GENERAL PLAN
     I.       INTRODUCTION
     A. Purpose and Scope
     The purpose of this Circulation Element is to establish guidelines and policy direction for the
     development and maintenance of a comprehensive transportation system for the city of Signal Hill. The
     Circulation Element works in tandem with the other elements of the Signal Hill General Plan and with
     regional transportation planning documents to plan for the long-term development, maintenance, and
     enhancement of the area’s circulation system. This document:
         •    Evaluates regional transportation connections and influences;
         •    Creates a citywide plan for an efficient, multimodal transportation system;
         •    Establishes policies, plans, and programs that encourage the use of alternatives to the single-
              occupant auto for most trips, thereby reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) and attendant air
              pollution and greenhouse gas emissions; and
         •    Creates a direct, clear link with the policies, plans, and programs of the Land Use Element of
              the General Plan in particular, and with all other Signal Hill General Plan elements in general.
     In addition to evaluating regional and citywide connectivity, Signal Hill’s transportation system must
     provide efficient access to and from all parcels and accommodate essential utilities, including water,
     sewerage, gas, electricity, communications, and storm drainage. It is imperative that the city have a
     comprehensive circulation plan to accommodate the effective transport of persons, goods, and utility
     services within and through the community. This circulation system is created by the efficient use of
     roadways, sidewalks, paths, trails, and utility easements.
     The Circulation Element recognizes that transportation routes and utility services play an important
     role in shaping the physical development of the city. Roadway and utility systems are part of the
     architecture of the community and provide a relatively permanent foundation for shaping substantial
     portions of it. The Circulation Element also offers opportunities for a variety of transportation means,
     such as driving, public transportation, biking, and walking.
     Signal Hill's traffic circulation system is well established and is not anticipated to change materially over
     time. New urban development is anticipated to occur on vacant oil field areas and to a lesser extent on
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                           Circulation Element 1
GENERAL PLAN

     infill lots in established neighborhoods through redevelopment. The Circulation Element anticipates
     that the automobile will remain an important mode of travel for most trips, with the exception of
     certain commute trips, and that congestion of many of the city’s roadways will increase. Much of the
     current and anticipated traffic is associated with pass-through trips, which are vehicles traveling through
     Signal Hill to get to other destinations outside of the city. To counteract the negative impacts of a
     continued increase in auto usage, goals, policies, and implementation measures have been incorporated
     into this document which when implemented, will encourage the use of alternative modes of
     transportation (walking, bicycling, public transit, etc.). Additionally, an analysis of transit-oriented
     development opportunities is provided to help guide future development of General Plan and zoning
     standards. Signal Hill’s access to a well-developed bus system and the Blue Line light rail service and the
     potential for transit-oriented development will assist in reducing the number of miles driven by
     community residents.
     Many city roadways are already experiencing reduced efficiency, especially in peak commuting hours.
     Further development of bus and light rail systems serving the southern part of Los Angeles County may
     slow the rate at which these roadways become congested, but will likely account for only a fraction of
     the ever-growing vehicular travel demands on the road system. In addition, as the population and the
     economy of the Signal Hill area grows within the context of the larger regional economy, travel
     demands on the existing circulation system due to our dependence on the automobile will also
     increase, resulting in further congestion. Therefore, the need to incorporate alternative means of
     transportation besides the single-occupancy vehicle becomes increasingly important to the long-term
     strategy of maintaining an efficient and effective circulation system.
     The Circulation Element recognizes the city’s entrepreneurial past and promotes an environment
     intended to help the City deal effectively with future growth and development, as projected in the 2001
     General Plan Land Use Element through 2025.
     B. Regulatory Framework
     The Circulation Element is one of seven elements mandated by the State of California as part of every
     General Plan. A Circulation Element provides policy direction for the location and extent of
     transportation linkages that offer potential for multi-modal use and for the reduction, to the extent
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                         Circulation Element 2
GENERAL PLAN

     feasible, of adverse environmental consequences. Government Code Section 65302(b) requires that the
     General Plan include:
          A circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of existing and proposed major
          thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, any military airports and ports, and other local public utilities
          and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan.
     Furthermore, State guidelines recommend that the Circulation Element address coordinated land use
     and circulation relationships, circulation efficiency and safety, protection of environmental quality and
     equitable use of economic and natural resources.
     Toward those ends, the Signal Hill Circulation Element addresses streets, highways, parking, transit,
     bicycle and pedestrian facilities, trails, railroads, and airports. In addition, the Element addresses utility
     infrastructure, including petroleum and natural gas pipelines, electrical transmission, and distribution
     lines; communications systems; sewer and sanitary waste systems; solid waste collection; water
     acquisition, storage, and distribution; flood and drainage control; and stormwater pollution.
     Recent Legislative Mandates
     Several recent legislative mandates imposed by the State of California impact the content of this
     Circulation Element. Of particular importance are:
          •    Assembly Bill (AB) 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006;
          •    Senate Bill (SB) 375 of 2008; and
          •    AB 1358, the California Complete Streets Act of 2008.
     AB 32
     AB 32 requires California to reduce its total greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. This
     measure was preceded in 2005 by Executive Order S-3-05, which required an 80 percent reduction in
     greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2050. Both of these State requirements will be partially
     implemented through new goals, policies, programs, and implementation measures at the local level. As
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                                Circulation Element     3
GENERAL PLAN

     the guiding document for decision-making in Signal Hill, the City’s General Plan must provide
     direction for the City in reducing the community’s greenhouse gas emissions.
     A range of actions may be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and comply with State
     requirements. These include, but are not limited to:
          •   Providing sidewalks and bicycle facilities to encourage pedestrian and bicycle travel in lieu of
              motor vehicle use;
          •   Enhancing public transportation services, including the creation of park-and-ride facilities, to
              encourage the use of public transportation in lieu of motor vehicle use;
          •   Encouraging mixed-use development, to allow individuals to live closer to workplaces, retail
              stores, restaurants, and other daily activity areas to encourage pedestrian and bicycle travel;
          •   Encouraging green building practices, which reduce the environmental impact of renovations
              and new construction by reducing energy and water use, reducing the release of harmful
              emissions, incorporating sustainable materials in construction, reducing heat island impacts,
              reducing stormwater quality and quantity impacts, as well as other improvements; and
          •   Increasing use of alternative energy systems, such as solar panels or wind turbines.
     SB 375
     SB 375 requires each federally-designated Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) in California to
     develop a “sustainable communities strategy” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles and
     light trucks. The MPO serving Signal Hill, the Southern California Association of Governments
     (SCAG), is working with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop greenhouse gas
     reduction targets for automobiles and light trucks. The sustainable communities strategy is part of the
     Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), a long-range planning document developed by SCAG.
     Subregional councils of governments (COGs) within the SCAG area may prepare the sustainable
     communities strategy or alternative planning strategies to establish a development pattern for the
     region. This pattern, when integrated with the transportation network and other transportation
     measures and policies. This will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and, if feasible, achieve targets set by
     CARB. Signal Hill is one of 27 member cities in the Gateway Cities COG; this subregional COG may

GENERAL PLAN

     elect to prepare a sustainable communities strategy or alternative planning strategies to meet the
     requirements of SB 375.
     SB 375 also creates a streamlining process for transit priority projects containing at least 50 percent
     residential use at a minimum density of 20 dwelling units per acre and located within ½ mile of a
     major transit stop or high-quality transit corridor. Future planning actions taken by the City of Signal
     Hill will take into consideration the need to minimize motor vehicle use in order to meet the targets of
     this legislation.
     AB 1358
     AB 1358 requires that, upon any substantive revision of the circulation element, the community’s
     circulation plan be modified to plan for a balanced, multimodal circulation system. The circulation
     plan must be designed to meet the needs of all users of area roadways, defined to include motorists,
     bicyclists, pedestrians, children, persons with disabilities, seniors, movers of commercial goods, and
     users of public transportation.
     A range of actions may be taken to encourage the use of multiple modes of transportation and comply
     with State requirements:
          •    The addition of sidewalks and curb cuts to encourage pedestrian circulation;
          •    The addition of bikeways to encourage bicycle use;
          •    Encouraging mixed-use development to allow residential uses in closer proximity to workplaces,
               retail, restaurants, and other daily activity areas; and
          •    Encouraging higher-density development in areas well-served by transit to reduce the need for
               motor vehicle use.
     C. Relationship to Other Elements
     The Circulation Element is closely related to other elements of the General Plan, particularly, the Land
     Use Element, as mandated by State Law. The Circulation Element must, at least, guide the support
     mechanisms for the development of land as specified in the Land Use Element and, conversely, may
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                       Circulation Element 5
GENERAL PLAN

     dictate land use policies. For example, where the Land Use Element designates an area for high-density
     residential uses, the Circulation Element must guide the development of roadway, water, sewer,
     drainage and utility systems to accommodate the number of future residents anticipated in that area.
     Although not required, circulation plans should be coordinated with Caltrans master plans. From a
     regional planning perspective, the City of Long Beach Circulation Element should also be considered
     to achieve efficient traffic flow at the regional level.
     The Circulation Element is also related to the Environmental Resources Element and Open Space/
     Recreation Element by providing and preserving access to recreational amenities including hilltop
     viewing opportunities and to protect sensitive natural or habitat areas. The Circulation Element also
     serves to guide the design, location and construction of roadways and the infrastructure systems in ways
     that protect the environment and minimize potential pollution. For example, the urban runoff from
     paved surfaces is a primary source of pollution at California’s beaches. Minimizing pavement area in
     the streets and incorporating water quality features to collect and clean storm water helps reduce
     pollution levels at nearby waterways and beaches.
     Further, the Circulation Element is related to the Safety Element because it provides the minimum
     standards for the creation of safe and efficient evacuation routes that may be needed during emergency
     conditions. The Safety Element identifies the evacuation routes that may be necessary under various
     emergency conditions, such as fires, earthquakes or toxic waste spills, and serves as a guide to the
     development of roadways of adequate width and numbers of lanes to provide for emergency vehicle
     access and, if necessary, evacuation traffic.
     Lastly, the Circulation Element is related to the Noise Element by way of the noise levels generated by
     the various components of the transportation system addressed herein. Maximizing the efficiency of the
     transportation system will result in a reduction of the noise that is generated by traffic of all types.

     A. Existing Transportation Systems
     Signal Hill is located approximately two miles north of the Pacific Ocean in southern Los Angeles
     County. Signal Hill is completely surrounded by the city of Long Beach, and its transportation network
     is intertwined with that of its neighbor. Regional access to the city, depicted in Figure 1, Regional Access,
     is provided by freeways, especially Interstate 405 (I-405); arterial roadways; bus routes; a light rail line;
     two major seaports; and Long Beach Airport, which is located immediately northeast of Signal Hill.
     The existing Signal Hill transportation system consists of roads of varying sizes and capacities; public
     transportation systems, including bus, light rail, and paratransit service; airports, and seaports. The
     network created by these systems serves two distinct and equally important functions: 1) to provide
     access to adjacent land uses, and 2) to facilitate the movement of persons and goods to, from, within,
     and through the city. The discussion below summarizes the existing state of Signal Hill’s transportation
     system.
     Roads and Highways
     Signal Hill’s roadway system is a critical component of the city’s transportation infrastructure.
     According to the 2000 U.S. Census, almost 92 percent of Signal Hill residents used a motor vehicle to
     commute to work. Signal Hill roadways are used for both local and pass-through traffic between
     neighborhoods in Long Beach. Major north-south through routes include Cherry and Orange Avenues;
     major east-west through routes include Spring and Willow Streets and Pacific Coast Highway.
     The city’s roadway system consists of seven classes of roads or highways, as shown in Table 1, Signal Hill
     Roadway Classifications. The Interstate class of roadway is constructed and maintained by the California
     Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and is not an official City classification.

Interstate                 Varies (Caltrans ownership).
Principal Arterial         100-110' ROW; four travel lanes with painted or raised median.
Minor Arterial             80' ROW; four travel lanes with painted median.
Collector Street           60'-70' ROW; two travel lanes and two parking lanes. May include a painted median.
Local Street               60' ROW; two travel lanes and two parking lanes. Reduced width permitted for some private
                           streets.
Alleys                     20' ROW; varies in some neighborhoods, with narrower widths permitted in some areas.
     The design and operation of each street is determined by the importance placed on its functions.
     Streets that have a mobility and/or regional access function have more lanes, higher speed limits and
     fewer driveways. Where access to properties is required, streets will have fewer lanes, lower speeds,
     parking and more frequent driveways to serve abutting properties. The Circulation Element describes
     the City’s plan for the development of this network of streets and highways and other key elements of
     the traffic circulation system. Figure 2, Roadway Classifications, depicts the hierarchy of the circulation
     system roadways based on the classifications above.
     The City's official roadway classification system includes six designations (not including the Interstate
     classification). The names assigned to these designations have been updated from previous Circulation
     Elements, with the new nomenclature based on standards established by the Federal Highway
     Administration (FHWA) Functional Classification system, as shown in Table 2, Updated Roadway
     Designations. The modified names for roadway classifications improve the City’s eligibility for federal
     highway funding, and simplify the process of obtaining such funds.
     The Principal Arterial classification in this General Plan is equivalent to the “Other Principal Arterial”
     classification in the FHWA system. With the updated roadway classifications, the Secondary Modified
     Highway category has been eliminated. Roads within that category have been reassigned to the Minor
     Arterial or Collector Street categories, as appropriate.
     The standards for the development of roadways are included in the following definitions:

  All roadways previously classified as Secondary Modified Highways have been re-classified as Minor Arterials or Collector Streets,
  as appropriate.
      Interstate
      The San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405 or I-405) crosses the northern portion of Signal Hill. The
      highway is owned and maintained by Caltrans. In the Signal Hill area, the I-405 currently consists of
      ten travel lanes, including eight mixed-flow and two carpool lanes. The freeway has an average daily
      traffic (ADT) of 289,000 vehicles.
      The I-405 is one of the major access routes to Signal Hill but is also a major traffic generator that affects
      traffic flow within the city. The freeway interchanges with the Long Beach Freeway (I-710)
      approximately three miles northwest of Cherry Avenue, with the San Gabriel Freeway (I-605)
      approximately five miles southeast of Cherry Avenue, and with the Garden Grove Freeway (State Route
      22 or SR-22) approximately 7.5 miles southeast of Cherry Avenue. Full freeway access is provided at
      Atlantic, Cherry, and Orange Avenues, and Lakewood Boulevard. Northbound I-405 access to the city
      for traffic oriented south on Cherry Avenue is provided at Temple Avenue. This circuitous access to
      Cherry Avenue increases traffic levels on Temple Avenue and Spring Street and is confusing to
      motorists.
      The 2003 Short-Range Transportation Plan (SRTP), prepared by the Metropolitan Transportation
      Authority (Metro), recognizes the I-405 as a “congested corridor” in the Signal Hill area, and identifies
      the Cherry and Atlantic Avenue ramps as “hot spots” with recurring heavy traffic congestion. These
      designations make this freeway corridor a higher priority for future improvements; however, no major
      improvements are currently funded.

     Principal Arterial
     Principal Arterials (equivalent to the FHWA’s “Other Principal Arterial” classification) are important
     city and intercommunity routes. Principal Arterials have a minimum 100- to 110-foot right-of-way width
     with four moving travel lanes and a painted or raised median. Four roadways have been identified as
     Principal Arterials: Cherry and Orange Avenues and Spring and Willow Streets. These roads serve
     traffic both within Signal Hill, and traffic passing through the city. Cherry and Orange Avenues
     connect the primarily residential, industrial, and airport-oriented land uses in Long Beach north of
     Signal Hill with residential, commercial, and recreational areas near the ocean. Spring and Willow
     Streets likewise connect Long Beach neighborhoods located east of Signal Hill with those to the west.
     Principal Arterials support the heaviest traffic volumes of all the roadway classifications, and can
     support a maximum ADT of 33,000 vehicles at a Level of Service (LOS) D.
     Minor Arterial
     Minor Arterials serve traffic traveling to local destinations, tying together the various parts of the city
     and connecting it to nearby areas. Minor Arterials have a minimum 80-foot right-of-way width with four
     travel lanes and a painted median. These roadways support a maximum ADT of 12,500 vehicles at an
     LOS D.
     Collector Street
     Collector Streets collect local traffic from residential neighborhoods and commercial and industrial
     areas and feed the traffic to Minor and Principal Arterials. Collector Streets have a 60- to 70-foot right-
     of-way with two travel lanes and two parking lanes, where parking is feasible. Collector Streets with 70-
     foot rights-of-way may also include a painted median. This painted median increases roadway safety and
     improves efficiency by limiting the number of left-turning cars that queue in travel lanes; for that
     reason, the 70-foot right-of-way is preferred. However, where physical or environmental factors limit
     roadway width, a 60-foot right-of-way is permissible. Collector Streets generally carry fewer vehicles than
     Minor Arterials.
     Local Street
     The Local Street classification includes all roadways and streets not otherwise classified. These are
     generally 60-foot wide rights-of-way with two travel lanes and two parking lanes where feasible, but there

GENERAL PLAN

     are several variations in roadway width. These variations are found in both older neighborhoods and in
     newer areas, particularly those with private streets. Local Streets are designed to serve individual
     properties and provide access from residential neighborhoods to Collector Streets. Local Streets include
     private streets owned and maintained by homeowners associations. Local Streets carry the lowest traffic
     volumes of all streets in the city; most traffic on these streets is accessing local destinations, rather than
     passing through. Through the specific plan process, the City has approved a variety of private street
     configurations, including rights-of-way less than 60 feet wide.
     Alleys
     The Alley classification consists of roadways which provide secondary access to parcels. The standard
     width of Alleys is 20 feet; however, in older neighborhoods, narrower roadways are common, with
     many 10- to 15-foot cross-sections.
     Official Plan Lines Map
     The Plan Lines Map displays the City’s desired future right-of-way width for all roadways and alleys. The
     map describes the extent of right-of-way dedications required by the City as a condition of the issuance
     of building permits. Dedication consistent with the Plan Lines Map is required when the valuation of a
     building permit for new buildings and for paving of parking lots exceeds a certain valuation, which is
     adjusted annually. The Plan Lines Map shows the City’s desired street plan but the specific timing or
     phasing of future roadway development is a function of the marketplace and the City’s Capital
     Improvement Program. The map is not a part of the General Plan, and is maintained under separate
     cover by the Community Development Department.
     Traffic Study Areas
     Also shown on the Plan Lines Map are certain Traffic Study Areas that are crosshatched and designated
     with the letter “A.” Traffic Study Areas generally consist of vacant land where the City will consider
     alternative circulation plans concurrent with requests for development entitlements. Roadways
     currently shown on the Plan Lines Map within Traffic Study Areas are often unimproved dirt roads, or
     unbuilt “paper” streets that were planned in the early 20th century but never implemented. In some
     cases, the roadways currently shown include severe grade changes and very long cul-de-sacs, and do not
     take into account circulation efficiency, property access, view corridors, or other features. A traffic study

     Study Area and its integration with the surrounding network. Such studies are often prepared
     concurrently with specific plans or other development project proposals to address topography, the
     intensity of development, and specific requirements for circulation facilities based upon traffic
     generated from the proposed project.
     Within a Traffic Study Area the City may vacate existing right-of-way to improve overall circulation and
     to make land available for development. The land vacated by the elimination of unimproved or “paper”
     streets is returned equally to the adjacent property owner(s).
     Scenic Routes
     The City of Signal Hill has designated a series of roadways at higher elevations as a scenic route, as
     shown in Figure 3, Scenic Route. This route use the existing street system and provides a link between
     the Crescent Heights Historic District and the Alamitos 1 Well, a State Historical Monument, located
     at the northeast corner of Temple and Hill Streets. The entire route provides views of urban Southern
     California, the ocean, and the downtown Long Beach skyline, as shown in Image 1.
     Truck Routes
     Truck Routes are intended to keep large trucks (defined in the Signal Hill Municipal Code [SHMC] as
     trucks weighing three tons or more) off local residential streets. The Motor Vehicle Code provides a
     mechanism for local enforcement provided that truck routes are listed in the SHMC and signs are
     posted along the routes. Trucks must remain on the routes when driving through the city, but drivers
     may leave a designated truck route for deliveries or pick-ups. Local truck routes designated by Signal
     Hill are shown in Figure 4, Truck Routes.
     Bus Service
     Signal Hill is well-served by bus systems. Services provided by Long Beach Transit and Metro operate
     within or in the vicinity of the city; additional bus lines are accessible through the nearby Long Beach
     Transit Mall.

     A list of bus stops serving the city is provided in Table 4, Bus Stops Serving Signal Hill. Most bus stops are
     disabled-accessible; however, stops serving Route 7 at the intersections of Orange Avenue and 28th and
     29th Streets are not currently wheelchair-accessible. Improvements to make these stops compliant with
     Americans with Disabilities Act requirements will likely occur with future improvements to Orange
     Avenue.

     Long Beach Transit is currently in the process of upgrading its bus stops with satellite-controlled bus
     tracking technology known as “TranSmart.” TranSmart-equipped stops provide real-time updates on
     routes and arrival times. Currently, only the stop at the southwest corner of Cherry Avenue and Willow
     Street has been upgraded; no schedule for improvements to the remaining stops within Signal Hill is
     currently available.

     Information on transit ridership in Signal Hill is available from Long Beach Transit. Data from 2006
     show almost 1,600 riders per day board Long Beach Transit buses within the city of Signal Hill (see
     Table 5, Long Beach Transit Ridership at Signal Hill Bus Stops). Approximately 21 percent of riders use the
     system during morning hours, 40 percent use it midday, and 38 percent use the system during the
     evening hours. Riders leaving the city at any time are roughly equal in number to those arriving. Total
     ridership is approximately equal to 35 percent of the city's resident labor force, and 20 percent of
     persons working in Signal Hill.

     In addition to local bus routes, several additional public transportation services are provided by Long
     Beach Transit along nearby corridors:
          •    ZAP express bus service,
          •    Passport circulator shuttle bus service, and
          •    AquaLink and AquaBus water taxis.
     Beyond the city of Signal Hill, regional bus service is provided by Metro along the 7th Street corridor in
     Long Beach (one mile south of Signal Hill), and a number of agencies operate service from the Long
     Beach Transit Mall (two miles southwest of Signal Hill). Metro Express Route 577X operates along 7th
     Street from the Long Beach Transit Mall to the El Monte Transit Center. Additional services at the
     Long Beach Transit Mall are provided by Long Beach Transit, the Los Angeles Department of
     Transportation (Commuter Express), Metro, the Orange County Transportation Authority, and
     Torrance Transit. The agencies serving the Mall provide access to areas throughout the Los Angeles
     basin and Orange County. Both the 7th Street corridor and the Long Beach Transit Mall are accessible
     from Signal Hill via local bus service.
     Light Rail
     Light rail service is provided to Signal Hill by the Metro Blue Line, which is located along the western
     boundary of the city (Image 2). The 22-mile long Blue Line connects downtown Long Beach with
     downtown Los Angeles and operates approximately 20 hours a day, 365 days a year. The Blue Line is
     the second most-heavily-used light rail route in the U.S. (after Boston’s Green Line), serving over 24.5

     Bicycle Circulation
     Prior to this Circulation Element update, there were no bikeways designated within the city of Signal
     Hill. However, via this updated Circulation Element, approximately 5.5 miles of bikeways along a
     number of routes are planned, as described in Table 7, Planned Area Bikeways, and shown in Figure 6,
     Bicycle Master Plan. These bikeways fall into three classes, as defined by Caltrans; an explanation of the
     three classes is provided in Table 8, Bikeway Classifications.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                           Circulation Element 23
GENERAL PLAN

     Bikeways provide and encourage an alternative to the use of automobiles. Bikeways are intended to link
     living, working, shopping, educational, and recreational locations. The bikeways currently proposed
     serve a number of purposes:
          •   East-west routes provide access to destinations such as light rail stations, schools, CSULB, Long
              Beach City College, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, and shopping centers along
              Atlantic and Long Beach Boulevards. Recently-widened Spring Street offers adequate space for
              an on-street bike lane along much of its right-of-way in the city (Image 3).
          •   North-south routes provide access to destinations such as schools, commercial centers along
              Pacific Coast Highway, regional bus lines operating on 7th Street, Downtown Long Beach,
              beaches, civic and arts facilities, and hospitals.
          •   The route along Temple Street/Skyline Drive/Burnett Street provides panoramic skyline views
              and is heavily utilized by pedestrians.
          •   The route along the former Pacific Electric Railway right-of-way provides an off-street bikeway
              that shortens the distance for travel in a northwest-southeast direction, providing direct access
              from the Willow Street Blue Line Station to Long Beach City College. This bikeway is located
              in the city of Long Beach, along its border with Signal Hill.
     New bikeways should be considered by the City, particularly when they would connect with existing or
     proposed bikeways in the city of Long Beach. Traffic volumes and characteristics along potential routes
     must be considered, along with traffic safety and grade issues.

     Pedestrian Circulation
     Pedestrian circulation facilities within Signal Hill consist of sidewalks and trails. Sidewalks are located
     along most of the city’s streets. The city’s trail system, as depicted in Figure 7, Trails Plan, and Image 4,
     serves mostly recreational purposes. The system is located near the top of Signal Hill and connects
     several area parks and monuments, including Hilltop Park, Sunset View Park, and Discovery Well Park.
     The approximately one-mile-long Panaroma/Skyline Loop Trail circles the top of Signal Hill; numerous
     feeder trails connect to this main route. Trails provide scenic views of the surrounding community, and
     are heavily utilized. Features along these trails include seating, pedestrian-scaled lighting, telescopes in
     view areas, and interpretive panels. Many trails in the area are publically-accessible but located within
     private, gated communities.
     Aviation
     Long Beach Airport is located beyond Signal Hill’s northeastern boundary. The airport covers 1,166
     acres and has five runways, the longest over 10,000 feet in length. It is used by commercial carriers,
     general aviation aircraft, and air cargo handlers. Commercial flights are offered to 15 cities within the
     U.S. The airport served over 2.9 million passengers and handled over 46,000 tons of air cargo in 2008.
     Los Angeles International Airport is the largest and most heavily-trafficked airport in Southern
     California. Located 17 miles northwest of Signal Hill, the airport served over 59.8 million passengers
     and handled 1.8 million tons of air cargo in 2008. It provides access to hundreds of domestic and
     international destinations.
     Other civilian airports serving Signal Hill are listed in Table 9, Airports Serving Signal Hill.

     Ports
     Signal Hill is located approximately 3.5 miles northeast of the Port of Long Beach and 6 miles
     northeast of the Port of Los Angeles. Together, these two ports compose one of the largest port
     complexes in the world. Approximately 15.8 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) passed
     through the ports in 2006, accounting for 24 percent of all U.S. container exports and 40 percent of
     U.S. container imports. Most of these containers are transported to and from the ports via the I-710
     freeway or Alameda Corridor rail line. According to the 2008 RTP Goods Movement Report,
     approximately 1,875 port trucks per day use the I-405 between the I-710 and I-605. This equates to 12
     percent of trucks that pass along the I-405 through the city of Signal Hill, and less than 1 percent of all
     vehicular traffic on the freeway.
     In addition to the cargo services provided by the ports, passenger cruise lines also operate out of the
     area. Approximately 1.2 million passengers boarded 265 cruises operating out of the Port of Los
     Angeles in 2008, and regular boat service is offered from Downtown Long Beach, the Queen Mary, and
     the Port of Los Angeles to Catalina Island.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                       Circulation Element 29
GENERAL PLAN
     B. Other Circulation Systems
     Water
     The city’s primary water supply comes from two groundwater wells located in north Long Beach.
     Additional water may be purchased from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. The
     City has drilled a third groundwater well centrally located within Signal Hill and is in the process of
     developing plans and specifications for the necessary pumping and treatment facilities.
     The City has three storage reservoirs and pumping facilities, providing water for domestic purposes and
     fire fighting. The Gundry reservoir and pumping facility was constructed in 1929 and has a storage
     capacity of 4.7 million gallons. This facility is located in the northern part of the city. Two hilltop
     reservoirs and pumping facilities were constructed in the late 1990s, having a combined storage capacity
     of 2.6 million gallons.
     The Water Division operates as an enterprise fund, independent from the City’s general fund. The
     water fund includes a capital improvement program to replace aging or obsolete infrastructure. In
     addition, the City’s development impact fee ordinance requires that developers pay a proportionate
     share of new water facilities made necessary by development projects.
     Reclaimed Water
     The City of Long Beach maintains an extensive reclaimed water infrastructure. Reclaimed water is
     currently used to irrigate Reservoir Park, located on Wardlow Road along the city’s northern boundary,
     and Burroughs Elementary School, also in the North End Neighborhood. The City of Signal Hill is
     interested in expanding the reclaimed water system to serve other parks and the hilltop area open
     spaces that are owned and maintained by the several homeowners associations, but the lack of pipelines
     limits opportunities for such expansion in the short term. Additionally, reclaimed water supplies are
     limited in the City of Long Beach. Other potential sources of reclaimed water include the Los Angeles
     County Sanitation District and the Water Replenishment District of Southern California; however,
     neither of these agencies currently maintains reclaimed water pipelines within Signal Hill.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                      Circulation Element 30
GENERAL PLAN

     Sewerage
     Sewerage service in Signal Hill is provided by Los Angeles County Sanitation District No. 29. The City
     of Signal Hill previously owned and maintained the area's local and collector sewers; these have now
     been transferred to County Sanitation District control (a process completed in 2006). There is currently
     no sewer development impact fee for new development. However, property owners/developers pay for
     the extension of sewers to serve new development projects and pay connection fees, which are intended
     to cover additional costs to accommodate any increased demand created by the project.
     In isolated areas, existing dwellings and businesses use septic tanks because sewer mains are not
     available. In 2002, the City extended sewer service to the Crescent Heights Historic District. With this
     sewer extension, only a small number of structures remain on septic systems. Conditions of approval
     for new development require that they provide sewer service.
     Gas
     The City of Long Beach provides natural gas service to Signal Hill and owns and maintains a network
     of gas mains and lines throughout the city. Property owners/developers pay for the extension of the gas
     system to serve new development projects and pay connection fees, which are intended to cover
     additional costs to accommodate any increased demand created by the project.
     Electricity
     The city receives electrical service from Southern California Edison. One unique feature of the existing
     system is the extensive system of high-voltage transmission lines that traverse the city, primarily along
     major roadways. These transmission lines are unsightly but expensive to place underground. The City
     encourages that overhead utilities be placed underground concurrently with the development of vacant
     land; however, various physical and economic constraints can make undergrounding impractical. The
     decision to underground utilities must be made on a case-by-case basis, with the aesthetic and safety
     goals of undergrounding balanced with project feasibility.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                     Circulation Element 31
GENERAL PLAN
     Telephone and Cable
     Verizon provides landline telephone service to Signal Hill. The overhead and underground telephone
     system is well developed and property owners/developers pay all costs associated with extending services
     to new development projects. Cable television and internet service is provided by Charter
     Communications, which is in the process of upgrading the existing cable network citywide. Property
     owners/developers pay the costs associated with extending the cable system to new development.
     Storm Drains
     Signal Hill storm water runoff flows into the storm drain system owned and operated by the Los
     Angeles County Flood Control District. The district maintains and improves the storm drain system
     and property owners/developers construct new storm drain facilities in accordance with the adopted
     storm drain master plan. There is currently no storm drain developer impact fee. A growing area of
     concern both to local and regional governments is the discharge of trash and debris and a variety of
     water pollutants into the storm drain system that eventually flows into and pollutes the Pacific Ocean.
     The city's stormwater drains into the Pacific Ocean. Accordingly, in order to protect ocean water
     quality, all grading and development activities must include stormwater pollution protection as a
     primary consideration. Effective stormwater management will include protection measures during
     construction and as part of the development. The city may benefit from two major retention basins
     located in the vicinity of Signal Hill, Hamilton Bowl located at Walnut and 20th Street and the
     California Bowl located near the intersection of Orange Avenue and Spring Street. These facilities are
     viewed as major resources in devising solutions to storm water run-off issues including contamination
     and water borne trash.
     According to federal flood hazard maps, the former Pacific Electric Railway right-of-way along the
     southerly boundary of the city may be subject to inundation during a major flood event. Localized
     flooding may occur in low-lying areas where there are no existing flood control facilities.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                       Circulation Element 32
GENERAL PLAN
     Petroleum Pipelines
     The city of Signal Hill is traversed by a network of privately-owned pipelines that are used to transport
     petroleum products, including crude petroleum and gas produced in the local Long Beach/Signal Hill
     Oil Field and refined products such as gasoline and jet fuel manufactured in refineries located in the
     South Bay. Two major gasoline storage terminals remain in the city: the Shell Terminal on Redondo
     Avenue south of Willow Street and the Hathaway Terminal located on Obispo Avenue south of Willow
     Street. These facilities store and distribute gasoline products by truck to retail gas stations. Each
     pipeline operator is required to maintain a city franchise and to maintain pipeline safety in compliance
     with State pipeline safety and fire codes.
     There are currently far more inactive oil wells than active wells within the city. Active wells require
     pipelines for water, gas, and petroleum. Pipelines, including some in place since the 1920s, are removed
     and replaced concurrent with new development. Relocated pipelines are typically located below open
     spaces or rights-of-way.
     C. Transportation Planning Context
     A number of local and regional agencies are involved in transportation planning, the provision of
     transportation services, and the maintenance of transportation infrastructure. The following are key
     entities that impact planning in the Signal Hill area:
     Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
     SCAG is the State-designated Regional Transportation Planning Agency (RTPA) and federally-
     designated MPO for most of southern California. SCAG is mandated by both the State and federal
     governments to prepare plans for transportation and growth management; this includes preparation of
     the RTP, a long-range transportation planning document. A comprehensive update of the RTP occurs
     every four years. The current document was adopted in May 2008 and presents a vision for the region
     through 2035.
     The RTP is implemented by two regularly-updated documents: the Regional Transportation
     Improvement Plan (RTIP), also prepared by SCAG, and the Congestion Management Program (CMP),
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                      Circulation Element 33
GENERAL PLAN
     prepared for Los Angeles County by Metro. The RTIP provides a detailed listing of all projects planned
     for implementation during the document’s planning period. The document is updated every two years
     and has a six-year planning horizon. The CMP has a goal of relieving traffic congestion and maintaining
     high levels of service on roadways.
     The RTP, RTIP, and CMP are vital planning documents for Signal Hill; having a project listed in these
     documents is a critical step in getting State and federal funding for its implementation. Additionally,
     because Signal Hill is in an ozone and carbon monoxide non-attainment zone, federal funds may not be
     programmed for transportation projects that significantly increase single-occupant vehicle capacity
     unless that project is addressed in the CMP.
     Compass Blueprint
     The Compass Blueprint is a growth vision for Southern California developed by SCAG. The vision
     pursued by the Compass Blueprint seeks to enhance four areas that impact our regional quality of life:
     mobility, livability, prosperity, and sustainability.
     The implementation method for this vision is known as the "2% Strategy." The 2% Strategy focuses on
     changes to land uses and transportation within 2 percent of the SCAG region—the "2% Strategy
     Opportunity Areas." These opportunity areas are selected based on population and employment
     densities; public transportation availability; access to airports, seaports, and industrial areas; and
     availability of land for increased residential development. Based on these criteria, most of the city of
     Signal Hill (with the exception of the northernmost areas) falls within a 2% Strategy Opportunity Area,
     indicating that the community is an ideal location for continued urban development and
     enhancements to transportation systems.
     Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro)
     Metro is the transportation planning, coordinating, designing, building, and operating agency serving
     Los Angeles County. Metro operates bus and rail systems and funds local street, highway, bikeway, and
     pedestrian facilities improvements. Additionally, Metro funds 16 municipal bus services, including
     Long Beach Transit, which serves Signal Hill.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                     Circulation Element 34
GENERAL PLAN

     Beyond the day-to-day operations of various transportation systems, Metro prepares the region's Long-
     Range Transportation Plan (LRTP), which provides a 20-year vision for the county's transportation
     system; prepares the SRTP, which implements the strategies of the LRTP and has a six-year time
     horizon; supports the Call for Projects program, which is a competitive process that distributes
     discretionary capital transportation funds to regionally significant projects; and maintains the CMP, as
     discussed above.
     South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD)
     AQMD is the air pollution control agency serving Signal Hill. The AQMD develops plans and
     regulations to achieve and maintain healthy air quality. To control emissions from cars, trucks, buses,
     and other mobile sources, AQMD has established a comprehensive program to meet the emissions
     standards established by CARB and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). AQMD co-
     produces, along with SCAG, an Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) for the region. There is a close
     link between transportation planning and air quality; the policies produced in the AQMP, Compass
     Blueprint, RTP, and other documents seek to reduce the number of VMTs in order to reduce air
     pollution. These policies include, among others: focusing growth in centers and major transportation
     corridors, creating significant areas of mixed-use development, and targeting growth around transit
     stations.
     Caltrans
     Caltrans coordinates several statewide transportation programs that impact Signal Hill. Among these
     are the State Transportation Improvement Program, which funds projects included in the RTIP; the
     Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program, which funds projects that help achieve compliance
     with federal ozone and carbon monoxide requirements; and the Traffic Congestion Relief Program,
     which funds projects that reduce congestion, improve goods movement, and provide intermodal
     connectivity.
     Caltrans owns and maintains the I-405 freeway. Any future improvements to the freeway would be
     planned and constructed by Caltrans. The 2008 LRTP developed by Metro does not include substantial
     changes to the I-405 in the Signal Hill area; however, modifications to ramps at Cherry Avenue may
     occur.

GENERAL PLAN
     City of Long Beach
     Because Signal Hill is surrounded by Long Beach, decisions made by the City of Long Beach relative to
     circulation improvements have a significant impact on Signal Hill. Cooperation in developing
     circulation plans is key to maintaining an effective transportation system for both cities.

     A. Major Traffic Generators
     A relatively small number of major traffic generators have a significant impact on the local
     transportation system. In addition to traffic generators located within the city of Signal Hill, numerous
     facilities in Long Beach, which surrounds Signal Hill and has well-established traffic patterns, influence
     the local circulation system.
     Major traffic generators in Signal Hill include the following:
     Major Employers
     Signal Hill has a large and growing retail and commercial services employment base. Table 10, Major
     Employers in Signal Hill, displays the city’s top ten employers. These major employers are also among the
     city’s major traffic generators.

GENERAL PLAN

     Airports and Seaports
     Long Beach Airport and the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are significant traffic generators.
     Long Beach Airport is increasingly popular as an alternative to the more crowded Los Angeles
     International Airport. While increased usage of Long Beach Airport is limited by the City of Long
     Beach's Noise Compatibility Ordinance, the 2008 RTP Airport and Aviation Ground Access Report
     forecasts that airport passenger traffic will increase from the current 2.8 million passengers per year to
     4.2 million passengers per year in 2035. Additionally, air cargo traffic is forecast to increase from
     50,000 tons per year to 139,000 tons per year in 2035.
     The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are located southwest of Signal Hill and provide full
     passenger and freight services to domestic and international destinations. Port activity is growing; the
     2008 RTP Goods Movement Report forecasts that combined traffic at the two ports will increase from
     15.8 million TEUs to 42.5 million TEUs by 2030.
     Port access is currently provided by both truck and rail, and improvements to regional rail systems
     could potentially reduce the impact on area roadways of increased port traffic. SCAG projects that the
     use of rail to ship containers from the ports will triple by 2030. Nonetheless, because of the dramatic
     increase in projected port traffic, the number of trucks required to service the facilities is expected to
     increase significantly. This may have a negative impact on local traffic circulation in Signal Hill.
     Moreover, large truck traffic is increasing in the Signal Hill area because local businesses have
     functional linkages with the Los Angeles and Long Beach harbor areas, although the presence and
     enforcement of truck route restrictions should limit impacts on residential districts.
     Medical Facilities
     Medical facilities contribute to traffic in the Signal Hill area. Long Beach Memorial Medical Center is
     located just west of the city, across Atlantic Avenue; Pacific Hospital of Long Beach is located 0.5 mile
     west of the city; Community Hospital of Long Beach is located approximately 0.25 mile east of the city;
     and St. Mary Medical Center is located 1.4 miles southwest of the city. Long Beach Memorial Medical
     Center is a particularly large traffic generator, impacting traffic flow on Atlantic Avenue and Spring and
     Willow Streets. In planning for future improvements to the roadway network, it is important to be
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                         Circulation Element 38
GENERAL PLAN
     cognizant of the needs of emergency services for adequate access points and roadway capacity to serve
     hospitals.
     Educational Facilities
     Several large educational facilities are located in the vicinity of Signal Hill. These include Long Beach
     City College's Pacific Coast Campus, located adjacent to Signal Hill's southern boundary, which serves
     approximately 6,000 students; Long Beach Polytechnic High School, located southeast of Pacific Coast
     Highway and Atlantic Avenue, which serves 5,000 students; and a number of other, smaller schools.
     California State University, Long Beach is located approximately two miles southeast of Signal Hill.
     Pacific Coast Highway is one of the major east-west routes providing access to the campus, and it is
     likely that a significant number of the college's 38,000 students pass through the city regularly.
     Downtown Long Beach
     Downtown Long Beach is one of the major commercial centers of Southern California, with
     approximately 4.2 million square feet of office space and 2,770 hotel rooms. In an effort to strengthen
     the local economy, Long Beach has concentrated on intensifying business, industrial, and residential
     development in its downtown and Port of Long Beach areas. Thousands of new homes and hundreds
     of thousands of square feet of new commercial development have increased the intensity of
     development in Downtown Long Beach in recent years. Circulation improvements serving downtown
     activity centers can potentially stimulate and expand the production of services, thus strengthening the
     downtown economy. As the Long Beach economy grows, there will be indirect effects on Signal Hill.
     B. Population and Employment Trends
     Demographic and development trends are important to the formulation of circulation and
     infrastructure policies. Table 11, Population Trends, displays population growth rates in the city since
     1940, as well as projected growth rates through 2035. SCAG projects that population growth will slow
     significantly in the city in the coming decades; Signal Hill is expected to reach a build-out population of
     13,235 by 2035.

     C. Traffic Analysis
     Level of Service (LOS)
     LOS is a qualitative measure of the effect of traffic flow factors, such as speed, delays, travel time,
     interruptions, freedom to maneuver, driver comfort and convenience, and indirectly, safety and
     operating costs. Roadway and traffic conditions, ranging from ideal to forced flow, have been divided
     into six LOS for qualitative evaluation, as shown in Table 13, Level of Service Definitions and Figure 8,
     Level of Service Diagram. The 2004 CMP establishes LOS E as the lowest acceptable LOS in Los Angeles
     County. However, this does not preclude the use of different standards for local policies or studies.
     Both the Cities of Signal Hill and Long Beach consider LOS D to be the lowest acceptable LOS.

               Type of Flow         Delay                                        Definition
  Level
    A        Free flow        Little or no    There are no loaded traffic signal cycles, and fewer are even closed to
                              delay           loaded at this service level. No approach phase is fully utilized by traffic
                                              and no vehicle waits longer than one red indication.
    B        Stable flow      Short traffic   This level represents stable operation where an occasional approach
                              delay           phase is fully utilized and a substantial number are approaching full use.
                                              Many drivers begin to feel restricted within platoons of vehicles.
    C        Stable flow      Average traffic At this level, stable operation continues. Loading is still intermittent but
                              delay           more frequent than at Level B. Occasionally, drivers may have to wait
                                              through more than one red signal indication and backups may develop
                                              behind turning vehicles. Most drivers feel somewhat restricted, but not
                                              objectionably so.
    D        Approaching      Long traffic    This level encompasses a zone of increasing restriction-approaching
             unstable flow    delays          instability at the intersection. Delays to approaching vehicles may be
                                              substantial during short peaks within the peak hour, but enough cycles
                                              with lower demand occur to permit periodic clearance of queues, thus
                                              preventing excessive backups. Drivers frequently have to wait through
                                              more than one red signal. This level is the lower limit of acceptable
                                              operation to most drivers.
    E        Unstable flow    Very long       This represents near capacity and capacity operation. At capacity
                              traffic delays  (ICU=1.0) it represents the most vehicles that the particular intersection
                                              can accommodate. However, full utilization of every signal cycle is
                                              seldom attained no matter how great the demand. At this level, all drivers
                                              wait through more than one red signal, and frequently through several.
    F        Forced flow      Excessive       Jammed conditions. Traffic backed up from a downstream location on
                              delay           one of the streets restricts or prevents movement of traffic through the
                                              intersection under consideration.

     Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU)
     ICU is a measurement of how well an intersection operates based on available roadway capacity.
     Existing traffic volume is compared to the capacity in order to assess the operational performance of an
     intersection. The capacity is a defined measurement of the maximum traffic passing through an
     intersection. Traffic volumes are counted for each traffic movement (left turn, through, and right turn),
     which is compared to the intersection’s capacity. The results of this comparison define how well the
     intersection is performing.
     The ICU is used for planning applications such as roadway design and traffic impact studies. It tells
     how much reserve capacity is available or how much an intersection or roadway segment is overcapacity.
     Existing Traffic Conditions
     Table 13, Existing Traffic Conditions, shows traffic conditions in Signal Hill by major roadway segments.
     It illustrates existing average daily traffic (ADT) as well as the ADT required to reach a LOS D for that
     segment. The table further reflects the equivalent volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio for LOS D, which is
     the minimum acceptable roadway operational Level of Service (LOS) as defined by the City. The
     County’s Congestion Management Program permits an LOS E. ICU analysis and levels of service for
     major intersections in the city is shown in Table 15, Summary of Existing Intersection Capacity Utilization
     and Levels of Service.

     As shown in Table 14, most roadway segments are operating at an efficient level of service when LOS C
     is designated as a standard of efficiency. Those roadway segments operating at LOS D or lower (E or F)
     are Pacific Coast Highway and Willow Street between Walnut Avenue and Temple Avenue and Cherry
     Avenue between Spring Street and Crescent Heights Street.
     Frequently, intersection levels of service play a greater role in determining street performance than do
     the capacities of roadway sections, since intersections usually create the greatest delays and are thus
     more objectionable to drivers.

GENERAL PLAN
     IV. C I R C U L A T I O N C O N C E P T
     With the completion of hillside development east of Cherry Avenue, Signal Hill's roadway system is
     now largely complete. Future improvements may occur within those districts marked as “Traffic Study
     Areas” on the City’s Plan Lines Map. These improvements fall into three major categories:
         1. Improving streets by widening roadways where necessary and enhancing aesthetics, and
               potentially realigning the roadway system in areas that are redeveloped;
         2. Expanding and enhancing the city's sidewalk, trail, and bikeway systems; and
         3. Enhancing the relationship between land uses and circulation, encouraging the development of
               residential and commercial land uses and transportation facilities which complement each
               other and minimize vehicle miles traveled.
     The following discussion examines concepts and strategies that may be employed by Signal Hill to
     achieve the desired circulation system enhancement.
     A. Transportation Planning Strategies
     Enhancing the Transportation Planning-Land Use Planning Connection
     Transportation and land use planning are closely correlated. All land uses must be accessible, and the
     modes of transportation that are most efficient and most conveniently located are most effective. Signal
     Hill is served by an extensive public transportation system, including 15 Long Beach Transit bus routes
     and, just west of the city's boundaries, the heavily-utilized Metro Blue Line light rail service. These
     services provide an excellent opportunity for Signal Hill to pursue unique development types that are
     most effective and successful when transit systems are in place.
     Figure 9, Transit-Oriented Development Opportunities, presents a graphic depiction of areas within the city
     that may be most appropriate for denser, mixed-use development.

     The following factors were considered in the development of the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)
     Opportunities plan:
         •    Population density, with higher-density areas being more conducive to mixed-use projects and
              TODs;
         •    Transit corridors, with areas closest to bus routes and the Blue Line being most appropriate for
              TOD; and
         •    Major traffic generators, including large employers, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, and
              Long Beach City College, with locations closest to traffic generators being most appropriate for
              TOD.
     Transportation Demand Management
     Transportation Demand Management (TDM) refers to various strategies, policies, and programs that
     serve to reduce VMTs. The implementation of TDM programs is a critical component of regional
     transportation and air quality plans. A significant amount of funding from federal sources is contingent
     on the application of these programs to bring the region into compliance with federal air quality
     standards.
     This Circulation Element contains a range of TDM programs that will ultimately redistribute some
     vehicular traffic to other modes of transportation. These programs, which are further discussed below,
     include:
         •    Enhancing bicycle circulation systems,
         •    Expanding and improving the system of sidewalks and trails,
         •    Maintaining and enhancing the local public transportation system,
         •    Encouraging the development of TODs, and
         •    Encouraging major traffic generators to implement ridesharing programs and offer
              telecommuting options and alternative work schedules.

GENERAL PLAN

     B. Roadways Plan
     The city of Signal Hill is largely built-out, and no significant changes are proposed to the city's roadway
     system. Future improvements will primarily consist of capacity, safety, and aesthetic improvements to
     existing rights-of-way. Additionally, a renewed emphasis will be placed on creating "complete streets"—
     streets that serve the needs of all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, the disabled, and others.
     Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
     ITS make use of advanced detection, communications, and computing technology to improve the safety
     and efficiency of the transportation network. Arterial roadway ITS may perform functions such as
     traffic signal synchronization; the granting of buses and emergency vehicles priority at traffic signals;
     freeway ramp metering; and changes to signal timing in response to traffic volumes, direction of traffic,
     and special events or incidents. An ITS implementation often involves connecting traffic signals to a
     central traffic management center, which can remotely control signal operations. Closed-circuit
     television cameras are also used to provide real-time images of key intersections. ITS are often a cost-
     effective and relatively rapid method of improving a transportation system's efficiency.
     A major ITS implementation is planned in Signal Hill and adjacent areas as part of the Douglas Park
     project, located north of Long Beach Airport. The plan, known as the Douglas Park Adaptive Traffic
     Control System (ATCS), will implement a traffic signal control system that can adapt to changing traffic
     conditions. ATCS will reduce delay and improve travel times for motorists by facilitating multi-
     jurisdictional cooperation, providing for data exchange among agencies, monitoring traffic signal
     operations and congestion, and enabling a multi-jurisdictional response to special events or incidents.
     Participating agencies include the Cities of Signal Hill, Long Beach, Lakewood, Bellflower, and
     Cerritos; the County of Los Angeles; and Caltrans. ATCS will create eight “Adaptive Corridors” where
     traffic signals will be linked and coordinated. Four of these corridors—on Atlantic and Cherry Avenues,
     and Spring and Willow Streets—pass through or are adjacent to the city of Signal Hill, as shown in
     Figure 10, ATCS Signal Hill Corridors. The four corridors impacting Signal Hill include 11 signalized
     intersections, as detailed in Table 16, ATCS Signal Hill Intersections. Additionally, one closed-circuit
     television camera will be installed. The 11 signals located on the ATCS corridors in and near Signal
     Hill will be connected to and, under an agreement with the City of Signal Hill, managed by the City of
     Long Beach’s Traffic Management Center.

GENERAL PLAN
     The planned ATCS is an expandable system. Should the initial phase be successful in improving traffic
     flow, Signal Hill will support the continued implementation of ITS in area roadways, and will
     coordinate such systems with Caltrans and the City of Long Beach to ensure that regional traffic flows

     Traffic calming measures seek to enhance roadway safety and raise the area’s quality of life by reducing
     unsafe driver behavior, particularly driving at excessive speeds. Traffic calming reduces the negative
     impact of motor vehicles, and improves conditions for non-motorized users of the street.
     The City of Signal Hill takes a three-step approach to traffic calming:
          1. Education – Public education is the most cost-effective tool to in changing the attitudes and
              behaviors of drivers. Educational efforts encourage residents and visitors to be aware of speed
              limits and abide by them. Often, however, the impacts of educational efforts are short-term,
              and they are less likely to be effective when a substantial amount of traffic is from outside the
              community.
          2. Enforcement – Where education is not adequately reducing unsafe driver behavior, enhanced
              enforcement is next step. This is effective only when enforcement is consistent over a period of
              time, which can be a costly initiative for the City.
          3. Engineering – Where education and enforcement prove ineffective, the next step is to
              implement structural modifications that compel drivers to change their behaviors. Various
              engineering solutions to calm traffic are discussed below.
     The City of Signal Hill supports the use of traffic calming in areas where motor vehicle use has resulted
     in unsafe conditions and a reduced quality of life. In general, the use of traffic calming measures
     should:
          •   Be consistent with sound traffic engineering principles,
          •   Encourage and facilitate public involvement,

GENERAL PLAN

         •    Minimize diverted traffic to other local or residential collector streets,
         •    Maintain or improve the aesthetics of the streetscape,
         •    Provide for emergency vehicle access without undue impacts to safety and response times,
         •    Minimize adverse impacts to maintenance activities, and
         •    Encourage bicycle and pedestrian travel.
     The traffic calming techniques described below involve physical modifications to roadways. Before
     committing to these relatively expensive improvements, the City should consider using traffic control
     devices and programs and minor design modifications to achieve its goals for the street. These basic
     measures may include:
          •   High-visibility crosswalks,
          •   Curb marking and roadway striping modifications,
          •   Turn restrictions,
          •   Increased police enforcement,
          •   Photo enforcement (e.g., red light cameras),
          •   Truck restrictions,
          •   Higher-visibility signage, and
          •   Safety education programs,
     Where the above methods prove inadequate, the City may apply traffic-calming techniques such as
     those described in Table 17, Traffic Calming Techniques. Selected methods are depicted in Figure 11,
     Traffic Calming Examples. Other methods, not discussed in this General Plan, may also be used, at the
     discretion of the City Engineer.
     The use of traffic calming must be carefully considered before implementation, and should only be
     used where existing driver behavior (or anticipated driver behavior in redeveloping areas) diminishes
     the quality of life for or would be harmful to community members. Distinctions must be made between
     residential districts and commercial districts in the city.

         Technique                                                     Description
                            Areas of pavement raised several inches in height over a distance of at least 12 feet.
                            Various factors affect the speed at which a vehicle can safely cross a hump. Appropriate
                            roadway markings and signage should be included. Speed humps reduce speeds and
       Speed Hump
                            discourage cut-through traffic, but also slow emergency response vehicles.
    Raised Crosswalk
                            Raised crosswalks are generally wider than speed humps and are placed in locations with
   Raised Intersection      pedestrian traffic.
                            Raised intersections are flat-topped speed humps that cover an entire intersection. Bollards
                            are often used to define the pedestrian zone surrounding.
                            Speed cushions typically consist of recycled rubber or asphalt raised several inches above
                            the surrounding pavement. Spaces between the cushions permit large emergency vehicles
      Speed Cushion
                            to straddle the device; smaller vehicles cross over the cushion as they would a speed
                            hump, reducing traffic speeds.
                            Traffic circles are raised circular medians that direct traffic counterclockwise through an
       Traffic Circle       intersection. “Yield” signs may be used on approaches; in some cases, “Stop” signs may
                            be appropriate. Traffic circles reduce vehicular speeds.
                            Roundabouts are raised circular medians, which, like traffic circles, direct traffic
                            counterclockwise through an intersection. Roundabouts have the added advantages of
        Roundabout          higher capacity, allowing their use on streets of all sizes, and reducing delay at many
                            intersections. Additionally, they slow traffic and reduce accident frequency and severity.
                            Roundabouts are controlled by “Yield” signs at entries.
                            Mid-block Chokers are raised islands in the parking area of streets. They narrow roadways
                            and reduce vehicular speeds and cut-through traffic.
    Mid-block Choker        Bulbouts are similar to Chokers, but are placed at roadway intersections. They narrow the
                            intersection, causing vehicular speeds to be reduced and allowing pedestrians to cross a
          Bulbout
                            shorter distance.
          Chicane
                            Chicanes are Chokers which are placed in an alternating pattern on the roadway, creating a
                            curvilinear alignment. These shorten sight lines for drivers and require additional
                            maneuvering, causing a reduction in vehicular speeds.
                            Medians are raised islands in the center of the roadway that separate traffic directions. They
          Median
                            reduce vehicular speeds and shorten pedestrian crossings.
                            Diverters, closures, and extended medians reduce volume on roadways by compelling
                            drivers to take alternate routes. Diverters are raised areas placed diagonally across an
                            intersection, restricting through movements.
          Diverter
                            Partial closures limit vehicular access to streets and full closures completely block vehicular
  Full or Partial Closure
                            access by physically blocking roadways, while offering through routes for pedestrians and
    Extended Median         bicyclists.
                            Extended medians are raised islands in the center of the roadway which extend through
                            intersections, preventing left turn movements.

                                                Figure 11

     In residential areas, the primary goals of traffic calming are to reduce vehicular speeds and minimize
     cut-through traffic from congested collector and arterial roadways. Along commercial roadways, which
     primarily consist of collector and arterial streets, the goals of traffic calming are to reduce unsafe
     vehicular speeds and enhance the roadway environment for non-motorized users of the street, without
     causing congestion. School zones and routes are particularly common areas for traffic calming measures
     to be implemented; calming in these areas typically seeks to alert motorists of the presence of the
     school, and to improve safety conditions for pedestrians and bicyclists. Schools and school access routes
     in Signal Hill are depicted in Figure 12, Signal Hill Schools and Primary Pedestrian Access Routes.
     Aesthetic Improvements
     As funding permits, the City of Signal Hill will continue to improve the aesthetics of publicly-owned
     rights-of-way. This may include the addition of features such as:
          •   Landscaped medians
          •   Street trees
          •   Gateway monuments and signs
          •   Enhanced signage
     An example of a right-of-way that has received significant aesthetic improvements is shown in Image 5.
     The improvements shown on Cherry Avenue between Skyline Drive/Burnett Street and 21st Street
     include a raised median with trees and groundcover and attractively landscaped hillsides and retaining
     walls. The City should focus future aesthetic improvements on the area’s most-heavily-traveled
     corridors, such as the remaining segments of Cherry Avenue, Willow Street, Spring Street, and Orange
     Avenue. Special attention should be provided to the developing Pacific Coast Highway corridor and
     other mixed-use areas. Improvements in these areas should focus on creating “complete streets” that are
     attractive and functional for pedestrians, bicyclists, and other roadway users, in addition to motor
     vehicles.

     Improvements to major corridors may include:
          •    Public art
          •    Outdoor seating, especially near restaurants and transit nodes
          •    Widened sidewalks to facilitate pedestrian movement and create plaza-like entries to buildings
          •    Improved TranSmart-equipped transit stops, with additional seating and trash receptacles and
               enhanced shelters and signage
     Improvements implemented by the City of Signal Hill on corridors bordering Long Beach should be
     coordinated with the City of Long Beach.
     C. Sidewalks, Trails, and Bikeways
     Continued enhancement of the city's sidewalks, trails, and bikeways is one of the goals of this
     Circulation Element. Signal Hill's location near densely populated neighborhoods and major traffic
     generators make walking and bicycling a realistic alternative to motor vehicles for many residents.
     While the steep topography near the top of Signal Hill may discourage non-motorized transport except
     for those seeking exercise, much of the city consists of flat land or areas with modest slopes that can
     comfortably be traversed by pedestrians and bicyclists.
     The quality and availability of sidewalks varies widely across the city. SHMC Chapter 12.04 mandates
     the construction of sidewalks concurrent with new development. As areas of the city redevelop,
     sidewalk availability will increase.
     Off-street pedestrian trails are primarily located near the top of Signal Hill, where they provide
     panoramic views of the surrounding community. Trails in this area are heavily utilized by pedestrians.
     Trails provide links to the sidewalk system in various locations, and the sidewalk and off-street trail
     systems work in concert to create an expansive pedestrian network near the top of the hill. There is
     potential for the addition of new trails on the northern side of the hill, which is currently used for oil
     drilling.
     Significant improvements in Signal Hill's bicycle circulation system may yield a substantial increase in
     bicycle use. Existing constraints to bike travel include steep topography in parts of the city and narrow
     roadway rights-of-way in some areas. Nonetheless, opportunities exist for new bikeways to be created, as

GENERAL PLAN

     shown in Figure 7, Bicycle Master Plan. A major Class I bike path is planned along the former Pacific
     Electric right-of-way along the southwestern border of the city (Image 6). A new Class II bike lane is
     planned along Spring Street, and Class III bike routes are planned along Orange Avenue and Temple
     Avenue/Skyline Drive/Burnett Avenue from Pacific Coast Highway to Orange Avenue.
     D. Planned or Proposed Projects
     Figure 2, Roadway Classifications Map, depicts the build-out condition of Signal Hill's roadway system.
     No changes are proposed to the typical rights-of-ways discussed in Section II.A, above. Table 18, Planned
     or Proposed Projects, describes the key proposals within and in the vicinity of the city of Signal Hill that
     could impact the city's roadways in coming years. Two of these projects are shown in Images 7 and 8.
     The planned and proposed projects are in varying stages of development, and many have not yet been
     funded. The City supports the implementation of all of these projects and will coordinate with local,
     State, and regional agencies in their development.

                         pedestrian and bicycle facilities, where appropriate, and construction of new public
                         works facilities reasonably related to the impacts of the development and intended
                         use on the existing systems.
             Policy 1.c: Develop and improve the circulation and utility systems by identifying and
                         establishing a range of funding sources.
             Policy 1.d: Limit growth and development when the impacts of growth cannot be mitigated or
                         will overtax the existing systems.
             Policy 1.e: Strengthen the framework for effective regional and local circulation system
                         planning efforts.
             Policy 1.f: Ensure that new development provides adequate parking for anticipated uses;
                         however, reductions in parking requirements should be considered where
                         alternative modes of transportation or shared parking opportunities exist.

Land Use Element
I Background and Organization
The panoramic view from the crest of Signal Hill is truly one of the most beautiful in all
Southern California. Most spectacular is the view of the Pacific Ocean framed by the
Palos Verdes Peninsula and the Sheep Hills at Newport Beach. This ocean view
features rolling breakers at Huntington Beach, the Queen Mary and the Long Beach
skyline arguably equally spectacular at night. To the northwest, Signal Hill vistas include
the skyscrapers in downtown Los Angeles, the Hollywood sign and the Getty Museum
of Art perched upon the Santa Monica Mountains. To the east the view is remarkably
grand including the Long Beach Airport and the Pyramid at the California State
University at Long Beach. Signal Hill is a special place that enjoys a certain sense of
serenity above the surrounding urban plain. The residents of the City share many of the
attributes of small town life: a true sense of community, peaceful residential
neighborhoods, tree-lined streets, parks and trails and a vibrant community life. Signal
Hill is a City with a clear view, and a clear vision of its future as defined in its mission
statement:
Mission Statement
"Signal Hill is a small unique community that is economically independent, prides itself
in personalized service to the residents and business community that it serves and a
community which has created and works to maintain a high degree of livability for its
residents."
As in 1989 when the Land Use Element was last updated, vacant land remains Signal
Hill's most important resource. Significant development has occurred in the past
decade transforming an oil field and industrial city into a residential and light industrial
community. This update of the Land Use Element builds upon the success of the past
decade, establishes goals, policies and objectives for the planning period 2001-2015;
and makes "build-out" development projections for 2020 and 2025 for population,
household growth and employment.
The Land Use Element of the General Plan is Signal Hill's vision of its future and sets
forth the means to protect the land use philosophy of the community, the character of
its existing neighborhoods and the quality of the physical environment. Contained in
the Land Use Element are criteria for the various land use types and the appropriate
locations for each type of land use. Within each land use category are guidelines for
the intensity of development, urban design concepts and standards for measuring the
appropriateness of development proposals.
Signal Hill's land use pattern is well established and it is not anticipated to change
materially over time. New development will occur within the vacant oil field areas and to
a lesser extent in-fill development is anticipated in established neighborhoods.
Significant constraints to development of the "oil patch" will continue to limit the
availability of development sites and the rate of development. These constraints
include: ongoing oil field operations, steep slopes, unsuitable soils, environmental

Land Use Element
contamination, lack of existing utility systems or the need to upgrade existing systems,
small lot sizes, complex property ownership patterns, and a reluctance by traditional
lending institutions to finance development of environmentally impacted properties.
Major Proposals
Differences between the proposed Land Use Element and the existing Land Use
Element (1989) are generally minor, though there are a few important proposals that
should be noted:
    Heritage Square Central Business District concept for a mixed use intensive
    commercial and residential specific plan is added to the Commercial Town Center
    area located between 25th and Creston Streets and Rose and Cherry Avenues.
    Crescent Heights Historic District concept for a low-density residential specific plan
    located between Walnut and Gardena Avenues and 25 th and Creston Streets is
    added to encourage the relocation and renovation of 1890-1930 vernacular
    architecturally significant dwellings in a neighborhood setting.
    Atlantic/Spring Neighborhood General Industrial District is added by changing the
    current Commercial Office and Commercial General land use designations in the
    area generally bounded by Atlantic and California Avenues and Spring and Willow
    Streets to include a General Industrial District generally located between Canton
    and 27th Streets and Olive and California Avenues and a CG - Commercial General
    District generally located between Atlantic and California Avenues and Spring and
    Canton Streets.
    Cherry Avenue Low Density District is added by deleting the current Mixed Use land
    use designation along Cherry Avenue, between the City boundary south of 19 th
    Street and 21st Street and Cherry Avenue and the alley between Cherry and St.
    Louis Avenues.
    Total residential holding capacity increased from 10,070 to 11,286 persons.
Public Participation
The citizens of the City of Signal Hill have participated in the formulation of "likes,
dislikes and recommendations" for the future of Signal Hill through their loyal
participation in half a dozen General Plan workshops held during 1999. Their input is
recognized here as the most valued of all the information used in the formulation of
clear and concise statements about what is right about the City and what needs to be
fixed. Moreover, there is a strong desire of the citizens to maintain the peace, quiet and
secure environment the City has managed to achieve and preserve at this time in its
seventy years history.
Signal Hill General Plan                    5
Land Use Element
Legislative Authorization
The California Government code requires all City General Plans to contain a Land Use
Element. The Element should identify land use opportunities and constraints, promote
a balance of land uses, and guide public and private development activities. Section
65302(a) of the California Government Code identifies the required content of the Land
Use Element as follows:
"A land use element which designates the proposed general distribution and general
location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open spaces,
including agriculture, natural resources, recreation, enjoyment of scenic beauty,
education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and
other categories of public and private uses of land. The land use element shall include
a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended
for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan. The land use element
shall also identify areas covered by the plan which are subject to flooding and shall be
reviewed annually with respect to such areas."
State law encourages cities to include issues of greatest local concern in the General
Plan and Land Use Element. Accordingly, this Element focuses on the interface of oil
production and other urban uses, the preservation of views and scenic vistas, and the
orderly development of neighborhood shopping opportunities.
Relationship to Other Elements
Of all the elements required in the General Plan the Land Use Element has the
broadest scope and is key to the synthesis of the other State mandated elements
including Housing, Circulation, Environmental Resources, Safety, and Noise. The Land
Use Element has been prepared in conjunction with the update of the Housing and
Circulation Elements and in full knowledge and consideration of the other elements
including the Parks and Recreation Master Plan that has been adopted into the Signal
Hill General Plan.
Organization and Format
To help the reader in using the General Plan, the Land Use Element is structured
around analysis of seven Neighborhoods (Section III) with discussions, and summaries
from community meetings identifying general themes, characteristics and concerns that
provide the basis for city-wide goals, policies and action plans/objectives. During a year-
long community participation process, City officials, residents and businesspersons
participated in a series of Neighborhood Workshops to discuss city-wide and
neighborhood-level "likes and dislikes" and to provide recommendations for the land
use plan. Constraints and Issues (Section IV) provide further policy recommendations
based on background information and existing conditions relevant to land use planning.
Synthesis of ideas begins in Growth Concept (Section V) where predicted and
Signal Hill General Plan                    6
Land Use Element
proposed growth scenarios are quantified. The land use plan for the community is
described the Land Use Map (Section VI) and Special Management Areas Map
(Section VII). The Land Use Map section provides further narrative detail on the land
use classification plan and the allowed intensity of development. In Section VIII, broad
goals are defined, along with policies to guide evaluation of future development
proposals in the Goals and Policies (Section VIII). The Implementation Program
(Section VIII) sets forth Action Plans/Objectives to implement the City’s strategy for
carrying out its land use plan. During annual general plan reviews, the City will
compare its achievements to the Implementation Program Section to measure progress
or to recommend midcourse corrections to the land use plan.

Land Use Element
II Trends
Demographic and development trends are important to the formulation of land use
policies. This section of the Land Use Element builds upon the information in the 1989
Land Use Update.
Population
Table 1 displays a relatively steady rate of population growth during the past several
decades increasing approximately 100 persons per year, or an annual percentage
increase of less than one percent. However, the City is currently experiencing
unprecedented residential development in and around the hilltop area, and it is
expected that during the period 2000 - 2005 the rate of population growth will exceed
historic levels. The 1989 Land Use Element projected a maximum population of 11,232
assuming full development of all residentially zoned land in the City. The
recommendations in this update of the Land Use Element would result in residential
holding capacity of 11,286 persons. According to the State Department of Finance, in
the year 2000 the population of the City was 9,247. The forecast for 2010 is a
population of 10,471 in line with previous build out projections. Forecasts predict
additional population growth beyond the build out of the City to a population of 15,182
in 2025.

Economic
National, state and local economic trends influence local economic conditions, and local
conditions and land use policies tend to encourage or discourage economic
development. The City of Signal Hill has a long tradition of policies that are "business
friendly" including low business license fees and no utility taxes. As a low-or-no
property tax city, Signal Hill has found it necessary to rely upon sales taxes to support
local government activities. Table 2 compares per capita sales tax revenues collected
by the Cities of Signal Hill and Long Beach and Los Angeles County.

Employment
Signal Hill has a large and growing employment base. The petroleum industry, including
oil well tools (fish tools), pipe supply, and oil well servicing companies, were once a
major local employer and influential force in the City. Today, retail and service related
industries are the main employers. Moreover, businesses with less than five
employees account for the greatest number of employment opportunities. Table 3
displays the top ten employers in 1990 and 2000 that reveals the trend away from
petroleum and heavy industry to light manufacturing and service industries-especially
retail sales.

Redevelopment
In 1974, the City identified the entire Signal Hill oilfield a “blighted” area pursuant to
State Redevelopment Law, and incorporated nearly two-thirds of the 2.2 square mile
city as Redevelopment Project Area No. 1. Established neighborhoods, now some of
the oldest in the City were left outside of the project boundaries shown in Figure 1.
During the 1970's and 1980's, the Agency focused most of its attentions on
infrastructure improvement projects, including water, sewer, storm drain and street
improvement projects. In the 1980's, the Agency shifted its focus to economic
development. Notable projects assisted by the Agency’s economic development
program include: Price Club (Costco), Office Depot (formerly Eastman Company),
Home Depot, Toy's-R-Us, Office Max and several dealerships in the Signal Hill Auto
Center. During the past decade, the Agency also focused on the development of
affordable housing including Sea Breeze Manor, Signal Hill Village, East Village, and
the proposed Town Center West Senior Housing. Other Agency programs such as the
first-time-buyer assistance program and housing rehabilitation grants have helped to
upgrade the condition of the local housing stock.
Agency activities, especially economic development projects, help drive the land use
process in Signal Hill through implementation of a three-part economic development
program including business retention, business expansion, and business attraction.
Development of the oil field is extraordinarily complicated by fragmented ownership
patterns, soils contamination, and infrastructure requirements. Accordingly, the Agency
has had and will continue to have significant influence on land use patterns, housing
opportunities, and the quality of architecture and urban design features of the City.

III      Neighborhoods
This section discusses the City in terms of seven neighborhoods: 1-North End, 2-
Central, 3-West Side, 4-Civic Center, 5-Southeast, 6-Hilltop and 7-Atlantic/Spring.
Figure 2 displays the boundaries of these neighborhoods
1.       North End Neighborhood
Shady tree lined streets, comfortable cottage homes, and a walk in the park describes
life in the North End Neighborhood. Chinese Elm trees, both loved and despised by
local residents, provide a canopy of foliage above a grid of wide streets and alley ways.
The North End Neighborhood was a well established suburb of Long Beach before the
incorporation of the City of Signal Hill in 1924, and many of the dwellings there were
relocated from the oilfield to make way for further petroleum exploration. The Signal
Hill Oil Field traverses the City from northwest to southeast and forms the westerly
boundary of the North End Neighborhood along with a Target retail store and several
blocks of light industrial development. The entire neighborhood lies north of the I- 405
freeway (1962) that separates the neighborhood from the rest of Signal Hill. The City
was successful in requiring the designers of the freeway to place it below grade in this
stretch so that is a somewhat less dominate feature than elsewhere in the region.
Unfortunately, off-ramps at Atlantic and Orange Avenues spill unwanted traffic into the
neighborhood. In 1998, the State responded to City and resident's long-standing
requests and shared the construction costs for a sound wall along the north side of the
freeway.
The residential lot size in the North End Neighborhood is relatively large, typically 6,375
square feet, and most lots have both street and alley access. The design of the
individual houses varies from classic Spanish to Victorian and Craftsman. Typical post
Wold War II tract style homes, single-story stucco with metal frame windows and
composite shingle roofs are commonplace. Garages are thoughtfully placed to the rear
of the lot, with the access provided via an alley. This site design de-emphasizes the
role of the automobile typical of modern suburban neighborhood streets too often
Signal Hill General Plan                   12
Land Use Element
dominated by rows of driveways and garage doors. Many properties have one or more
rental dwellings in addition to the main dwelling.
Prior to 1985, the Crane Company (formerly Pacific Valves) operated a foundry at
Walnut Avenue and 32nd Street. It was partially replaced by a modern light industrial
park in 1985. This project sparked much controversy at the time of its development, but
its exemplary design, landscaping and maintenance make it a good neighbor for nearby
residents who rarely complain about its effect on the neighborhood. To the east of
Walnut Avenue lies a City of Long Beach Water Department facility, with its broad
landscaped yard that provides a pleasing east edge for the North End Neighborhood.
The north boundary of the neighborhood is located 90-feet south of Wardlow Road, and
the shops fronting on Wardlow Road obtain business licenses from the City of Long
Beach. Apparently, the founders of the City avoided responsibility for maintaining
Wardlow Road by drawing the City boundary 90 feet south of the road. This same
boundary arrangement is found along Atlantic Avenue.
Public facilities and institutions located in the North End Neighborhood include
Burroughs Elementary School and Reservoir Park. The southerly half of the park is a
five million-gallon reservoir and pump station. In contrast to the otherwise exclusively
single-family character of the North End Neighborhood, there is a concentration of two-
story apartment buildings on 32nd Street near California Avenue. The following are
comments from the residents who attended the North End Neighborhood workshop:
What North End residents like: Nice homes and trees, picturesque streetscapes,
security and cleanliness
What they don't like: An increasing number of rentals, cut through traffic, trucks and
noise, lack of property maintenance.
Recommendations:
     The City needs to promote home ownership as the preferred form of tenancy.
     The City needs to encourage or require all property owners to maintain their
     property.
     The City should work with the neighborhood on a "traffic calming" plan to mitigate
     cut-through traffic and reduce traffic impacts like noise, odors and dust

2.       Central Neighborhood
The Central Neighborhood lies south of the I-405 freeway between Temple and
California Avenues. Willow Street is the southerly boundary of the Central
Neighborhood except that the Hathaway Tank Farm and industrial complex between
Hathaway and Redondo Avenues is included in the Central Neighborhood. During the
oilfield boom years (1923-1965), the Central Neighborhood served as a vast storage
yard for the oil field. Principle businesses included pipe and equipment storage yards,
oil tool (fish tool) companies, petroleum refineries and tank farms. As production
declined, the major petroleum companies Shell, Texaco and Arco sold their interests in
the Signal Hill oil field, and concurrently relinquished the surface rights back to property
owners more interested in alternative forms of urban development. Several of these
storage yard businesses remain unattractive reminders of Signal Hill's colorful past.
Small size industrial lots, narrow streets and alleys and obsolete industrial buildings
make the Central Neighborhood a congested place to do business. While it is a
convenient location for commerce near the airport and several freeways, it lacks the
infrastructure necessary to accommodate large tractor-trailer size trucks that compete
with smaller vehicles for road space and parking. The viability of the Central
Neighborhood as the City's employment hub will depend on the City's success in
limiting the growth of businesses involving fleets of tractor-trailer size trucks that tend to
impede the free flow of smaller vehicles.
In the1970's, developers found the Central Neighborhood of Signal Hill, an ideal
location for development of high-quality light industrial space. Attributes of the location
include freeway access midway between Los Angeles and Orange County business
districts, proximity to two ports, Long Beach and Los Angeles, and adjacency to the
Long Beach Airport. Table 5 displays the growth of commercial and light industrial
space in the City during the past several decades.

The Central Neighborhood also includes the Signal Hill Auto Center located along
Spring Street and Cherry Avenue. Nine new car dealerships are currently represented
with plans to add two more in the year 2001. The City/Agency plans for continued
growth of the Auto Center as more sites become available along Spring Street or
Cherry Avenue. Auto Center Design Guidelines and the Spring/Cherry/Willow Corridors
Landscape Design Standards will continue to guide development of the Auto Center
which provides an attractive edge for the Central Neighborhood and a palm tree lined
gateway corridor leading to the Town Center. Entertainment and many services are
also available in the Central Neighborhood. Most notably, the On the Green
fairgrounds developed by the Signal Hill Chamber of Commerce hosts a summer
evening concert series and weekly farmers market. A wide range of neighborhood
services are also available in the Central Neighborhood including auto repair, banking,
delicatessens, fitness center, trade schools, upholstery, picture framing, and welding.
The Commercial/Industrial Zoning District designation given to many Central
Neighborhood properties recognizes that retail sales is an important accessory
component of many light manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and service
businesses. The following are comments from the property and business owners who
attended the Central Neighborhood workshop:
Signal Hill General Plan                              16
Land Use Element
What Central Neighborhood business owners like: Safe area for business activity,
good freeway access, low business license taxes, no utility taxes.
What they don't like: Unattractive storage businesses, increasing traffic and
congestion.
Recommendations:
   The City should encourage the transition of "unattractive" storage yards to other
   land uses like light industrial parks.
   The City should discourage businesses that increase traffic and congestion
   especially businesses involving fleets of large tractor trailer truck, large vans or
   buses.
   The City should discourage development of port related cargo terminals, container
   storage yards, and trucking businesses.
Signal Hill General Plan                  17
Land Use Element
3.     West Side Neighborhood
The West Side Neighborhood is located south of Willow Street between Orange and
the abandoned Pacific Electric Railroad right-of-way. It includes a mix of older industrial
and residential land uses on small size lots with scattered oil field operations.
Compared to the other neighborhoods the West Side Neighborhood appears less
spatially organized than other parts of the City with more rental properties and fewer
well kept buildings and lawns. The West Side Neighborhood has a lower income
population, more dwellings in need of repairs, less landscaping and fewer trees. The
residential core of the West Side Neighborhood is located on Cerritos, Lemon and
Lewis Avenues between 23rd and Burnett Streets. This residential enclave has many
unique historic dwellings, and some painstakingly restored by their owners. Notable
structures include the barn-like dwelling at 2289 Lemon Avenue that was once a
community playhouse. Unfortunately, industrial uses including several unsightly
storage yards surround these dwellings and detracts from the quality of life of the
neighborhood.
There are more apartment buildings located in the West Side Neighborhood than
elsewhere in the City. Among these apartments, the Las Brisas Apartments located
along California Avenue north of Burnett Street is among the City's most troubled
residential areas. Police and Code Enforcement efforts to force property owners to
improve the Las Brisas Apartments have largely failed to address lingering problems
with absentee and undercapitalized property owners. The Agency has begun to
implement a comprehensive revitalization plan for the Las Brisas Apartments to
purchase and renovate the 152-unit complex and introduce single ownership and strong
property maintenance and management. The proposal includes a small neighborhood
park and may include a community center or day care center.
The West Side Neighborhood is affected by the appearance of Orange Avenue, a
corridor lined with storage yards and auto repair businesses. In 1998, the City
Signal Hill General Plan                 18
Land Use Element
approved a property maintenance ordinance requiring property owners along Orange
Avenue to improve the appearance of their properties by painting buildings,
constructing screen fences, and planting landscaping. This ordinance was associated
with the relaxation of zoning standards for street dedications and building setbacks.
Moreover, the General Plan Circulation Element designation for Orange Avenue was
downgraded from Major Highway (100-foot right-of-way) to Secondary Modified
Highway (70-foot right-of-way). The appearance of the Orange Avenue corridor has
improved as a result of the changed ordinance and new development projects including
the Signal Hill Golf Center, a golf driving range that added several acres of green space
to the Westside Neighborhood. The following are comments from residents and
business owners who attended the West Side Neighborhood workshop:
What West Side Neighborhood residents like: Home ownership opportunities and
affordable restorable houses, responsive Police Department, good access to schools
and shopping.
What they don't like: Lack of neighborhood shopping opportunities, dilapidated
apartments.
Recommendations:
    The City should encourage home ownership and homeowners efforts to repair and
    restore existing housing.
    The City should encourage further development of neighborhood shopping
    opportunities.
    The Agency needs to complete the acquisition and renovation of the Las Brisas
    apartments, and establish a common ownership and management structure to
    ensure consistent maintenance.
    The City should complete the General Plan, Park Master Plan recommendations
    and develop a West Side Park.
    The City should consider ways to improve the interface or create buffer areas
    between the existing commercial/ industrial land uses and the existing residential
    neighborhood.

4. Civic Center Neighborhood
The Civic Center Neighborhood takes its name from the many public institutions located
between Cherry and Walnut Avenues and Willow Street and the southerly City
boundary along the abandoned Pacific Electric railroad right-of-way. Public institutions
located in the Civic Center Neighborhood include: City Hall, Police Station, Library and
Community Center all surrounding Signal Hill Park, the largest park in the City. Long
Beach Unified School District operates three schools in the Civic Center Neighborhood;
Signal Hill and Alvarado elementary schools, the oldest and newest elementary schools
in the City respectively, and the Preparatory Academy junior high school that is planned
for replacement. The Civic Center Neighborhood also includes the Town Center West
commercial center.
In the vicinity of City Hall, the Civic Center Neighborhood contains a mix of older homes
and contemporary condominiums, some of which capture views toward the west of the
Palos Verdes peninsula and Long Beach skyline. This neighborhood used to be
influenced by the negative visual and air quality affects of the Chemoil (formerly
MacMillan) oil refinery on Walnut Avenue south of Hill Street. The refinery and
associated tank farm were demolished in 1999, and the site remains vacant today.
Considerable soils remediation work will have to be completed to make the site suitable
for development. Given the constraints to development, the most feasible use of the old
refinery site may be light industrial business park type uses.
Overlooking the City Hall area is the Crescent Heights residential neighborhood that
takes its name from the original subdivision map of that area. Here are several fine
historic homes constructed before the discovery of oil on Signal Hill or in some
instances moved to Crescent Heights from elsewhere in the oil patch. The owners of
these dwellings have expressed interest in the creation of a historic district to
encourage repair and renovation efforts and attract further historic house relocations to
the neighborhood. Crescent Heights commands ocean views to the south and
southwest and the neighborhood is close to neighborhood shopping opportunities at the
Town Center.
Signal Hill General Plan                   20
Land Use Element
In recent years, the City has turned away from focusing exclusively on retail sales tax
generating businesses like the Costco and Home Depot found in Town Center East and
more toward a neighborhood-shopping venue. The Town Center West shopping center,
planned for completion in 2001, includes a grocery store, beauty supply shop, coffee
house, sit-down and fast food restaurants and a service station. Town Center West also
mixes urban uses with a large senior-housing component planned for a view-oriented
site located adjacent to the neighborhood shopping center. This type of development
helps achieve affordable housing goals described in more detail in the Housing
Element, and provides a built-in population base necessary to support neighborhood
businesses. The following are comments from residents who attended the Civic Center
Neighborhood meeting:
What Civic Center Neighborhood residents like: Peaceful quiet neighborhoods,
neighborhood services and shopping, historic houses, small town history.
What they don't like: Traffic congestion by schools, dusty lots, too much "big box" and
"fast food", overhead utilities, lack of neighborhood shops and restaurants.
Recommendations:
    The City should encourage the repair and renovation of architecturally or historically
    significant houses by creating incentives to relocate dwellings into the Crescent
    Heights area.
    The Crescent Heights neighborhood should be given a special designation and a
    Specific Plan should be prepared to establish precise district boundaries, strict
    guidelines for design, landscaping, house moving projects, etc.
    The City lacks a true Central Business District and needs a bold new high-intensity
    commercial environment to serve our growing community. Accordingly, it is
    recommended that the City encourage the development of a Central Business
    District envisioned as a diverse, view oriented, intensely developed, pedestrian
    friendly shopping and dining venue with small shops and services, sit-down and
    outdoor dining opportunities, and community facilities. Residential lofts/ apartments
    and mixed-use structures will be permitted in multi-story configurations as an
    incentive to achieving public amenities like a town square or a public viewing area.
    The essential elements of the Central Business District include curbside parking,
    wide sidewalks, shops with a lot of windows, doors open to the customers, and
    outdoor merchandize displays. The Central Business District will capitalize on the
    existing retail environment by providing additional specialty retail shops and
    services. It will also provide a rest stop for hilltop hikers and a walk-to-shopping and
Signal Hill General Plan                   21
Land Use Element
   dining venue for the residents of the adjacent Crescent Heights and Promontory
   neighborhoods.
   The City should investigate funding mechanisms for undergrounding overhead
   utilities especially where the undergrounding of overhead wires and poles will help
   to improve public or private views.
   The City should coordinate traffic circulation studies and traffic enforcement efforts
   with the Long Beach Unified School District to improve pedestrian safety and traffic
   flow in vicinity of Signal Hill School.

5.      Hilltop Neighborhood
Hilltop residents enjoy living on the high ground well above the surrounding landscape
where they enjoy the benefits of breathtaking panoramic views, but they also endure
certain annoyances from outsiders visiting the hill who add traffic and exasperate
parking congestion. Hilltop Neighborhood development consists of view oriented single
-family dwellings and condominiums on the top of the hill, Willow Ridge condominiums
on the north side of the hill, Town Center East with Costco and Home Depot, the
condominium buildings on the south slope of the hill including the condominiums on
Molino and Temple Avenues north of 19th Street, Bixby Ridge and California Crown
single-family homes east of Temple Avenue. The boundaries of the Hilltop
Neighborhood are Willow Street on the north, 21st and 19th Streets on the south, Cherry
Avenue on the west and Hathaway and Obispo Avenues on the east.
Development of the remaining vacant land in the Hilltop Neighborhood began in earnest
in 1999 with the Bixby Ridge gated community of small-lot homes on the east flank of
the hill, followed by the Promontory on top of the hill. These residential development
projects were made possible after the City initiated Hilltop Neighborhood infrastructure
improvements including the construction of two water reservoirs, the Hilltop Park and
the consolidation of antenna facilities. As a part of the effort to develop the Hilltop
Neighborhood, the City coordinated the consolidation of seven telecommunications
sites and nine antenna towers into a single antenna consolidation site occupied by two
antenna towers. The City of Long Beach operates a large telecommunications facility
serving the needs of public safety, schools, transportation and utility providers, and
Mountain Union Telecom operates a smaller tower serving private service
telecommunications providers of wireless services and KLON, an FM radio station. The
Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulates the safety of radio broadcasts
from these facilities.
The Hilltop Neighborhood is planned to develop in accordance with the Hilltop Area
Specific Plan which calls for a mix of single family detached dwellings and view oriented
Signal Hill General Plan                  23
Land Use Element
condominium flats. These planned residential areas will be traversed by walking and
hiking trails that will link the Hilltop, Sunset View and Discovery Well neighborhood
parks to the Civic Center, Signal Hill Park, the Community Center and Library and the
Town Center shopping district.
Existing Hilltop Neighborhood residential development provides a range of housing
opportunities from small condominiums to large view oriented single family dwellings.
Scattered among these residential dwellings are operating oil wells and at least two-
nonconforming office/ manufacturing buildings held over from an earlier era when the
hilltop was zoned industrial. The remaining vacant land in the Hilltop Neighborhood
                                                                 th
includes oil field land in the vicinity of Obispo Avenue and 20 Street zoned for single
family detached dwellings and the north facing slope of Signal Hill that is zoned for 120-
four-plex dwellings. The Central Drill Site is also located on the north side of the hill at
Temple Avenue and Combellack Drive. This facility separates water from the
petroleum produced in the oil field. Accordingly, it will remain active in the foreseeable
future. The City may want to study the Planned Development Area-2 zoning that
applies to the Central Drill Site because the standards are difficult to apply to new
development proposals. The Sierra Club and the property owner are also studying the
feasibility of establishing a thirty-five acre open space conservancy area on the north
side of Signal Hill to preserve habitat and walking trails.
In the next few years, the hilltop neighborhood will be transformed by significant
residential development envisioned in the Hilltop Area Specific Plan (1991). This
development will involve grading of the hillsides, construction of retaining walls and
pads for new dwellings. Impacts on existing view are anticipated, as vacant lots
become home sites. The following are comments from residents who attended the
Hilltop Neighborhood workshop:
Signal Hill General Plan                     24
Land Use Element
What Hilltop Neighborhood residents like: The view, sea breezes, peace and quiet,
walking and hiking trails, proximity to Civic Center and parks, progress and beauty of
new development.
What they don't like: Undeveloped weed filled lots, trees that block the views,
unimproved roads, noisy oil wells and aircraft, lack of parking, existing high-density
housing, too many hikers in the streets.
Recommendations:
   The City should encourage the continuation of the development of the hilltop with
   high-quality housing.
   The City should require developers to pay their fair share for improving roads and
   infrastructure related to their projects.
   The City should follow the recommendations in the Hilltop Area Specific Plan
   regarding landscaping and the careful planting of trees so as not to create view
   obstructions.
   The City must continue to enforce the Oil Code landscaping and maintenance
   standards.
   Views from existing dwellings should be preserved when feasible, but efforts to
   preserve views should not infringe on the rights of property owners to develop in
   accordance with the existing Hilltop Area Specific Plan.
   The City should encourage the development of a comprehensive system of
   sidewalks and trails to encourage walking and hiking and the enjoyment of the view
   from the hilltop.
   The City should consider revision or deletion of the PD-2 zoning district because the
   text and standards are difficult to apply to development proposals

6.Southeast Neighborhood
The Southeast Neighborhood has enjoyed a significant resurgence during the past
planning period (1989 - 2000). The redevelopment of formerly commercial properties
along Pacific Coast Highway with new single family homes (Signal Hill Village and East
Village) reinvigorated the neighborhood by removing the blighting influences of obsolete
commercial highway uses. However, much work remains to be done to turn around the
appearance and character of Pacific Coast Highway. The Southeast Neighborhood is
an older attractive neighborhood of tree-lined streets and a variety of housing styles.
Both property maintenance and values increase with elevation where the view improves
and with distance from Pacific Coast Highway, a busy and noisy State highway. The
Southeast Neighborhood is located close to the Civic Center, Signal Hill Park and the
Library, but lacks a neighborhood park. To address the need, the City recently acquired
two lots on Raymond Avenue for development of a park.
Between Cherry and Stanley Avenues the character of the neighborhood is primarily
single family and duplex homes. East of Stanley Avenue, the topography changes
dramatically affording opportunities for hillside housing including some of the City's
more expensive view homes on Terrace Drive and Stanley Avenue. Nearby, are high
value multi-family view oriented condominium flats on Molino Avenue and 20 th Street.
The existing Commercial Residential zoning designation that applies to the properties
with street frontage on Cherry Avenue is difficult to apply to new development
proposals. The City may want to study the Commercial Residential designation and
consider an all residential designation for the Cherry Avenue properties between the
City boundary at the railroad right-of-way and 20th Street.
Signal Hill General Plan                 26
Land Use Element
The east half of the Southeast Neighborhood, generally located between Orizaba and
Redondo Avenues, consists of a light industrial park occupied by light manufacturing,
warehouses and office uses. There are few remaining vacant lots in the industrial park,
but it is anticipated that older obsolete storage yards and obsolete warehouse buildings
will be replaced by newer development as the demand for light industrial space
continues to grow. The City has adopted a Pacific Coast Highway Specific Plan to
control new development and reuse of existing industrial and commercial buildings in
this area but the area is located outside of the boundaries of the Redevelopment
Project Area. Reuse or replacement of the vacant Beach City Chevrolet auto
dealership buildings remains one of the most difficult issues for the Southeast
Neighborhood. The following are comments from Southeast Area residents and
businesspersons that attended the Southeast Neighborhood workshop:
What Southeast residents like: Small town atmosphere, a location that is close to
beaches and shopping, proximity to the City Hall and Signal Hill Park.
What they don't like: Cut through traffic from Cherry Avenue and Pacific Coast
Highway, dilapidated businesses on Pacific Coast Highway and Cherry Avenue, lack of
neighborhood parks.
Recommendations:
    The City should encourage homeownership and home improvement
    The City should encourage renovation of existing dwellings, when practicable, or the
    replacement of obsolete housing.
    The City should encourage further renewal efforts along Pacific Coast Highway.
    The City should study the current Commercial /Residential along Cherry Avenue
    between Pacific Coast Highway and 21st Street. The school should be given a
    Public Institutional designation and the properties fronting on Cherry Avenue should
    be re-designate residential consistent with the adjacent residential neighborhood.
    The Cities of Signal Hill and Long Beach should coordinate planning efforts to
    effectuate improvement of dilapidated Pacific Coast Highway properties.

7.      Atlantic/ Spring Neighborhood
The Atlantic/ Spring Neighborhood contains the single largest vacant land area
remaining in the City. This neighborhood is located between Atlantic and California
Avenues and the 405-Freeway and Willow Street. It remains vacant because there are
overwhelming constraints to development including: ongoing oil production activities
primarily independent oil operations; contaminated soils including sumps and past
refining facilities; small lot sizes and fragmented ownership patterns; lack of
infrastructure; and topographical constraints including steep slopes and a ravine north
of Columbia Street. Long ago, a stream ran through the Atlantic/Spring Neighborhood
from northeast to southwest. Portions of this streambed were filled with rubble following
the Long Beach Earthquake in 1932. Existing land uses include medical offices and
related facilities that support the Memorial Medical Center along Atlantic Avenue, and a
mix of commercial and residential uses along Willow Street. The City is currently
processing an environmental impact report for a 22-acre Home Depot retail center on a
site overlooking the 405-Freeway and greater Long Beach at the northeast corner of
Spring Street and Atlantic Avenue. The City of Long Beach plans to develop a large
(26-acre) pay-for-play Sports Park between Willow and Spring Streets east of California
Avenue.
During the past planning period, the Cities of Signal Hill and Long Beach established
the Spring Street Corridor Joint Powers Authority to facilitate planning for the
Spring/Atlantic Neighborhood. The genesis of the Authority, a proposed stock-car
racetrack proved infeasible due to the aforementioned constraints and other
environmental concerns. Other development ideas for the area included a golf course
and residential neighborhood. The City did not hold a general plan workshop for the
Atlantic/Spring Neighborhood but received considerable advice from the landowners
during Authority meetings and independent efforts to organize owners in support of a
development plan. Property owners suggest that interior properties, sites lacking
commercial frontage, should be designated for industrial use and sites with commercial
Signal Hill General Plan                    28
Land Use Element
frontage designated for commercial uses that support or benefit from the nearby
medical center or the proposed Sports Park and Home Depot projects.
Recommendations:
       The City should prepare a Specific Plan and rezone the Atlantic/ Spring
       Neighborhood for General Industrial and Commercial use.
       The City should seek grants to study and develop the infrastructure necessary
       for the development of the Atlantic/ Spring Neighborhood.
       The City should seek federal and /or state grants and other tax revenues
       targeted toward “brownfield” development opportunities.

IV Constraints and Issues
The preceding section of this element evaluated population, employment, economic
and redevelopment trends and discussed needs, issues and preferences of the
residents and businesspersons that participated in the General Plan workshop series.
In order to develop land use policies for the future, it is important to first examine
existing land use constraints and issues as they relate to other elements of the General
Plan. In the case of the Land Use Element, the constraints are both natural and man-
made physical constraints that determine site suitability for different types of land uses
and compatibility among land uses.
Residential Density
A consistent theme heard at the community workshops was support for the continuation
of the current General Plan Land Use Element policies regarding "moderate growth"
residential density. Both the 1986 and 1989 Land Use Element updates considered the
need to establish varying residential densities within the City to provide a range of
housing types to meet the needs of the community. Another important consideration in
determining residential densities for certain areas of the City is the need to provide
affordable housing and to conform to State mandates that requires each California city
provide its fair share of affordable housing opportunities consistent with local need and
employment opportunities. The specifics of the local need are addressed in the
Housing Element.
Considerations in determining residential densities for certain areas of the City include
the capabilities of public utility infrastructure, the capacity of the circulation system, the
availability of public services and existing and man-made conditions. Funding for
growth and development of the infrastructure includes developers paying their fair share
of improvement costs. The residential policies established in the 1986 General Plan
and updated in the 1989 Land Use Element have succeeded in encouraging private
sector residential development in the vacant residentially zoned areas of the City. The
City has adopted six residential specific plans encompassing approximately 255 acres
of land as follows:
Signal Hill General Plan                     30
Land Use Element
California Crown - Developed in 1990, this neighborhood of ninety single-family homes
is one of Signal Hill's most prestigious communities. The site constraints to
development were significant, including the abandonment and re-drilling of numerous
oil wells, relocation of local streets, soils issues and the need to extend water mains to
the hillside area.
Sea Breeze Manor - This very low-income high-density housing development of 52
attached dwellings replaced a troubled and obsolete apartment complex. With
assistance from the Agency, the Crippled Children's Society combined the resources of
several agencies to provide housing for disabled residents. The development is located
adjacent to the Civic Center and Signal Hill Park.
Signal Hill Village - This high-density single family detached dwelling project includes 52
for sale dwellings. It replaced some of the City's most dilapidated commercial
development along Pacific Coast Highway and helped to rejuvenate the Southeast
Neighborhood by reducing cut-through traffic from Pacific Coast Highway to Cherry
Avenue.
Hilltop Promontory - Adopted in 1992 and amended in 1993 and again in 1999/2000 the
Promontory is the City's "crown jewel" residential neighborhood. The original specific
plan called for 525 dwellings. The current plan tempered by the refinement of geologic
investigation calls for approximately 450 single-family homes and duplex townhouses.
Bixby Ridge - Planned as an entry level small lot single-family development this 189
dwelling gated community includes the five acre Discovery Well Park and a system of
trails that link the neighborhood to the hilltop Panorama Trail and Hilltop Park. First
entitled in 1997, development of this hillside neighborhood required significant grading
and slope stabilization efforts.
Town Center West Senior Housing - This 152-unit development is planned for a 4.5
acre view parcel located adjacent to the City's newest mixed-use retail center.
Build-out in accordance with these approved specific plans will assure that the City
achieves the residential density objectives identified in the 1989 Land Use Element as
well as achieve State mandated affordable housing objectives identified in the Housing
Element. Moreover, creative land use plans for mixed-use development like the Town
Center West, that combines neighborhood scale commercial development with high
density senior housing located close to major public transportation corridors and
shopping opportunities, furthers the community desire to provide housing for all age
and income segments of the society. The City should continue to use the specific plan
process as the preferred planning process for achieving desired results.
Signal Hill General Plan                    31
Land Use Element
Manage Scenic Hillside Areas
Signal Hill, from which the City derives its name, is the City's most valuable resource.
Its scenic vistas and natural beauty help define the attributes of open space and coastal
proximity mentioned often as prime reasons for living in the City. The approved plans
for the development of the hilltop and hillsides attempts to preserve open spaces and
trails for the future enjoyment of the greater community. Already, the Hilltop Park has
become a favorite tourist stop for showing-off the scenic beauty of the area.
Concurrent with the development of the remaining privately owned open space, the
importance of enhancing the public viewing locations and improving the walking trails
increases. Managing hillside scenic areas also means paying close attention to the
architecture of new development and the landscaping on both public and privately
maintained hillsides. View obstructing trees should be discouraged through the site
plan design review process and enforcement of homeowners associations' rules and
regulations.
Quality Development
A major theme of the 1986 Land Use Element restated here and made part of this
update is the concern that during the 1970's-1980's, the City allowed too much low
quality, poorly designed development to occur without benefit of design review
guidelines and specific plan standards. The Land Use Element recognizes the
continuing need to maintain a high level of control over the development review process
in order to achieve the highest quality development. An important element of quality
development is the City's commitment to an urban design concept and the wherewithal
to stick to an urban design theme long enough to impact the community and give it a
unique sense of place. Through the Site Plan and Design Review process the City has
identified and repeated certain design elements that help give it a unique sense of
place including the following:
     Pyramid roof elements on commercial buildings.
     Smooth finish stucco exterior on commercial buildings.
     Square archways instead of curved archways on commercial buildings.
     Multi-tone paint exteriors with dark color base banding on commercial buildings.
     Opposing image buildings (Office Depot at Willow & Redondo and industrial
     buildings at Gundry Avenue north of Willow Street).
     Denni mansion theme walls (Hilltop parks & trails and Promontory residential)
     Cherry Avenue wall, stucco pilasters and over-size wrought iron (along Cherry
     Avenue. Also found at the gate at the end of Junipero Avenue).
     High quality landscaping and oilfield landscaping.
     Distinctive "Hill Swoosh" logo City entry signs.
     City Hall & Community Center oil patch.
     City history photo collection.
     City Hall deco architecture (Community Center and Signal Hill Storage on PCH).
Signal Hill General Plan                   32
Land Use Element
    Meandering sidewalks (Town Center and Bixby Ridge). In addition to quality design,
    quality development requires that the City remains committed to its plan review and
    inspection during construction to assure long lasting beauty and durability of the built
    environment.
Quality development also includes development of high quality public works
infrastructures including power, communications, sewer, water, storm drains, street
improvements, trees, lighting, and landscaping. Moreover, providing quality
development entails the provision of high quality community services including the
following: parks, trails, libraries, community and police services. New development
must contribute its fair share to the design, development and maintenance of these
facilities and services.
The City has attempted to improve the appearance of new development projects by
requiring that overhead utilities be placed underground when technically feasible.
Unfortunately, it is too expensive to bury high voltage lines (16 Kilowatts and above)
that crisscross the City, and utility funding (Rule 20A) for undergrounding existing utility
systems is increasingly limited.
Revitalize Older Commercial and Industrial Areas
During the past planning period, the Land Use Element established goals for the
improvement of the appearance of the oil field and recommended a move away from
heavy industrial uses, especially refining activities. Perhaps the most striking visual
change in the City in recent years is the dramatic change of the oil field as a result of
the adoption of the Signal Hill Oil Code in 1986. The City mandated that the oil
operators paint all pumping units and tanks and plant five trees and seven shrubs for
each pumping unit and tank. Drought tolerant trees and plants were selected for
landscaping the oilfield because many oil field areas lacked water for irrigation. As the
landscaping has matured, it has transformed the appearance of the oilfield and the City
into a garden like environment.
Further revitalization of the heavy industrial areas occurred as a result of market
conditions unfavorable to refining activities and City code enforcement efforts. During
the past planning period, the last of the petroleum refineries where dismantled including
Eco refinery, Enviropur (formerly PRC), and Chemoil (formerly McMillian) refinery. In
addition, the Redevelopment Agency's development of the Signal Hill Auto Center
contributed to the replacement of two large auto junkyards, numerous oil field
equipment storage businesses, and two large petroleum tank farms.
Notwithstanding these changes, the unique character of Signal Hill remains entwined
with ongoing oil field activity, diversity of land uses and the variety of architectural styles
found in the City. The desire to preserve the character of Signal Hill must be weighed
against the desire to transform the City into a more attractive community. In 1999, the
City addressed the unattractive storage yard issue in one area of the City. The Orange
Avenue Improvement Program and implementation ordinance required that property
Signal Hill General Plan                    33
Land Use Element
owners of existing storage yards located along Orange Avenue construct screen fences
and plant landscaping. It also included incentives designed to encourage the Orange
Avenue property owners to improve their properties, including City funded street
improvements and a relaxation of building setback and right-of-way dedication
requirements. Expansion of the Orange Avenue Improvement Program is
recommended to include the remaining storage yards throughout the City.
Large truck traffic and the port related need for shipping container and truck storage
facilities is a growing concern for planners in the greater Signal Hill area. The Land Use
Element recommends against the establishment or expansion of large truck facilities
and truck transportation related storage facilities.
Revitalize Older Residential Areas
The community takes pride in its limited examples of historic dwellings and places.
Residents and visitors alike admire the City Hall and its collection of historic
photographs. The City has encouraged individual efforts to preserve historic structures,
collected photographs and preserved oral histories from seniors who were once active
in the oil field and civic affairs. The Land Use Element recognizes the growing interest
in the community to identify and promote the restoration and preservation of historic
dwellings and the documentation of Signal Hill's colorful past through oral histories and
photographs.
Special attention should be placed on older residential neighborhoods that need
maintenance and upgrading to continue to provide safe and attractive living
accommodations for the residents. The Land Use Element encourages renovation of
existing dwellings when feasible and the replacement of obsolete structures when
necessary.
Diversify the City's Economic Base
The City relies heavily on retail sales taxes to provide public services. While retail sales
from the Signal Hill Auto Center and Town Center big box retail stores have consistently
increased, these sources of retail sales tax revenues are subject to economic cycles. It
is increasingly difficult for cities to respond to growth pressures, state and federal
mandates and the demands of community interests. The Land Use Element
encourages the continued growth of the Town Center and Auto Center, and looks to
other areas and sales tax opportunities like business-to business sales to further growth
and diversification of the retail sales tax base. Historically, the City has not relied on the
oil industry as a revenue source. Currently, the City receives less than ten percent of
its revenue from oil barrel taxes, oil business license taxes and well and tank permit
fees. Moreover, the City must maintain a staff to enforce the Signal Hill Oil Code and
respond to citizens' issues and concerns about ongoing oil field activities including
Signal Hill General Plan                     34
Land Use Element
noise, odors, and community disruption. The Land Use Element recommends
continued proactive enforcement of the Signal Hill Oil Code in order to minimize the
negative effects of the interactions of oil field activities and other urban uses.
Address Incompatible Land Uses
Incompatible land uses exist in several Signal Hill neighborhoods. Such uses, known as
nonconforming uses, may have negative impacts on the neighborhood especially
residential neighborhoods and sensitive land uses like schools and medical facilities.
The City decided against the amortization of nonconforming uses in 1988 and amended
the Nonconforming Uses Ordinance to allow the continuation of certain nonconforming
land uses including industrial uses in residential districts. Over time, new development
has replaced many nonconforming uses, but the successive re-use of nonconforming
buildings, some of which are in excellent repair and continue as profitable rental
properties, remains a difficult problem for the City.
Maintain Adequate Public Facilities and Services
During the past planning period, the City has greatly improved its public works facilities
and system of parks and trails discussed in more detail in the corresponding General
Plan elements. It has greatly expanded community services including day care,
recreation and library services to the community. The City's policy requires that
residential, commercial and industrial developers pay a fair share for capital
improvements that benefit their projects and the community. However, the ongoing
maintenance of these facilities and the costs of providing community services remain a
major fiscal challenge for the City. When possible the City encourages that new
developments establish homeowner's association to maintain landscaping, private
streets and other neighborhood amenities. Security is also an issue for both residential
and commercial neighborhoods where gated neighborhoods and private security
services can help relieve public policing costs.
Flooding
The former Pacific Electric Railroad right-of-way along the southerly boundary of the
City may be subject to inundation during a major flood event according to official federal
flood hazard maps. Localized flooding may occur in low-lying areas where there are no
existing flood control facilities. Such facilities are installed concurrent with new
development or as part of the City's capital improvement program.
Storm Water Pollution
The City's storm water drains into the Pacific Ocean. Accordingly, all grading and
development activity must include storm water pollution protection as a primary
Signal Hill General Plan                  35
Land Use Element
consideration in order to protect ocean water quality. The type, location and intensity of
new development must be controlled by effective storm water management and
protection measures. The City may benefit from two major retention basins located in
vicinity of Signal Hill, Hamilton Bowl located at Walnut and 20 th Street and the California
Bowl located near the intersection of Orange Avenue and Spring Street. These
facilities are viewed as major resources in devising solutions to storm water run-off
issues including contamination and water borne trash.
Schools
One major issue for the City is whether to form a school district separate from the Long
Beach Unified School District. The City will soon decide this issue because the District
has been unresponsive to the City's concerns about education, the concentration of
elementary schools in Signal Hill, and the conversion of neighborhood schools into
schools serving larger regions of the District. The future use of the Academy property
on the southwest corner of Cherry Avenue and 20 th Street is of interest to the City
because full development of the property may impact the Civic Center Neighborhood.
Likewise the City has interest in the District's plan for its ten-acre property at the
southeast corner of Obispo Avenue and Hill Street.

V Growth Concept
The year 2010 growth concept builds upon the "moderate" growth alternative adopted
in the 1986 Comprehensive General Plan and 1989 Land Use and Housing Element
Updates. The moderate growth alternative provides the basis for updating the General
Plan and developing goals and policies. Table 6 displays the 1989 moderate growth
alternative, actual growth during the past planning period, and predicted growth for four
land use categories; residential (population), commercial (retail), industrial and quasi-
public (parks). The purpose of reviewing growth alternatives is to establish a framework
for decision making related to allocation of land use designations on the land use map
in order to provide a desirable distribution and adequate opportunities to accommodate
the moderate growth alternative.

VI Land Use Map
The Land Use Map (Figure 3) displays the general pattern and boundaries of land use
designations, but does not specify the timing or phasing of future development which is
a function of the marketplace. A meandering line is intentionally used to show
boundaries between land use designations. The Land Use Map is a general guide to
the amount of land and the boundaries of land use types, but should not be substituted
for the Zoning Map. Table 8 displays the general land use distribution, acres in each
land use category including streets and highways, and the percentage of the total city in
each category.

Signal Hill General Plan 41
Land Use Element
The following text describes the purpose of the land use designations, the intended
character for new development and the density or intensity of development. There are
three residential, six commercial and industrial, and two miscellaneous land use
designations; open space and public institutional. A maximum dwelling unit density is
specified for each of the three residential designations (Low, Medium and High
Density). A mix of residential densities may be permitted in any area consistent with its
residential land use description, but the maximum residential density shall not be
exceeded within an area or in an individual development project. However, the
maximum residential density may be exceeded in an affordable housing development
that provides housing for low or very-low income households. When necessary to
implement land use element goals and objectives, lower densities may be required.
Examples of when circumstances may warrant lower densities include severe
topography, earthquake fault zones and other hazardous conditions.
1.1 - Low Density Residential (less than ten dwelling units per acre)
The Low-Density Residential category allows single-family detached dwellings on
individual lots, and in the Hilltop Area attached dwellings containing two to four units.
Developed areas of the City that are designated as Low-Density Residential include
California Crown located at Temple Avenue and 20 th Street and portions of the
Southeast Neighborhood located south of 21 st Street. Vacant Low-Density Residential
areas include the following:
    Bixby Ridge - remaining vacant land located along Hathaway Drive north and south
    of Hill Street.
    Ten-acre parcel - located north of 21st Street and west of Obispo Avenue.
    Crescent Heights - located between Walnut and Rose Avenues and Creston and
    25th Streets. It is recommended that the Crescent Heights area is designated a
    Historic District the boundaries of which are shown on Figure 4.
    Hilltop Area - remaining vacant areas with the exception of Area I-B located at Ohio
    Avenue and Skyline Drive that is designated for high-density development.
    Four acre parcel - located at the southwest corner of 21st Street and Temple
    Avenue.
    Ten acre oil field parcel - located northwest of Obispo Avenue and 20th Street.
    North Slope of Signal Hill - the current zoning allows for the development of 120
    dwellings (4 per unit buildings) on approximately 35 acres of hillside land. The
    Sierra Club, the City and the property owner are discussing an alternative plan to
    establish an open space conservancy on the North Slope.
Development standards for the Low-Density Residential land use category are defined
by specific plans or by zoning districts including:(SP-2)-Hilltop Area Specific Plan, (SP-
5)-California Crown, and (SP-9)-Bixby Ridge, (RL)- Residential Low Density, RLM-2) -
Residential Low Medium Density, and (PD-2)- Planned Development Area-2. The PD-2
zoning standards assign density according to the quality of project design.
Interpretation of the PD-2 standards is confusing and it is proposed that the designation
be revised to another residential zoning district designation.
Signal Hill General Plan                   42
Land Use Element
1.2 - Medium Density Residential (10 - 20 dwelling units per acre)
The Medium-Residential Density land use category includes most land in the North End
and West Side Neighborhoods that are largely developed with a mix of lower density
single family detached dwellings and medium density multi-family development. Vacant
Medium-Residential Density land is found scattered among existing developed parcels.
New development may include single-family detached or attached duplex development
on lots zoned RLM-2 Residential Low Medium-2.
1.3 - High Density Residential (20 - 35 dwellings per acre)
The High-Density Residential land use category provides opportunities for multi-family
development including multi-story condominiums and apartments. The High-Density
Residential areas are located in the Civic Center, West Side and Hilltop Neighborhoods
where there are existing high-density residential developments. Vacant land within this
category are located in the Hilltop Area 1-B and the senior housing site in the Town
Center West located at the northeast corner of Walnut Avenue and 25 th Street. High-
density affordable housing in any configuration may be permitted subject to the Special
Purpose Housing Specific Plan.
The Commercial Land Use Categories remain unchanged from the 1989-land use plan
except that the Mixed Use category is deleted along Cherry Avenue between the City
boundary south of 19th Street and 21st Street. The Mixed Use designation is
inappropriate for the Alvarado School on the west side of Cherry Avenue designated in
this plan as Public Institutional. The remaining parcels along the east side of Cherry
Avenue are designated 1.1 Low-Density Residential consistent with the adjacent
Southeast Neighborhood.
3.1 - Town Center
The Town Center land use category is the commercial core of the City generally located
at the intersection of Cherry Avenue and Willow Street. The Town Center category
provides opportunity for large-scale retail stores, offices, entertainment and dinning as
well as neighborhood shopping centers. Vacant parcels include Town Center North
located at the northeast corner of Walnut Avenue and Willow Street and a two acre site
on the northwest corner, and the proposed Central Business District bounded by Cherry
and Gardena/Rose Avenues and Creston and 25 th Streets. New development in the
Town Center is guided by existing Town Center East and the Commercial Corridor
Specific Plans and by the Willow/Spring/Cherry Landscape Overlay District. These
plans and design guidelines promote orderly development, compatible land uses and
cohesive design primarily through the design review procedure including architecture,
landscape and sign plan review. It is recommended that the City prepare a Heritage
Square/ Central Business District specific plan for the Town Center area between 25 th
and Creston Streets and Cherry Avenue west to midway between Rose and Gaviota
Avenue. Figure 4 displays the proposed boundaries of the proposed specific plan(s) for
the Heritage Square/ Central Business District and also the Crescent Heights Historic
District.
Signal Hill General Plan                 43
Land Use Element
The Heritage Square/ Central Business District (CBD) is envisioned as a high intensity
mixed-use development that may include the following land uses; retail shops,
entertainment, fitness center, eateries including fine dining and outdoor dining and
professional or business offices. High density residential condominium flats or lofts may
be part of comprehensively designed CBD project that provides as part of the
residential development project public amenities such as a town square, park or public
viewing area. In lieu of development of a museum facility it is recommended that public
and private spaces incorporate art, photographs and artifacts that portray Signal Hill's
oil field history. The CBD should serve the community as a venue for socializing,
shopping, dining, and recreating in a high quality view-oriented urban environment.
3.2 - Commercial General
The Commercial General land use category is characterized by a variety of
miscellaneous retail and commercial service land uses including retail sales, automotive
repair, restaurants, offices, day care, nursery, technical schools and convenience
stores. The Commercial General areas are located along major arterial highways
including Wardlow Road (where the City of Long Beach controls the frontage, zoning
and business licensing), Willow Street between Atlantic and California Avenues, Spring
Street between Atlantic and California Avenues, and the Target shopping center
located in the North End neighborhood at 33 rd Street and California Avenue. Vacant
land and potential development opportunities include the northeast corner of Spring
Street and Atlantic Avenue where Home Depot is proposing to develop a new shopping
center, the Auto Center, and the Target shopping center.
3.3 - Commercial Office
The Commercial Office land use category provides for the development of professional
offices and related supportive retail and service commercial uses. Offices permitted by
this category include finance, insurance, architecture, engineering, real estate, business
support services and medical or dental. Support commercial services may include
hotels, medical laboratories, research facilities, clinics, restaurants and delis, retail drug
stores and copy centers. Vacant Commercial Office land is located along Atlantic
Avenue north of Willow Street and on Walnut Avenue north of 21 st Street. New
development in the Atlantic Avenue Commercial Office area should compliment existing
large scale medical offices including but not limited to professional or medical office in
mid to high-rise structures, hotels, medical laboratories and research facilities, clinics
and medical supply facilities and related retail and service uses. The Commercial Office
area located on Walnut Avenue south of Hill Street may provide opportunity for the
enlargement of the adjacent existing office complex.
3.4 - Commercial Industrial
The Commercial Industrial category is intended to accommodate a combination of retail
and light industrial uses. The designation applies to areas located along Willow Street
and Cherry Avenue. The Commercial Industrial designation allows for mixed-use types
of businesses such as manufacturing with retail sales of the manufactured product or
Signal Hill General Plan                  44
Land Use Element
warehousing with limited retail sales. Because the typical buildings in the Commercial
Industrial category are designed and parked for light industrial use the appropriate uses
should not overburden limited parking in the area, but should compliment the retail
business along Willow Street and Cherry Avenue. Likewise, heavy industrial uses are
not encouraged in the Commercial Industrial category.
4.1 - Light Industrial
The Light Industrial land use category is designed to accommodate a variety of light
industrial uses which are nonpolluting and which can coexist with surrounding
commercial and residential uses. Permitted uses shall include, but are not limited to,
research and development, assembly, general offices, light manufacturing not involving
excessive noise, vibrations, odors, dust or hazardous materials. Uses permitted in the
Light Industrial category include limited warehouse and distribution uses of finished
products but not transportation, storage or shipping uses involving fleets of large size
(tractor trailer) trucks. Support commercial services like delicatessens and other
eateries are allowed provided there is adequate parking. The light industrial category is
not intended for cargo container storage, fleet storage of buses, tractor-trailer size
trucks, large scale recycling, tow-truck impound yards and auto body repair or painting
businesses.
Development in the Light Industrial areas should compliment the existing modern
industrial park development with landscaped setbacks orderly parking lots, and high
quality design buildings. When light industrial development abuts commercial or
residential development special buffering or wall treatments should be incorporated into
the design to minimize incompatibilities.
4.2 - General Industrial
The General Industrial land use category provides opportunities for heavy industrial
uses that can coexist with adjacent light industrial and commercial development. A
variety of manufacturing, machine shop, auto repair (excluding auto body and paint),
warehousing and distribution, assembly, outdoor storage uses, lumber yard, roofing
yard, etc. The general industrial category may include heavy industrial uses subject to
conditional use permit approval such as, but not limited to large recycling centers,
hazardous waste management facilities, concrete ready mix plants, outdoor storage
yards, oil field service equipment storage yards, lumber yards, contractors' storage
yards and manufacturing and assembly. Conditionally permitted uses shall be required
to demonstrate that they can operate safely and compatibly with surrounding existing
and planned land uses and that they can mitigate environmental impacts including, but
not limited to; noise, vibration, smoke, odor, dust, glare, radiation or other
environmental impacts. Certain heavy industrial uses are not be permitted including
petroleum refining, bulk storage of petroleum products, waste water treatment, bulk
storage or processing, cargo container storage yard, tractor-trailer size truck storage
yard, transportation vehicle storage yard or repair facility, auto body shop with or
without painting, forge or foundry, raw materials processing, and meat, fish or poultry
Signal Hill General Plan                  45
Land Use Element
processing. The evaluation of conditionally permitted land uses in the General
Industrial area shall consider how well the proposal addresses the aesthetic impacts on
the surrounding community by incorporating landscaping, high quality architecture and
setbacks into the site design.
OS - Open Space
The Open Space category includes public parks, trails and privately owned
trails/enhanced walkways when the general public has access to the use of the
trail/enhanced walkway recorded as a pedestrian easement. The 1986 General Plan
combined a discussion of Open Space and Conservation into one Environmental
Resources element. In 1989, the City adopted a Parks and Recreation Master Plan
and incorporated that document into the General Plan by reference. The Parks and
Recreation Master Plan was revisited in 1998 and its goals and objectives reaffirmed as
still relevant. A 2000 Community Needs Assessment also supported the Master Plan
concepts and also recommended establishing the PI - Public Institutional land use
designation for schools and non-recreation public facilities.
PI - Public Institutional
The Public Institutional land use category is for public school sites; institutions, utility
facilities and public buildings formerly included in the open space land use category.
The intent of the Public Institutional category is to improve the open space calculation
that was overstated in previous general plans. There are four existing school sites
within the City far more than necessary to serve the neighborhood populations in
vicinity of the schools. New Public Institutional development should reflect the public
interest in high quality durable architecture and landscaping to compliment existing
surrounding development.

VII Special Management Areas Map
Natural and man-made environmental features will impact the ultimate use of the
remaining vacant land in the City of Signal Hill. Development without special
precautions in these areas could result in the loss of life and property. For this reason,
the Special Management Areas Map (Figure 5) identifies the location and general
extent of special features and this section provides general guidelines for consideration
prior to development of these areas.
Geologic Study Area
The California State Geologist collects data concerning the location and sensitivity of
the state's earthquake faults, and publishes seismic safety maps pursuant to the
Alquist- Priolo Geologic Hazards Act. Within the special studies zone identified by the
State Geologist certain precautions must precede development: Structures for human
occupancy must not be constructed across an actual surface expression of an active
fault. A site-specific geologic study must be prepared during the plan review period to
determine the precise location of active faults. Proposed buildings must be set back a
minimum of 50 feet from an active fault. The set back increases when fill conditions are
proposed. All structures must be designed in accordance with the most current
adopted Uniform Building Codes and all grading plans must be designed in accordance
with the Uniform Grading Codes.
Noise Impact Areas
Certain areas along major arterial highways or under the flight path of aircraft are
considered noise impact areas. These areas are defined in more detail in the Noise
Element of this General Plan. New development within a noise impact area must
conform to certain standards including the following: Residential structures must be
designed to conform to Title 25 of the State of California Housing and Community
Development Law. An acoustical study must be prepared for all residential structures
proposed within a noise impact area as defined by Title 25 of the State Government
Code. Structures must be designed to mitigate noise to acceptable standards per Title
25.
Petroleum Production Areas
Most vacant land in the City is vacant because it is part of the extensive "secondary
recovery" oil filed project that requires multiple well locations for petroleum and gas
extraction and water injection. Pipelines transport gas and a mixture of petroleum and
water from the production wells to centralized processing facilities where the water is
separated and recycled back into the oilfield at injection well sites. Further refining of
the petroleum occurs outside of the City because there are no refineries remaining in
town. Petroleum production is anticipated to continue during the planning period.
There are approximately 485 wells scattered throughout the City, therefore there is

Land Use Element
Figure 5 - Special Management Areas Map
Signal Hill General Plan            49
Land Use Element
increasingly potential for conflict between oil production activities and other urban uses.
Periodic well servicing activities may continue for several days and disrupt the peace
and quiet of the surrounding neighborhood. Moreover, petroleum spills and splattering
has the potential to damage property and furtive gas leaks, though rarely combustible,
are odorous and affect local air quality. In sensitive hillside locations the oil field
pumping units may also have view impacts. Accordingly, development in oil production
areas must consider the following: Irrespective of property lines, new structures must
conform to the setback requirements of the Uniform Fire Code. The design of all
projects must consider the preservation of access to wells and easements for pipelines
and oil field utilities. All wells including active, inactive or abandoned wells must be
considered during the plan review process and wells must be abandoned, re-
abandoned or improved to conform to the State of California, Department of
Conservation standards. When feasible, oil production facilities may be integrated into
new development projects. Pumping units shall be painted and landscaped to soften
visual impacts. Operating agreements (Joint Use Agreements) that allow for the
continuation of oil production activities in both residential neighborhoods and parking
lots of retail centers and provide for the continuation of petroleum recovery activities
while putting valuable land into compatible productive urban uses are recommended for
all new development in the oil field.
Scenic Vistas
The view from the hilltop is a valued public resource that must be preserved for the
benefit of the community and the general public. The Hilltop Area Specific Plan
recognizes the importance of preserving the public view and prohibits the construction
of new dwellings that may interrupt the current unobstructed views from the Hilltop,
Sunset View or Discovery Well Parks. Homeowners are also interested in preserving
the view from their private dwellings and the purchase price of hillside housing often
includes a "view premium". The City has adopted a View Policy and in the Hilltop Area
Specific Plan, a View Ordinance, that attempts to balance existing residents' views and
the property owners' right to develop vacant property in accordance with the Hilltop
Area Specific Plan or other zoning standards. Through careful planning and analysis of
the specific site and the affected views, new structures in hillside areas shall be
designed and located where they have the least impact on existing views from private
dwellings.

VIII Goals and Policies
Signal Hill residents, businesspersons and community leaders success in preserving
the community's character and the features that make Signal Hill such a desirable place
to live and do business has required a thoughtful approach to the land use decision
making process. The community has worked diligently to create a clear sense of
priorities and direction expressed here as Signal Hill's land use goals and policies.
GOAL 1 - Manage growth to achieve a well-balanced land use pattern that
accommodates existing and future needs for housing, commercial and industrial
land, open space, and community facilities and services, while maintaining a
healthy, diversified economy adequate to provide future City revenues. Goal 1
expresses the community desire to continue with a managed growth scenario to provide
development opportunities for a variety of urban uses so long as the combination of
land uses includes new or expanded revenue streams that support the public
infrastructure and services needed for a growing community.
GOAL 2 - Ensure that new development is consistent with the City's circulation
system, availability of public facilities, existing development constraints, and the
City's unique characteristics and natural resources. Goal 2 expresses the
importance of the interrelationship between all of the General Plan elements and
recognizes limitations on growth may be necessary due to the capacity of the circulation
system and other public facilities or development constraints including natural
conditions like the earthquake fault zone or steep slopes.
GOAL 3 - Assure a safe, healthy, and aesthetically pleasing community for
residents and businesses. Goal 3 recognizes that the community values public safety
through design and support of police services, the importance of a healthy environment
through building and safety codes, heath and fire and pollution regulation, and an
aesthetically pleasing environment through site plan and design review and landscaping
standards and the maintenance of private and public lands and facilities.
GOAL 4 - Ensure that future land use decisions are the result of sound and
comprehensive planning. Goal 4 states the community's intent to be actively involved
in the planning process including regional planning issues. Public participation in the
development review process is encouraged and facilitated through community
workshops and public hearings. Public officials participate in regional planning through
the Gateway Council of Governments and the Southern California Association of
Governments and professional organizations that promote regional solutions to local
issues.
The four land use goals are restated below and given greater clarity through policy
statements designed to further explain the goal and facilitate and support future
decisions that will be made during the development review process. The policies are
used to support staff recommendations for or against future development related
decisions.

to allow more percolation of storm water runoff into the ground
Policy 3.20 - Minimize to the extent practicable, the amount of storm water directed to
impermeable areas and to the municipal separate storm water system. Build storm
water pollution prevention systems into all development projects including maximizing
landscaped areas and providing areas for storm water storage and sedimentation.
Policy 3.21 - Require new projects to include permanent controls to reduce storm water
pollutant loads from development sites including parking lots to the maximum extent
practicable.

GENERAL PLAN
I.     INTRODUCTION
    A. Purpose and Scope
    The Noise Element of the Signal Hill General Plan provides goals, policy direction, and
    implementation measures intended to limit the community’s exposure to excessive noise levels. This
    element includes:
        •    A discussion of the regulatory framework impacting noise elements, including applicable local,
             State, and federal regulations;
        •    A discussion of major local noise sources, how noise is measured, and how it can be mitigated;
             and
        •    A list of goals, policies, and implementation measures that will serve to effectively reduce
             negative noise impacts throughout Signal Hill.
    To assist the reader, definitions of terms used throughout this document are provided in Table 1, Noise
    Element Definitions.
TABLE 1      Noise Element Definitions
Abbreviation   Term                                     Definition
               Ambient Noise                            The composite of all noise sources; the normal or existing
                                                        level of environmental noise in a given location.
CNEL           Community Noise Equivalent Level         A 24-hour average Leq with a 10 dBA weighting added during
                                                        the hours of 10:00 pm and 7:00 am and a 5 dBA weighting
                                                        added during the hours of 7:00 pm to 10:00 pm to account
                                                        for noise sensitivity in the evening, nighttime, and early
                                                        morning.
dB             Decibel                                  The standard measurement of sound, measured on a
                                                        logarithmic scale. An increase of 3 dB represents a doubling
                                                        of sound energy levels.
dBA            Decibel, A-weighted                      A measurement unit which weights sounds based on
                                                        frequency in a manner similar to that of the human ear.
Ln             Noise level percentile                   The sound level exceeded by n percent of the noise
                                                        measurement duration. For example, L10 indicates that 10
                                                                                                    Circulation Element 1

                                                          percent of the noise measurements exceeded this level.
Leq            Equivalent Energy Noise Level              The average acoustic energy content of noise for a stated
                                                          period of time. Thus, the Leq of a time-varying noise and that
                                                          of a steady noise are the same if they deliver the same
                                                          acoustic energy to the ear during exposure.
               Intrusive Noise                            That noise which intrudes over the existing ambient noise at
                                                          a given location. The relative intrusiveness of a sound
                                                          depends on its amplitude, duration, frequency, time of
                                                          occurrence, and other factors, as well as the prevailing noise
                                                          level.
Lmax           Maximum Noise Level                        The highest noise level reached during a noise event.
SENEL          Single Event Noise Exposure Level          A measure of the highest noise level during a noise event
                                                          and the duration of the event.
     B. The Noise Environment
     Sound is created when objects vibrate and produce pressure variations that move outward into the
     surrounding air. The main characteristics of these air pressure waves are amplitude (loudness) and
     frequency (pitch). Amplitude is measured using decibels (dB). Human sensitivity to sound amplitude is
     frequency-dependent; A-weighted decibels (dBA) account for this variation in sensitivity. Additionally, a
     measurement called Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) is used to modify dB and dBA
     measures to allow for increased sensitivity to noise during evening, nighttime, and early morning hours.
     Typical noise levels for various activities are shown in Figure 1, Typical Noise Environments.

     C. Regulatory Framework
     The State of California has mandated that each city and county prepare a Noise Element as part of its
     general plan. Section 65302(f) of the California Government Code requires that the element:
         […] identify and appraise noise problems in the community. The Noise Element shall
         recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise Control and shall analyze and
         quantify, to the extent practicable, as determined by the legislative body, current and
         projected noise levels for all of the following sources:
             1. Highways and freeways.
             2. Primary arterials and major local streets.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                        Noise Element 3
GENERAL PLAN

              3. Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems.
              4. Commercial aviation, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military airport
                   operations, aircraft overflights, jet engine test stands, and all other ground facilities
                   and maintenance functions related to airport operation.
              5. Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classification yards.
              6. Other ground stationary noise sources identified by local agencies as contributing
                   to the community noise environment.
     This Noise Element identifies and evaluates current and projected future noise levels for Signal Hill,
     with a particular emphasis on noise produced by Interstate 405 (I-405, the San Diego Freeway), major
     roadways, Long Beach Airport, and oilfield operations. Noise levels, which are measured in decibels,
     are stated in terms of Community Noise Equivalent Level, and contours maps were developed in
     conformance with State-prescribed noise modeling techniques
     Noise Level Standards
     Federal, State, and local governments have various responsibilities for measuring and mitigating noise
     impacts. The following summarizes these standards.
     Federal Regulations
     The negative impacts of noise were recognized by the federal government in the Noise Control Act of
     1972, which serves three purposes:
         1. Establishing noise emission standards for interstate commerce,
         2. Assisting state and local noise abatement activities, and
         3. Promoting noise education and research.
     Federal noise policies and programs are developed by a range of agencies. A list of the agencies with
     most relevance to the City of Signal Hill is provided in Table 2, Federal Agencies with Noise Policies
     Affecting Signal Hill.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                                Noise Element 4
GENERAL PLAN
TABLE 2        Federal Agencies with Noise Policies Effecting Signal Hill
                   Agency                                                    Responsibility
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)        Regulates noise generated by aircraft and airports, including Long Beach
                                             Airport.
Federal Transit Administration (FTA)         Regulates operations of rail systems receiving federal funding, including light
                                             rail lines operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro).
                                             Regulates transit noise, including Long Beach Transit buses.
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)        Regulates freeways that are part of the interstate highway system, including
                                             the I-405.
Department of Labor (DOL)                    Establishes noise standards for workplaces.
Department of Housing and Urban              Establishes noise standards for federally-assisted housing projects.
Development (HUD)
     State Regulations
     State codes related to noise abatement primarily concern noise from airports, aircraft, and vehicles. A
     list of State codes related to noise is provided in Table 3, State Codes Regulating Noise.
     One of the major noise sources identified by the State is airports. California Code of Regulations
     (CCR) Title 21 requires each county in California to establish an Airport Land Use Commission
     (ALUC); the ALUC for Los Angeles County is the Regional Planning Commission. The ALUC is
     responsible for protecting public health, safety, and welfare by ensuring the orderly development of
     airports and the adoption of land use measures that minimize the public’s exposure to excessive noise
     and safety hazards within areas around public use airports.
 TABLE 3       State Codes Regulating Noise
                    Code                                                      Regulations
CCR, Title 21                                Regulates noise levels for land uses in the vicinity of airports.
CCR, Title 24                                Regulates noise insulation measures in residential construction.
(California Building Standards Code)
California Vehicle Code                      Regulates noise levels from motor vehicles.
     Local Regulations
     Noise is regulated in Signal Hill by Chapter 9.16 (Noise Ordinance) of the Signal Hill Municipal Code
     (SHMC). The Noise Ordinance establishes standards related to:
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                                         Noise Element  5
GENERAL PLAN

         •   Construction of or repairs to buildings.
         •   Vehicular and industrial noise sources.
         •   Machinery and equipment which emit noise beyond the property lines of the facility operating
             them.
         •   New residential construction near oil wells.
         •   Servicing and redrilling of existing oil wells.
     Additional noise regulation is provided in Chapters 16.16 (Drilling Standards) and 16.20 (Operating
     and Safety Standards) of the Oil Code in the SHMC.
     Noise regulations established by the City of Long Beach also affect noise levels in Signal Hill. The City
     of Long Beach has implemented an Airport Noise Compatibility Ordinance (Chapter 16.43, Long
     Beach Municipal Code) which effectively limits noise for neighborhoods in both Long Beach and
     Signal Hill. The Airport Noise Compatibility Ordinance has two major components which substantially
     limit noise impacts:
          •   Establishment of a Single Event Noise Exposure Level (SENEL) standard for non-
              governmental aircraft operating at the airport. These noise limits vary by time of day and
              runway location, with lower limits during evening and night hours and on runways whose
              flight paths have a greater impact on noise-sensitive land uses.
          •   Requiring the Airport to comply with a “noise budget,” which limits the noise contributions of
              various types of airport users.
     D. Relationship to Other Elements
     General plan elements provide important policy guidance to assist in decision-making. All of the
     elements of the general plan are related and interdependent to some degree. However, the Noise
     Element is closely related to the Land Use, Housing, Circulation, and Environmental Resources
     elements.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                           Noise Element  6
GENERAL PLAN

     The objective of the Noise Element is to provide guidelines to achieve noise-compatible land use. The
     Land Use and Noise Elements are, therefore, closely related. The noise element, by identifying noise-
     sensitive land uses and establishing compatibility guidelines for land use and noise, will influence the
     general distribution, location, and intensity of future land use. Effective land use planning can alleviate
     noise problems.
     Residential areas are one of the most noise-sensitive land uses found in the city; therefore, the Housing
     Element is directly affected by the Noise Element. The housing element policies and programs should
     include safeguards against noise intrusion. Enforcement of land use and noise compatibility guidelines
     can reduce noise impacts in residential locations. In addition, effective noise insulation in housing
     construction can mitigate exterior-to-interior noise transmission.
     The circulation system within a city is one of the major sources of noise. The existing and future
     circulation system identified in the circulation element will, therefore, greatly influence the noise
     environment. The circulation routes, such as the freeway, highways, and truck routes, should be located
     to minimize noise impacts upon noise-sensitive land uses. The location and design of new
     transportation facilities and possible mitigation of noise from existing and planned facilities will greatly
     influence the overall noise environment within the city.
     Since noise can adversely affect the enjoyment of quiet outdoor activities, the noise element is also
     closely related to the Environmental Resources Element. Open spaces can be used as a noise buffer
     between incompatible land uses. This technique can reduce community noise impacts and also provide
     usable open space for recreation and visual relief.
     E. Element Organization
     This element is organized into four sections:
     Section I, Introduction – a discussion of the purpose and scope, regulatory framework, and
     organization of this document.
     Section II, Defining and Measuring Noise – a discussion of existing noise sources in the area, noise
     measurement methods, noise sensitive receptors, and noise attenuation methods.
     Section III, Goals and Policies – goals and policies which will serve to minimize noise impacts.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                             Noise Element   7
GENERAL PLAN

     Section IV, Implementation Program – a list of specific, practical action steps that, when
     implemented, achieve the goals and policies identified in Section III.
     Section V, Enforcement – a discussion of mechanisms available to enforce the City’s adopted noises
     standards.
II. D E F I N I N G A N D M E A S U R I N G N O I S E
     A. Noise Sources
     The noise environment comprises background, or ambient, noise and intrusive noise sources.
     The following discussion of intrusive noise sources developed from an analysis of noise measurements
     and noise contours, and from discussions with City staff. The major noise sources in the Signal Hill
     vicinity, as shown in Figure 2, Major Noise Sources, include roadways, the Long Beach Airport, and oil
     drilling and maintenance operations.
     Roadways
     Roadways are one of the major sources of noise in Signal Hill. The I-405 is the most heavily trafficked
     roadway in Signal Hill, and produces the most noise. However, because the highway is placed below-
     grade where it runs through the city, and because the City successfully lobbied Caltrans to construct a
     sound wall to protect the North End Neighborhood, noise impacts on adjacent uses are reduced.
     Principal Arterial and Minor Arterial also carry significant amounts of traffic and may produce high
     noise levels. Collector and Local Streets carry much less traffic and generally do not exceed noise
     standards.

     After a significant increase in passenger travel early in the 2000s, travel has remained stable in recent
     years, ranging from approximately 2.7 million to 3.0 million passengers per year. Air cargo transport
     has similarly been stable, at approximately 46,000 to 52,000 tons per year. The number of air
     operations (arrivals and departures) can fluctuate widely from year to year, as general aviation uses are
     highly variable. The Southern California Association of Governments’ 2008 Regional Transportation
     Plan Airport and Aviation Ground Access Report forecasts that airport passenger traffic will increase to
     4.2 million passengers per year in 2035; air cargo traffic is forecast to increase from 50,000 tons per year
     to 139,000 tons per year in 2035.
     CCR, Title 21 establishes a maximum 65 dB CNEL noise exposure level around airports for sensitive
     land uses such as homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship. Airport noise contours are mapped
     by the ALUC; a map depicting Long Beach Airport’s 65 dB CNEL noise contour is provided in Figure

          Noise Element • December 2009
                                                                                                      Influence Area

     The City of Long Beach maintains an Airport Noise and Operations Monitoring System, which
     performs 24-hour monitoring of noise levels from 18 sites in the airport area. Noise violations are
     tracked, and fines are assessed to air carriers, commuter flights, charter flights, and general aviation
     aircraft which exceed noise standards established by the Long Beach Municipal Code. Complaints
     received from members of the public are also tracked and compiled by ZIP code, with monthly updates
     published on the Airport’s website. For the six-month period from December 2008 through May 2009,
     a total of 1,014 complaints were received, with only six (fewer than one percent of all complaints)
     coming from within the city of Signal Hill’s ZIP code of 90755. The small number of complaints from
     within Signal Hill suggests that airport noise is not a major concern for city residents.
     Oil Operations
     Drilling, pumping, and well-servicing operations occur throughout the city and are regulated by the
     SHMC Oil Code and Zoning Ordinance. Noise levels from these sources vary depending on the type
     and maintenance of the equipment involved. The SHMC prohibits the drilling of new wells in
     residential districts. However, existing wells and drill sites are interspersed with residential and other
     noise-sensitive land uses and wells are sometimes located close to homes. This creates potential noise
     conflicts.
     Operations
     Most pumping units operate with electric motors to reduce noise; however, occasionally, a unit may
     develop an audible annoying squeak if a lubricated joint becomes dry between scheduled maintenance
     periods. Periodic well servicing, generally lasting from three to five days, is necessary to maintain
     petroleum production but produces short-term noise disruptions. In the past, operators have been
     responsive to citizen or City complaints to service or repair noisy units. Well servicing in residential
     areas is limited to weekdays from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm. The City maintains contact information for the
     operators to facilitate repairs should a citizen complaint be filed, and oil operators’ emergency contact
     information is posted on all well enclosures. As part of the update to this Noise Element, the City
     conducted noise measurements of a typical pumping unit (Redrill Well 17-7) on August 17, 2009; the
     results of these noise measurements are presented in Table 5, Oil Derrick Noise Measurements. The
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                            Noise Element 12
GENERAL PLAN

     measurement locations shown in the table are at the boundaries of the well enclosure. Figure 4, Typical
     Oil Well Redrilling Noise Levels, graphically depicts the contours listed in the table.
     Drilling and Redrilling Activities
     Well drilling and redrilling activities are considerably noisier than typical pumping operations because
     the power source is a large, portable generator powered by an internal combustion engine. Redrilling
     noise can be perceived as intrusive to a radius of 150 feet from the rig.
     Drilling or redrilling of wells is accomplished with multiple pieces of equipment working in support of
     the drill rig itself. Drilling and redrilling generally produce the same level of noise, but redrilling takes a
     shorter period of time.
     Noise testing was performed during redrilling operations conducted at a well in the parking lot of the
     Costco/The Home Depot center located at the southeast corner of Cherry Avenue and Willow Street.
     Testing locations were along the fence of the derrick enclosure, a chain-link fence. This well is located
     in an open area, with no buildings or topographical changes impacting noise levels. The testing revealed
     that a marked variation in noise levels occurs in the vicinity of the well. Major factors influencing noise
     levels are distance from the generators and intervening barriers, such as buildings.

     Other Noise Sources
     Other noise sources impacting Signal Hill include:
         •    Commercial and industrial uses. In general, these operations and activities are not considered
              a citywide noise problem. Isolated conflicts occur where commercial and industrial uses are
              located near noise-sensitive sites. Additionally, the Noise Ordinance, Zoning Ordinance, and
              other portions of the SHMC provide standards that limit noise production from commercial
              and industrial uses.

         •    Construction. Construction noise can be annoying to noise-sensitive land uses; however,
              construction noise is typically short-term. The Noise Ordinance generally restricts construction
              to weekdays between 7:00 am and 6:00 pm.
     B. Noise Measurements
     Ambient noise measurements were conducted in 1985 during the development of the Noise Element
     of the Signal Hill General Plan. These measurements focused on differentiating among areas that were
     predominately residential or commercial/industrial and those that were a mix of multiple uses. The
     1985 field survey found that suburban noise-environments in residential areas ranged from 54 to 56 dB
     Leq. More urbanized areas recorded levels ranging from 56 to 66 dB Leq. As a rule of thumb, weighted
     24-hour CNEL levels are 2 or 3 dB higher than Leq levels during the daytime. Even with this
     adjustment, any areas of the City exceeding the 65 dB CNEL noise compatibility standard for noise-
     sensitive uses were highly localized.
     An update of the now almost 25-year old field survey was conducted on June 7, 2009. As much as
     possible, each location from the 1985 survey was revisited to evaluate any historical changes in noise
     patterns. The locations of the current noise survey are summarized in Table 6, Short-Term Noise
     Measurement Locations. Each noise measurement has been assigned the same number as the 1985
     measurement at that approximate location. The results and a comparison to the 1985 survey are shown
     in Table 7, Noise Measurement Results by Site.
     Without precise documentation of the 1985 monitoring location, it is difficult to accurately determine
     historical trends in ambient noise. However, 10 of the 13 monitoring sites recorded an increase in
     noise levels in the last 25 years. The most typical increase was in the range of 1 to 3 dB. However, even
     with an increase over time, and adjusting Leq to CNEL, residential and mixed use areas have noise
     exposures considered acceptable for noise-sensitive land uses.

GENERAL PLAN

     C. Noise-Sensitive Receptors
     Noise-sensitive receptors are those uses that have associated human activities that may be subject to
     stress or significant interference from noise. Potentially sensitive uses in Signal Hill include residences,
     schools, churches, and libraries. Table 8, Noise Compatibility Criteria by Land Use, presents standards
     used by the City of Signal Hill in assessing noise compatibility. Figure 5, Community Noise Exposure
     Levels, presents more detailed criteria to assess the compatibility of proposed land uses with the noise
     environment, as developed by the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research.
TABLE 8       Noise Compatibility Criteria by Land Use
Land Use                             Compatibility Criteria
RESIDENTIAL
     Exterior                        Outdoor living areas must be mitigated to 65 dB CNEL or less.
     Interior                        Habitable rooms must be mitigated to 45 dB CNEL or less.
OTHER NOISE-SENSITIVE USES
     Exterior                        Same as residential criterion.
     Interior                        Same as residential criterion.
COMMERCIAL
     Exterior                        A noise level of 70 dB CNEL or less, or one that does not interfere with normal
                                     business activity.
INDUSTRIAL
     Exterior                        A noise level of 75 dB CNEL or less, or one that does not interfere with normal
                                     business activity.
                                     Public access areas should be 65 dB CNEL or less.
     D. Traffic Noise Levels
     The most pervasive noise source in all of Southern California is on-road traffic. The major producers of
     traffic noise in Signal Hill are the I-405 freeway and arterial roadways.
     I-405 Freeway
     Although I-405 is a major traffic noise source, it is shielded from residential and other Signal Hill noise-
     sensitive uses by grade separation, distance, and intervening structures. Noise-sensitive land uses near
     the I-405 in Signal Hill include residences in the North End Neighborhood and Burroughs Elementary

      School. The limited distance between the uses and the 405 Freeway would normally result in significant
      noise levels; however, the combination of a depressed freeway, soundwalls, and school buildings set
      back from the roadway reduce noise to satisfactory levels.
      The freeway currently carries almost 300,000 vehicles per day, of which slightly fewer than 10,000 per
      day are heavy trucks. The calculated mid-day noise level at the edge of the freeway travel lanes using the
      FHWA traffic noise model is 86 dB Leq. Measured freeway noise hum (the 90th percentile noise level,
      October 7, 2009) at various residential locations within the community were compared to the expected
      noise level that would occur in the absence of grade separation and noise barrier effects. The results are
      detailed in Table 9, Expected vs. Observed Freeway Noise Levels.

      Noise shielding of the community creates sound levels that are 10 to 14 dB lower than the level that
      would be expected without such protection. The federal noise abatement criterion for noise sensitive
      land uses is 67 dB Leq. Except at the garages on the alley adjacent to the freeway soundwall, the freeway
      noise level does not approach or exceed this threshold. Should future noise levels rise above 67 dB Leq,
      mitigations such as improved or expanded soundwalls, berms, and noise-reducing pavements may be
      introduced.
      Noise levels are logarithmically proportional to traffic volumes. It takes large changes in volumes to
      create any perceptible noise level difference. Traffic volume growth from 1995 to 2005 was from
      255,000 per day to 295,000 vehicles per day on the I-405 at Orange Avenue. This represents a +0.6 dB
      theoretical noise level increase. Projecting this change forward, and assuming that the human
      perception threshold of +3 dB as being clearly louder, it will take 50 years of traffic growth before one
      might conclude that freeway noise has increased significantly. Therefore, freeway noise does not

GENERAL PLAN
     currently significantly impact Signal Hill residents closest to the freeway, and that situation is not
     anticipated to change in the reasonable future.
     Other Roadways
     The limited noise impacts of the I-405 suggest that noise within the city derives mainly from principal
     internal roadways.
     Traffic noise levels were calculated for existing traffic volumes detailed in the Circulation Element,
     which were matched with posted speed limits on all Circulation Element roadways. The federal
     highway traffic noise prediction model (FHWA-RD-77-108) was initialized with California vehicle noise
     curves and Southern California day/night and auto/truck mixes. Consistent with projected traffic
     growth rates for the city, a 1.5 percent annual growth factor was applied for 2010 to 2030 to establish
     build-out traffic volumes. Because of the logarithmic relationship between traffic volumes and
     associated noise, future noise levels will be almost indistinguishable for the assumed rate of growth.
     Table 10, Roadway Noise Levels, summarizes existing and future traffic noise levels in terms of the CNEL
     metric. The acceptable range for noise exposure by land use is presented in Table 8.
     Table 11, Roadway Noise Impact Distances, and Figure 6, Traffic Noise Impact Distances, show that noise
     from Willow Street, Cherry Avenue, and the portion of Spring Street east of Cherry Avenue impose
     potentially substantial constraints on placement of noise-sensitive land uses directly adjacent to the
     roadways. Orange Avenue and the rest of Spring Street are only mildly noisy, with acceptable levels
     noise levels readily achieved by common noise mitigation methods such as dual-pane windows and
     enhanced exterior doorways. Noise exposure should also be considered in placement of business or
     institutional uses along Willow Street, Cherry Avenue, and Spring Street west of Cherry Avenue.
     Table 11 summarizes the required distance from the roadway centerline to achieve acceptable noise
     exposures solely via setbacks for sound propagation across a landscaped surface. Traffic noise should be
     a consideration in future development planning, but it is not a serious development constraint in
     Signal Hill with the use of reasonable mitigation.

     E. Noise Mitigation Methods
     Various noise mitigation methods may be used to minimize noise impacts on noise-sensitive receptors.
     Mitigation methods may include:
          •   Restrictions on the time and location of noise-producing activities, such as construction;
          •   Restrictions on unnecessary, excessive, or annoying noise in the city, including noise generated
              by motor vehicles, machinery, or sound amplification devices;
          •   Using sound-insulating materials in construction of noise-sensitive facilities in areas where they
              would be exposed to unacceptable levels of noise;
          •   Using site planning and the California Environmental Quality Act environmental review
              process to reduce noise impacts;
          •   Incorporating noise exposure criteria (such as shown in Figure 5) into land use planning to
              reduce future noise and land use incompatibilities; and,
          •   Continued enforcement of noise restrictions located in the Noise Ordinance, Oil Code, and
              other City regulations.

GOAL 1:      Protect the health, safety, and welfare of people living and working within the city from
             adverse noise impacts.
             Policy 1.a: The City will consider the severity of noise exposure in the community planning
                         process to prevent or minimize noise impacts to existing and proposed land uses.
             Policy 1.b: Noise-compatible commercial and industrial land uses will be planned along the I-
                         405 freeway and major roadways.
             Policy 1.c: Noise-sensitive land uses, including residential, transient lodging, hospitals and
                         long-term care facilities, educational facilities, libraries, churches, and places of
                         public assembly will not be located near major stationary noise sources.
             Policy 1.d: The City will inform those living and working within the city of the effects of noise
                         pollution and will cooperate with all levels of government to reduce or minimize
                         impacts.
             Policy 1.e: Require noise mitigation to ensure that noise-sensitive land uses are not exposed
                         to noise levels of greater than 45 dB in habitable rooms and 65 dB in outdoor
                         living areas.
             Policy 1.f: Where needed, the City will encourage the use of noise mitigation methods that
                         minimize visual impacts and maintain necessary access.

CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                           Noise Element 26
GENERAL PLAN
IV. I M P L E M E N T A T I O N P R O G R A M
     This section provides a coordinated set of action plans and programs that serve to implement the goals
     and policies described in Section III.
TABLE 12        Implementation Program
                                  Action Plans/Policies                                  Corresponding Goal/Policy
 1    Provide information to the public regarding the effects of high noise levels and               1.d
      means to reduce noise levels and their impacts.
 2    Utilize the site plan review process and California Environmental Quality Act           1.a, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f
      review of new developments to minimize impacts of noise-generating activities
      whenever feasible.
 3    Review City functions and activities to ensure that noise from concerts,                       1.a
      construction, refuse collection, and street cleaning is reduced to the lowest
      possible level.
 4    Consider the use of noise criteria in the purchase of new equipment by City                    1.a
      departments and agencies as part of bid evaluation.
 5    Encourage the federal and State governments to continue to provide standards                   1.a
      of allowable industrial noise exposure so that all workers are adequately
      protected against noise-induced hearing loss.
 6    Review the City’s noise ordinance and recommend amendments as needed.                          1.d
 7    Review the Noise Element and update, if necessary, every five to ten years.                    1.a
 8    Continue to review County and regional plans for transportation, airport                       1.a
      operation, etc. to identify the environmental impact of noise and to develop
      alternatives for the control of major noise sources on a County and regional
      basis.
 9    Work closely with Caltrans in the early stages of design modification or                  1.a, 1.c, 1.f
      expansion of State-owned highways to ensure proper consideration of noise
      impacts on the city.
10    Work with Caltrans to incorporate source noise reduction, barriers, and other                1.b, 1.f
      design elements for future freeway ramp or access alignments.
11    Continue enforcement procedures to effect compliance with Motor Vehicle                        1.a
      Code noise standards for motor vehicles
12    Review the City’s truck routes to limit to the extent practicable truck traffic in             1.a
      noise-sensitive areas.
13    Support the currently-adopted Aircraft Noise Compatibility Ordinance (Long                     1.d
      Beach Municipal Code Chapter 16.43) and noise abatement procedures for
      Long Beach Airport. Strongly oppose the establishment of flight patterns of
      aircraft over the city and relocation of runways, which would include noise
      impacts on land uses in Signal Hill.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                                  Noise Element 27
GENERAL PLAN

14    Encourage Long Beach Transit to use noise criteria as an important factor in            1.d
      their purchase of new buses.
15    Mitigate new noise sources to an acceptable exterior level of 65 dB CNEL or          1.a, 1.e
      less and an interior level in habitable rooms of 45 dB CNEL or less at existing
      noise-sensitive land uses.
16    Require an acoustical analysis report where the introduction or addition of a      1.a, 1.d, 1.e
      new noise source has the potential to result in exterior noise levels exceeding
      60 dB CNEL at a noise-sensitive location. The report must show how noise
      mitigation measures have been incorporated into the design of the new noise
      source to reduce interior noise levels at noise-sensitive locations to 45 dB
      CNEL.
17    For new residential structures to be located where the predicted CNEL exceeds      1.a, 1.c, 1.d
      60 dB (as shown on Figure 6, Traffic Noise Impact Distances), require an
      acoustical analysis assuring that the proposed design will limit exterior noise to
      allowable levels: 45 dB in any habitable room, and to the extent practicable, 65
      dB for outdoor living areas.
19    Enforce the California Building Standards Code (CCR, Title 24) for sound                1.a
      transmission between adjacent multifamily dwellings to ensure an acceptable
      interior noise level of 45 dB CNEL in habitable rooms.
21    Consider the use of reduced street widths and traffic calming to reduce                 1.g
      vehicular noise.
22    Enforce existing noise ordinance requirements for the construction of new               1.e
      single-family detached or multifamily residential dwellings within 600 feet of an
      operating well, injection well, or other appurtenant oil field equipment (SHMC
      Section 9.16.085).
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                           Noise Element 28
GENERAL PLAN
V. E N F O R C E M E N T
     Noise control programs involve federal, State, County, and City agencies, as described in Section I.B,
     above. Primary responsibility for enforcement of City regulations and guidelines lies with the
     Community Development Department and the Police Department. The Community Development
     Department enforces zoning and subdivision ordinances, applies the California Environmental Quality
     Act, and incorporates the goals, policies, and implementation measures of the Noise Element into the
     planning process. The Police Department enforces various regulations related to noise control,
     including the California Vehicle Code.
     The City of Signal Hill can achieve a noise-compatible environment through continued comprehensive
     land-use planning, including the evaluation of potential noise impacts on proposed new development
     relative to the City’s policies and implementation measures. The City’s noise compatibility objectives by
     land use are summarized in Table 8. Proposed residential and other noise-sensitive projects impacted by
     noise levels of 65 dB CNEL or greater for exterior and 45 dB CNEL for interior noise levels would
     require additional acoustical analysis and noise mitigations to achieve acceptable exterior and interior
     noise levels. Noise-sensitive land uses include residential (single- and multi-family dwellings,
     mobilehome parks, dormitories, and similar uses); transient lodging (hotels, motels, and similar uses);
     hospitals, nursing homes, convalescent hospitals, and other facilities for long-term medical care; and
     public or private educational facilities, libraries, churches, and places of assembly. The City will
     continue to require that proposals near noise-sensitive land uses include an acoustical analysis prepared
     by a qualified acoustical engineer with experience in environmental noise assessment and noise control
     design.
     The Community Development Department’s Building and Safety Division is responsible for continued
     enforcement of noise insulation standards found in the California Building Code (CCR, Title 24, Part
     2). The Division is also responsible for enforcing the Noise Ordinance, which is directed at controlling
     noise from stationary sources and its intrusion onto adjacent properties. The enforcement of the Noise
     Ordinance is an effective tool to control non-transportation noise sources.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                          Noise Element  29

CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                                           Safety Element      1
GENERAL PLAN

    B. Regulatory Framework
    The State of California has mandated that each city and county prepare a Safety Element as part of its
    General Plan. Section 65302(g) of the California Government Code (CGC) requires that a Safety
    Element provide:
        […] for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of
        seismically-induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure;
        slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence, liquefaction, and other seismic hazards
        identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8 (commencing with Section 2690) of Division 2 of the Public
        Resources Code, and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and wildland and
        urban fires. The safety element shall include mapping of known seismic and other geologic hazards. It
        shall also address evacuation routes, military installations, peakload water supply requirements, and
        minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those items relate to identified fire and
        geologic hazards. […]
    Section 65302(g)(2) of the CGC establishes additional requirements for safety elements revised in 2009
    or later. These requirements provide for the inclusion of additional information and analysis of flood
    hazards. Section 65302(g)(3) of the CGC establishes additional requirements for safety elements revised
    in 2014 or later to address the risk of fire for land classified as very high fire hazard severity zones.
    This 2016 Safety Element meets all state requirements described in the CGC and summarized above. As
    there are no military installations within Signal Hill, that topic will not be further discussed in this
    document.
    C. Relationship to Other Elements
    General Plan elements provide important policy guidance to assist in decision-making. All of the elements
    of the General Plan are related and interdependent to some degree. However, the Safety Element is
    closely related to the Land Use, Housing, and Circulation Elements.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                                      Safety Element 2
GENERAL PLAN

    The objective of the Safety Element is to provide guidelines that minimize the impacts of potential hazards
    on humans and property. Where hazard areas are identified, the Land Use and Housing Elements
    provide guidelines and standards which establish appropriate development intensities and require
    enhanced analysis and mitigation of potential risks. Similarly, the Circulation Element’s plans and
    policies take into account Safety Element recommendations to ensure fire department and other
    emergency access vehicles can access fire-prone areas.

GENERAL PLAN

    II. BACKGROUND & EXISTING CONDITIONS
    A. City Profile
    The City of Signal Hill (“City”) is located centrally within the southwestern coastal area of Los Angeles
    County. It is the County’s 41st city, encompassing 2.25 square miles. The City of Signal Hill was
    incorporated as a general law city in 1924 and became a charter city in 2000. Signal Hill is located four
    miles west of the 605 Freeway, three miles east of the 710 Freeway and the 405 Freeway runs through the
    northern portion of the City. Although still a producing oilfield, the City is transitioning into a diverse,
    modern community and has active oil wells co-existing adjacent to modern commercial and residential
    development. Signal Hill is a growing community with an inventory of vacant land available for
    development. The City’s population has increased from 11,016 in 2010 to 11,673, according to 2016
    State Department of Finance data. Housing data shows an increase in available housing from 4,389 to
    an estimated 4,531 between 2010 and 2016.
    B. Oilfield
    Oil operations are not common to every City, therefore a discussion of the history of the oilfield, as well
    as a summary of oil production processes is included to provide general information about the oilfield
    (related hazards are discussed in more detail in Section III). Signal Hill is within the Long Beach Oilfield.
    Oil was discovered in 1921 in the Long Beach Oilfield with the completion of “Alamitos No. 1” by Shell
    Oil Company, located at the corner of Temple Avenue and Hill Street in what is now Discovery Well
    Park, the oilfield was originally estimated to hold approximately three billion barrels of oil.
    Approximately 2,900 wells have been drilled in the Long Beach Oilfield of which approximately 2,618
    are within the City of Signal Hill. Of the wells in Signal Hill thousands were abandoned, while hundreds
    remain active and the field continues to produce both oil and gas.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                             Safety Element  4
GENERAL PLAN

                                                                                                  Source: SHPI.net
    The Long Beach Oilfield reached a peak production of 68 million barrels just two years after it was
    discovered, but continued robust production to meet wartime needs during World War II. Between 1945
    and 1958, the field gradually became depressurized and another occurrence during that time was
    subsidence. As a result of oil extraction and reduced pressure in the Wilmington Oilfield (just south of
    the Long Beach Oilfield), parts of the City of Long Beach and Long Beach Harbor, sank by as much as
    one to two feet per year. There was less subsidence in Signal Hill and the Long Beach Oilfield. In 1959,
    both the federal and state governments stepped in to address subsidence and stop the collapse. It was
    discovered that water injection could be used to re-pressurize oilfields, to arrest and ultimately correct
    subsidence. However, for water injection to succeed, each oil and gas reservoir in the field would have to
    be operated as a unit. In 1958, the Subsidence Control Act was passed to regulate water injection and to
    utilize unitization agreements as a method to share the resource. The objective of unitization is to provide
    unified development and operation of an oil and gas reservoir so that exploration, drilling and
    production can proceed in the most efficient and economical manner.
    Since the 1970s water injection has been utilized as a secondary recovery method and the Long Beach
    Oilfield continues to produce 1 million barrels of oil and 365 cubic feet of natural gas per year. The
    secondary recovery method, minimizes the risk of future subsidence resulting from oil extraction in the
    city and allows the mature field to remain an active producer. Signal Hill Petroleum, Inc. (SHPI) has been

GENERAL PLAN
     operating in the City since 1984 and is the primary oil operator in the City, SHPI is a privately owned
     California based energy company.
     As of June 2014, approximately 2,196 wells have been abandoned and/or re-abandoned and
     approximately 422 active oil or gas wells remain within the City (“active” wells include injection wells,
     production wells, and idle wells). As of October 2016, these active wells, 375 (over 88 percent) are owned
     and operated by SHPI and the remaining 47 are owned and operated by a range of 18 independent
     operators. As the City has developed into a commercial and residential environment oil and gas
     production has shifted from industrial to urban operations.
     Oil and gas wells are regulated by both the State and the City. The State Department of Conservation,
     Division of Oil Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) regulates resource capture, production and
     abandonment activities and the City of Signal Hill, Community Development Department regulates land
     use activities over and in close proximity to wells. DOGGR maintains listings, well logs and maps of all
     active and inactive wells in the State.3 The wells in Signal Hill are concentrated in a broad swath of land
     stretching from the northwest to the southeast. Oilfield operations have changed over time and as a result
     regulations continue to change in response to technological advances, understanding of geology, and
     refinement of best practices to protect public health and safety.
     Well Classifications
     Active Wells
     Active and idle wells and equipment can be below grade, at grade and above grade throughout the City.
     Wells are found in a wide range of land use districts, and sometimes share parcels with non-oil-related
     land uses including residential uses. The Signal Hill Municipal Code (SHMC) prohibits the drilling of
     new wells in residential districts. Currently, a new well could only be drilled within one of Signal Hill
     Petroleum’s seven established Consolidated Drilling and Oil Production Sites under the conditions of
     their Conditional Use Permit. As of October 2016, of the 375 Signal Hill Petroleum wells, 69 are in drill
     sites (18%), while 306 are outside drill sites (82%). Redrilling and repair work is permitted for established
     wells and occurs regularly. Below are images of active wells that can be used in oil operations today.

    Injection Wells
    Water injection involves pumping pressurized water into the oil reservoir by use of an injection well
    which moves the oil in place and recovery of the oil through the use of a production well which pulls
    both the oil and water to the surface. Water must be injected to increase oilfield pressure; a mix of water
    and oil (with a small amount of natural gas) is then pumped out of wells. Without active pumping, liquids
    stop moving and the well ceases operation. Water is injected in from 2,500 to 6,000 feet at a maximum
    pressure of 1,800 psi. Every injection well is monitored daily as to injection rate and pressure, the data is
    collected and reported to DOGGR monthly. Every injection well receives an annual inspection by
    DOGGR to review the conditions of well head and to confirm the certification of the test gauge.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                              Safety Element 7
GENERAL PLAN
                                              WATERFLOOD SYSTEM
    Idle Wells
    A well shall be deemed to be an idle well if, the well does not produce an average of two barrels of oil per
    day or one hundred cubic feet of gas per day for a continuous six months period during any consecutive
    five-year period prior to or after January 1, 1991, except that an active water injection well shall not be
    classified as an idle well. DOGGR requires operators of idle wells to test them periodically to ensure that
    no damage is occurring to oil and gas reservoirs or groundwater. An idle-well test for DOGGR may be as
    simple as a fluid-level survey or may be a more complicated well-casing mechanical integrity test. The City
    cannot require that an idle well be abandoned. Therefore, idle wells can be reactivated at any time.
    Abandoned Wells
    When a well is no longer needed, either because the oil or gas reservoir becomes depleted, or because no
    oil or gas was found (called a dry-hole), the well is plugged and abandoned. Abandonment of oil wells in
    the field began shortly after the field was discovered therefore, there are numerous abandoned oil wells
    throughout the City. Abandoned wells were typically backfilled, abandoned wells on vacant properties
    are typically unseen and require excavation to locate them and existing development in the City may be
    over or near an abandoned oil well that is below ground.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                           Safety Element   8
GENERAL PLAN
     Abandonment of an active or idle oil well is governed by SHMC Chapter 16.23 (Abandonment of Wells)
     and state law.4 DOGGR has established standards for the abandonment of wells and requires well
     operators to show that wells have been properly shut down. This includes submittal of wellbore schematic
     diagram with casing intervals and sizes, perforation locations, cement plug depths inside casing, and the
     location of the cement outside casing. DOGGR reviews and approves plugging requirements to minimize
     the potential for subsurface contamination (to oil and gas reservoirs or ground water supplies) and to
     minimize hazardous surface conditions. Prior to commencement of abandonment or re-abandonment,
     the permittee or other responsible party shall provide a copy of the DOGGR approval to abandon said
     well and obtain a City issued abandonment permit from the Oil Services Coordinator. The cost to
     abandoning or re-abandoning a well is very high, ranging from $25,000 - $100,000 and up.
                                                              ABANDONED WELL
     Products and Processing
     A mix of water and oil and small amount of natural gas is pumped out of wells. Approximately 97 percent
     of the liquid pumped from Signal Hill wells is salt water, with the remaining 3 percent mostly crude oil.
     Liquids pumped from oil wells are transported via pipeline to two processing facilities in Signal Hill. At
     these processing facilities, the water/oil mix is broken down into its constituent parts. Salt water is
     pressurized and sent to water injection wells, where it is re-injected into the oilfield. Crude oil is sent via
     pipeline to refineries throughout Southern California. Wells are also connect to a gas vacuum system
     pipeline and taken to a turbine or processing facility.

    Federal, State and Local Agency Oversight
    Oil operations are under the oversight of several federal and state agencies for various aspects for example,
    pipelines, transportation, vehicles, emissions, materials handling, spills, well operations are managed by
    different agencies. A list of various agencies and areas of oversight for oil operators is provided in Table

    Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources
    The Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources was formed in 1915 to address the needs of the
    state, local governments, and industry by regulating statewide oil and gas activities with uniform laws and
    regulations.
    DOGGR is charged with implementing Section 3000 of the Public Resources Code. With oversight of the
    drilling, operation, maintenance, and abandonment of wells and the operation, maintenance, and
    removal or abandonment of tanks and facilities attendant to oil and gas production, including pipelines
    that are within an oil and gas field, so as to prevent, as far as possible, damage to life, health, property,
    and natural resources; damage to underground oil and gas deposits from infiltrating water and other
    causes; loss of oil, gas, or reservoir energy, and damage to underground and surface waters suitable for
    irrigation or domestic purposes by the infiltration of, or the addition of, detrimental substances.
    Every oil, gas, or geothermal well drilled in California has information about that well such as the history
    of work done, permits issued, inspections made, and well logs run called a well record. The DOGGR
    District 1 office maintains well records for wells in Signal Hill. DOGGR well records are open to public
    inspection.
    City Regulatory Oversight
    In 1942, the first Signal Hill Oil Code was adopted and it was significantly revised in 1964. In 1990, the
    City convened an Oil Code Committee to initiate another comprehensive update to the 1964 Oil Code.
    The 1990 Oil Code regulated the following: drilling of new wells, re-drilling of existing wells and
    abandoning wells; waterflood injection; location of drill sites; noise standards; surface mitigation measure
    recommendations; methane gas venting; property maintenance; landscaping; development constraints;
    and, vehicular access for oilfield equipment.
    The City’s 1990 code required developers or property owners intending to develop, to first obtain written
    approval (i.e., certification letter and stamped site plans) from DOGGR documenting compliance with

GENERAL PLAN

    the provisions of the Construction Site Plan Review Program (CSPRP) prior to issuance of a grading,
    building permit, or development permit whichever should occur first in the City’s entitlement process.
    In 2010, DOGGR abruptly changed the CSPRP, and discontinued the process of providing a
    certification letter along with the option of an equivalent standard for well abandonments. In addition,
    DOGGR discontinued conducting the leak testing that had been the practice in District 1. Because of
    the City’s Oil Code strict reliance upon the DOGGR certification process and the subsequent
    certification letter, the City was left with an obsolete Oil Code with respect to the determination to build
    over an abandoned well. This created an extreme hardship for the City in that no development permits
    could be issued for properties with abandoned wells until the Oil Code was amended.
    In order to replace the previous DOGGR certification letter review process with safe and responsible
    City standards, the City conducted special technical studies on past and present oil operations, collected,
    collated and analyzed thousands of documents dating back nearly two decades. The contents of the
    studies and details of the current oil code are discussed above.
    In 2015, the City’s Oil Code was amended. One amendment was to the title. The new title is the Oil and
    Gas Code, which recognizes the additional gas resource in the field even though the prominent regulatory
    resource is oil and that it is also regulated by the SHMC. Additional updates reflected changes to the
    standards and procedures for well surveys, leak testing and venting, and establish regulations for
    development on properties with abandoned wells. Site restoration requirements for well abandonments
    were added and an equivalency standard related to the City’s authority regarding development over and
    in close proximity to abandoned wells was established. In addition, all development projects in the city
    would be required to conduct a methane assessment and the results of each assessment would dictate the
    need for any methane mitigation systems. The sections of the old Oil Code related to drilling of new
    wells, re-drilling of existing wells and abandoning wells; waterflood injection; location of drill sites; noise
    standards; property maintenance; and landscaping remained in place.
    Per the Oil and Gas Code, at least one time per year, the City Oil Services Coordinator inspects the wells
    and well sites for compliance with the provisions of the City Oil and Gas Code. In the event a violation
    is found, the inspector shall provide notice to the operator and the operator shall have thirty days from
    the date of the notice to correct the violation.

      Peakload Water Supply Requirements
      The City Water Department provides water for domestic and fire-fighting purposes for the entire City.
      Currently, water supplies are via two City operated groundwater production wells (Well #7 and #8),

    located in the North Long Beach area. The City can also receive imported water from a connection with
    the Metropolitan Water District regional water transmission system. Water storage is provided from three
    storage reservoirs, with water delivery to higher pressure zones achieved from three booster pump stations.
    The Gundry Reservoir and pumping facility was constructed in 1929 and has a storage capacity of 4.7
    million gallons. This facility is located in the northern part of the City at Reservoir Park. Two hilltop
    reservoirs and pumping facilities (one below Hilltop Park and the other on Temple Avenue, south of
    Skyline Drive) were constructed in the late 1990s and have a combined storage capacity of 2.6 million
    gallons. In addition, the City can also receive up to 3,350 gallons per minute of imported water supply
    from a service connection (CENB-19) to the Metropolitan Water District. The existing reservoirs,
    pumping facilities, and imported water supply are adequate for the City’s projected growth and no further
    expansion of the system is considered necessary to meet peakload demands.
    LACoFD has reviewed and approved the fire storage and fire flow requirements for the various land use
    categories throughout the City. As part of the 2005 Water Master Plan, an analysis of both fire storage
    and fire flow was conducted. The results indicate that there is adequate fire storage within the City’s
    water system to meet LACoFD requirements. The fire flow analysis results indicate that the water system
    as a whole is adequate to meet the required fire flow demands approved by LACoFD. The analysis did
    identify some specific locations where fire flow inadequacies may exist within the water system. These
    locations are identified in the 2005 Water Master Plan and are mostly related to the existence of dead-
    end water mains. The an update to Water Master Plan (2015) is currently being reviewed and will be
    adopted by the City Council in the near future. The 2015 plan provides a plan for the City’s water system
    over the next 10 years.
    To improve existing infrastructure and reliability the 2011/12 through 2015/16 Capital Improvement
    Plans included notable water projects such as:
            The dead-end water main at 20th Street and Alamitos Avenue was eliminated.
            An emergency interconnection with the Long Beach Water Department was constructed at
             Reservoir Park. The interconnection would provide an imported water supply to the Reservoir
             treatment plant, in the case of an emergency affecting water Wells #7 and #8 groundwater supply.
            In 2015, construction of water Well #9 project began. The Well is within the City and expected
             production capacity of 1.725 million gallons per day. The Well is equipped with nano-filtration

               treatment to treat naturally occurring constituents in the groundwater. Well #9 is expected to be
               operation in December 2016 and will provide the needed water demand to service the City with
               imported water serving as an emergency back-up.
     Police Protection
     Police protection in Signal Hill is provided by the Signal Hill Police Department (SHPD). As of 2016,
     the SHPD has 34 sworn officers and 19 civilian staff (14 full-time and 5 part-time) operating from one
     station located at 2745 Walnut Avenue. The police station is 21,500-square-feet and includes a fully
     functional Emergency Operations Center (EOC). (See Figure 1.)
     Mutual aid agreements are in place with the Long Beach Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s
     Department, and other regional law enforcement agencies. These agreements allow for assistance from
     other agencies in the event of a major crime or natural disaster that could not effectively be handled with
     the resources available to the SHPD. Nearby police stations are listed in Table 3.

    Disaster Preparedness
    The Signal Hill Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) provides detailed guidance to emergency service
    providers, City staff, and elected officials on actions required to maximize the City’s preparedness for
    disaster, and to react effectively when disasters occur. The 2015 EOP updated the 2011 EOP document
    and was harmonized with the current California Emergency Management Agency template. The 2015
    Signal Hill EOP is in full compliance with state requirements for content and scope. It has three goals:
         ■    To provide effective life safety measures and reduce property loss.
         ■    To provide for the rapid resumption of impacted businesses and community services.
         ■    To provide accurate documentation and records required for cost recovery efforts.
    The Chief of Police is responsible for the coordination of training events and exercises in support of the
    EOP, and for coordinating and disseminating annual reviews and updates to the document.
    In addition, Signal Hill attempts to minimize the potential impacts of natural and man-made hazards
    through its Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP), which is being updated concurrently with the 2016 Safety
    Element. The HMP has five goals: to protect life and property, enhance public awareness, preserve natural
    systems, encourage partnerships and implementation, and strengthen emergency services. To do this, the
    HMP analyzes hazards that occur within the City and establishes a mitigation plan including short- and
    long-term actions which should be implemented to reduce risk. A range of hazards are assessed in the
    plan, and four hazards considered most likely to impact the City were analyzed in greater detail:
    earthquakes, landslides, windstorms, and drought. The mitigation plan discusses potential funding
    sources and assigns responsibility for the accomplishment of each mitigation measure. The HMP remains
    a relevant and vital document through annual reviews and plan revisions every five years. The Hazard
    Mitigation Plan and all policies and programs contained therein, is incorporated in Appendix A. In
    addition, the HMP serves as one of implementation programs of the Safety Element
    Both the HMP and EOP analyze risks to critical and essential facilities in the City. The HMP also includes
    mitigations which would reduce these risks. Critical facilities are defined as those necessary for
    government response and recovery activities, generally including 911 dispatch facilities, EOCs, schools
    hosting shelters, police and fire stations, public works facilities, local communications centers, hospitals,
    bridges and major roads, and shelters. In addition, the City of Signal Hill considers high-occupancy
    facilities such as shopping centers and high-risk facilities such as reservoirs and hazardous materials sites

GENERAL PLAN

      to be critical facilities. Essential facilities are those facilities that are vital for the continued delivery of key
      city services or that may significantly impact the City’s ability to recover from a disaster. These facilities
      generally include jails, public services buildings not considered critical facilities, and schools which do
      not house shelters. Table 5 lists critical facilities (excluding roadways and bridges) identified by the EOP.

     Similar to the local HMP adopted by the City of Signal Hill, an All-Hazard Mitigation Plan (updated
     February 2014) has been adopted by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. This plan analyzes
     risks and provides mitigations for unincorporated areas throughout the county, as well as for County-
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                     Safety Element 20
GENERAL PLAN

    provided services utilized by incorporated cities. As Signal Hill contracts for fire protection services with
    the County, risk analysis and mitigation for such services are covered by the County-adopted plan.
    Emergency Operations
    The EOP describes the City’s emergency response and recovery operations. Emergency operations are
    managed in one of three modes, depending on the magnitude of the event:
        ■    Level One — Decentralized Coordination and Direction. A minor to moderate incident
             wherein local resources are adequate and available. A local emergency may or may not be
             proclaimed. The EOC may or may not be activated. Off-duty personnel may be recalled.
        ■    Level Two — Centralized Coordination and Decentralized Direction. A moderate to severe
             emergency wherein local resources are not adequate and mutual aid may be required. Key
             management level personnel from the principal involved agencies will co-locate in a central
             location to provide jurisdictional or multi-jurisdictional coordination. A local emergency will be
             proclaimed. The EOC should be activated. Off-duty personnel may be recalled.
        ■    Level Three — Centralized Coordination and Direction. A major local or regional disaster
             wherein resources in or near the impacted area are overwhelmed and extensive state and/or
             federal resources are required. A local emergency will be proclaimed. All response and early
             recovery activities will be conducted from the EOC. All off-duty personnel will be recalled.
    As discussed under Police Protection, above, the EOC component of the police department serves as a
    centralized location for emergency and disaster management.
    Signal Hill Municipal Code (SHMC) Chapter 2.76 (Emergency Organization and Functions) creates a
    Disaster Council to develop emergency and mutual aid plans and agreements. The Disaster Council
    consists of the Mayor, Director of Emergency Services, Assistant Director of Emergency Services, and
    other members as determined by the City Council. It is responsible for the preparation of the EOP that
    provides for the mobilization of resources in emergency situations. The City Manager serves as Director
    of Emergency Services. The Director of Emergency Services is authorized to direct emergency organization
    within the City, request the proclamation of an emergency by the City Council or the Governor, and

CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                            Safety Element  21
GENERAL PLAN

    Signal Hill’s emergency management programs maintain compliance with the federally-mandated
    National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the state Standardized Emergency Management
    System (SEMS) through regular training and disaster preparedness exercises for employees and the
    community. SEMS (Title 19, Division 2 of the Code of California Regulations) requires local
    governments within each county be organized into a single operational area for the purposes of emergency
    management. Signal Hill is part of the Los Angeles County Operational Area, which is managed by the
    Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management (LACOEM). This Operational Area is further
    divided into eight Disaster Management Areas. Signal Hill is part of Disaster Management Area F, which
    also includes the cities of Long Beach and Avalon. The Disaster Management Area Coordinator (DMAC)
    for Area F is the Long Beach Fire Department Disaster Management Bureau, which is based out of the
    City of Long Beach EOC (located 0.5 mile northeast of Signal Hill at 2990 Redondo Avenue). The
    DMAC represents the region at operational area, regional, and state meetings and events.
    The Los Angeles County Operational Area Citizen Corps Council is a volunteer component of the
    LACOEM and operates with support from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
    Citizens Corps Councils help coordinate volunteer activities that make communities safer and better
    prepared to respond to emergency situations.
    Community Organizations, Volunteer Groups, and Safety Programs
    A range of community organizations, volunteer groups, and safety programs are in place to assist with
    public safety and emergency management in the City. Among these are:
         ■   Citizens’ Police Academy. The SHPD offers the Citizens’ Police Academy, a program taught by
             police officers and staff members and which gives an inside look at law enforcement in the
             community. Attendees learn about patrol operations, criminal law, narcotics enforcement,
             investigative techniques, crime prevention, emergency dispatch procedures, the court system, and
             many other areas of law enforcement.
         ■   Explorer Post 806. The Explorer Post is a youth-oriented program sponsored by the
             SHPD. Members of the Explorer Post receive basic instruction in all phases of law enforcement,
             including crime prevention, investigation, fingerprinting, drug and narcotics recognition, first
             aid, Vehicle Codes, Penal Codes, juvenile crimes, truancy, and other related fields. The basic
             program emphasizes good citizenship and high moral character.

GENERAL PLAN

         ■   Community Emergency Response Team (CERT). CERT members assist citizens and police,
             fire, and medical professionals during major disasters. The SHPD, in conjunction with the
             LACoFD, offers CERT training to the public. Training is free of charge and provided in
             emergency preparedness, fire safety, light search and rescue operations, medical operations,
             disaster psychology, and disaster simulation.
         ■   Community Volunteer Program. The SHPD recruits community volunteers to support police
             services. Volunteers receive classroom training, field training, and in-service training, and assist
             with functions such as parking enforcement, vacation watch, speed watch, clerical
             functions, bicycle registration, fingerprinting services, and newsletter creation.
         ■   Emergency Network of Los Angeles. This network consists of Los Angeles County nonprofit
             community based organizations that provide assistance to individuals, families, and organizations
             following emergencies and disasters. Network organizations include the American Red Cross –
             Los Angeles Region, Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, the Salvation Army, and others.
         ■   Neighborhood Watch. Neighborhood Watch programs are in effect in Signal Hill. These are
             crime prevention programs that stress education and community cooperation. Neighborhood
             Watch groups typically focus on observation and awareness as a means of preventing crime.
    Evacuation Routes
    The roadway grid in and around Signal Hill provides for multiple means of evacuation from natural,
    technological, or human-caused disasters. Arterial roadways and the I-405 freeway are major evacuation
    routes (see Table 6 and Figure 2). Dead-end streets limit movement over the I-405 in the northern part
    of the City and the former Pacific Electric Railway right-of-way along the City’s southwest boundary limit
    roadway connections in some areas. Nonetheless, the presence of numerous bridges across these barriers
    makes existing evacuation routes adequate to serve the City’s population; no major improvements are
    considered necessary to maintain emergency access. Future development in the City would be required
    to meet minimum roadway widths and subdivision design requirements as established by SHMC Titles
    15 (Building and Construction) and 18 (Subdivisions) and Los Angeles County Fire Department. These
    standards ensure that roadways are wide enough to allow emergency vehicle access during emergencies
    and permit the efficient movement of large numbers of people.

    III. ISSUES AND CONTRAINTS
    A. Seismic and Geologic Hazards
    Earthquakes
    Signal Hill is located in a seismically active region, and major regional faults create the risk of substantial
    earth shaking and potential ground rupture in the area. Within Los Angeles County, there are over 50
    active and potentially active fault segments, an undetermined number of buried faults, and at least 4
    blind-thrust faults capable of producing damaging earthquakes.
    Earthquakes present a multitude of potentially dangerous consequences that can include ground rupture,
    ground failure, and landslides. A catastrophic earthquake would severely strain the emergency response
    and recovery capabilities of federal, state, and local governments, and profoundly impact the regional and
    state economy.
    Regional Faults
    Major regional faults are displayed in Figure 3, along with the approximate epicenters of significant
    historical earthquakes.
    The San Andreas Fault is the most significant regional fault, and is recognized as being capable of
    producing an earthquake of magnitude 8.0+ on the Richter scale. In 2007, the Working Group on
    California Earthquake Probabilities projected that the Southern California segment of the San Andreas
    Fault has a 59 percent chance of producing a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake within 30 years. 6
    Despite this risk and because the San Andreas Fault is located over 40 miles from Signal Hill, smaller
    faults located closer to the City, including the Newport-Inglewood and Whittier Faults, are generally
    considered a greater risk to the area’s residents and infrastructure.
    Table 7 lists the most significant earthquakes to have impacted Signal Hill over the past century.
6 The Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities consists of the U.S. Geological Survey, California Geological
  Survey, and Southern California Earthquake Center. Their report is available at www.wgcep.org.

     Local Seismicity
     Locally, the Newport-Inglewood Fault System cuts diagonally across Signal Hill (see Figure 4). This is the
     most significant seismic feature in the area and is considered seismically active. The 1933 Long Beach
     earthquake resulted from activity on this fault (see Figure 3 for epicenter location). Within the Newport-
     Inglewood Fault System, five faults have been identified in and in the immediate vicinity of Signal Hill:
     the Cherry Hill Fault, Pickler Fault, Northeast Flank Fault, Reservoir Hill Fault, and Wardlow Fault.
     These faults are generally in a northwest-to-southeast alignment. The Wardlow Fault is a pre-quaternary
     fault that has not ruptured in at least 2 million years, and is therefore considered inactive. All other faults
     are considered active.
     The Newport-Inglewood Fault System is a nearly linear alignment of faults extending 45 miles along the
     southwestern side of the Los Angeles basin. It can be traced as a series of topographic hills, ridges, and
     mesas from the Santa Monica Mountains to Newport Beach, where it trends offshore. Structures along
     the zone of deformation act as groundwater barriers and, at greater depths, as petroleum traps.
     Continuing seismic activity has been evidenced most prominently by the 1920 Inglewood and 1933 Long
     Beach earthquakes.
     Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones
     The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act7 of 1972 was created to prohibit the location of most
     structures for human occupancy across the traces of active faults, thus lessening the hazard of fault
     rupture.
     The three main provisions of the Act:
           ■   require the California Geological Survey to produce maps of the surface traces of known active
               faults, including both the best known location where faults cut the surface and a buffer zone
               around the known trace(s);
           ■   require property owners (or their real estate agents) to disclose that their properties lie within
               identified hazard zones; and,
7 California Public Resources Code Section 2621 et seq.

GENERAL PLAN

        ■     prohibit new construction of projects, as defined by the Alquist-Priolo Act, within these
              identified hazard zones until a comprehensive geological study has been completed.
    The City of Signal Hill complies with the Act through SHMC Chapter 15.04 (Building Code). The
    SHMC requires an engineering geology report be prepared for all projects within Alquist-Priolo zones, as
    well as other areas when deemed necessary by the City Engineer. Before projects can be permitted, the
    geologic investigation must demonstrate that proposed buildings will not be constructed across active
    faults. Structures for human occupancy must be set back at least 50 feet from active faults. The evaluation
    and written report must be prepared by a registered geologist.
    Since the Newport-Inglewood Fault System is active, it has been designated as an Alquist-Priolo zone. The
    Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones within Signal Hill are depicted on Figure 4.

    Unreinforced Masonry Structures
    The typical unreinforced masonry building has brick walls with no steel reinforcing bars embedded within
    them. The Unreinforced Masonry (URM) Law8 requires cities and counties within Seismic Zone 4
    (including Signal Hill) to identify hazardous unreinforced masonry buildings and consider local
    regulations to abate risks associated with such buildings through retrofitting and demolition. The URM
    Law does not apply to the following types of structures: warehouses and similar structures not used for
    human habitation, residential structures with five or fewer dwelling units, and historical properties. The
    City of Signal Hill has completed a building inventory and determined that there are no unreinforced
    masonry structures within the City that require action under the URM Law.
    Liquefaction
    Liquefaction is a geologic process that causes various types of ground failure. Liquefaction typically occurs
    when loose, saturated sediment of primarily sandy composition is subject to strong ground shaking.
    When liquefaction occurs, the sediments involved experience a total or substantial loss of shear strength
    and behave like a liquid substance. Depending on other conditions, such as density, ground slope, and
    stratification, the temporary loss of strength may result in foundation failures, landslides, and subsidence.
    To have a potential for liquefaction, three simultaneous conditions are necessary: 1) generally
    cohesionless soils, 2) high groundwater, and 3) groundshaking. California’s Seismic Hazards Mapping
    Act provides for statewide mapping of seismic hazards based in part on an examination of these
    conditions. Mapping for Signal Hill is provided on Figure 5. As shown on the figure, only two small
    portions of the City are considered at risk from liquefaction. One area consists of a strip of land adjacent
    to and under the Columbia Street right-of-way (part of which is currently used for oil production) between
    Atlantic and California Avenues. The second area is a narrow band along the southwestern border of the
    City, adjacent to the right-of-way of the former Pacific Electric Railway. Notably, this area of liquefaction
    risk includes a large portion of the site of a Long Beach Unified School District middle school, Jessie
    Elwin Nelson Academy, (1951 Cherry Avenue). As a school district project, development on this site is
    subject to review by and required to meet the standards of the Division of the State Architect rather than
8 Government Code Section 8875 et seq.

GENERAL PLAN

    the City of Signal Hill. The Division of the State Architect maintains regulations that appropriately
    mitigate liquefaction risks on development sites.
    As required by the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act, areas at risk of liquefaction have been mapped where
    the historical occurrence of liquefaction and/or local geological, geotechnical, and groundwater
    conditions indicate a potential for future permanent, liquefaction-induced ground displacements such
    that mitigation would be required. Such mitigation would be intended to minimize seismic risks.
    Landslides
    Landslides can result from earthquake-related ground shaking or failure of steep slopes due to water
    saturation or unstable soil conditions. Landslides can overrun structures and other property, and cause
    human injury or death. They can sever utility lines and block roads, thereby hindering rescue operations
    following an earthquake. Signal Hill was most recently impacted in 1998 when a portion of steep and
    unstable natural slope below Panorama Drive eroded due to heavy El Niño rains. The Seismic Hazards
    Mapping Act requires identification of landslide zones in which the stability of hill slopes must be
    evaluated. Figure 5 outlines the areas of the City that are susceptible to landslides. Areas that previously
    experienced landslide movement and/or local topographic, geological, geotechnical, and groundwater
    conditions may indicate the potential for future, permanent ground displacements. If confirmed during
    site geotechnical analyses, site mitigation would be required.
    The areas found susceptible to landslides are found in the upper reaches of Signal Hill. Development,
    completed mostly over the past decade, is located both above and below areas at risk of landslides.
    Geotechnical analyses were prepared for these developments, and risks associated with landslides were
    mitigated to reduce their potential impacts. As shown on Figure 5, two areas remain with landslide
    potential in the City, located north of Panorama Promenade and southwest of Sunset View Park.

    Soil Settlement and Expansion
    The potential for seismic settlement to occur is based on the intensity and duration of ground shaking
    and the relative density of the subsurface soils. Figure 6 shows the geologic units present in the Signal
    Hill. Information on the characteristics of these geologic units is provided in Table 8. As shown in the
    table, the Qop soil types which dominate Signal Hill have a limited expansion potential, with moderate
    expansion potential present only in clayey sections. The Qya and Qyfa which make up the remainder of
    the City have moderate to high expansion potential. In part because of the characteristics associated with
    the Qya and Qyfa geologic units, areas with these soils are considered to have a higher potential for
    liquefaction, as was previously shown on Figure 5. Development on these geologic units may be required
    to present geotechnical analysis before approval by the City.

   Qop       Old paralic deposits (late to middle Pleistocene; include the Lakewood Formation, terrace deposits, and Palos Verdes
             sand) – In the Signal Hill area, these are composed primarily of silt and sand with scattered gravel and fossiliferous
             lenses, capped locally with a reddish-brown weathered (soil) zone of clayey silt to clayey sand. These interfingered
             strandline, beach, estuarine, and colluvial deposits are mostly poorly sorted, moderately permeable, and medium dense
             to dense. The silt and sand sections, where exposed in slope faces, are susceptible to erosion and surficial slumping;
             the clayey sections may have a moderate expansion potential. May be corrosive to concrete.
    Qya      Young alluvial floodplain deposits (Holocene and Late Pleistocene) – Composed mostly of soft clay, silt and loose to
             moderately dense sand and silty sand. These deposits are mostly poorly consolidated, poorly sorted, and permeable,
             and therefore potentially susceptible to liquefaction and differential settlement. Locally, these deposits may have a
             moderate to high expansion potential.
   Qyfa      Young alluvial fan and valley deposits (Holocene and Late Pleistocene) – Composed of clay, sand, gravel and cobbles.
             These deposits are mostly poorly consolidated and poorly sorted, and are therefore compressible, potentially susceptible
             to collapse, liquefaction, and seismically-induced differential settlement. Locally, these deposits may have a moderate to
             high expansion potential.
     --      Artificial fill (compacted and uncompacted) – deposits of various thicknesses are known to occur locally in the Signal Hill
   (Not      area but are not mapped here. These deposits are typically associated with petroleum exploration and drilling activities,
  Mapped)    grading, and construction. Fills impacted with petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals may be encountered in areas
             that were previously part of an oilfield. These deposits are mostly poorly consolidated, poorly sorted, potentially
             compressible, and may have a moderate to high expansion potential.

    Subsidence
    Subsidence is the sinking or gradual lowering of the earth's surface. Subsidence can result from either
    natural geologic and/or man-made causes. Natural geologic causes are basin-downwarp, fault movement,
    sediment compaction, and relaxation of deep earth stresses. Man-made causes include groundwater
    pumping, mining, oil and gas production, river channelization, and surface loading.
    As mentioned in the background, from about 1940 to 1960, a significant amount of subsidence (up to
    29 feet in some areas) occurred in the Port of Long Beach area due primarily to oil and gas extraction in
    the Wilmington Oilfield. In the 1960s, steps were taken that successfully prevented further subsidence
    in the Wilmington Field. The main action required was the injection of water into the areas where oil
    was removed. The Wilmington field is located much deeper underground, than the Long Beach Oilfield
    therefore, Signal Hill is not subject to the same subsidence concerns as the Port of Long Beach area.
    Nonetheless, Signal Hill Petroleum, Inc. (SHPI), which controls over 80 percent of the oil wells in Signal
    Hill and the units, uses the same strategy of injecting water into the oil formation. This minimizes the
    risk of future subsidence resulting from oil extraction in the City.
    B. Fire Hazards
    Fire hazards within Signal Hill may arise from three sources: open spaces with dry vegetation; urban
    development; and industry, particularly facilities associated with oil production, storage, and
    transportation. These fire hazards are discussed below.
    Wildland Fire
    With development over the past 15 years, much of the open space near the peak of Signal Hill has been
    developed with housing. However, some fire hazards remain in areas that have not been developed and
    are covered with natural vegetation. Vegetation in these areas generally consists of grasses which become
    dry and highly flammable during the fire season in the summer and fall.

GENERAL PLAN
     The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) has mapped fire hazard severity
     zones throughout the state.9 Designations include Unzoned (the lowest wildland fire risk), Moderate,
     High, and Very High. These designations take into account five major factors in wildland fire risk:
           ■    Vegetation: Vegetation is “fuel” for a wildfire, but it varies over time. Fire hazard mapping
                considers the potential vegetation over a 50-year horizon.
           ■    Topography: Fires burn faster on steep slopes.
           ■    Weather: Fires burn faster and with more intensity where air temperatures tend to be high,
                relative humidity low, and winds strong.
           ■    Crown fire potential: Under extreme conditions, fires burn up into trees and tall brush.
           ■    Ember production and movement: Fire brands are blown ahead of the main fire, where they
                may enter buildings and ignite. This factor measures the likelihood of an area burning over a 30-
                to-50-year time period.
     Fire hazard mapping for Signal Hill is provided in Figure 7. The City is unzoned, indicating a low
     potential for wildland fire; there are no Moderate, High or Very High fire hazard zones in Signal Hill.
     Urban Fire
     Residential development covers approximately 35 percent of Signal Hill, ranging from single-story single-
     family homes to multi-story apartment and condominium structures. According to the California
     Department of Finance, as of January 1, 2010, Signal Hill housed 1,950 single-family homes and 2,494
     units in multi-family developments.10 A significant number of single-family homes are over 60 years old,
     and are in varying states of maintenance and repair. Fire is a particular risk for these older residences;
     however, the Fire Department is generally prohibited by legal restrictions from conducting inspections
     of these homes. Multi-family development is generally newer, with few such projects over 40 years old.
     Residential development is subject to the requirements of the Signal Hill Fire Code (SHMC Chapter
     15.08), which adopts by reference the California Fire Code. The California Fire Code is updated
     periodically with new regulations intended to minimize potential fire hazards. Effective January 1, 2011,

GENERAL PLAN

     sprinklers are mandated for all new single-family homes. This requirement is intended to reduce the
     frequency and severity of house fires. It is estimated that the presence of sprinklers reduces deaths from
     fires by 83 percent.11

    Oil Fire Hazards
    Potential fire hazard associated with the oilfield is explosion or fire resulting from the ignition of
    accumulated methane gas, overheating of pumps due to mechanical failures can cause oil well fires;
    however, existing active wells pose only minor fire hazards. The liquid extracted from wells is a mixture
    of salt water and oil (with water typically composing 97 percent of the mix). This mix is substantially less
    combustible than pure oil. The water-heavy mixture, combined with required blowout prevention
    equipment, significantly reduces potential hazards from oil well fires. Some of the independent well
    operators store pumped liquids in fuel tanks on the well site. These tanks are subject to regulation and
    inspection by the state and LACoFD.
    Oil facilities are subject to the requirements of the SHMC Fire Code; in addition, to minimize fire
    hazards associated with such infrastructure, the SHMC Oil and Gas Code restricts the drilling of new
    wells in residential districts and establishes minimum building setbacks for such facilities. Other City
    policies require proper landscape maintenance and refuse removal to limit fire hazards. To further reduce
    potential fire impacts to these and other surrounding land uses, storage facilities maintain onsite fire
    suppression equipment to allow for rapid response to emergencies. Employees are trained to use
    suppression equipment until Fire Department equipment arrives. In addition, safety is ensured through
    routine inspection by local, state, and federal authorities, including the City of Signal Hill; Los Angeles
    County Fire Department; DOGGR; the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration;
    and others. SHPI, which operates over 80 percent of the wells in Signal Hill, monitors oil well activity 24
    hours per day, and wells are subject to daily physical inspection. SHPI staff and firefighters conduct
    periodic drills and walkthroughs of oil facilities.
    The 2013 Los Angeles County Fire Code section 5706.3 requires building not necessary to the operation
    of the well shall not be constructed within 100 feet of the oil well and 300 feet if the building is used as
    a place of assembly, institution or school. The Fire Code allows the Chief to approve the use of alternative
    materials and methods, provided that he finds that the proposed design meets the intent of the code and
    is at least equivalent to that which is prescribed by the Code. Due to the uniqueness of the oilfield and
    pumping operations in the City of Signal Hill, there are several alternate methods of protection approved.
    Mitigation may be provided at the well or at the structure to allow specific buildings to be constructed 35
    feet from an oil well.

GENERAL PLAN
    C. Flood Hazards
    In general, Signal Hill is not subject to flood hazards. Only a small area along the City’s southwestern
    boundary is designated as Zone X on the FEMA’s Flood Insurance Rate Map, indicating no major flood
    risk (see Figure 8). The remainder of the City is unzoned. Accordingly, there are no special flood hazard
    areas in the City. However, due to topography, infrequent but intense rainfall can present minimal
    flooding problems in parts of the City. The areas with the greatest potential for rainfall-related flooding
    are in localized areas to the south, southeast, and southwest of the Hilltop area. Although some flood
    control facilities are maintained by the City of Signal Hill, the majority are controlled by the Los Angeles
    County Flood Control District. New drainage facilities will be considered during the review process for
    development projects.
    There is a remote possibility that one of the City-operated water reservoirs (as described under Peakload
    Water Requirements, above) could rupture and leak, resulting in localized flooding in some areas of the
    City if stored water is released rapidly. The risk of damage is minimized because the reservoirs are partially
    or completely buried, limiting the amount of water that could be released. In addition, all reservoir
    facilities in the City are regularly inspected.

    D. Oilfield Hazards
    Oil Leaks
    The risk of a significant oil leak in Signal Hill is low. This is in part because upward pressure in the Signal
    Hill oilfield is too low to rise to the surface through wells on its own. Water must be injected to increase
    oilfield pressure; without active pumping, liquids stop moving and the well ceases operation. In cases
    where a well is located near development, a “float switch” may be required to be placed at each well to
    shut off the flow of liquid if deemed necessary by the city inspector. In addition, in the event of a major
    incident such as an earthquake, a single switch can shut down all SHPI pumping operations in the area.
    The approximate locations of active wells are mapped on Figure 9.
    Pipelines
    Three types of pipelines service the oil industry in Signal Hill: one type carries a combination of water
    and oil, the second type carries natural gas and the third type carries refined fuel products to and from
    oil refineries in the region (for example, Carson, Wilmington, Torrance) to the two tank farms in the
    City and the Long Beach Airport (these pipelines are shown on Figure 9 as “Hazardous Liquid
    Pipelines”).
    SHPI has pipelines that run underneath the streets, throughout the City. The pipelines are used to
    transport water, crude oil, and produced natural gas from the wells to a central processing facility. Wells
    operated by SHPI are connected to two pipelines: one carries a combination of water and oil and the
    second carries the relatively small amount of natural gas that is extracted with the water/oil mix from
    wells. Some natural gas is consumed by gas turbine electric generators operated by SHPI which supports
    their operations. The additional gas is sold to Long Beach Gas & Oil Department (LBGO).
    The pipelines used to transport produced natural gas from oil and gas operations are operated at negative
    pressure at low flow rates. The produced natural gas contains a small amount of crude oil which builds
    up in the pipeline. There are “clean outs” (piping that connects back to the surface) with lids and valves
    at strategic locations on the natural gas pipeline (typically in streets). A special truck called a “vacuum
    truck” regularly goes to the clean outs and uses vacuum pressure to suck the residual crude oil out of the
    produced natural gas pipeline. This routine maintenance procedure is part of on-going work done. SHPI

GENERAL PLAN

     also conducts mechanical integrity tests on all of its pipelines on a regularly scheduled basis to ensure
     their strength and safety.
     The pipelines used to transport oil from oil and gas operations are required to comply with the provisions
     of federal and state law.12 These regulations establish minimum requirements in the following areas of
     concern: 1) annual, accident, and safety-related condition reporting; 2) design requirements; 3)
     construction; 4) pressure testing; 5) operations and maintenance; 6) qualification of pipeline personnel;
     and 7) corrosion control. Inspection, testing, and investigation of pipelines are conducted by the Office
     of the State Fire Marshal’s Pipeline Safety Division.
     Oil and gas pipelines from oilfield operations are not the direct responsibility of the City of Signal Hill.
     Prior to the construction of public works projects or private development, maps are reviewed to determine
     if pipelines may be located under the project site. Pipeline locations may also be determined by contacting
     Underground Service Alert, which will send out staff to mark pipeline locations before excavations occur.
     Processing Facilities
     There are two processing facilities in Signal Hill (see Figure 9) liquids pumped from oil wells are
     transported via pipeline and collected at these facilities. At these facilities, the water/oil mix is broken
     down into its constituent parts. Approximately 97 percent of the liquid pumped from Signal Hill wells is
     salt water, with the remaining 3 percent mostly crude oil. The salt water is pressurized and sent to water
     injection wells, where it is reinjected into the oilfield. The crude oil is sent via pipeline from the
     processing facility to refineries throughout Southern California. There are no refineries in the City of
     Signal Hill. The risk of fire at the central processing facilities is very low due to the low concentration of
     oil in the liquid mix.
     Refined Petroleum Tank Farms
     Two tank farms (also sometimes called an oil depot or terminal) for refined petroleum product remain
     in operation within Signal Hill, as shown on Figure 9. The tank farms store petroleum products (after
12 Part 195 (Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline) of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations and
   Section 31010 et seq. of the California Government Code (California Pipeline Safety Act).

    they have been refined at refineries outside of the city) until they are transported to end users or another
    storage facility. There is no processing or other transformation on-site, however minor blending, addition
    of additives and distribution can be conducted at the sites as it is not considered major manufacturing.
    The tank farms are adjacent to each other and located near the City’s eastern boundary. The larger of the
    two tank farms is the Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company, at 2350 Obispo which consists of 19
    storage tanks with a total maximum design capacity of 1,119,500 barrels. Seven of the tanks were installed
    in 1958, and the remaining 12 in 1980. The smaller Shell Oil Products tank farm is supplied by direct
    pipeline from the companies Carson terminal, the tank farm is located east of the Tesoro facility at 2457
    Redondo and includes tanks with a total capacity of 61,000 barrels. Employees at these facilities conduct
    daily visual inspections of storage tanks and other site facilities. Internal inspections of tanks are
    conducted periodically, when tanks are empty and open. Facility inspections are also carried out by the
    local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA), an entity which must be approved by the California
    Environmental Protection Agency. The CUPA for Signal Hill is the LACoFD Health Hazardous
    Materials Division.

    Groundwater Quality
    Groudwater quality can be affected by various activities including oilfield operations, spills from
    commercial and industrial facilities and leaks from underground storage tanks if they are not managed
    properly. The City’s water quality consultant, Flow Science, Inc., conducted a groundwater quality
    analysis to evaluate the potential impacts of oilfield operations on groundwater quality in the Signal Hill-
    Long Beach area. Flow Science reviewed information on subsurface geology, including the locations of
    drinking water aquifers and hydrocarbon production zones. The report found that in the Signal Hill area,
    drinking water aquifers typically occur well above hydrocarbon zones and the aquifers are generally
    separated by layers of low permeability. In addition, oil/gas wells are constructed with solid casings that
    extend through drinking water aquifers; oil/gas wells are not screened or perforated in drinking water
    zones.
    In addition, a cursory analysis of the oil/gas recovery technique used in the Signal Hill area called
    waterflood was also conducted. DOGGR establishes limits and monitoring requirements for waterflood
    operations throughout California. DOGGR requires that injection pressures in waterflood operations be
    maintained below the fracture pressure of the formation and DOGGR requires pressure levels be
    confirmed in the field.
    The report concludes that subsurface oilfield operations within the Signal Hill-Long Beach area to date
    have had no widespread significant impact on the water quality within overlying drinking water aquifers
    in spite of the fact that many abandoned wells within the Long Beach oil and gas field (the Field) lack an
    adequate plug at the base of fresh water. A copy of the February 24, 2014 Impacts of Oilfield Operations
    on Groundwater Quality in Signal Hill-Long Beach Area study is on file with the Community
    Development Department.
    Soil Contamination
    Petroleum hydrocarbons are the principal components of crude oil, therefore the soils around an active,
    idle or abandoned oil well or previous industrial sites including oilfield processing and manufacturing
    facilities may have hydrocarbons in the soil.
    If DOGGR or City inspectors determine that contaminated soil is likely to be present on the project site,
    a soils investigation by a qualified soils engineer is required. In addition, a Human Health Risk

GENERAL PLAN

    Assessment (HHRA) may be required as a condition of approval for a development project. A HHRA
    must follow the guidance in the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) Preliminary
    Endangerment Assessment guidance manual, along with the guidance of other manuals as needed.
    Human Health Risk Assessments are submitted to the State Office of Environmental Health Hazard
    Assessment for scientific validity.
    For construction purposes, the property owners should submit a soils management plan to provide
    guidance to building contractors in the event that discolored or odiferous soils are discovered during
    onsite excavation and grading activities.
    Methane
    Methane is a colorless, odorless gas, is lighter than air and consequently travels in the subsurface along
    the path of least resistance until released into the atmosphere. Methane is generated from oil production
    and from microbial degradation of waste in municipal landfills and animal waste/sewage. Methane is a
    known asphyxiate and is explosive when three conditions are met: (1) it has accumulated in a confined
    space, (2) it is under pressure in the confined space, and (3) an ignition source is present.
    The City has no record of methane or fluids leaking from abandoned or re-abandoned wells. However,
    all properties in the City, whether or not they contain abandoned wells, shall be tested for methane gas
    prior to issuance of construction or development permits unless otherwise approved by the Oil Services
    Coordinator. Methane Assessments are conducted per City of LADBS “Site Testing Standards for
    Methane” (P/BC 2002-101, November 30, 2004) using field instruments to measure methane, pressure
    and other fixed gases. The concentrations of methane detected and the measured pressure in the
    subsurface dictate the type of mitigation system warranted.
    Methane Mitigation systems range from Vapor Barrier, Hardscape and Landscape Treatments, Passive
    Methane Mitigation System, and Modified Active Methane System. These may include, for example,
    venting systems, impervious foundation membranes, perforated pipe collection systems, and gas
    detection systems. Methane systems are then plan checked and installed during construction.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                           Safety Element 49
GENERAL PLAN

    Development of Properties of Abandoned Oil Wells
    DOGGR states the following significant and potentially dangerous issues related to development near
    abandoned oil wells:
    “The property owner, developer, and local permitting agency should be aware of, and fully understand,
    the following significant and potentially dangerous issues associated with development near oil or gas
    wells:
         1) The property owner is always responsible for providing access to any well located on the
              property, if re-abandonment becomes necessary. This means the property owner is
              responsible for removing any structure or obstacle that prevents or impedes access to a
              well. This includes, but is not limited to, buildings, housing, fencing, landscaping, trees,
              pools, patios, sidewalks, and decking. The DOGGR is also not responsible for the
              rebuilding or replacing of any structure or obstacle that needs to be removed to gain
              access to a well. According to Section 3255 of the Public Resources Code, the DOGGR
              may order the re-abandonment of any well that poses a danger to life, health, or natural
              resources.
         2) There is no guarantees that wells properly abandoned to current DOGGR standards will
              not start leaking oil, gas, and/or water after abandonment. It always remains a possibility
              that any well may start to leak oil, gas, and/or water after abandonment, no matter how
              thorough the well was plugged and abandoned. DOGGR acknowledges wells that are
              abandoned to current standards have a lower probability of leaking oil, gas, and/or water
              after abandonment, but makes no guarantees about the abandonment.”
    When a proposal for development (new construction or addition) is presented to the Community
    Development Department, City staff review DOGGR maps to determine if any active, idle or abandoned
    oil wells are located within or adjacent to the subject property. If abandoned oil wells appear to be in the
    area of development, the property is subject to SHMC Chapter 16.24 Development Standards for
    Properties Containing Abandoned Wells. The steps needed prior to development are outlined below:
         ■    Step 1- Well Discovery. First, the precise location of the well must be determined through on-
              site excavation, prior to excavation a well discovery permit is issued by the City to ensure the site
              is monitored and secured.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                             Safety Element   50
GENERAL PLAN

        ■   Step 2- Leak Test. Once the well is located, it is uncovered and examined for gas and oil leakage.
            A leak testing permit shall be issued by the Oil Services Coordinator, a leak test shall be
            completed utilizing a “GT-43" gas detection meter, or one of comparable quality approved in
            advance by the Oil Services Coordinator, and shall be conducted by a state licensed geotechnical
            or civil engineer or state registered environmental assessor, class II, or other as determined
            necessary by the Oil Services Coordinator. The methane gas leak test is conducted around the
            perimeter of the interior and exterior surface plugs and across the face of the visible surface plugs
            of the visible well casing(s). A leak test report shall be prepared by a state licensed geotechnical
            or civil engineer or state registered environmental assessor, class II, and shall be submitted to the
            city for review and approval by the Oil Services Coordinator. The greatest detected measured
            concentrations of methane for the interior and exterior of each visible well casing shall be
            included in the report.
                         A well shall be considered leaking if the leak test report indicates the meter read is
            greater than 500 parts per million. If a well is found to be leaking they shall be abandoned
            pursuant to Sections 16.23.010 and 16.23.020.
                         A well shall not be considered leaking if the leak test report indicated the meter read
            is less than 500 parts per million. If a well is not leaking, vent risers and vent cones shall be
            installed to provide a subsurface path of least resistance for methane until released into the
            atmosphere. Cone and riser materials, design and installation shall be observed and inspected
            and approved by the Oil Services Coordinator and shall be in compliance with the
            recommendations contained in the leak test report.
            Following all testing and inspection, the test area shall be returned to its previous state and
            fencing may be required around the area, or the entire site, to the satisfaction of the Oil Services
            Coordinator. In addition, a licensed survey must be submitted to show the location of the well
            on the property to ascertain the location and document the depth of the well surface plate from
            the existing grade, or in the case of pending new development, the proposed depth. This is to
            provide more complete information about the well on the property.
        ■   Step 3-Well Access Exhibit. Once the wells are located and a survey is created the developer shall
            create a well access exhibit that shows the locations of the abandoned oil well with a fully
            dimensioned site plan overlaid on top of the survey. The developer is responsible for the site
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                             Safety Element 51
GENERAL PLAN

            plan design and choosing whether to maintain rig access to the well, by not building over, or in
            close proximity to the well or building over or within close proximity of the well. Each
            abandoned well shall be marked on the exhibit as one of the following: 1. “Access provided” for
            wells meeting the close proximity standard, or not proposed to be built over. 2. “No access &
            methane mitigation required” for wells with improvements proposed over, or in close proximity
            to the well.
        ■   Step 4- Well Abandonment Report. A well abandonment report shall be required for all
            abandoned wells marked as “no access & methane mitigation required” on the well access exhibit
            and shall be submitted to the Oil Services Coordinator for review. The report is to compile all
            of the information that is known for the well in one place, for example the well survey, leak test,
            DOGGR well bore data. The most important part of the report is the equivalency standard
            assessment report prepared by the applicant’s registered petroleum engineer, registered
            petroleum geologist, or a professional with the equivalent of these registrations for review by the
            city’s Petroleum Engineer. The assessment shall state whether the well meets, or does not meet,
            the City’s equivalency standard pursuant to Section 16.24.070. The written narrative and
            wellbore diagram should therefore contain all relative facts (and assumptions) about the plugs to
            allow the developer and the City to reach conclusions on the adequacy of the plugs. The city’s
            consulting petroleum engineer / geologist will determine if these conditions have been met (the
            abandonment is adequate to prevent hydrocarbons from reaching the surface via said well).
        ■   Step 5- Well Evaluation. The primary focus of the Equivalency Standard (ES) is on the cement
            plugs set in the well during the course of the abandonment operations. The standard was
            developed by the City’s Petroleum Engineer, Tom Walker of Evans & Walker, following
            extensive analysis of drilling and historic well abandonments and re-abandonments in the Field.
            The purpose of the standard is to establish a basis for the City’s determination to allow
            development over and in close proximity to abandoned wells. The overarching goal of the
            standard is to insure that the integrity of the abandonment is sufficient to protect the public
            health, safety and welfare by preventing hydrocarbons from reaching the surface. In summary,
            the Equivalency Standard requires three cement plugs at three levels:
                         Last hydrocarbon producing zone
                         Base of fresh water zone

             A copy of the October 7, 2014 Well Abandonment Equivalency Standard study is on file with
             the Community Development Department.
         ■   Step 6- Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&Rs). Prior to issuance of any certificate
             of occupancy for developments constructed over abandoned wells, or for abandoned wells
             marked “no access,” the property owner shall record a declaration of covenants, conditions and
             restrictions (CC&Rs), in a form subject to the review and approval of the City Attorney. This is
             to ensure that present and future property owners are aware of 1) the wells located on the
             property, and 2) significant and potentially dangerous issues associated with development near
             oil or gas wells. The CC&Rs are recorded to the property to put future owners and occupants
             on notice of the following: the existence of abandoned wells on the site; that the wells within the
             area of development have been leak tested and found not to leak; description of any methane
             mitigation measures employed; disclosure that access to these wells has been provided to address
             the fact that they may leak in the future causing potential harm; acknowledgment that the state
             may order the re-abandonment of any well should it leak in the future; acknowledgment that the
             state does not recommend building over wells; and releasing and indemnifying the city for issuing
             project permits.
    E. Other Hazards
    Hazardous Material Generators
    Various industrial uses in Signal Hill use or produce materials which may be deemed hazardous by the
    state and federal governments. Regulation of hazardous wastes is provided on the federal, state and local
    levels.
    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Department of Toxic Substances
    Control have developed and continue to update lists of hazardous waste subject to regulation. The South
    Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) works with the California Air Resources Board
    (CARB) and is responsible for developing and implementing rules and regulations regarding air toxins
    on a local level. The SCAQMD establishes permitting requirements, inspects emission sources, and
    enforces measures through educational programs and/or fines.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                           Safety Element  53
GENERAL PLAN

    Hazardous waste management plans are implemented by jurisdictions across California. These plans
    assure adequate treatment and disposal capacity is available to manage the hazardous wastes generated
    within each jurisdiction. In 1988, Los Angeles County adopted the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste
    Management Plan, which was subsequently approved by the State Department of Health Services. The
    Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan provides policy direction and action programs
    to address current and future hazardous waste management issues that require local responsibility and
    involvement in Los Angeles County. In addition, the Plan discusses hazardous waste issues, and analyzes
    current and future waste generation within the region.
    Senate Bill 1082 (1993) established the Unified Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials Management
    Regulatory Program (Unified Program). The Unified Program consolidates, coordinates, and makes
    consistent six hazardous materials and hazardous waste program elements. The Unified Program is
    implemented by the local CUPA. The LACoFD provides inspections and emergency response for
    facilities handling hazardous materials. They also evaluate Risk Management Plans prepared to minimize
    the risk of accidental releases.
    Underground storage tanks, such as those commonly located below gas stations, are regulated by the Los
    Angeles County Department of Public Works, Environmental Programs Division. The Environmental
    Programs Division maintains the Underground Storage Tank Program, which has the goal of protecting
    the public, the environment, and storage tank owners/operators by ensuring that tank facilities
    are permitted, designed, installed, operated and eventually closed in compliance with local, state, and
    federal requirements.
    Natural Gas Utility Pipelines
    Natural gas pipelines service residential, commercial, and industrial uses throughout the city. Signal Hill
    is served by Long Beach Gas & Oil (LBGO), a municipal gas utility owned and operated by the City of
    Long Beach. LBGO services over 500,000 residents and businesses in Long Beach and Signal Hill, and
    maintains over 900 miles of natural gas main pipelines. No major natural gas explosions have occurred
    in Long Beach since LBGO’s founding in 1924. In order to maintain safe service, approximately $8
    million is expended annually to implement a long-range pipeline replacement plan. In the first eight
    months of 2010, LBGO replaced about 70,000 feet of pipeline, including 52,000 feet of pipelines
    constructed before 1950. Most gas pipelines in Signal Hill are small distribution lines, which provide

GENERAL PLAN

     natural gas directly to individual homes and businesses. However, there is one larger gas transmission
     line within the city, running mostly below 28th Street (see Figure 9).
     As required by federal regulations, LBGO continually monitors its pipelines for leakage, with personnel
     conducting walking surveys along the full length of the pipeline system with sensitive gas detection
     equipment. Leak surveys are conducted annually in business districts and every five years in residential
     areas. Depending on the magnitude of identified leaks, the damaged pipe is repaired or the pipeline
     section is completely replaced. The federal Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety
     conducts periodic audits of LBGO's pipeline operation and maintenance practices. LBGO has met all
     standards for leak survey, repairing all leaks according to federal safety standards and procedures. LBGO
     also maintains emergency service contact numbers and work crews on call 24 hours per day to investigate
     potential leaks.
     Tsunami, Seiche, and Dam Failure
     Tsunamis are unusually large sea waves produced by submarine earth movements or volcanic eruptions.
     They have the potential to impact coastlines and low-lying areas inland from the coast. Tsunami
     inundation mapping for California’s coastal counties, including Los Angeles, was prepared in 2009
     through a collaboration of the California Emergency Management Agency, the California Geological
     Survey, and the University of Southern California.13 Mapping for the Long Beach Quadrangle shows that
     tsunamis are not expected to impact the City of Signal Hill. Much of the coast of Long Beach is protected
     by a high bluff which prevents tsunami impacts beyond the beach. The area nearest Signal Hill that could
     be impacted by a tsunami is the Colorado Lagoon area in Long Beach, located south of 7 th Street and
     east of Ximeno Avenue, 1.5 miles southeast of Signal Hill’s boundary.
     Similar to a tsunami, seiche is the sudden oscillation of waters in an enclosed water body, such as a lake,
     rather than on the sea. There are no such enclosed water bodies in the vicinity of Signal Hill, and there
     is therefore no risk from seiche.
     Dam failure can result in large-scale flooding of downstream areas. There are no dams in the Signal Hill
     area which could cause flooding in the City.

    IV. G O A L S A N D P O L I C I E S
    The goals and policies of this Safety Element fall into three major categories: prevention, preparation,
    and recovery. Goal 1 provides for prevention, which includes actions that should be taken to avert to the
    greatest degree feasible potential disasters. Where prevention is not feasible, Goal 2 provides for
    preparation, which involves taking steps to minimize impacts from disasters that are cannot be prevented.
    Finally, Goal 3 provides for recovery, or the rapid and effective restoration of services, infrastructure, and
    normal citywide operations following a major event.
    Goal 1: PREVENTION: Strive to prevent man-made disasters and minimize the potential for natural disasters
             to impact the community.
             Policy 1.a: Maintain a high level of interjurisdictional cooperation and communication on
                          emergency planning and management.
             Policy 1.b: Design future development located near water storage facilities and below the slope
                          of the Hill to minimize the possibility of damage from flooding or a water storage
                          facility leak or rupture.
             Policy 1.c: Regulate the location, use, storage, and transportation of hazardous and toxic
                          materials and protect the public from these hazards.
             Policy 1.d: Maintain, revise, and enforce appropriate standards and codes to minimize seismic
                          and geologic risks.
             Policy 1.e: Encourage the maintenance or improvement of buildings’ structural integrity to
                          protect residents and preserve communities.
             Policy 1.f:  Locate, staff, and equip fire stations to meet established response times. Response
                          time objectives are to be based on national standards.
             Policy 1.g: Regulate the amount and type of new development in areas susceptible to fire
                          hazards.
CITY OF SIGNAL HILL                                                                             Safety Element  56
GENERAL PLAN

Part I: PLANNING PROCESS
Introduction
The Hazard Mitigation Plan (Mitigation Plan) was prepared in response to Disaster Mitigation Act
of 2000 (DMA 2000). DMA 2000 (also known as Public Law 106-390) requires state and local
governments to prepare mitigation plans to document their mitigation planning process, and
identify hazards, potential losses, mitigation needs, goals, and strategies. This type of planning
supplements the City’s comprehensive land use planning and emergency management planning
programs. This document is a federally mandated update to the City of Signal Hill 2012 Hazard
Mitigation Plan and ensures continuing eligibility for Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP)
funding.
DMA 2000 was designed to establish a national program for pre-disaster mitigation, streamline
disaster relief at the federal and state levels, and control federal disaster assistance costs.
Congress believed these requirements would produce the following benefits:
      Reduce loss of life and property, human suffering, economic disruption,
        and disaster costs.
      Prioritize hazard mitigation at the local level with increased emphasis on planning and
        public involvement, assessing risks, implementing loss reduction measures, and ensuring
        critical facilities/services survive a disaster.
      Promote education and economic incentives to form community-based partnerships and
        leverage non-federal resources to commit to and implement long-term hazard mitigation
        activities.
The following FEMA definitions are used throughout this plan (Source: FEMA, 2002, Getting
Started, Building Support for Mitigation Planning, FEMA 386-1):
Hazard Mitigation – “Any sustained action taken to reduce or eliminate the long-term risk to human
life and property from hazards”.
Planning – “The act or process of making or carrying out plans; specifically, the establishment of
goals, policies, and procedures for a social or economic unit.”
Planning Approach
The four-step planning approach outlined in the FEMA publication, Developing the Mitigation
Plan: Identifying Mitigation Actions and Implementing Strategies (FEMA 386-3) was used to
develop this plan:
      Develop mitigation goals and objectives - The risk assessment (hazard characteristics,
        inventory, and findings), along with municipal policy documents, were utilized to develop
        mitigation goals and objectives.
      Identify and prioritize mitigation actions - Based on the risk assessment, goals and
        objectives, existing literature/resources, and input from participating entities, mitigation
        activities were identified for each hazard. Activities were 1) qualitatively evaluated against
                                                                           Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016
                                                                                             Introduction
                                                                                                    -5-

        the goals and objectives, and other criteria; 2) identified as high, medium, or low priority;
        and 3) presented in a series of hazard-specific tables.
     Prepare implementation strategy - Generally, high priority activities are recommended
        for implementation first. However, based on community needs and goals, project costs,
        and available funding, some medium or low priority activities may be implemented before
        some high priority items.
     Document mitigation planning process - The mitigation planning process is
        documented throughout this plan.
Hazard Land Use Policy in California
Planning for hazards should be an integral element of any City’s land use planning program. All
California cities and counties have General Plans (also known as Comprehensive Plans) and the
implementing ordinances that are required to comply with the statewide land use planning
regulations.
The continuing challenge faced by local officials and state government is to keep the network of
local plans effective in responding to the changing conditions and needs of California’s diverse
communities, particularly in light of the very active seismic region in which we live.
Planning for hazards requires a thorough understanding of the various hazards facing the City
and region as a whole. Additionally, it’s important to take an inventory of the structures and
contents of various City holdings. These inventories should include the compendium of hazards
facing the City, the built environment at risk, the personal property that may be damaged by
hazard events and most of all, the people who live in the shadow of these hazards. Such an
analysis is found in this hazard mitigation plan.
State and Federal Partners in Hazard Mitigation
All mitigation is local and the primary responsibility for development and implementation of risk
reduction strategies and policies lies with each local jurisdiction. Local jurisdictions, however, are
not alone. Partners and resources exist at the regional, state and federal levels. Numerous
California state agencies have a role in hazards and hazard mitigation.
Some of the key agencies include:
     California Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is responsible for disaster mitigation,
        preparedness, response, recovery, and the administration of federal funds after a major
        disaster declaration;
     Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) gathers information about earthquakes,
        integrates information on earthquake phenomena, and communicates this to end-users
        and the general public to increase earthquake awareness, reduce economic losses, and
        save lives.
     California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) is responsible for all
        aspects of wildland fire protection on private and state properties, and administers forest
        practices regulations, including landslide mitigation, on non-federal lands.
     California Division of Mines and Geology (DMG) is responsible for geologic hazard
        characterization, public education, and the development of partnerships aimed at
        reducing risk.
                                                                            Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016
                                                                                              Introduction
                                                                                                     -6-

     California Division of Water Resources (DWR) plans, designs, constructs, operates, and
        maintains the State Water Project; regulates dams; provides flood protection and assists
        in emergency management. It also educates the public, serves local water needs by
        providing technical assistance
     FEMA provides hazard mitigation guidance, resource materials, and educational
        materials to support implementation of the capitalized DMA 2000.
     United States Census Bureau (USCB) provides demographic data on the populations
        affected by natural disasters.
     United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides data on matters pertaining to
        land management.
Q&A | ELEMENT A: PLANNING PROCESS | A3
Q: A3. Does the Plan document how the public was involved in the planning process during the
drafting stage? (Requirement §201.6(b)(1))
A: See Planning Phases Timeline below.
Stakeholders
A Hazard Mitigation Planning Team (Planning Team) consisting of department representatives
from City of Signal Hill staff worked with Emergency Planning Consultants to create the updated
Plan. The Planning Team served as the primary stakeholders throughout the planning
process.
As required by DMA 2000, the Planning Team informed the general public and external agencies
(including special districts and adjoining jurisdictions) of the planning process and provided
opportunities for input during both the plan writing and review phases. The general public and
external agencies served as secondary stakeholders in the planning process.
Hazard Mitigation Legislation
Hazard Mitigation Grant Program
In 1974, Congress enacted the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Act, commonly
referred to as the Stafford Act. In 1988, Congress established the Hazard Mitigation Grant
Program (HMGP) via Section 404 of the Stafford Act. Regulations regarding HMGP
implementation based on the DMA 2000 were initially changed by an Interim Final Rule (44 CFR
Part 206, Subpart N) published in the Federal Register on February 26, 2002. A second Interim
Final Rule was issued on October 1, 2002.
The HMGP helps states and local governments implement long-term hazard mitigation measures
for natural hazards by providing federal funding following a federal disaster declaration. Eligible
applicants include state and local agencies, Indian tribes or other tribal organizations, and certain
nonprofit organizations.

Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program
The Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program (PDM) was authorized by §203 of the Stafford Act, 42 United
States Code, as amended by §102 of the DMA 2000. Funding is provided through the National
Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund to help state and local governments (including tribal governments)
implement cost-effective hazard mitigation activities that complement a comprehensive mitigation
program.
In Fiscal Year 2009, two types of grants (planning and competitive) were offered under the PDM
Program. Planning grants allocate funds to each state for Mitigation Plan development.
Competitive grants distribute funds to states, local governments, and federally recognized Indian
tribal governments via a competitive application process. FEMA reviews and ranks the submittals
based on pre-determined criteria. The minimum eligibility requirements for competitive grants
include participation in good standing in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and a
FEMA-approved Mitigation Plan.

Flood Mitigation Assistance Program
The Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) Program was created as
part of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act (NFIRA) of 1994          “Floods and hurricanes
(42 U.S.C. 4101). Financial support is provided through the
                                                                         happen. The hazard itself

Q&A | ELEMENT C. MITIGATION STRATEGY | C2
Q: C2. Does the Plan address each jurisdiction’s participation in the NFIP and continued
compliance with NFIP requirements, as appropriate? (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(ii))
A: See NFIP Participation below.
National Flood Insurance Program
Established in 1968, the NFIP provides federally-backed flood insurance to homeowners, renters,
and businesses in communities that adopt and enforce floodplain management ordinances to
reduce future flood damage.
NFIP Participation
The City of Signal Hill participates in NFIP and the FEMA FIRM maps for the City of Signal Hill
were last updated September 26, 2008. Unfortunately, FEMA flood maps are not entirely
accurate. These studies and maps represent flood risk at the point in time when FEMA completed
the studies, and does not incorporate planning for floodplain changes in the future due to new
development. Although FEMA is considering changing that policy, it is optional for local
communities.
According to FEMA, the City of Signal Hill is designated a No Special Flood Hazard Area
(NSFHA). A Non-Special Flood Hazard Area (NSFHA) is an area that is in a moderate- to low-
risk flood zone (Zones B, C, X Pre- and Post-FIRM). An NSFHA is not in any immediate danger
from flooding caused by overflowing rivers or hard rains. According to the City’s 2016 General
Plan Safety Element, Signal Hill is not subject to flood hazards. Only a small area along the city’s
southwestern boundary is designated as Zone X on the Federal Emergency Management
Agency’s Flood Insurance Rate Map, indicating no major flood risk. The remainder of the City is
unzoned. Accordingly, it is concluded that there are no special flood hazard areas in the City as
shown on Map: Flood Hazards.

Q&A | ELEMENT B: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT | B4
Q: B4. Does the Plan address NFIP insured structures within the jurisdiction that have been
repetitively damaged by floods? (Requirement §201.6(c)(2)(ii))
A: See Repetitive Loss Properties below.
Repetitive Loss Properties
Repetitive Loss Properties (RLPs) are most susceptible to flood damages; therefore, they have
been the focus of flood hazard mitigation programs. Unlike a Countywide program, the Floodplain
Management Plan (FMP) for repetitive loss properties involves highly diversified property profiles,
drainage issues, and property owner’s interest. It also requires public involvement processes
unique to each RLP area. The objective of an FMP is to provide specific potential mitigation
measures and activities to best address the problems and needs of communities with repetitive
loss properties. A repetitive loss property is one for which two or more claims of $1,000 or more
have been paid by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) within any given ten-year period.
According to FEMA resources, there are no Repetitive Loss Properties within the City of Signal
Hill.
State and Federal Guidance in Hazard Mitigation
While local jurisdictions have primary responsibility for developing and implementing hazard
mitigation strategies, they are not alone. Various state and federal partners and resources can
help local agencies with mitigation planning.
The Mitigation Plan was prepared in accordance with the following regulations and guidance

Plan Adoption and Approval
As per DMA 2000 and supporting Federal regulations, the Mitigation Plan is required to be
adopted by the City Council and approved by FEMA. See the Planning Process Section for
details.
Who Does the Mitigation Plan Affect?
This plan provides a framework for planning for natural hazards. The resources and background
information in the plan are applicable City-wide and to City-owned facilities outside of the City
boundaries, and the goals and recommendations provide groundwork for local mitigation plans
and partnerships. Map: City of Signal Hill shows the regional proximity of the City to its adjoining
communities.

Planning Process
Throughout the project, the City followed its traditional approach to developing policy documents
which included preparation of a First Draft Plan for review by the City’s Hazard Mitigation Planning
Team who served as the primary stakeholders. Next, following necessary updates, a Second
Draft Plan was shared with the general public and external agencies (special districts and
adjoining jurisdictions) during the plan writing phase. The general public and external agencies
served as the secondary stakeholders. Next, the comments gathered from the secondary
stakeholders were incorporated into a Third Draft Plan which was submitted to Cal OES and
FEMA along with a request for a conditional approval.
Next, the Planning Team completed amendments to the Plan to reflect mandated input by Cal
OES and FEMA. The Fourth Draft Plan was then posted for an additional opportunity for input
from the secondary stakeholders. Following the review period, comments gathered were
incorporated into a City Council Staff Report and a public notice was placed on the City’s website
announcing the City Council’s public meeting. Following adoption by the City Council, the Final
Draft Plan was re-submitted to FEMA with a request for final approval. The planning process
described above is portrayed below in a timeline:

Plan Methodology
The Planning Team discussed knowledge of natural hazards and past historical events, as well
as planning and zoning codes, ordinances, and recent planning decisions.
The rest of this section describes the mitigation planning process including 1) Planning Team
involvement, 2) extended Planning Team support (department heads), 3) public and external
agency involvement; and 4) integration of existing data and plans.
Q&A | ELEMENT A: PLANNING PROCESS | A1
Q: A1. Does the Plan document the planning process, including how it was prepared and who
was involved in the process for each jurisdiction? (Requirement §201.6(c)(1))
A: See Table: Planning Team Involvement and Level of Participation below.
Planning Team Involvement
The Planning Team consisted of representatives from City of Signal Hill departments related to
hazard mitigation processes. The Planning Team served as the primary stakeholders throughout
the planning process. Citizens and businesses (general public) along with external agencies
(special districts and adjoining jurisdictions) served as secondary stakeholders in the planning
process. The Planning Team was responsible for the following tasks:
       Confirming planning goals
       Prepare timeline for plan update
       Ensure plan meets DMA 2000 requirements
       Organize and solicit involvement of public and external agencies
       Analyze existing data and reports
       Update hazard information
       Review HAZUS loss projection estimates
       Update status of Mitigation Action Items
       Develop new Mitigation Action Items
       Participate in Planning Team meetings and City Council public meeting
The Planning Team, with assistance from Emergency Planning Consultants, identified and
profiled hazards; determined hazard rankings; estimated potential exposure or losses; evaluated
development trends and specific risks; and developed mitigation goals and action items.

General Public and External Agency Involvement
The Planning Team provided data and expertise during plan writing phase. This effort was
supplemented through the assistance of the general public and external agencies (special districts
and adjoining jurisdictions). The City posted public notices announcing the availability of the
Second Draft Plan on its website and other customary posting locations. Copies of the postings
are located in the Appendix. The postings directed the general public to the City’s website where
the Second Draft Plan was available for download along with a request to submit input directly to
the Chair of the Planning Team.
External agencies listed below were invited via email and provided with an electronic link to the
City’s website. Following is the email distributed along with the invitation to comments:

Capability Assessment – Existing Processes and Programs
The City will incorporate mitigation planning as an integral component of daily operations. This
will be accomplished by the Planning Team working with their respective departments to integrate
mitigation strategies into the planning documents and operational guidelines within the City. In
addition to the Capability Assessment below, the Planning Team will strive to identify additional
policies, programs, practices, and procedures that could be created or modified to address
mitigation activities.

Plan Adoption Process
Adoption of the plan by the local governing body demonstrates the City’s commitment to meeting
mitigation goals and objectives. Governing body approval legitimizes the plan and authorizes
responsible agencies to execute their responsibilities.
The City Council must adopt the Mitigation Plan before the Plan can be approved by FEMA.
In preparation for the public meeting with the City Council, the Planning Team prepared a Staff
Report including an overview of the Planning Process, Risk Assessment, Mitigation Goals, and
Mitigation Actions. The staff presentation concluded with a summary of the input received during
the public review of the document. The meeting participants were encouraged to present their
views and make suggestions on possible mitigation actions.

Part II: RISK ASSESSMENT
Community Profile
Geography and the Environment
The City of Signal Hill is located approximately two miles north of the Pacific Ocean in southern
Los Angeles County. Signal Hill consists of 2.2 square miles completely surrounded by the City
of Long Beach. Regional access to the City is provided by freeways, especially Interstate 405 (I-
405); arterial roadways; bus routes; a light rail line; two major seaports; and Long Beach Airport,
which is located immediately northeast of Signal Hill.
According to the City’s General Plan, the panoramic view from the crest of Signal Hill is truly one
of the most beautiful in all of Southern California. Most spectacular is the view of the Pacific
Ocean framed by the Palos Verdes Peninsula and the Sheep Hills at Newport Beach. This ocean
view features rolling breakers at Huntington Beach, the Queen Mary and the Long Beach skyline
arguably equally spectacular at night. To the northwest, Signal Hill vistas include the skyscrapers
in downtown Los Angeles, the Hollywood sign and the Getty Museum of Art perched upon the
Santa Monica Mountains. To the east the view is remarkably grand including the Long Beach
Airport and the Pyramid at the California State University at Long Beach.
Most famous for the discovery of oil in 1921, and commonly known as an "oil town,” the City is
now a diverse community with an "oil history" and a bright future. By the turn of the 20th Century,
stately mansions dotted the hilltop, as the value of the panoramic view became evident. However,
by 1917 the prospect of striking oil on the hilltop surpassed the value of the view and the Union
Oil Company drilled the first oil well in the area. The well failed to produce any oil and it was
abandoned. Further exploration was suspended until the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company
resumed exploration and hit pay dirt on June 23, 1921. That first "gusher," at Alamitos Well #1,
marked a turning point in Signal Hill's history and put the city on the map.
                                                                          Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016
                                                                                     Community Profile
                                                                                                 - 27 -

Ultimately one of the richest oil fields in the world, it produced over 1 billion barrels of oil by 1984.
The field is still active and produced over 1.6 million barrels of oil in 1994 alone. Oil production
continued to be Signal Hill's mainstay until declining oil prices reduced production in the 1970’s.
Today, Signal Hill is a well-balanced, financially sound and economically diverse community of
over 11,673 people.
Climate
According to the City of Signal Hill’s General Plan – Environmental Resources Element (1989), is
located within a moderate climate of the South Coast Air Basin. The annual average temperature
in the City ranges from the mid 50°F in winter to the mid 70°F in the summer. Freezing conditions
and temperatures over 100°F occur infrequently.
The prevailing wind pattern is a daytime sea breeze, flowing toward the east and northeast with
little seasonal variability. Nighttime winds are light, and although variable, often have an offshore
character that flows toward the south/southwest. During the fall and early winter, Santa Ana wind
conditions sometimes occur. These relatively strong winds flow from the mountains in the east
toward the southwest in the vicinity of Signal Hill and generally increase local temperatures.
Annual precipitation varies, with long-term average of about 15.4 inches per year. Annual
average relative humidity in January ranges from 50 to 75 percent daily, whereas in July it varies
from 60 to 85 percent. As the State of California and the Los Angeles region has undergone a
several-year drought, rainfall has been much lower in the City.
Furthermore, actual rainfall in the Southern California region tends to fall in large amounts during
sporadic and often heavy storms rather than consistently over storms at somewhat regular
intervals. In short rainfall in Southern California might be characterized as feast or famine within
a single year.
Population and Demographics
According to the City’s General Plan, in 1980, the City’s population was approximately 5,734
residents. According to the California Department of Finance (2016), the population has grown
to 11,673 as of 2016. From 2000 to 2016, the City has experienced an average growth rate of
1.4 percent annually. Similarly, the population of Los Angeles County experienced a growth rate
of 0.4 percent per year.
According to the California Department of Finance (2014), the demographic makeup of the City
is as follows:
                                                                             Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016

Transportation and Commuting Patterns
According to the City of Signal Hill’s General Plan – Circulation Element (2009), Signal Hill is
completely surrounded by the city of Long Beach, and its transportation network is intertwined
with that of its neighbor. Regional access to the City as shown on Map: Regional Access, is
provided by freeways, especially Interstate 405 (I-405); arterial roadways; bus routes; a light rail
line; two major seaports; and Long Beach Airport, which is located immediately northeast of Signal
Hill.
The existing Signal Hill transportation system consists of roads of varying sizes and capacities;
public transportation systems, including bus, light rail, and paratransit service; airports, and
seaports as shown on Map: Roadway Classifications. The network created by these systems
serves two distinct and equally important functions: 1) to provide access to adjacent land uses,
and 2) to facilitate the movement of persons and goods to, from, within, and through the City.
Interstate
The San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405 or I-405) crosses the northern portion of Signal Hill. The
highway is owned and maintained by Caltrans. In the Signal Hill area, the I-405 currently consists
of ten travel lanes, including eight mixed-flow and two carpool lanes.
Interstate 405 is one of the major access routes to Signal Hill but is also a major traffic generator
that affects traffic flow within the City. The freeway interchanges with the Long Beach Freeway
(I-710) approximately three miles northwest of Cherry Avenue, with the San Gabriel Freeway (I-
605) approximately five miles southeast of Cherry Avenue, and with the Garden Grove Freeway
(State Route 22 or SR-22) approximately 7.5 miles southeast of Cherry Avenue. Full freeway
access is provided at Atlantic, Cherry, and Orange Avenues. Northbound I-405 access to the
City for traffic oriented south on Cherry Avenue is provided at Temple Avenue. This circuitous
access to Cherry Avenue increases traffic levels on Temple Avenue and Spring Street and is
confusing to motorists.

                                                                                     Community Profile
                                                                                                 - 31 -

The 2003 Short-Range Transportation Plan (SRTP), prepared by the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (Metro), recognizes the I-405 as a “congested corridor” in the Signal Hill area, and
identifies the Cherry and Atlantic Avenue ramps as “hot spots” with recurring heavy traffic
congestion. These designations make this freeway corridor a higher priority for future
improvements; however, no major improvements are currently funded.
Bus Service
Signal Hill is well-served by bus systems. Services provided by Long Beach Transit and Metro
operate within or in the vicinity of the City; additional bus lines are accessible through the nearby
Long Beach Transit Mall.
Long Beach Transit is the primary public transportation provider to Signal Hill. It is a municipal
transit agency operated on behalf of the City of Long Beach by a nonprofit corporation, the Long
Beach Public Transportation Company. In 2007, Long Beach Transit operated a total of 249
buses on 38 bus routes, providing over 26.6 million passenger trips. Service is provided from
approximately 4:30 am to 1:30 am, seven days per week.

Risk Assessment
What is a Risk Assessment?
Conducting a risk assessment can provide information regarding: the location of hazards; the
value of existing land and property in hazard locations; and an analysis of risk to life, property,
and the environment that may result from natural hazard events. Specifically, the five levels of a
risk assessment are as follows:
     1.  Hazard Identification
     2.  Profiling Hazard Events
     3.  Vulnerability Assessment/Inventory of Existing Assets
     4.  Risk Analysis
     5.  Assessing Vulnerability/Analyzing Development Trends
Q&A | ELEMENT B: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT | B1
Q: B1. Does the Plan include a description of the type, location, and extent of all natural hazards
that can affect each jurisdiction(s)? (Requirement §201.6(c)(2)(i))
A: See Hazard Identification below.
1) Hazard Identification
This section is the description of the geographic extent, potential intensity, and the probability of
occurrence of a given hazard. Maps are used in this plan to display hazard identification data.
The City of Signal Hill utilized the categorization of hazards as identified in California’s
State Hazard Mitigation Plan, including: Earthquakes, Floods, Levee failures, Wildfires,
Landslides and earth movements, Tsunami, Climate-related hazards, Volcanoes, and
Other hazards.
Next, the Planning Team reviewed existing documents to determine which of these hazards
posed the most significant threat to the City. In other words, which hazard would likely result in a
local declaration of emergency.
The geographic extent of each of the identified hazards was identified by the Planning Team
utilizing maps and data contained in the City’s General Plan and City’s Emergency Operations
Plan. In addition, numerous internet resources and the County of Los Angeles All-Hazards
Mitigation Plan served as valuable resources. Utilizing the Calculated Priority Risk Index (CPRI)
                                                                         Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016

ranking technique, the Planning Team concluded the following hazards posed a significant threat
against the City:
                       Earthquake | Landslide | Windstorm | Drought
The hazard ranking system is described in Table: Calculated Priority Risk Index, while the
actual ranking is shown in Table: Calculated Priority Risk Index Ranking for City of Signal
Hill.

3) Vulnerability Assessment/Inventory of Existing Assets
A Vulnerability Assessment in its simplest form is a simultaneous look at the geographical location
of hazards and an inventory of the underlying land uses (populations, structures, etc.). Facilities
that provide critical and essential services following a major emergency are of particular concern
because these locations house staff and equipment necessary to provide important public safety,
emergency response, and/or disaster recovery functions.
Critical and Essential Facilities
Facilities critical to government response activities (i.e., life safety and property and environmental
protection) include: local government 9-1-1 dispatch centers, local government emergency
operations centers, local police and fire stations, local public works facilities, local
communications centers, schools (shelters), and hospitals. Also, facilities that, if damaged, could
cause serious secondary impacts are also considered "critical”. A hazardous materials facility is
one example of this type of critical facility.
                                                                                       Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016

Essential facilities are those facilities that are vital to the continued delivery of key City services
or that may significantly impact the City’s ability to recover from the disaster. These facilities
include but are not limited to: schools (hosting shelters); buildings such as the jail, law
enforcement center, public services building, community corrections center, the courthouse, and
juvenile services building and other public facilities.

essential facilities within City of Signal Hill and the vulnerability of those facilities to the identified
hazards.

4) Risk Analysis
Estimating potential losses involves assessing the damage, injuries, and financial costs likely to
be sustained in a geographic area over a given period of time. This level of analysis involves
using mathematical models. The two measurable components of risk analysis are magnitude of
the harm that may result and the likelihood of the harm occurring. Describing vulnerability in
terms of dollar losses provides the community and the state with a common framework in which
to measure the effects of hazards on assets. For each hazard where data was available,
quantitative estimates for potential losses have been included in the hazard assessment. Data
was not available to make vulnerability determinations in terms of dollar losses for all of the
identified hazards. The Mitigation Actions Matrix includes an action item to conduct such an
assessment in the future.
5) Assessing Vulnerability/ Analyzing Development Trends
This step provides a general description of City facilities and contents in relation to the identified
hazards so that mitigation options can be considered in land use planning and future land use
decisions. This Mitigation Plan provides comprehensive description of the character of the City
of Signal Hill in the Community Profile Section. This description includes the geography and
environment, population and demographics, land use and development, housing and community
development, employment and industry, and transportation and commuting patterns. Analyzing
these components of the City of Signal Hill can help in identifying potential problem areas and
can serve as a guide for incorporating the goals and ideas contained in this mitigation plan into
other community development plans.
Hazard assessments are subject to the availability of hazard-specific data. Gathering data for a
hazard assessment requires a commitment of resources on the part of participating organizations
and agencies. Each hazard-specific section of the plan includes a section on hazard identification
using data and information from City, County, state, or federal sources.
Regardless of the data available for hazard assessments, there are numerous strategies the City
can take to reduce risk. These strategies are described in the action items detailed in the
Mitigation Actions Matrix in the Mitigation Strategies Section. Mitigation strategies can further
reduce disruption to critical services, reduce the risk to human life, and alleviate damage to
personal and public property and infrastructure.
Land and Development
The City of Signal Hill General Plan provides the framework for the growth and development of
the City. This Plan is one of the City's most important tools in addressing environmental
challenges including transportation and air quality; growth management; conservation of natural
resources; clean water and open spaces.
According to the City’s General Plan - Land Use Element (2001), Signal Hill's land use pattern is
well established and it is not anticipated to change materially over time. New development will
occur within the vacant oil field areas and to a lesser extent in-fill development is anticipated in
established neighborhoods. Significant constraints to development of the "oil patch" will continue
to limit the availability of development sites and the rate of development. These constraints
include: ongoing oil field operations, steep slopes, unsuitable soils, environmental contamination,
lack of existing utility systems or the need to upgrade existing systems, small lot sizes, complex

property ownership patterns, and a reluctance by traditional lending institutions to finance
development of environmentally impacted properties.
Impacts to Types of Land Uses
City of Signal Hill’s General Plan identifies primarily residential land uses with other land uses
consisting of commercial, industrial, public institutional, and open space.

Earthquake Hazards
Previous Occurrences of Earthquakes in the City of Signal Hill
Q&A | ELEMENT B: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT | B2
Q: B2. Does the Plan include information on previous occurrences of hazard events and on the
probability of future hazard events for each jurisdiction? (Requirement §201.6(c)(2)(i))
A: See Previous Occurrences of Earthquakes in the City of Signal Hill below.
The following earthquake events significantly impacted the region surrounding the City of Signal
Hill.
In January 1994, the magnitude 6.7 Northridge
Earthquake (thrust fault) which produced severe ground
motion, caused 57 deaths, 9,253 injuries and left over
20,000 displaced. Scientists have stated that such
devastating shaking should be considered the norm
near any large thrust earthquake. Recent reports from
scientists of the U.S. Geological Survey and the
Southern California Earthquake Center say that the Los
Angeles Area could expect one earthquake every year
of magnitude 5.0 or more for the foreseeable future.
Since the writing of the 2012 Mitigation Plan, there have
been no significant earthquake events in the City of Signal Hill.
Previous Occurrences of Earthquakes in Los Angeles County
Southern California has a history of powerful and relatively frequent earthquakes, dating back to
the powerful magnitude 8.0+ 1857 San Andreas Earthquake which did substantial damage to the
relatively few buildings that existed at the time.
Paleoseismological research indicates that large magnitude (8.0+) earthquakes occur on the San
Andreas Fault at intervals between 45 and 332 years with an average interval of 140 years. Other
lesser faults have also caused very damaging earthquakes since 1857. Notable earthquakes
include the 1933 Long Beach Earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando Earthquake, the 1987 Whittier
Earthquake and the 1994 Northridge Earthquake.
Local Conditions
According to the City of Signal Hill General Plan - Safety Element (2016), Signal Hill is located in
a seismically active region, and major regional faults create the risk of substantial earth shaking
and potential ground rupture in the area. Within Los Angeles County, there are over 50 active
and potentially active fault segments, an undetermined number of buried faults, and at least 4
blind-thrust faults capable of producing damaging earthquakes.
Several active faults have been identified within close proximity or within the City boundaries
which, most importantly, indicates that the community falls under the State Earthquake Fault
                                                                          Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016
                                                                                   Earthquake Hazards
                                                                                                 - 44 -

Zoning Act and the State Hazards Mapping Act. These Acts require that local governments, in
the general plan update process, adopt policies and criteria to ensure the structural adequacy of
buildings erected across active faults for human occupancy. In some cases, the development of
structures must be prohibited.
Earthquakes that could affect the City would most likely originate from the San Andreas, Newport-
Inglewood, or Puente Hills Faults. These faults are close enough in proximity or expected to
generate strong enough shaking that could affect the City.
San Andreas Fault Zone
The San Andreas Fault Zone is located approximately 40 miles northeast of the City of Signal Hill.
This fault zone extends from the Gulf of California northward to the Cape Mendocino area where
it continues northward along the ocean floor. The total length of the San Andreas Fault Zone is
approximately 750 miles. The activity of the fault has been recorded during historic events,
including the 1906 (M8.0) event in San Francisco and the 1857 (M7.9) event between Cholame
and San Bernardino, where at least 250 miles of surface rupture occurred. These seismic events
are among the most significant earthquakes in California history. Geologic evidence suggests
that the San Andreas Fault has a 50 percent chance of producing a magnitude 7.5 to 8.5 quake
(comparable to the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906) within the next 30 years.
Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone
Locally, the Newport-Inglewood Fault System cuts diagonally across Signal Hill as shown on Map:
Regional Faults. This is the most significant seismic feature in the area and is considered
seismically active. The 1933 Long Beach earthquake resulted from activity on this fault. Within
the Newport-Inglewood Fault System, five faults have been identified in and in the immediate
vicinity of Signal Hill: the Cherry Hill Fault, Pickler Fault, Northeast Flank Fault, Reservoir Hill
Fault, and Wardlow Fault. These faults are generally in a northwest-to-southeast alignment. The
Wardlow Fault is a pre-quaternary fault that has not ruptured in at least 2 million years, and is
therefore considered inactive. All other faults are considered active.
The Newport-Inglewood Fault System is a nearly linear alignment of faults extending 45 miles
along the southwestern side of the Los Angeles basin. It can be traced as a series of topographic
hills, ridges, and mesas from the Santa Monica Mountains to Newport Beach, where it trends
offshore. Structures along the zone of deformation act as groundwater barriers and, at greater
depths, as petroleum traps. Continuing seismic activity has been evidenced most prominently in
recent times by the 1920 Inglewood and 1933 Long Beach earthquakes.
Puente Hills Fault
The Puente Hills fault is located approximately 15 miles northeast of the City. According to USGS,
the Puente Hills Fault was most recently responsible for the M5.1 La Habra earthquake on March
28, 2014 which caused an estimated $2.6 million in damage. The USGS estimates that a future,
larger M7.5 earthquake along the Puente Hills fault could kill 3,000 to 18,000 people and cause
up to $250 billion in damage. In contrast, a larger M8.0 quake along the San Andreas would
cause an estimated 1,800 deaths.
Whittier Fault
                                                                          Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016

The Whittier Fault is a 25 mile right-lateral strike-slip fault that runs along the Chino Hills range
between the cities of Chino Hills and Whittier. It is estimated that this fault could generate up to
a magnitude 7.2 earthquake.

Q&A | ELEMENT B: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT | B3
Q: B3. Is there a description of each identified hazard’s impact on the community as well as an
overall summary of the community’s vulnerability for each jurisdiction? (Requirement
§201.6(c)(2)(ii))
A: See Impact of Earthquakes in the City of Signal Hill below.
Impact of Earthquakes in the City of Signal Hill
Based on the risk assessment, it is evident that earthquakes will continue to have potentially
devastating economic impacts to certain areas of the City. Impacts that are not quantified, but
can be anticipated in future events, include:
      Injury and loss of life;
      Commercial and residential structural damage;
      Disruption of and damage to public infrastructure;
      Secondary health hazards e.g. mold and mildew;
      Damage to roads/bridges resulting in loss of mobility;
      Significant economic impact (jobs, sales, tax revenue) upon the community;
      Negative impact on commercial and residential property values; and
      Significant disruption to students and teachers as temporary facilities and relocations
        would likely be needed.
Earthquake-Induced Landslides
Earthquake-induced landslides are secondary earthquake hazards that occur from ground
shaking. They can destroy the roads, buildings, utilities, and other critical facilities necessary to
respond and recover from an earthquake. Many communities in Southern California have a high
likelihood of encountering such risks, especially in areas with steep slopes.
Map: Landslide and Liquefaction Zones shows the moderate risk of earthquake-induced
landslide risk within the City. The areas found susceptible to landslides are found in the upper
reaches of Signal Hill.
Liquefaction
Liquefaction is a phenomenon in which the strength and stiffness of a soil is reduced by
earthquake shaking or other events. Liquefaction occurs in saturated soils, which are soils in
which the space between individual soil particles is completely filled with water. This water exerts
a pressure on the soil particles that influences how tightly the particles themselves are pressed
together. Prior to an earthquake, the water pressure is relatively low. However, earthquake
shaking can cause the water pressure to increase to the point where the soil particles can readily
move with respect to each other. Because liquefaction only occurs in saturated soil, its effects
are most commonly observed in low lying areas. Typically, liquefaction is associated with shallow
groundwater, which is less than 50 feet beneath the earth’s surface.
According to the City of Signal Hill General Plan - Safety Element (2016), only two small portions
of the City are considered at risk from liquefaction. One area consists of a strip of land adjacent
                                                                          Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016
                                                                                    Earthquake Hazards
                                                                                                 - 49 -

to and under the Columbia Street right-of-way (part of which is currently used for oil production)
between Atlantic and California Avenues. The second area is a narrow band along the
southwestern border of the City, adjacent to the right-of-way of the former Pacific Electric Railway.
Notably, this area of liquefaction risk includes a large portion of Chittick Field Park and Jessie
Elwin Nelson Academy located at 1951 Cherry Avenue.

Exposure
The data in this section was generated using the HAZUS-MH program for earthquakes. Once
the location and size of a hypothetical earthquake are identified, HAZUS-MH estimates the
intensity of the ground shaking, the number of buildings damaged, the number of casualties, the
amount of damage to transportation systems and utilities, the number of people displaced from
their homes, and the estimated cost of repair and clean up.
Building Inventory
HAZUS estimates approximately 77% of the building stock within the City of Signal Hill is
residential housing. In term of building construction types found in the region, wood frame
construction makes up 79% of the building inventory.
Critical Facility Inventory
HAZUS breaks critical facilities into two (2) groups: essential facilities and high potential loss
facilities (HPL). Essential facilities include hospitals, medical clinics, schools, fire stations, police
stations and emergency operations facilities. High potential loss facilities include dams, levees,
military installations, nuclear power plants and hazardous material sites.

Transportation and Utility Lifeline Inventory
Within HAZUS, the lifeline inventory is divided between transportation and utility lifeline systems.
Transportation systems include highways, railways, light rail, bus, ports, ferry and airports. Utility
systems include potable water, wastewater, natural gas, crude & refined oil, electric power and
communications.
                                                                             Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016

                                                                                                    - 52 -

Casualties
HAZUS estimates the number of people that will be injured and killed by the earthquake. The
casualties are broken down into four (4) severity levels that describe the extent of the injuries.
The levels are described as follows:
     Severity Level 1: Injuries will require medical attention but hospitalization is not needed.
     Severity Level 2: Injuries will require hospitalization but are not considered life-
         threatening
     Severity Level 3: Injuries will require hospitalization and can become life threatening if
         not promptly treated.
     Severity Level 4: Victims are killed by the earthquake.
The casualty estimates are provided for three (3) times of day: 2:00 AM, 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM.
These times represent the periods of the day that different sectors of the community are at their
peak occupancy loads. The 2:00 AM estimate considers that the residential occupancy load is
maximum, the 2:00 PM estimate considers that the educational, commercial and industrial sector
loads are maximum and 5:00 PM represents peak commute time.
Building-Related Losses
Building losses are broken into two categories: direct building losses and business interruption
losses. The direct building losses are the estimated costs to repair or replace the damage caused
to the building and its contents. The business interruption losses are the losses associated with
inability to operate a business because of the damage sustained during the earthquake. Business
interruption losses also include the temporary living expenses for those people displaced from
their homes because of the earthquake.

Structures and Building Code
The built environment is susceptible to damage from earthquakes. Buildings that collapse can
trap and bury people. Lives are at risk, and the cost to clean up the damages is great. In most
California communities, including the City of Signal Hill, many buildings were built before 1993
when building codes were not as strict. In addition, retrofitting is not required except under certain
conditions and can be expensive. Therefore, the number of buildings at risk remains high. The
California Seismic Safety Commission makes annual reports on the progress of the retrofitting of
unreinforced masonry buildings. According to the City of Signal Hill General Plan – Safety
Element (2016), all URM buildings within the City have been identified and upgraded to meet
current requirements.
Implementation of earthquake mitigation policy most often takes place at the local government
level. The City of Signal Hill Building Safety Department enforces building codes pertaining to
earthquake hazards.
Additionally, the City has implemented basic building requirements that are above and beyond
what the State demands for hazard mitigation. Newly constructed buildings in Signal Hill that are
built in an area subject to Earthquake-induced landslide or liquefaction are typically built with extra
foundation support. Such support is found in the post-tension reinforced concrete foundation; this
same technique is used by coastal cities to prevent home destruction during cases of liquefaction.
Generally, these codes seek to discourage development in areas that could be prone to flooding,

applicable construction standards are met. Developers in hazard-prone areas may be required
to retain a qualified professional engineer to evaluate level of risk on the site and recommend
appropriate mitigation measures.

Landslide Hazards
Q&A | ELEMENT B: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT | B2
Q: B2. Does the Plan include information on previous occurrences of hazard events and on the
probability of future hazard events for each jurisdiction? (Requirement §201.6(c)(2)(i))
A: See Previous Occurrences of Landslides in the City of Signal Hill below.
Previous Occurrences of Landslides in the City of Signal Hill
Signal Hill was most recently impacted in 1995 when a portion of Panorama Drive collapsed due
to undermining of the asphalt roadway by heavy rains.
Since the writing of the 2012 Mitigation Plan, there have been no significant landslide events in
the City of Signal Hill.
Local Conditions
According to the City of Signal Hill General Plan – Safety Element (2016), landslides can result
from earthquake-related ground shaking or failure of steep slopes due to water saturation or
unstable soil conditions. Landslides can overrun structures and other property, and cause human
injury or death. They can sever utility lines and block roads, thereby hindering rescue operations
following an earthquake. The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act requires identification of landslide
zones in which the stability of hill slopes must be evaluated. Areas that previously experienced
landslide movement and/or local topographic, geological, geotechnical, and groundwater
conditions may indicate the potential for future, permanent ground displacements. If confirmed
during site geotechnical analyses, site mitigation would be required.
The areas found susceptible to landslides are found in the upper reaches of Signal Hill.
Development, mostly completed over the past decade, is located both above and below areas at
risk of landslides. Geotechnical analyses were prepared for these developments, and risks
associated with landslides were mitigated to reduce their potential impacts. As shown on Map:
Landslide Hazard Areas, two areas remain with landslide potential in the city, located north of
Panorama Promenade and southwest of Sunset View Park.

Windstorm Hazards
Q&A | ELEMENT B: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT | B2
Q: B2. Does the Plan include information on previous occurrences of hazard events and on the
probability of future hazard events for each jurisdiction? (Requirement §201.6(c)(2)(i))
A: See Previous Occurrences of Windstorms in the City of Signal Hill below.
Previous Occurrences of Windstorms in the City of Signal Hill
Severe windstorms pose a significant risk to life and property in the City of Signal Hill by creating
conditions that disrupt essential systems such as public utilities, telecommunications, and
transportation routes. High winds can and do occasionally cause tornado-like damage to local
homes and businesses in and near the community. High winds have destructive impact,
especially to trees, power lines, and utility services.
Since the writing of the 2012 Mitigation Plan, there have been no significant windstorm events in
the City of Signal Hill.
Local Conditions
According to the City, Signal Hill is at increased risk of windstorm damage – especially from falling
trees.
Recent drought conditions have significantly
increased the vulnerability of trees due to lack of
necessary water. Additionally, eucalyptus trees
within Signal Hill are specifically and currently
prone to pest infestation. The infected, dying trees
are increasingly vulnerable to severe Santa Ana
wind conditions.
Historically, high wind conditions have caused
injury, death, property damage, and fanned wild
fires. Windstorms with significant intensity have
been responsible for the sinking of watercraft and
the downing of aircraft resulting in the loss of life.
The most common wind condition is a Santa Ana
Wind. This condition has generated winds that
have exceeded 100 mph. Wind velocities of up to
111 mph have been generated from the same
Santa Ana wind, resulting in the loss of life due to
flying debris.

Drought Hazards
Q&A | ELEMENT B: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT | B2
Q: B2. Does the Plan include information on previous occurrences of hazard events and on the
probability of future hazard events for each jurisdiction? (Requirement §201.6(c)(2)(i))
A: See Previous Occurrences of Drought in the City of Signal Hill below.
Previous Occurrences of Drought in the City of Signal Hill
Fortunately, there is no history of severe drought within the City of Signal Hill. Although there is
no evidence of a drought having a significant impact on the City at the current time, California as
a whole has experienced a serious drought since 2012.
Since the writing of the 2012 Mitigation Plan, there have been no significant damages to the City
from a drought.
Previous Occurrences of Drought in Los Angeles County
The region’s Mediterranean climate makes it especially susceptible to variations in rainfall.
Though the potential risk to the City of Signal Hill is in no way unique, severe water shortages
could have a bearing on the economic well-being of the community. Comparison of climate
(rainfall) records from Los Angeles with water well records beginning in 1930 from the San Gabriel
Valley indicates the existence of wet and dry cycles on a 10-year scale as well as for much longer
periods. The climate record for the Los Angeles region beginning in 1890 suggests drying
conditions over the last century. With respect to the present day, climate data also suggests that
the last significant wet period was the 1940s. Well level data and other sources seem to indicate
the historic high groundwater levels (reflecting recharge from rainfall) occurred in the same
decade. Since that time, rainfall (and groundwater level trends) appears to be in decline. This
slight declining trend, however, is not believed to be significant. Climatologists compiled rainfall
data from 96 stations in the State that spanned a 100-year period between 1890 and 1990. An
interesting note is that during the first 50 years of the reporting period, there was only one year
(1890) that had more than 35 inches of rainfall, whereas the second 50-year period recording of
5 year intervals (1941, 1958, 1978, 1982, and 1983) that exceeded 35 inches of rainfall in a single
year. The year of maximum rainfall was 1890 when the average annual rainfall was 43.11 inches.
The second wettest year on record occurred in 1983 when the State’s average was 42.75 inches.
The driest year of the 100-year reported in the study was 1924 when the State’s average rainfall
was only 10.50 inches. The region with the most stations reporting the driest year in 1924 was
the San Francisco Bay area. The second driest year was 1977 when the average was 11.57
inches. The most recent major drought (1987 to 1990) occurred at the end of a sequence of very
wet years (1978 to 1983). The debate continues whether “global warming” is occurring, and the
degree to which global climate change will have an effect on local micro-climates. The semi-arid
southwest is particularly susceptible to variations in rainfall. A study that documented annual
precipitation for California since 1600 from reconstructed tree ring data indicates that there was
a prolonged dry spell from about 1755 to 1820 in California. Fluctuations in precipitation could
contribute indirectly to a number of hazards including wildfire and the availability of water supplies.

According to the City of Signal Hill General Plan – Circulation Element (2009), the City’s primary
water supply comes from two groundwater wells located in north Long Beach. Additional water
may be purchased from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
The City has drilled a third groundwater well centrally located within Signal Hill and is in the
process of developing plans and specifications for the necessary pumping and treatment facilities.
The City has three storage reservoirs and pumping facilities, providing water for domestic
purposes and firefighting. The Gundry reservoir and pumping facility was constructed in 1929
and has a storage capacity of 4.7 million gallons. This facility is located in the northern part of the
city. Two hilltop reservoirs and pumping facilities were constructed in the late 1990s, having a
combined storage capacity of 2.6 million gallons.
A significant drought has hit the state of California since 2012. The drought has depleted reservoir
levels all across the state. In January of 2014, Governor Brown declared a state of emergency
and directed state officials to take all necessary actions to prepare for water shortages. As the
drought prolonged into 2015, to help cope with the drought, Governor Brown gave an executive
order in April 2015 which mandated a statewide 25 percent reduction in water use. In January of
2016, the DWR and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation have finalized the 2016 Drought
Contingency Plan that outlines State Water Project and Central Valley Project operations for
February 2016 to November 2016. The plan was developed in coordination with staff from State
and federal agencies. Although the drought has more significantly impacted surfaces waters and
other agencies that use water for agriculture, the City of Signal Hill is still affected by the drought,
primarily due to reduced reliability of imported water.

PART III: MITIGATION STRATEGIES
Mitigation Strategies
Overview of Mitigation Strategy
As the cost of damage from natural disasters continues to increase nationwide, the City of Signal
Hill recognizes the importance of identifying effective ways to reduce vulnerability to disasters.
Mitigation Plans assist communities in reducing risk from natural hazards by identifying resources,
information and strategies for risk reduction, while helping to guide and coordinate mitigation
activities throughout the City.
The plan provides a set of action items to reduce risk from natural hazards through education and
outreach programs, and to foster the development of partnerships. Further, the plan provides for
the implementation of preventative activities, including programs that restrict and control
development in areas subject to damage from natural hazards.
The resources and information within the Mitigation Plan:
     1. Establish a basis for coordination and collaboration among agencies and the public in the
         City of Signal Hill;
     2. Identify and prioritize future mitigation projects; and
     3. Assist in meeting the requirements of federal assistance programs
The Mitigation Plan is integrated with other City plans including the City of Signal Hill Emergency
Operations Plan, General Plan as well as department-specific standard operating procedures.
Mitigation Measure Categories
Following is FEMA’s list of mitigation categories. The activities identified by the Planning Team
are consistent with the six broad categories of mitigation actions outlined in FEMA publication
386-3 Developing the Mitigation Plan: Identifying Mitigation Actions and Implementing Strategies.
      Prevention: Government administrative or regulatory actions or processes that influence
         the way land and buildings are developed and built. These actions also include public
         activities to reduce hazard losses. Examples include planning and zoning, building codes,
         capital improvement programs, open space preservation, and storm water management
         regulations.
      Property Protection: Actions that involve modification of existing buildings or structures
         to protect them from a hazard, or removal from the hazard area. Examples include
         acquisition, elevation, relocation, structural retrofits, storm shutters, and shatter-resistant
         glass.
      Public Education and Awareness: Actions to inform and educate citizens, property
         owners, and elected officials about hazards and potential ways to mitigate them.
         Such actions include outreach projects, real estate disclosure, hazard information centers,
         and school-age and adult education programs.
      Natural Resource Protection: Actions that, in addition to minimizing hazard losses
         preserve or restore the functions of natural systems. Examples include sediment and
                                                                             Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016
                                                                                      Mitigation Strategies
                                                                                                     - 93 -

        erosion control, stream corridor restoration, watershed management, forest and
        vegetation management, and wetland restoration and preservation.
     Emergency Services: Actions that protect people and property during and immediately
        following a disaster or hazard event. Services include warning systems, emergency
        response services, and protection of critical facilities.
     Structural Projects: Actions that involve the construction of structures to reduce the
        impact of a hazard. Such structures include dams, levees, floodwalls, retaining walls, and
        safe rooms.
Q&A | ELEMENT C. MITIGATION STRATEGY | C3
Q: C3. Does the Plan include goals to reduce/avoid long-term vulnerabilities to the identified
hazards? (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(i))
A: See Goals below.
Goals
The Planning Team developed mitigation goals to avoid or reduce
long-term vulnerabilities to hazards. These general principles clarify     FEMA defines Goals as
desired outcomes.
                                                                            general guidelines that

Each goal is supported by mitigation action items. The Planning            represent global visions.
Team developed these action items through its knowledge of the
local area, risk assessment, review of past efforts, identification of
mitigation activities, and qualitative analysis.                           FEMA defines Mitigation
                                                                         Activities as specific actions
The five mitigation goals and descriptions are listed below.
                                                                          that help you achieve your

Enhance Public Awareness
Develop and implement education and outreach programs to increase public awareness of the
risks associated with natural, human-caused, and technological hazards.
Provide information on tools; partnership opportunities, and funding resources to assist in
implementing mitigation activities.
Preserve Natural Systems
Support management and land use planning practices with hazard mitigation to protect life.
Preserve, rehabilitate, and enhance natural systems to serve hazard mitigation functions.
Encourage Partnerships and Implementation
Strengthen communication and coordinate participation with public agencies, citizens, non-profit
organizations, business, and industry to support implementation.
Encourage leadership within the City and public organizations to prioritize and implement local
and regional hazard mitigation activities.
Strengthen Emergency Services
Establish policy to ensure mitigation projects for critical facilities, services, and infrastructure.
Strengthen emergency operations by increasing collaboration and coordination among public
agencies, non-profit organizations, business, and industry.
Coordinate and integrate hazard mitigation activities where appropriate, with emergency
operations plans and procedures.
The Planning Team also developed hazard-specific mitigation goals, which appear in the
Mitigation Strategies Section.
How are the Mitigation Action Items Organized?
The action items are a listing of activities in which City agencies and citizens can be engaged to
reduce risk. Each action item includes an estimate of the timeline for implementation.
The action items are organized within the following Mitigation Actions Matrix, which lists all of
the multi-hazard (actions that reduce risks for more than one specific hazard) and hazard-specific
action items included in the mitigation plan. Data collection and research and the public
participation process resulted in the development of these action items. The Matrix includes the
following information for each action item:
Funding Source
The action items can be funded through a variety of sources, possibly including: operating
budget/general fund, development fees, Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), Hazard
Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), other Grants, private funding, Capital Improvement Plan, and
other funding opportunities.

Coordinating Organization
The Mitigation Actions Matrix assigns primary responsibility for each of the action items. The
hierarchies of the assignments vary – some are positions, others departments, and other
committees. The primary responsibility for implementing the action items falls to the entity shown
as the “Coordinating Organization”. The coordinating organization is the agency with regulatory
responsibility to address hazards, or that is willing and able to organize resources, find appropriate
funding, or oversee activity implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.                  Coordinating
organizations may include local, County, or regional agencies that are capable of or responsible
for implementing activities and programs.
Plan Goals Addressed
The plan goals addressed by each action item are included as a way to monitor and evaluate how
well the mitigation plan is achieving its goals once implementation begins.
The plan goals are organized into the following five areas:
       Protect Life and Property
       Enhance Public Awareness
       Preserve Natural Systems
       Encourage Partnerships and Implementation
       Strengthen Emergency Services

Q&A | ELEMENT C. MITIGATION STRATEGY | C5
Q: C5. Does the Plan contain an action plan that describes how the actions identified will be
prioritized (including cost benefit review), implemented, and administered by each jurisdiction?
(Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(iv)); (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(iii))
A: See Priority Ratings below.
Benefit/Cost Ratings
The benefits of proposed projects were weighed against estimated costs as part of the project
prioritization process. The benefit/cost analysis was not of the detailed variety required by FEMA
for project grant eligibility under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) and Pre-Disaster
Mitigation (PDM) grant program. A less formal approach was used because some projects may
not be implemented for up to 10 years, and associated costs and benefits could change
dramatically in that time. Therefore, a review of the apparent benefits versus the apparent cost
of each project was performed. Parameters were established for assigning subjective ratings
(high, medium, and low) to the costs and benefits of these projects.
Cost ratings were defined as follows:
         High: Existing jurisdictional funding will not cover the cost of the action item so other
         sources of revenue would be required.
         Medium: The action item could be funded through existing jurisdictional funding but would
         require budget modifications.
         Low: The action item could be funded under existing jurisdictional funding.
Benefit ratings were defined as follows:
         High: The action item will provide short-term and long-term impacts on the reduction of
         risk exposure to life and property.
         Medium: The action item will have long-term impacts on the reduction of risk exposure to
         life and property.
         Low: The action item will have only short-term impacts on the reduction of risk exposure
         to life and property.
                                                                          Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016
                                                                                   Mitigation Strategies
                                                                                                  - 97 -

Priority Rating
Going beyond rating “benefit and cost”, the Planning Team adopted the following process for
rating the “priority” of each mitigation action item. Designations of “High”, “Medium”, and “Low”
priority have been assigned to each action item using the following criteria:
  Does the Action:
        solve the problem?
        address Vulnerability Assessment?
        reduce the exposure or vulnerability to the highest priority hazard?
        address multiple hazards?
        benefits equal or exceed costs?
        implement a goal, policy, or project identified in the General Plan or Capital
           Improvement Plan?
  Can the Action:
        be implemented with existing funds?
        be implemented by existing state or federal grant programs?
        be completed within the 5-year life cycle of the LHMP?
        be implemented with currently available technologies?
  Will the Action:
        be accepted by the community?
        be supported by community leaders?
        adversely impact segments of the population or neighborhoods?
        require a change in local ordinances or zoning laws?
        positive or neutral impact on the environment?
        comply with all local, state and federal environmental laws and regulations?
  Is there:
        sufficient staffing to undertake the project?
        existing authority to undertake the project?
  As mitigation action items were updated or written the Planning Team, representatives
  were provided worksheets for each of their assigned action items. Answers to the
  criteria above determined the priority according to the following scale.
          1-6 = Low priority
          7-12 = Medium priority
          13-18 = High priority
                                                                          Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016

conjunction with the construction of
a new VHF-trunked radio system.
The new system will feature a
combined ECC dispatch facility
with a ten (10) workstation design
to serve all public safety and local
government agencies. The center’s
operation will be CAD based with
Enhanced 9-1-1 interface that
includes hard wire and wireless
call number and location
identification using a GIS/GPS
digital mapping component. An
optional feature for mobile units will
include mobile data transmission
capability using mobile mounted
laptops to provide rapid access to
information critical to most
emergency response incidents.

Plan Maintenance
The plan maintenance process includes a schedule for monitoring and evaluating the Plan
annually and producing a plan revision every five years. This section describes how the City will
integrate public participation throughout the plan maintenance process.

Monitoring and Implementing the Plan
Plan Adoption
Adoption of the Mitigation Plan by the City’s governing body is one of the prime requirements for
approval of the plan. Once the plan is completed, the City Council will be responsible for adopting
the Mitigation Plan. The governing body has the responsibility and authority to promote sound
public policy regarding hazards. The local agency governing body will have the authority to
periodically update the plan as it is revised to meet changes in the hazard risks and exposures in
the City. The approved Mitigation Plan will be significant in the future growth and development of
the City.
The City Council will be responsible for adopting the Mitigation Plan. This governing body has
the authority to promote sound public policy regarding hazards. Once the plan has been adopted,
the Local Mitigation Officer will be responsible for submitting it to the State Hazard Mitigation
Officer at California Emergency Management Agency (Cal OES). Cal OES will then submit the
plan to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for review and approval. This
review will address the requirements set forth in 44 C.F.R. Section 201.6 (Local Mitigation Plans).
Upon acceptance by FEMA, City of Signal Hill will gain eligibility for Hazard Mitigation Grant
Program funds.

Local Mitigation Officer
Under the direction of the Local Mitigation Officer, the Planning Team will take responsibility for
plan maintenance and implementation. The Local Mitigation Officer will facilitate the Planning
Team meetings and will assign tasks such as updating and presenting the Plan to the members
of the Planning Team. Plan implementation and evaluation will be a shared responsibility among
all of the Planning Team members. The Local Mitigation Officer will coordinate with City
leadership to ensure funding for 5-year updates to Plan as required by FEMA.
The Planning Team will be responsible for coordinating implementation of plan action items and
undertaking the formal review process. The Local Mitigation Officer will be authorized to make
changes in assignments to the current Planning Team.
The Planning Team will meet no less than quarterly. Meeting dates will be scheduled once the
final Planning Team has been established. These meetings will provide an opportunity to discuss
the progress of the action items and maintain the partnerships that are essential for the
sustainability of the mitigation plan.
Q&A | ELEMENT C. MITIGATION STRATEGY | C6
Q: C6. Does the Plan describe a process by which local governments will integrate the
requirements of the mitigation plan into other planning mechanisms, such as comprehensive or
capital improvement plans, when appropriate? (Requirement §201.6(c)(4)(ii))
A: See Implementation through Existing Program below.
Implementation through Existing Programs
The City of Signal Hill addresses statewide planning goals and legislative requirements through
its General Plan, its Capital Improvement Plan, and California Building and Safety Codes. The
Mitigation Plan provides a series of recommendations - many of which are closely related to the
goals and objectives of existing planning programs. The City of Signal Hill will implement
recommended mitigation action items through existing programs and procedures.
The City of Signal Hill Building Safety Department is responsible for adhering to the State of
California’s Building and Safety Codes. In addition, the Planning Team will work with other
agencies at the state level to review, develop and ensure Building and Safety Codes are adequate
to mitigate or present damage by hazards. This is to ensure that life-safety criteria are met for
new construction.
Some of the goals and action items in the Mitigation Plan will be achieved through activities
recommended in the CIP. Various City departments develop the CIP and review it on an annual
basis. Upon annual review of the CIP, the Planning Team will work with the City departments to
identify areas that the Mitigation Plan action items are consistent with CIP goals and integrate
them where appropriate.
Upon FEMA approval, the Planning Team will begin the process of incorporating existing planning
mechanisms at the City level. The meetings of the Planning Team will provide an opportunity for
Planning Team members to report back on the progress made on the integration of mitigation
planning elements into City planning documents and procedures.

Economic Analysis of Mitigation Projects
FEMA's approach to identify the costs and benefits associated with hazard mitigation strategies,
measures, or projects fall into two general categories: benefit/cost analysis and cost-effectiveness
analysis.
Conducting benefit/cost analysis for a mitigation activity can assist communities in determining
whether a project is worth undertaking now, in order to avoid disaster-related damages later.
Cost-effectiveness analysis evaluates how best to spend a given amount of money to achieve a
specific goal. Determining the economic feasibility of mitigating hazards can provide decision-
makers with an understanding of the potential benefits and costs of an activity, as well as a basis
upon which to compare alternative projects.
Given federal funding, the Planning Team will use a FEMA-approved benefit/cost analysis
approach to identify and prioritize mitigation action items. For other projects and funding sources,
the Planning Team will use other approaches to understand the costs and benefits of each action
item and develop a prioritized list.
The “benefit” and “cost” of each mitigation action item was included in the Mitigation Actions Matrix
located in Part III: Mitigation Strategies. A more technical assessment will be required in the event
grant funding is pursued through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. FEMA Benefit-Cost
Analysis Guidelines are discussed below.
FEMA Benefit-Cost Analysis Guidelines
The Stafford Act authorizes the President to establish a program to provide technical and financial
assistance to state and local governments to assist in the implementation of hazard mitigation
measures that are cost effective and designed to substantially reduce injuries, loss of life,
hardship, or the risk of future damage and destruction of property. To evaluate proposed hazard
mitigation projects prior to funding FEMA requires a Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) to validate cost
effectiveness. BCA is the method by which the future benefits of a mitigation project are estimated
and compared to its cost. The end result is a benefit-cost ratio (BCR), which is derived from a
project’s total net benefits divided by its total project cost. The BCR is a numerical expression of
the cost effectiveness of a project. A project is considered to be cost effective when the BCR is
1.0 or greater, indicating the benefits of a prospective hazard mitigation project are sufficient to
justify the costs.
Although the preparation of a BCA is a technical process, FEMA has
developed software, written materials, and training to support the effort
and assist with estimating the expected future benefits over the useful life
of a retrofit project. It is imperative to conduct a BCA early in the project
development process to ensure the likelihood of meeting the cost-
effective eligibility requirement in the Stafford Act.
The BCA program consists of guidelines, methodologies and software
modules for a range of major natural hazards including:
     Flood (Riverine, Coastal Zone A, Coastal Zone V)
     Hurricane Wind
     Hurricane Safe Room
                                                                           Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016
                                                                                       Plan Maintenance
                                                                                                - 129 -

         Damage-Frequency Assessment
         Tornado Safe Room
         Earthquake
         Wildfire
The BCA program provides up to date program data, up to date default and standard values, user
manuals and training. Overall, the program makes it easier for users and evaluators to conduct
and review BCAs and to address multiple buildings and hazards in a single BCA module run.
Q&A | ELEMENT A: PLANNING PROCESS | A6
Q: A6. Is there a description of the method and schedule for keeping the plan current
(monitoring, evaluating and updating the mitigation plan within a 5-year cycle)? (Requirement
§201.6(c)(4)(i))
A: See Evaluating and Updating the Plan below.
Evaluating and Updating the Plan
Formal Review Process
The Mitigation Plan will be evaluated on an annual basis to determine the effectiveness of
programs, and to reflect changes in land development or programs that may affect mitigation
priorities. The evaluation process includes a firm schedule and timeline, and identifies the
agencies and organizations participating in plan evaluation. The Local Mitigation Officer or
designee will be responsible for contacting the Planning Team members and organizing the
annual meeting. Planning Team members will be responsible for monitoring and evaluating the
progress of the mitigation strategies in the Plan.
The Planning Team will review the goals and action items to determine their relevance to changing
situations in the City, as well as changes in State or Federal policy, and to ensure they are
addressing current and expected conditions. The Planning Team will also review the Risk
Assessment portion of the Plan to determine if this information should be updated or modified,
given any new available data. The coordinating organizations responsible for the various action
items will report on the status of their projects, the success of various implementation processes,
difficulties encountered, success of coordination efforts, and which strategies should be revised.
The Local Mitigation Officer will assign the duty of updating the Plan to one or more of the Planning
Team members. The designated Planning Team members will have three months to make
appropriate changes to the Plan before submitting it to the Planning Team members. The
Planning Team will also notify all holders of the City plan when changes have been made. Every
five years the updated plan will be submitted to the State Hazard Mitigation Officer at the California
Office of Emergency Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for review.
At each of the quarterly Planning Team meetings, the Local Mitigation Officer will facilitate a
discussion on each section of the FEMA-approved Plan:
          Planning Process – Update as necessary, including regulatory changes.
                                                                           Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016

        Risk Assessment - Determine if this information should be updated or modified, given
        any new available data.
        Mitigation Strategies - Review the goals and action items to determine their relevance
        to changing situations in the City, as well as changes in State or Federal policy, and to
        ensure they are addressing current and expected conditions. Most importantly, is the
        thorough review of the Mitigation Action Matrix. The coordinating organizations
        responsible for the various action items will report on the status of their projects, the
        success of various implementation processes, difficulties encountered, success of
        coordination efforts, and which strategies should be revised.
The Local Mitigation Officer will assign the duty of updating the Plan to one or more of the Planning

Q&A | ELEMENT A: PLANNING PROCESS | A5
Q: A5. Is there discussion of how the community will continue public participation in the plan
maintenance process? (Requirement §201.6(c)(4)(iii))
A: See Continued Public Involvement below.
Continued Public Involvement
The City of Signal Hill is dedicated to involving the public directly in the continual review and
updates to the Mitigation Plan. Copies of the plan will be catalogued and made available at City
Hall and at all City operated public libraries. The existence and location of these copies will be
publicized in City newsletters and on the City website. This site will also contain an email address
and phone number where people can direct their comments and concerns. A public meeting will
also be held after each evaluation or when deemed necessary by the Planning Team. The
meetings will provide the public a forum in which they can express their concerns, opinions, or
ideas about the Plan.
The Local Mitigation Officer will be responsible for using City resources to publicize the annual
public meetings and maintain public involvement through the public access channel, web page,
and newspapers.

PART IV: APPENDIX
General Hazard Overviews
Earthquake Hazards
Measuring and Describing Earthquakes
An earthquake is a sudden motion or trembling that is caused by a release of strain accumulated
within or along the edge of the Earth's tectonic plates. The effects of an earthquake can be felt
far beyond the site of its occurrence. They usually occur without warning and, after just a few
seconds, can cause massive damage and extensive casualties. Common effects of earthquakes
are ground motion and shaking, surface fault ruptures, and ground failure. Ground motion is the
vibration or shaking of the ground during an earthquake. When a fault ruptures, seismic waves
radiate, causing the ground to vibrate. The severity of the vibration increases with the amount of
energy released and decreases with distance from the causative fault or epicenter. Soft soils can
further amplify ground motions. The severity of these effects is dependent on the amount of
energy released from the fault or epicenter. One way to express an earthquake's severity is to
compare its acceleration to the normal acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration due to gravity
is often called "g". A ground motion with a peak ground acceleration of 100%g is very severe.
Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) is a measure of the strength of ground motion. PGA is used to
                               project the risk of damage from future earthquakes by showing
                               earthquake ground motions that have a specified probability (10%,
     When a fault ruptures,    5%, or 2%) of being exceeded in 50 years. These ground motion
                               values are used for reference in construction design for earthquake
     seismic waves radiate,    resistance. The ground motion values can also be used to assess
     causing the ground to     relative hazard between sites, when making economic and safety
                               decisions.
  vibrate. The severity of the
    vibration increases with   Another tool used to describe earthquake intensity is the Magnitude
                               Scale. The Magnitude Scale is sometimes referred to as the Richter
      the amount of energy
                               Scale. The two are similar but not exactly the same. The Magnitude
    released and decreases     Scale was devised as a means of rating earthquake strength and is
                               an indirect measure of seismic energy released. The Scale is
     with distance from the
                               logarithmic with each one-point increase corresponding to a 10-fold
        causative fault or     increase in the amplitude of the seismic shock waves generated by
                               the earthquake. In terms of actual energy released, however, each
            epicenter.         one-point increase on the Richter scale corresponds to about a 32-
                               fold increase in energy released. Therefore, a Magnitude 7 (M7)
earthquake is 100 times (10 X 10) more powerful than a M5 earthquake and releases 1,024 times
(32 X 32) the energy.
An earthquake generates different types of seismic shock waves that travel outward from the
focus or point of rupture on a fault. Seismic waves that travel through the earth's crust are called
body waves and are divided into primary (P) and secondary (S) waves. Because P waves move
faster (1.7 times) than S waves, they arrive at the seismograph first. By measuring the time delay
between arrival of the P and S waves and knowing the distance to the epicenter, seismologists
can compute the magnitude for the earthquake.
                                                                          Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016
                                                                              General Hazard Overviews
                                                                                               - 133 -
The duration of an earthquake is related to its magnitude but not in a perfectly strict sense. There
are two ways to think about the duration of an earthquake. The first is the length of time it takes
for the fault to rupture and the second is the length of time shaking is felt at any given point (e.g.
when someone says "I felt it shake for 10 seconds" they are making a statement about the
duration of shaking). (Source: www.usgs.gov)
The Modified Mercalli Scale (MMI) is another means for rating earthquakes, but one that attempts
to quantify intensity of ground shaking. Intensity under this scale is a function of distance from
the epicenter (the closer to the epicenter the greater the intensity), ground acceleration, duration
of ground shaking, and degree of structural damage. The Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale below
rates the level of severity of an earthquake by the amount of damage and perceived shaking.

Earthquake Related Hazards
Ground shaking, landslides, liquefaction, and amplification are the specific hazards associated
with earthquakes. The severity of these hazards depends on several factors, including soil and
slope conditions, proximity to the fault, earthquake magnitude, and the type of earthquake.
Ground Shaking
Ground shaking is the motion felt on the earth's surface caused by seismic waves generated by
the earthquake. It is the primary cause of earthquake damage. The strength of ground shaking
depends on the magnitude of the earthquake, the type of fault, and distance from the epicenter
(where the earthquake originates). Buildings on poorly consolidated and thick soils will typically
see more damage than buildings on consolidated soils and bedrock.
Seismic activity along nearby or more distant fault zones are likely to cause ground shaking within
the City limits.
Earthquake-Induced Landslide Potential
Generally, these types of failures consist of rock falls, disrupted soil slides, rock slides, soil lateral
spreads, soil slumps, soil block slides, and soil avalanches. Areas having the potential for
earthquake-induced landslides generally occur in areas of previous landslide movement, or where
local topographic, geological, geotechnical, and subsurface water conditions indicate a potential
for permanent ground displacements.
Liquefaction
Liquefaction occurs when ground shaking causes wet granular soils to change from a solid state
to a liquid state. This results in the loss of soil strength and the soil's ability to support weight.
Buildings and their occupants are at risk when the ground can no longer support these structures.
Liquefaction generally occurs during significant earthquake activity, and structures located on
soils such as silt or sand may experience significant damage during an earthquake due to the
instability of structural foundations and the moving earth. Many communities in Southern
California are built on ancient river bottoms and have sandy soil. In some cases, the soil may be
subject to liquefaction, depending on the depth of the water table.

Landslide Hazards
Hazard Characteristics
Landslides are a serious geologic hazard in almost every state in America. Nationally, landslides
cause 25 to 50 deaths each year. The best estimate of direct and indirect costs of landslide
damage in the United States range between $1 and $2 billion annually. As a seismically active
region, California has a significant number of locations impacted by landslides. Some landslides
result in private property damage; other landslides impact transportation corridors, fuel and
energy conduits, and communication facilities. They can also pose a serious threat to human life.
Landslides can be broken down into two categories: 1) rapidly moving (generally known as debris
flows), and; 2) slow moving. Rapidly moving landslides or debris flows present the greatest risk
to human life, and people living in or traveling through areas prone to rapidly moving landslides,
are at increased risk of serious injury. Slow moving landslides can cause significant property
damage, but are less likely to result in serious human injuries.
The primary effects of mudslides/landslides include: abrupt depression and lateral displacement
of hillside surfaces over distances of up to several hundreds of feet, disruption of surface drainage,
blockage of flood control channels and roadways, displacement or destruction of improvements
such as roadways, buildings, and water wells.
Historic Southern California Landslides
1928 St. Francis Dam
Cost, $672.1 million (2000 Dollars) The dam, located in Los Angeles County, gave way on March
12, and its waters swept through the Santa Clara Valley toward the Pacific Ocean, about 54 miles
away. Sixty-five miles of valley was devastated, and over 500 people were killed.
1956 Portuguese Bend
Cost, $14.6 million (2000 Dollars) California Highway 14, Palos Verdes Hills. Land use on the
Palos Verdes Peninsula consists mostly of single-family homes built on large lots, many of which
have panoramic ocean views. All of the houses were constructed with individual septic systems,
generally consisting of septic tanks and seepage pits. Landslides have been active here for
thousands of years, but recent landslide activity has been attributed in part to human activity. The
Portuguese Bend Landslide began its modern movement in August 1956, when displacement
was noticed at its northeast margin. Movement gradually extended downslope so that the entire
eastern edge of the slide mass was moving within 6 weeks. By the summer of 1957, the entire
slide mass was sliding towards the sea.
1958-1971 Pacific Palisades
Cost, $29.1 million (2000 Dollars) California Highway 1 and house damaged.
1961 Mulholland Cut
Cost, $41.5 million (2000 Dollars) On Interstate 405, 11 miles north of Santa Monica, Los Angeles
County.
                                                                            Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016

1963 Baldwin Hills Dam
Cost, $50 million (1963 Dollars) On December 14, the 650-foot-long by 155-foot-high earth fill
dam gave way and sent 360 million gallons of water in a 50-foot-high wall cascading onto the
community below, killing five persons.
1969 Glendora
Cost, $26.9 million (2000 Dollars) Los Angeles County, 175 houses damaged, mainly by debris
flows.
1969 Seventh Ave., Los Angeles County
Cost, $14.6 million (2000 Dollars) California Highway 60.
1970 Princess Park
Cost, $29.1 million (2000 Dollars) California Highway 14, ten miles north of Newhall, near Saugus,
northern Los Angeles County.
1971 Upper and Lower Van Norman Dams, San Fernando
Cost, $302.4 million (2000 Dollars) Earthquake-induced landslides. Damage due to the February
9, 1971, Magnitude 7.5 San Fernando, Earthquake.
The earthquake of February 9 severely damaged the Upper and Lower Van Norman Dams.
1971 Juvenile Hall, San Fernando
Cost, $266.6 million (2000 Dollars) Landslides caused by the February 9, 1971, San Fernando
earthquake. In addition to damaging the San Fernando Juvenile Hall, this 1.2 km-long slide
damaged trunk lines of the Southern Pacific Railroad, San Fernando Boulevard, Interstate
Highway 5, the Sylmar electrical converter station, and several pipelines and canals.
1977-1980 Monterey Park, Repetto Hills, Los Angeles County
Cost, $14.6 million (2000 Dollars) 100 houses damaged in 1980 due to debris flows.
1978 Bluebird Canyon Orange County
Cost, $52.7 million (2000 Dollars) October 2, 60 houses destroyed or damaged. Unusually heavy
rains in March of 1978 may have contributed to initiation of the landslide. Although the 1978 slide
area was approximately 3.5 acres, it is suspected to be a portion of a larger, ancient landslide.
1979 Big Rock, California, Los Angeles County
Cost, $1.08 billion (2000 Dollars) California Highway 1 rockslide.
1980 Southern California Slides
Cost, $1.1 billion in damage (2000 Dollars) Heavy winter rainfall in 1979-90 caused damage in
six Southern California counties. In 1980, the rainstorm started on February 8. A sequence of 5
days of continuous rain and 7 inches of precipitation had occurred by February 14. Slope failures
were beginning to develop by February 15 and then very high-intensity rainfall occurred on
                                                                          Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016

February 16. As much as eight inches of rain fell
in a six-hour period in many locations. Records
and personal observations in the field on February
16 and 17 showed that the mountains and slopes
literally fell apart on those two days.
1983 San Clemente, Orange County
Cost, $65 million (2000 Dollars), California
Highway 1.         Litigation at that time involved
approximately $43.7 million (2000).
1983 Big Rock Mesa
Cost, $706 million (2000 Dollars) in legal claims
condemnation of 13 houses, and 300 more
threatened rockslide caused by rainfall.
1978-1980 San Diego County
Experienced major damage from storms in 1978, 1979, and 1979-80, as did neighboring areas of
Los Angeles and Orange County. One hundred and twenty landslides were reported to have
occurred in San Diego County during these 2 years. Rainfall for the rainy seasons of 78-79 and
79-80 was 14.82 and 15.61 inches (37.6 and 39.6 cm) respectively, compared to a 125-year
average (1850-1975) of 9.71 inches (24.7 cm). Significant landslides occurred in the Friars
Formation, a unit that was noted as slide-prone in the Seismic Safety Study for the City of San
Diego. Of the nine landslides that caused damage in excess of $1 million, seven occurred in the
Friars Formation, and two in the Santiago Formation in the northern part of San Diego County.
1994 Northridge Earthquake Landslides
As a result of the Magnitude 6.7 Northridge Earthquake,
more than 11,000 landslides occurred over an area of
10,000 km2. Most were in the Santa Susana Mountains
and in mountains north of the Santa Clara River Valley.
Destroyed dozens of homes, blocked roads, and
damaged oil-field infrastructure. Caused deaths from
Coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) the spore of which
was released from the soil and blown toward the coastal
populated areas. The spore was released from the soil
by the landslide activity.
March 1995 Los Angeles and Ventura Counties
Above normal rainfall triggered damaging debris flows, deep-seated landslides, and flooding.
Several deep-seated landslides were triggered by the storms, the most notable was the La
Conchita landslide, which in combination with a local debris flow, destroyed or badly damaged 11
to 12 homes in the small town of La Conchita, about 20 km west of Ventura. There also was
widespread debris-flow and flood damage to homes, commercial buildings, and roads and
highways in areas along the Malibu coast that had been devastated by wildfire two years before.

On January 10, 2005, a landslide once again struck the community of La Conchita, killing ten
people and destroying or seriously damaging 36 houses.
Landslide Characteristics
What is a landslide?
“A landslide is defined as, the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth movement down a
slope. Landslides are a type of “mass wasting” which denotes any down slope movement of soil
and rock under the direct influence of gravity. The term “landslide” encompasses events such as
rock falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows.
Landslides are initiated by rainfall, earthquakes, volcanic activity, changes in groundwater,
disturbance and change of a slope by human-caused construction activities, or any combination
of these factors. Landslides also occur underwater, causing tidal waves and damage to coastal
areas. These landslides are called submarine landslides.”
The size of a landslide usually depends on the geology and the initial cause of the landslide.
Landslides vary greatly in their volume of rock and soil, the length, width, and depth of the area
affected, frequency of occurrence, and speed of movement. Some characteristics that determine
the type of landslide are slope of the hillside, moisture content, and the nature of the underlying
materials. Landslides are given different names, depending on the type of failure, and their
composition and characteristics.
Slides move in contact with the underlying surface. These movements include rotational slides
where sliding material moves along a curved surface and translational slides where movement
occurs along a flat surface. These slides are generally slow moving and can be deep. Slumps
are small rotational slides that are generally shallow. Slow-moving landslides occur on relatively
gentle slopes and cause significant property damage, but are far less likely to result in serious
injuries than rapidly moving landslides.
What is a Debris Flow?
A debris or mud flow is a river of rock, earth and other materials, including vegetation that is
saturated with water. This high percentage of water gives the debris flow a very rapid rate of
movement down a slope. Debris flows move with speeds greater than 20 miles per hour, and
often move much faster. This high rate of speed makes debris flows extremely dangerous to
people and property in its path.

Areas Particularly Susceptible to Landslides
Locations at risk from landslides or debris flows include areas with one or more of the following
conditions:
     On or close to steep hills
     Steep road-cuts or excavations
     Existing landslides or places of known historic landslides (such sites often have tilted
         power lines, trees tilted in various directions, cracks in the ground, and irregular-surfaced
         ground)
     Steep areas where surface runoff is channeled, such as below culverts, V-shaped valleys,
         canyon bottoms, and steep stream channels
     Fan-shaped areas of sediment and boulder accumulation at the outlets of canyons
     Canyon areas below hillside and mountains that recently (within 1-6 years) were subjected
         to a wildland fire
Excavation and Grading
Slope excavation is common in the development of home sites or roads on sloping terrain.
Grading these slopes results in slopes that are steeper than the pre-existing natural slopes. Since
slope steepness is a major factor in landslides, these steeper slopes are at an increased risk for
landslides.
The added weight of fill placed on slopes also results in an increased landslide hazard. Small
landslides are fairly common along roads, in either the road cut or the road fill. Landslides
occurring below new construction sites are indicators of the potential impacts stemming from
excavation.
Drainage and Groundwater Alterations
Water flowing through or above ground, is often the trigger for landslides. Any activity that
increases the amount of water flowing into landslide-prone slopes increases landslide hazards.
Broken or leaking water or sewer lines can be especially problematic, as does water retention
facilities that direct water onto slopes. However, even lawn irrigation in landslide prone locations
results in damaging landslides. Ineffective storm water management and excess runoff also
cause erosion, and increase the risk of landslide hazards. Drainage is affected, naturally by the
geology and topography of an area. Development that results in an increase in impervious
surface impairs the ability of the land to absorb water and redirects water to other areas.
Channels, streams, ponding, and erosion on slopes indicate potential slope problems.
Road and driveway drains, gutters, downspouts, and other constructed drainage facilities
concentrates and accelerates flow. Ground saturation and concentrated velocity flow are major
causes of slope problems and triggers landslides.
Changes in Vegetation
Removing vegetation from very steep slopes increases landslide hazards. Areas that experience
wildfire and land clearing for development may have long periods of increased landslide hazard.
Also, certain types of ground cover require constant watering to remain green. Changing away
from native ground cover plants increases the risk of landslide.

Windstorm Hazards
Hazard Characteristics
Santa Ana wind conditions results in two general
disaster conditions. The most common is fire
fanned by the high winds. This was the situation
in 1993 in Laguna Beach when a massive fire
destroyed a number of homes in the surrounding
hills. Wind driven flames again caused the
destruction of more than 3,000 homes in
Southern California in October, 2003. Other
forms of disaster would be direct building
damage, damage to utilities and infrastructure as
a result of the high winds. This has occurred in
the past few years in many southland
communities including Los Angeles County.
Santa Ana winds commonly occur between
October and February, with December having
the highest frequency of events. Summer events
are rare. Wind speeds are typically north to east at 35 knots through and below passes, and
canyons with gusts to 50 knots. Stronger Santa Ana winds has gusts greater than 60 knots over
widespread areas, and gusts greater than 100 knots in favored areas. Frequently, the strongest
winds in the basin occur during the night and morning hours due to the absence of a sea breeze.
The sea breeze which typically blows onshore daily, can moderate the Santa Ana winds during
the late morning and afternoon hours. Santa Ana winds are an important forecast challenge
because of the high fire danger associated with them. Also, unusually high surf conditions on the
northeast side of the Channel Islands normally accompany a Santa Ana event.
The Beaufort Scale below, coined and developed by Sir Francis Beaufort in 1805, illustrates the
effect that varying wind speed can have on sea swells and structures:

Santa Ana Winds and Tornado-Like Wind Activity
Based on local history, most incidents of high wind in the City of Signal Hill are the result of the
Santa Ana and El Niño related wind conditions. While high impact wind incidents are not frequent
in the area, significant wind events and sporadic tornado activity have been known to negatively
impact the City. In addition, the City is increasingly concerned with “global warming” ramifications
and potential increases in wind related events.
What are Santa Ana Winds?
“Santa Ana winds are generally defined as warm, dry winds that blow from the east or northeast
(offshore). These winds occur below the passes and canyons of the coastal ranges of Southern
California and in the Los Angeles and Orange County basins. Santa Ana winds often blow with
exceptional speed in the Santa Ana Canyon (the canyon from which it derives its name).
Forecasters at the National Weather Service offices in Oxnard and San Diego usually place speed
minimums on these winds and reserve the use of "Santa Ana" for winds greater than 25 knots.”
These winds accelerate to speeds of 35 knots as they move through canyons and passes, with
gusts to 50 or even 60 knots.
“The complex topography of Southern California combined with various atmospheric conditions
create numerous scenarios that may cause widespread or isolated Santa Ana events.
Commonly, Santa Ana winds develop when a region of high pressure builds over the Great Basin
(the high plateau east of the Sierra Mountains and west of the Rocky Mountains including most
of Nevada and Utah). Clockwise circulation around the center of this high pressure area forces
air downslope from the high plateau. The air warms as it descends toward the California coast at
the rate of five degrees F per 1,000 feet due to compressional heating. Thus, compressional
heating provides the primary source of warming. The air is dry since it originated in the desert,
and it dries out even more as it is heated.”

                                                                                                           - 143 -

These regional winds typically occur from October to March, and, according to most accounts are
named either for the Santa Ana River Valley where they originate, or for the Santa Ana Canyon,
southeast of Los Angeles, where they pick up speed.
What are Tornados?
Tornadoes are spawned when there is warm, moist air near the ground, cool air aloft, and winds
that speed up and change direction. An obstruction, such as a house, in the path of the wind
causes it to change direction. This change increases pressure on parts of the house, and the
combination of increased pressures and fluctuating wind speeds creates stresses that frequently
cause structural failures.
In order to measure the intensity and wind strength of a tornado, Dr. T. Theodore Fujita developed
the Fujita Tornado Damage Scale. This scale compares the estimated wind velocity with the
corresponding amount of suspected damage. The scale measures six classifications of
tornadoes with increasing magnitude from an “F0” tornado to a “F6+” tornado.

                        as iceboxes, water heaters, storage tanks, automobiles, etc. will create serious
                        secondary damage on structures.

Unlike tornados, microbursts are strong, damaging winds which strike the ground and often give
the impression a tornado has struck. They frequently occur during intense thunderstorms. The
origin of a microburst is downward moving air from a
thunderstorm's core. But unlike a tornado, they affect
only a rather small area. University of Chicago storm
researcher Dr. Ted Fujita first coined the term
“downburst” to describe strong, downdraft winds
flowing out of a thunderstorm cell that he believed were
responsible for the crash of Eastern Airlines Flight 66
in June of 1975.
A downburst is a straight-direction surface wind in
excess of 39 mph caused by a small-scale, strong
downdraft      from     the     base    of    convective
thundershowers and thunderstorms.               In later
investigations into the phenomena he defined two sub-
categories of downbursts: the larger macrobursts and small microbursts.
Macrobursts are downbursts with winds up to 117 mph which spread across a path greater than
2.5 miles wide at the surface and which last from five to 30 minutes. The microburst, on the other
hand is confined to an even smaller area, less than 2.5 miles in diameter from the initial point of
downdraft impact. An intense microburst can result in damaging winds near 270 km/hr (170 mph)
and often last for less than five minutes.
Downbursts of all sizes descend from the upper regions of severe thunderstorms when the air
accelerates downward through either exceptionally strong evaporative cooling or by very heavy
rain which drags dry air down with it. When the rapidly descending air strikes the ground, it
spreads outward in all directions, like a fast-running faucet stream hitting the sink bottom.
When the microburst wind hits an object on the ground such as a house, garage or tree, it can
flatten the buildings, and strip limbs and branches from the tree. After striking the ground, the
powerful outward running gust can wreak further havoc along its path. Damage associated with
a microburst is often mistaken for the work of a tornado, particularly directly under the microburst.
However, damage patterns away from the impact area are characteristic of straight-line winds
rather than the twisted pattern of tornado damage.”
Tornados, like those that occur every year in the Midwest and Southeast parts of the United
States, are a rare phenomenon in most of California, with most tornado-like activity coming from
micro-bursts.
What is Susceptible to Windstorms?
Life and Property
Based on the history of the region, windstorm events can be expected, perhaps annually, across
widespread areas of the region which can be adversely impacted during a windstorm event. This
can result in the involvement of City emergency response personnel during a wide-ranging
windstorm or microburst tornadic activity. Both residential and commercial structures with weak
reinforcement are susceptible to damage. Wind pressure creates a direct and frontal assault on
a structure, pushing walls, doors, and windows inward. Conversely, passing currents creates lift
                                                                           Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016
                                                                               General Hazard Overviews
                                                                                                - 145 -

suction forces that pull building components and surfaces outward. With extreme wind forces,
the roof or entire building can fail causing considerable damage.
Debris carried along by extreme winds can directly contribute to loss of life and indirectly to the
failure of protective building envelopes, siding, or walls. When severe windstorms strike a City,
downed trees, power lines, and damaged property can be major hindrances to emergency
response and disaster recovery.
Utilities
Historically, falling trees are the major cause of power outages in the region. Windstorms such
as strong microbursts and Santa Ana Wind conditions cause flying debris and downed utility lines.
For example, tree limbs breaking in winds of only 45 mph can be thrown over 75 feet, overhead
power lines are damaged, even in relatively minor windstorm events. Falling trees bring electric
power lines down to the pavement, creating the possibility of lethal electric shock.
Infrastructure
Windstorms damage buildings, power lines, and other property, and infrastructure, due to falling
trees and branches. During wet winters, saturated soils cause trees to become less stable and
more vulnerable to uprooting from high winds.
Increased Fire Threat
Perhaps the greatest danger from windstorm activity in Southern California comes from the
combination of the Santa Ana winds with the major fires that occur every few years in the
urban/wildland interface. With the Santa Ana winds driving the flames, the speed and reach of
the flames is even greater than in times of calm wind conditions.
Transportation
Windstorm activity impacts local transportation in addition to the problems caused by downed
trees and electrical wires blocking streets and highways. During periods of extremely strong
Santa Ana winds, major highways can be temporarily closed to truck and recreational vehicle
traffic. However, typically these disruptions are not long lasting, nor do they carry a severe long
term economic impact on the region.
Drought Hazards

Hazard Characteristics
Definition
Drought is defined as a deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time, usually a
season or more. This deficiency results in a water shortage for some activity, group, or
environmental sector. Drought should be considered relative to some long-term average
condition of balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration (i.e., evaporation +
transpiration) in a particular area, a condition often perceived as "normal". It is also related to the
timing (e.g., principal season of occurrence, delays in the start of the rainy season, occurrence of
rains in relation to principal crop growth stages) and the effectiveness of the rains (e.g., rainfall
intensity, number of rainfall events). Other climatic factors such as high temperature, high wind,
and low relative humidity are often associated with it in many regions of the world and can
significantly aggravate its severity. Drought should not be viewed as merely a physical
phenomenon or natural event. Its impacts on society result from the interplay between a natural
event (less precipitation than expected resulting from natural climatic variability) and the demand
people place on water supply. Human beings often exacerbate the impact of drought. Recent
droughts in both developing and developed countries and the resulting economic and
environmental impacts and personal hardships have underscored the vulnerability of all societies
to this "natural" hazard.
One dry year does not normally constitute a drought in California, but serves as a reminder of the
need to plan for droughts. California's extensive system of water supply infrastructure - its
reservoirs, groundwater basins, and inter-regional conveyance facilities - mitigates the effect of
short-term dry periods for most water users. Defining when a drought begins is a function of
drought impacts to water users. Hydrologic conditions constituting a drought for water users in
one location may not constitute a drought for water users elsewhere, or for water users having a
different water supply. Individual water suppliers may use criteria such as rainfall/runoff, amount
of water in storage, or expected supply from a water wholesaler to define their water supply
conditions.
Many governmental utilities, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and
the California Department of Water Resources, as well as academic institutions such as the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln's National Drought Mitigation Center and the National Drought
Mitigation Center, generally agree that there is no clear definition of drought. Drought is highly
variable depending on location.
Drought Threat
The region’s Mediterranean climate makes it especially susceptible to variations in rainfall.
Severe water shortages could have a bearing on the economic well-being of the community.
Comparison of climate (rainfall) records from Los Angeles with water well records beginning in
1930 from the San Gabriel Valley indicates the existence of wet and dry cycles on a 10-year scale
as well as for much longer periods. The climate record for the Los Angeles region beginning in
1890 suggests drying conditions over the last century. With respect to the present day, climate
data also suggests that the last significant wet period was the 1940s. Well level data and other
sources seem to indicate the historic high groundwater levels (reflecting recharge from rainfall)
occurred in the same decade. Since that time, rainfall (and groundwater level trends) appears to
be in decline. This slight declining trend, however, is not believed to be significant. Climatologists
compiled rainfall data from 96 stations in the State that spanned a 100-year period between 1890
and 1990. An interesting note is that during the first 50 years of the reporting period, there was
                                                                           Hazard Mitigation Plan | 2016

                                                                                                - 147 -

only one year (1890) that had more than 35 inches of rainfall, whereas the second 50-year period
recording of 5 year intervals (1941, 1958, 1978, 1982, and 1983) that exceeded 35 inches of
rainfall in a single year. The year of maximum rainfall was 1890 when the average annual rainfall
was 43.11 inches. The second wettest year on record occurred in 1983 when the State’s average
was 42.75 inches.
The driest year of the 100-year reported in the study was 1924 when the State’s average rainfall
was only 10.50 inches. The region with the most stations reporting the driest year in 1924 was
the San Francisco Bay area. The second driest year was 1977 when the average was 11.57
inches. The most recent major drought (1987 to 1990) occurred at the end of a sequence of very
wet years (1978 to 1983). The debate continues whether “global warming” is occurring, and the
degree to which global climate change will have an effect on local micro-climates. The semi-arid
southwest is particularly susceptible to variations in rainfall. A study that documented annual
precipitation for California since 1600 from reconstructed tree ring data indicates that there was
a prolonged dry spell from about 1755 to 1820 in California. Fluctuations in precipitation could
contribute indirectly to a number of hazards including wildfire and the availability of water supplies.

Drought is a gradual phenomenon. Although droughts are sometimes characterized as
emergencies, they differ from typical emergency events. Most natural disasters, such as floods
or forest fires, occur relatively rapidly and afford little time for preparing for disaster response.
Droughts occur slowly, over a multiyear period. There is no universal definition of when a drought
begins or ends.
Types of Drought
There are four different ways that drought can be defined:
(1) Meteorological - a measure of departure of precipitation from normal. Due to climatic
differences what is considered a drought in one location may not be a drought in another location.
(2) Agricultural - refers to a situation when the amount of moisture in the soil no longer meets the
needs of a particular crop.
(3) Hydrological - occurs when surface and subsurface water supplies are below normal.
(4) Socioeconomic - refers to the situation that occurs when physical water shortage begins to
affect people.
Historical California Droughts
A significant drought, reported by many of the ranchers in southern California, occurred in 1860.
The great drought of the 1930s, coined the "Dust Bowl," was geographically centered in the Great
Plains yet ultimately affected water shortages in California. The drought conditions in the plains
resulted in a large influx of people to the west coast. Approximately 350,000 people from
Arkansas and Oklahoma immigrated mainly to the Great Valley of California. As more people
moved into California, including Los Angeles County increases in intensive agriculture led to
overuse of the Santa Ana River watershed and groundwater resulting in regional water shortages.
Several bills have been introduced into Congress in an effort to mitigate the effects of drought. In
1998, President Clinton signed into law the National Drought Policy Act, which called for the
development of a national drought policy or framework that integrates actions and responsibilities
among all levels of government. In addition, it established the National Drought Policy
Commission to provide advice and recommendations on the creation of an integrated federal
policy. The most recent bill introduced into Congress was the National Drought Preparedness
Act of 2003, which established a comprehensive national drought policy and statutorily authorized
a lead federal utility for drought assistance. Currently there exists only an ad-hoc response
approach to drought unlike other disasters (e.g., hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes) which are
under the purview of FEMA.
Droughts exceeding three years are relatively rare in Northern California, the source of much of
the State's developed water supply. The 1929-34 droughts established the criteria commonly
used in designing storage capacity and yield of large Northern California reservoirs. The driest
single year of California's measured hydrologic record was 1977. According to USGS, California's
most recent multi-year droughts occurred between 1987-92, 2006-2010 and 2012-2016.
The Long-term Climatic Viewpoint

conditions. The following sampling of changes in climatic conditions over time helps put
California's twentieth century droughts into perspective. Most of the dates shown below are
necessarily approximations.

Not only must the climatic conditions be inferred from indirect evidence, but the onset or extent of
changed conditions may vary with geographic location. Readers interested in the subject of
paleo-climatology are encouraged to seek out the extensive body of popular and scientific
literature on this subject.
Past California Droughts
The historical record of California hydrology is brief in comparison to the time period of
geologically modern climatic conditions. The following samplings of changes in climatic and
hydrologic conditions help put California's twentieth century droughts into perspective, by
illustrating the variability of possible conditions. Most of the dates shown below are
approximations, since the dates must be inferred from indirect sources.
11,000 years before present
Beginning of Holocene Epoch- Recent time, the time since the end of the last major glacial epoch.
6,000 years before present
Approximate time when trees were growing in areas now submerged by Lake Tahoe. Lake levels
were lower then, suggesting a drier climate.
900-1300 A.D. (Approximate)
The Medieval Warm Period, a time of warmer global average temperatures. The Arctic ice pack
receded, allowing Norse settlement of Greenland and Iceland. The Anasazi civilization in the
Southwest flourished, its irrigation systems supported by monsoonal rains.
1300-1800 A.D. (approximate)
The Little Ice Age, a time of colder average temperatures. Norse colonies in Greenland failed
near the start of the time period, as conditions became too cold to support agriculture and livestock
grazing. The Anasazi culture began to decline about 1300 and had vanished by 1600, attributed
in part to drought conditions that made agriculture infeasible.
Mid - 1500s A.D.
Severe, sustained drought throughout much of the continental U.S., according to
dendrochronology. Drought suggested as a contributing factor in the failure of European colonies
at Parris Island, South Carolina and Roanoke Island, North Carolina.
1850s A.D.
Sporadic measurements of California precipitation began.
1890s A.D.
Long-term stream flow measurements began at a few California locations.

Palmer Drought Severity Index
Of the many varied indexes used to measure drought, the "Palmer Drought Severity Index" (PDSI)
is the most commonly used drought index in the United States. Developed by meteorologist
Wayne Palmer, the PDSI is used to measure dryness based on recent temperature compared to
the amount of precipitation. It utilizes a number range, 0 as normal, drought shown in terms of
minus numbers, and wetness shown in positive numbers. The PDSI is most effective at analyzing
long-range drought forecasts or predications. Thus, the PDSI is very effective at evaluation trends
in the severity and frequency of prolonged periods of drought, and conversely wet weather. The
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) publish weekly Palmer maps, which
are also used by other scientists to analyze the long-term trends associated with global warming
and how this has affected drought conditions.
The following map is the most current snapshot of drought conditions across the U.S. It is
provided by NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.
