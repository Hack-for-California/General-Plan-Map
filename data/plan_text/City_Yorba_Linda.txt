4. Circulation Element
Introduction
The Circulation Element provides a
framework for a functional circulation
system for the City that promotes the safe,
efficient, and reliable movement of people
and goods throughout the community.
The Circulation Element defines goals and
policies that will enhance the development
and maintenance of the transportation
system and maximize freedom of vehicular
and pedestrian movement in the
community. A multi-modal transportation
system that safely and efficiently serves
residents, businesses, and visitors, and provides access to neighborhoods, communities, and regional
centers is essential for upholding Yorba Linda’s quality of life and implementing the vision for the
community’s future.
Authority and Scope
The State of California Government Code Section 65302(b) requires that a General Plan include “a
circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of existing and proposed major
thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated
with the land use element of the plan.”
The Circulation Element describes existing circulation conditions in the City, establishes standards for
implementation of future improvements in conjunction with planned growth, and provides a method for
measuring system performance for future updates. Section 65302 of the California Government Code
recommends that the Circulation Element accomplish the following:
        Coordinate the transportation and circulation system of the City;
        Promote the efficient transport of goods and the safe and effective movement of all segments
         of the population;
        Make efficient use of existing transportation facilities; and
        Protect environmental quality and promote the discerning and equitable use of economic and
         natural resources.
To meet these objectives, the Circulation Element addresses the circulation improvements needed to
provide sufficient infrastructure to accommodate future traffic conditions. Corresponding goals and

policies have been established to ensure that the circulation system will meet the needs of the City of
Yorba Linda.
Background
Circulation in the City of Yorba Linda is provided by an integrated network of roadways, bicycle and
pedestrian facilities, trails, and public transportation. The purpose of the transportation system is to
provide the safe, efficient, and reliable movement of people and goods throughout the community. The
transportation system provides the ability to travel between destinations and access to properties.
Roadway Network
The City’s street and highway system is composed of a wide range of transportation facilities that serve
two basic functions: mobility and land access. Mobility means providing the ability for motorist to travel
between points of interest, while land access involves providing access to properties, which may include
parking or driveway access.
Regional Access
The freeways providing regional circulation for the City include the Riverside Freeway (SR-91), State
Route 57, and Imperial Highway (State Route 90). North-south arterials that extend through and beyond
the boundaries of the City of Yorba Linda include Rose Drive, Richfield Road, Lakeview Avenue, and
Fairmont Boulevard. East-west arterials that extend through and beyond the City limits include
Bastanchury Road and Yorba Linda Boulevard. Imperial Highway extends through the City beginning at
the northwest city limit, traveling in a southeasterly direction, and continuing beyond the southern city
limit.
Local Access
The City of Yorba Linda is served by a combination of curvilinear streets and straight north-south and
east-west arterials. Smaller collector and neighborhood streets connect neighborhoods and commercial
land uses to the arterial street system.
City of Yorba Linda Functional Roadway Classification System
The City of Yorba Linda’s circulation network serves two distinct and equally important functions: it
provides access to adjacent land uses, and it facilitates the movement of persons and goods to and
from, within and through the City. The design and operation of each street is determined by the
importance placed on each of these functions. Streets that have a mobility and/or regional access
function will typically have more lanes, higher speed limits and fewer driveways. Where direct access to
properties is required, streets will generally have fewer lanes, lower speeds, on-street parking, and more
frequent driveways to serve abutting properties.
To define the intended uses of roadways, many jurisdictions, including the City of Yorba Linda, use a
functional roadway classification system. The system provides a framework for the design and operation

                                                                       Yorba Linda General Plan
of the roadway system and helps identify preferred characteristics of each street. In the General Plan,
the City of Yorba Linda uses a functional classification system consistent with classification systems used
throughout Orange County. It includes the following street classifications:
         Smart Street
         Major
         Primary
         Secondary
         Collector
Typical cross sections for roadways in the City are presented in Exhibit CR-1: Typical Roadway Cross-
Sections. The existing functional classifications for the arterial roadways in the City of Yorba Linda are
presented on Exhibit CR-2: Existing Roadway Functional Classification.
Smart Street
Smart Streets are arterials with enhanced traffic-carrying capacity. Increases in capacity are achieved by
a variety of measures, including, but not limited to:
         Preferential and acceptably maintained traffic signal timing and synchronization;
         Prohibition of on-street parking;
         Intersection grade separations of critical through and/or turn movements;
         Addition of at-grade through or turn lanes at intersections;
         Access limitation to right turns only, or no access (street and/or driveways);
         Access consolidation;
         Frontage roads;
         Pedestrian grade separations; and
         Other elements that may be documented to be useful.
The intent of these measures is to minimize conflicts with cross traffic. These measures improve traffic
carrying capacity and facilitate improved traffic flow along an arterial. This designation is intended to
represent a roadway of a Primary, Major, or a Principal arterial classification.
In the City of Yorba Linda, Imperial Highway is a Smart Street with six-lanes from the west City limit to
Yorba Linda Boulevard, and four-lanes from Yorba Linda Boulevard to the south City limit.
Major Arterial
A Major Arterial is a six-lane divided roadway, with 84 to 106 feet of curb-to-curb width within 100 to
120 feet of right-of-way. The optimal right-of-way width for a six-lane Major arterial would be 120 feet,
but where full right-of-way is not available, the six-lane cross section could be accommodated within
less right-of-way (Modified Major). A minimum right-of-way of 100 feet is considered appropriate where
it is not feasible to obtain the desired right-of-way width of 120 feet. Major arterials are designated with

emphasis for automobile, goods movement, and/or transit, and may carry a component of regional
through traffic not handled by the freeway system.
A Major arterial would typically consist of three through lanes in each direction, with one or two left-
turn lanes and a dedicated right-turn lane at intersections. Major arterials in the City of Yorba Linda
consist of:
        Yorba Linda Boulevard: from Rose Drive to Fairmont Boulevard
        Fairmont Boulevard: from Village Center Drive S to Esperanza Road
        Esperanza Road from City limit to Fairmont Boulevard
Primary Arterial
A Primary Arterial is a four-lane divided roadway, with 64 to 84 feet of curb-to-curb width within 80 to
100 feet of right-of-way. The right-of-way width for a Primary arterial would be 100 feet, but where
necessary, the four-lane cross section could be accommodated within less right-of-way (Modified
Primary). A minimum right-of-way of 80 feet is considered appropriate where it is not feasible to obtain
the desired right-of-way width of 100 feet. Primary arterials are designated with emphasis for
automobile, goods movement, transit and bicycle, and may function similarly to Major arterials, with
the primary difference being vehicle capacity. Typically, Major arterials are expected to carry more
vehicles than Primary arterials.
A Primary arterial would typically consist of two through lanes in each direction, with a left-turn lane,
and may include a dedicated right-turn lane at intersections. Primary arterials in the City of Yorba Linda
consist of:
        Yorba Linda Boulevard: from Fairmont Boulevard to Esperanza Road
        Lakeview Avenue: from Yorba Linda Boulevard to south of southern City limit
        Fairmont Boulevard: from Village Center Drive N to Village Center Drive S
        Bastanchury Road from City limit to Fairmont Boulevard
        Rose Drive from north City limit to Imperial Highway
        Esperanza Road from Fairmont Boulevard to Yorba Linda Boulevard
        La Palma Boulevard from Yorba Linda Boulevard to Gypsum Canyon Road
Secondary Arterial
A Secondary Arterial is a four-lane undivided roadway, with 64 feet of curb-to-curb width within 80 feet
of right-of-way. Secondary arterials are designated with emphasis for automobiles and bicycles, and
often provide a collector function, distributing traffic between local streets and Major and Primary
arterials. Although some Secondary arterials may also serve as through routes, most provide more direct
access to surrounding land uses.

A Secondary Arterial would typically consist of two travel lanes in each direction, with a left-turn lane at
intersections. Secondary arterials in the City of Yorba Linda consist of:
        Buena Vista Avenue: from western City limit to Lakeview Avenue
        Valley View Avenue: from Yorba Linda Boulevard to Valleyview Circle
        Richfield Road: from Yorba Linda Boulevard to southern City limit
        Lakeview Avenue: from Yorba Linda Boulevard to Valleyview Avenue
        Kellogg Drive: from Yorba Linda Boulevard to Imperial Highway
        Village Center Drive: from Fairmont Boulevard N to Fairmont Boulevard S
        Yorba Ranch Road: from Yorba Linda Boulevard to Esperanza Road
        Paseo de las Palomas: from Fairmont Blvd. to Yorba Linda Blvd.
Collector Arterial
A Collector is a two-lane undivided roadway, with 40 feet of curb-to-curb width within 60 feet of right-
of-way. Collector streets would typically consist of one travel lane in each direction and a parking lane
or bike lane on each side. Collectors carry traffic from the neighborhoods to the higher classification
street system. An Enhanced Collector would serve the same function as a Collector but would also have
a center median.

Existing Volumes and Levels of Service
Level of Service Definition for Roadways
Congestion is a result of a street network that carries traffic volumes in excess of the network’s designed
capacity. A roadway’s capacity is a function primarily of the number of lanes provided to carry traffic
volumes, and whether or not the roadway is divided with a median or center turn lane. Generally, the
more lanes provided, the more capacity the roadway has to accommodate traffic demand. Table CR-
1: Daily Traffic-Carrying Capacities by Roadway Type, provides a summary of the theoretical daily traffic-
carrying capacities for each of the roadway types.

    Estimated daily capacity , expressed as vehicles per day (vpd)
The daily capacity of a roadway is also affected by a number of variables, including the type and number
of intersection controls, signal timing, the presence and frequency of driveways, on-street parking,
percentage of the daily traffic in the peak hour, the directionality of traffic in the peak hour, and other
factors. The daily capacities shown above provide a general guideline as to the adequacy or deficiency
of the roadway system.
Design capacity of a street or highway is the maximum volume of traffic a roadway is designed to carry
at a selected level of service. The concept of Level of Service (LOS) is used to qualitatively describe
prevailing conditions and their effect on traffic. Broadly interpreted, the LOS concept denotes any one
of a number of differing combinations of operating conditions that may take place as a roadway is
accommodating various traffic volumes. Service levels range from A through F with each level defined
by a range of volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Table CR-2: Level of Service, provides a detailed
description of each LOS.

                Congestion occurs and a small change in volumes increases

As shown on the table above, traffic conditions are best when the daily traffic volumes on a roadway
are less than 60% or 70% of the theoretical capacity of the roadway, while congestion and delays can
be expected when the daily traffic volumes approach or exceed 100% of the roadway capacity. The
threshold Level of Service for the City of Yorba Linda for intersection and daily roadway operation is
LOS D for planning purposes.
Existing roadway volumes were compared to roadway capacity to assess existing levels of service.
Analysis of existing traffic conditions in Yorba Linda indicate that all roadway segments currently operate
at LOS C or better except for the following roadway segments (portions of these segments may not be
within the City limits, but are included for analysis purposes):
        Imperial Highway (Rose Drive to Valley View Avenue)
        Imperial Highway (Lakeview Avenue to Kellogg Drive)
        Imperial Highway (Kellogg Drive to Orangethorpe Avenue)
A total of 30 intersections were also analyzed for the Circulation Element. Study intersections generally
consist of intersections of two arterial roadways (Secondary or higher) within the City of Yorba Linda, as
well as selected intersections that are currently carrying high peak hour volumes or have other operating
characteristics based on input from City staff. Selected study intersections, existing peak hour traffic
volumes, lane geometry, and traffic control for each study intersection are provided in detail in Appendix

F: Traffic Analysis and Report. The Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU) analysis conducted concluded
that all study intersections currently operate at LOS D or better under existing conditions.
Truck Routes
The designation of truck routes within a city limits is intended to direct truck traffic to those streets where
they would cause the least amount of neighborhood intrusion and where noise and other impacts would
not be considered nuisances. The City of Yorba Linda has designated one roadway as a truck route to
provide for the regulated movement of trucks through the City: Imperial Highway. This designated truck
route is illustrated on Exhibit CR-3: Truck Routes. The City anticipates truck traffic will access the City
along the area freeway system, including State Route 91 and State Route 57.
Trucks are directed to use Imperial Highway to the greatest extent possible to get to and from their
destination. The designation of truck routes does not prohibit trucks from using non-designated roads
or streets to make deliveries, once the truck has progressed as far as possible on the designated truck
route, or for other reasons as defined in the Motor Vehicle Code of the State of California.
Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Bicycle lanes and bicycle routes are provided on a number of roadways within the City of Yorba Linda.
Existing bicycle facilities are shown in Exhibit CR-4: Bikeways. The bike system is intended to provide
bicyclists with connections between neighborhoods, parks, schools, and other neighborhood and
recreational facilities. Most city bikeways are Class II – on-street bike lanes marked in the curb or parking
lane on selected city streets. Generally, bikeways are described according to the following
classifications:
        Class 1 Bikeway – Referred to as a bike path, share-use path, or multi-purpose trail. Provides
         for bicycle travel on a paved right-of-way completely separated from any street or highway.
         Other users, such as pedestrians and those in wheelchairs, may also be found on this type of
         facility.
        Class 2 Bikeway – Referred to as a bike lane. Provides a striped lane for one-way bicycle travel
         on a street or highway.
        Class 3 Bikeway – Referred to as a bike route. Provides for shared use with motor vehicle traffic.
Sidewalks are generally provided along the arterial roadways and on the vast majority of residential
streets throughout the city. The City of Yorba Linda circulation system has been designed to ensure that
adequate facilities are provided for pedestrian circulation, especially in the vicinity of schools, parks,
major retail facilities, and other locations with high levels of pedestrian activity.
Public Transportation
The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) operates local public transit routes that extend
into and through the City of Yorba Linda. The 2016 OCTA Bus Service Plan revised bus service in order
to address the decline in bus ridership and revenue. The revised plan eliminated two bus routes in Yorba

routes that serve areas in close proximity to the City limit, which is shown on Exhibit CR-5: Public
Transportation. The Inland Empire-OC Metrolink line runs east to west just south of Yorba Linda. The
nearest Metrolink station stop to the City of Yorba Linda is located in Anaheim Canyon.

Complete Streets
In 2008, the State Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 1358, the California Complete Streets Act.
Implementation of the Act requires cities and counties, upon substantive revision of the circulation
element of a general plan, to modify their circulation element to plan for a balanced, multimodal
transportation network that meets the needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways, including
motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists, children, persons with disabilities, seniors, movers of commercial
goods, and users of public transportation.
The Complete Streets Act is premised on the notion that a balanced, multimodal transportation network
would serve to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, make the most efficient use of transportation
infrastructure, and improve public health by encouraging physical activity by shifting short trips in the
automobile to biking, walking, and the use of public transit. In an effort to meet the requirements of the
Complete Streets Act, the Circulation Element include goals and policies to prioritize and develop
programs supporting Complete Streets principles and standards in Yorba Linda.
Related Plans and Programs
Transportation and circulation issues extend beyond the Yorba Linda city limits. State and regional
agencies have developed programs to forecast and manage county-wide and region-wide
transportation issues. To better coordinate with other public agencies, the City must consider existing
transportation system planning efforts to facilitate effective decisions about improvements to the local
transportation system.
State Regulations
         Assembly Bill 1358, Complete Streets Act– The California Complete Streets Act of 2008 requires
         circulation elements to address the transportation system from a multi-modal perspective. The
         bill states that streets, roads, and highways must “meet the needs of all users…in a manner
         suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context of the general plan.” Essentially, this bill
         requires a circulation element to plan for all modes of transportation where appropriate—
         including walking, biking, car travel, and transit. The Complete Streets Act also requires
         circulation elements to consider the multiple users of the transportation system, including
         children, adults, seniors, and the disabled.
         Assembly Bill 32, Global Warming Solutions Act– With the passage of the Global Warming
         Solutions Act of 2006, the State of California committed itself to reducing greenhouse gas
         (GHG) emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The California Air Resource Board (ARB), which is
         coordinating the response to comply with AB 32, is currently on schedule to meet this deadline.
         In 2007, ARB adopted a list of early action programs that could be put in place by January 1,
         2010. In 2008, ARB defined its 1990 baseline level of emissions, and by 2011 it completed
         rules for reducing GHG emissions. Rules on emissions, as well as market-based mechanisms
         like the proposed cap and trade program, came into effect January 1, 2012. The cap and trade
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                              Page CR-21

Yorba Linda General Plan
      program controls pollution by a governing agency selling permits on the amount of pollutants
      a firm can emit. A firm’s pollutants cannot exceed the limit. Firms requiring the need to increase
      their emissions must purchase permits from other firms requiring fewer permits.
      Senate Bill 375– In 2008, the California Air Resources Board (ARB) adopted its Proposed
      Scoping Plan for AB 32. This scoping plan included the approval of SB 375 as the means for
      achieving regional transportation-related GHG targets. SB 375 provides guidance on how
      curbing emissions from cars and light trucks can help the state comply with AB 32. SB 375 also
      provides CEQA streamlining incentives for preferred development types. Residential or mixed-
      use projects qualify if they conform to the Sustainable Communities Strategy. Transit-oriented
      developments also qualify if they 1) are at least 50 percent residential, 2) meet density
      requirements, and 3) are within one-half mile of a transit stop. The degree of CEQA streamlining
      is based on the degree of compliance with these development preferences.
      Senate Bill 743– SB 743 passed in 2013 and amends the California Environmental Quality Act
      (CEQA) to give individual agencies the ability to opt out of a congestion management program.
      Additionally, this bill requires the State Office of Planning and Research (OPR) to develop
      alternative impact criteria for transportation impacts in transit priority areas. The biggest impact
      of this senate bill may be the requirement for OPR to look at changing CEQA significance

      environmental analysis under CEQA. Proposed changes to the CEQA Guidelines were released
      for public review in January 2016.
Regional Plans and Initiatives
      Southern California Association of Governments Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable
      Communities Strategy (SCAG RTP/SCS)– The SCAG RTP/SCS provides a regional transportation
      plan for six counties in Southern California: Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, Los Angeles,
      Ventura, and Imperial. The primary goal of the RTP is to increase mobility for the region. With
      recent legislation, this plan also encompasses sustainability as a key principle in future
      development.
      Orange County Congestion Management Program (CMP)– The Orange County Congestion
      Management Program (CMP) was established in 1991 to reduce traffic congestion and to
      provide a mechanism for coordinating land use and development decisions. Compliance with
      the CMP requirements ensures a city’s ability to compete for State gas tax funds for local
      transportation projects. Within the City of Yorba Linda, the CMP Highway System includes two
      arterials: Rose Drive and Imperial Highway. There are no specific CMP requirements for
      roadway segment monitoring.
      Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies are geared toward increasing vehicle
      occupancy, promoting the use of alternative modes, reducing the number of automobile trips,
      decreasing overall trip lengths, and improving air quality. The adoption of a TDM ordinance

                                                                     Yorba Linda General Plan
       was required of every local jurisdiction for Orange County's 1991 Congestion Management
       Program (CMP). The adoption of these ordinances is no longer a statutory requirement,
       however OCTA continues to encourage local jurisdictions to promote and support TDM
       strategies in their community. Such strategies may include, but are not limited to, the following:
                   Encouraging employers to establish and help subsidize telecommuting, provide
                    monetary incentives for ridesharing, and implement alternative work hour programs;
                   Implementing bus loading facilities at worksites;
                   Implementing pedestrian facilities such as sidewalks, paved pathways, and
                    pedestrian grade separations over arterial streets to connect worksites to shopping,
                    eating, recreation, parking, or transit facilities; and
                   Participating in the development of remote parking facilities and the high‐occupancy
                    vehicles (i.e., shuttles, etc.) to serve them.
       OCTA Commuter Bikeways Strategic Plan– The Commuter Bikeways Strategic Plan (CBSP) is a
       regional planning document that identifies existing and proposed bikeways in Orange County.
       Through the cooperation of the cities and the County, an inventory was taken of existing
       bikeways, and priorities for new bikeways were identified. Prioritization of the proposed
       bikeways, as identified in the plan, was based on several factors, including input from local
       jurisdictions and the public, as well as connectivity to transit and regional destinations. In
       addition to analysis of existing and proposed bikeways, the document provides information on
       bicycle amenities, such as bike lockers, parking signage, and trail markings. It also includes a
       discussion on safety and education programs, innovative roadway markings, bikeway
       fundamentals, and funding sources.

9. Conservation Element
Introduction
The       Conservation       Element      addresses
conservation and utilization of natural resources
and the management and protection of open
space lands. The Conservation Element provides
policy guidance to protect, maintain, and
enhance Yorba Linda’s natural resources and
open space land.
Authority and Scope
The State of California Government Code
Section 65302(d) requires that a General Plan
include “a conservation element for the
conservation, development and utilization of natural resources including water and its hydraulic force,
forests, soils, rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals, and other natural resources.”
The Conservation Element must contain goals and policies that further the protection and maintenance
of the State’s resources such as water, soils, wildlife, mineral, and other natural resources. The
Conservation Element identifies those undeveloped lands that contain open space for the preservation
of natural resources; open space for the managed production of resources; and open space for public
health and safety.
Background
Approximately one-fourth of the land in Yorba Linda is preserved as permanent open space, including
natural habitat, wildlife corridors, and viewsheds. Much of Yorba Linda’s open space areas are located
in the northern and southeastern portions of the planning area. The unincorporated areas of Orange
County located in the north and east of the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) contain natural resources
significant to the sub-region. These portions of Yorba Linda contain natural habitat directly adjacent to
the Chino Hills State Park. The steep slopes along Yorba Linda’s northeastern City boundary form an
edge between Orange County and Chino Hills State Park, located in San Bernardino County, as
illustrated in Exhibit CN-1: Open Space and Recreation Areas.
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                                Page CN-1

Yorba Linda General Plan
Wildlife Habitat
Areas in the northern and southeastern
portions of the City of Yorba Linda,
provide natural open space, important
wildlife connectivity, and biological
habitats. Exhibit CN-2: Natural Habitat
Areas, shows the locations of natural
habitat areas in the planning area. The
natural habitat areas are open spaces
which contain wildlife and native plant
life.
Important open space in Yorba Linda
includes the riparian habitat around the Santa Ana River in the southeastern portion of the City, as well
as extensive oak woodland, chaparral, coastal sage scrub and riparian habitats located adjacent to the
Chino Hills State Park in the northern portion of the City. According to the National Land Cover
Database, Yorba Linda’s natural open space areas consists of a majority of shrub/scrub, with some
herbaceous and woody wetlands land cover.1
According to the California Department of Parks and Recreation, the open space areas around the City
are ideal locations for observing many wildlife species native to Southern California. More than 200
species of birds and mammals, numerous reptiles and amphibians, and thousands of types of insects
and other invertebrates can be found in habitat areas, including Chino Hills State Park. Wildlife species
in and around Yorba Linda include: mountain lions, bobcats, coyotes, mule deer, raccoons, opossums,
striped skunks, western grey squirrels, red-tailed hawks, Cooper’s hawks, and turkey vultures.
According to data provided by the California Natural Diversity Database, there are sensitive plant and
animal species located in the Yorba Linda Planning Area. Sensitive biological resources include species
present in the project vicinity that have been given special recognition by federal, state, or local resource
conservation agencies and organizations due to declining, limited or threatened populations, resulting
in most cases from habitat reduction; and habitat areas that are unique, of relatively limited distribution,
or of special value to wildlife. State governments have developed a rating system to designate the status
of sensitive species. These designation include, “Candidate,” “Threatened,” or “Endangered.” Official
designation of a species in one of these categories affords species or habitats certain levels of protection
in an effort to preserve their existence. Table CN-1: Sensitive Animals, Plants, and Communities, lists the
sensitive species that are rated “Threatened” or “Endangered.”

Wildlife Corridors
A wildlife corridor is a section of land connecting two larger areas of natural habitat which is free of
barriers that would prevent wildlife passage. Wildlife movement corridors are important for the free
movement of animals between population centers, for access to food and water sources, as escape
routes from brush fires, and in the longer term, for genetic dispersal of individuals between populations.
According to the California Essential Habitat Connectivity Project, parts of northern and eastern Yorba
Linda are considered Natural Landscape Blocks. Natural Landscape Blocks are relatively natural habitat
blacks that support native biodiversity and areas essential for ecological connectivity between them.2
Viewsheds
Yorba Linda has diverse topography, from the flood plains surrounding the Santa Ana River, to steep
ridgelines in the Chino and Pleito Hills. One of the most important ridgelines is known as Telegraph
Canyon, located within the Chino Hills State Park to the north of Yorba Linda. Telegraph Canyon
reaches an elevation of 1,476 feet, with an average height of 1,000 feet. Other prominent ridges are
to the northeast of the City in the Chino Hills, including Brush Canyon with elevations reaching 1,400
feet and San Juan Hills, reaching elevations of 1,661 feet. Chino Hills State Park is a dominant feature
in the area, as are the Santa Ana River, Featherly Park, and Yorba Regional Park.3
Night Skies
Nighttime lighting provides safety and comfort to communities and their residents, but excess and
misdirected light creates the phenomenon known as light pollution. An increasing problem in local
jurisdictions, light pollution is light not targeted for a specific task, creating an unhealthy and unsightly
environment. This light originates from a number of sources including interior and exterior lighting on
buildings, and lights associated with advertising, streetlights, sporting venues and shopping centers.
There are a number of environmental, ecological, and human health implications associated with light
pollution. Excess nighttime light wastes energy and harms the integrity of ecosystems. Upward-directed
light creates sky glow above cities, impairing the view of the night sky, stars and planets. The preservation
of night skies in Yorba Linda is an important priority to minimize light pollution and preserve the
community’s semi-rural character.

Yorba Linda General Plan
Watersheds
A Watershed is the area of land where all
of the water that is either on or under it goes
into the same place. Yorba Linda is within
the Santa Ana Watershed, which is
Southern California’s largest watershed.
The Santa Ana Watershed begins in the San
Bernardino Mountains and discharges into
the ocean in Huntington Beach. The Yorba
Linda Planning Area is drained by the Santa
Ana River in its natural configuration;
beyond Yorba Linda, the river is
channelized. The flow of the Santa Ana
River is intermittent, dependent on the amount of rainfall.
Water Resources
The City receives water service from both the Yorba Linda Water District (YLWD) and the Golden State
Water Company. Groundwater is pumped from nine active wells located throughout the YLWD and
imported water is treated at the Diemer Filtration Plant and is delivered to the YLWD system through
four imported water connections.
In response to the continuing drought in California, the Yorba Linda Water District adopted a Water
Conservation Ordinance in 2009. The ordinance consists of permanent year-round restrictions for
potable water, focused on the prevention of water waste, and four “Water Supply Shortage” stages.
These stages have increasing restrictions on water use in order to allow YLWD to meet all health and
safety guidelines in the face of water shortages. The ordinance contains a financial penalty structure
similar to a code enforcement violation for wasting water.
Golden State Water Company has files Advice Letter with the California Public Utilities Commission to
activate Staged Mandatory Water Conservation and Rationing. The Staged Mandatory Water
Conservation and Rationing filings outline restrictions, water allocations, enforcement measures, and
surcharges designed to achieve reductions due to water supply shortages or to achieve identified water
usage goals established by an authorized government agency or official.
The City of Yorba Linda has also adopted Water Efficient Landscape Regulations. These regulations
establish alternative water efficient landscape regulations that are acceptable under AB 1881, the State
Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance. The adopted ordinance provides regulations that are at
the least as effective in conserving water as the Model Ordinance in the context of conditions in the City
in order to:

                                                                   Yorba Linda General Plan
        Promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional
         agencies;
        Promote the values and benefits of landscapes while recognizing the need to invest water and
         other resources as efficiently as possible;
        Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, maintaining, and managing water
         efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitation projects;
        Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing
         landscapes;
        Use water efficiently without waste by setting a Maximum Applied Water Allowance as an upper
         limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount; and
        Encourage the use of economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water, such as
         implementing a budget-based tiered-rate structure.
Municipal Storm Water Permitting Program
The Municipal Storm Water Permitting Program regulates storm water discharges from municipal
separate storm sewer systems (MS4s). Storm water is runoff from rain or snow melt that runs off surfaces
such as rooftops, paved streets, highways or parking lots and can carry with it pollutants such as: oil,
pesticides, herbicides, sediment, trash, bacteria and metals. The runoff can then drain directly into a
local stream, lake or bay. Often, the runoff drains into storm drains which eventually drain untreated
into a local waterbody.
Additionally, municipal or urban areas commonly include large impervious surfaces which contribute to
an increase in runoff flow, velocity and volume. As a result streams are hydrologically impacted through
streambed and channel scouring, instream sedimentation and loss of aquatic and riparian habitat. In
addition to hydrological impacts, large impervious surfaces contribute to greater pollutant loading,
resulting in turbid water, nutrient enrichment, bacterial contamination, and increased temperature and
trash. MS4 permits were issued in two phases.
Under Phase I, which started in 1990, the Regional Water Quality Control Boards have adopted
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General Permit (NPDES) storm water permits for
medium (serving between 100,000 and 250,000 people) and large (serving 250,000 people)
municipalities. Most of these permits are issued to a group of co-permittees encompassing an entire
metropolitan area. These permits are reissued as the permits expire. The Phase I MS4 permits require
the discharger to develop and implement a Storm Water Management Plan/Program with the goal of
reducing the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable (MEP). MEP is the performance
standard specified in Section 402(p) of the Clean Water Act. The management programs specify what
best management practices (BMPs) will be used to address certain program areas. The program areas
include public education and outreach; illicit discharge detection and elimination; construction and
post-construction; and good housekeeping for municipal operations. In general, medium and large
municipalities are required to conduct monitoring.
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                            Page CN-11

Yorba Linda General Plan
On April 30, 2003 as part of Phase II, the State Water Resources Control Board issued a General Permit
for the Discharge of Storm Water from Small MS4s (WQ Order No. 2003-0005-DWQ) to provide
permit coverage for smaller municipalities (population less than 100,000), including non-traditional
Small MS4s, which are facilities such as military bases, public campuses, prison and hospital complexes.
The Phase II Small MS4 General Permit covers Phase II Permittees statewide. On February 5, 2013 the
Phase II Small MS4 General Permit was adopted and will become effective on July 1, 2013.
Agricultural Resources
According to the State of California Department of Conservation, Yorba Linda contains a small parcel
of Unique Farmland, located just east of Lakeview Avenue and south of Buena Vista Avenue. There is a
small portion of land located north of the Santa Ana River, near Featherly Regional Park that is
designated Prime Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Importance and Unique Farmland. Prime Farmland
has the best combination of physical and chemical features able to sustain long-term agricultural
production. Farmland of Statewide Importance is similar to Prime Farmland but with minor
shortcomings, such as greater slopes or less ability to store soil moisture. Unique Farmland consists of
lesser quality soils used for the production of the state’s leading agricultural crops.4
Mineral and Petroleum Resources
Mineral Resources
Yorba Linda contains mineral resources in the form of potential source of aggregate. Aggregate is the
term used to describe sand, gravel, and crushed stone which are used as construction materials. In the
Yorba Linda planning area, construction aggregate is found in the natural sand and gravel deposits
along the Santa Ana River. There are no active quarries in the planning area.
California’s Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA) requires that the State Geologist
classifies land based on the known or inferred mineral resource potential of that land. The Mineral Land
Classification process identifies lands that contain economically significant mineral deposits. The
primary goal of mineral land classifications is to ensure that the mineral source potential of lands is
recognized and considered in land use planning.5
The SMARA designated Mineral Resource Zones for areas with minerals which were of State-wide or
regional importance, as shown in Exhibit CN-3: Oil Production and Mineral Resource Zones. The areas
along the Santa Ana River are classified as Mineral Resource Zone 2 (MRZ-2). Adequate information
indicates that significant mineral deposits are present, or it is judged that a high likelihood exists for
their presence.6 The classification process does not take into account existing land uses and may result

in the classification of MRZs which are already developed, rendering these zones unsuitable for mining
production.
The planning area contains two specific Resource Sectors (Resource Sector B and Sector C) that are
designated Regionally Significant Aggregate.7 A Resource Sector is an area judged to contain a
significant deposit of construction-quality aggregate that is available to meet the future needs of the
region. Resource Sector B is located directly east of Featherly Regional Park, north of the Santa Ana
River. Resource Sector C is located directly west of Featherly Regional Park and includes lands presently
part of the Savi Ranch development.
The Yorba Linda General Plan is required to show the location of the Resource Sectors and incorporate
policies for the management of their mineral resources, due to the presence of the MRZ-2 Area in the
planning area. The aggregate located in Resource Sectors B and C are unavailable because the areas
were developed with land uses that preclude mining. The use of aggregate underlying the sand beneath
Featherly Park and within portions of Savi Ranch would require major land use changes, as well as loss
of valuable natural spaces and recreational facilities.
Petroleum Resources
There are known oil deposits located in Yorba Linda. The on-shore oil fields are aligned with the
Newport-Inglewood and Whittier fault zones. The faults have facilitated the entrapment of petroleum
resources. Oil extractions in Yorba Linda has been declining over the last several decades as resources
are depleted. The large Yorba Linda oil field (previously known as the Shell Property) has been
redeveloped into the Black Gold Golf Course and residential development.
There are still several active wells in the southwestern and northern portions of the planning area. The
City has identified existing and potential petroleum resource areas through the Oil Production
Combining Zone (O). The O Zone designates appropriate areas for the continued extraction and new
extraction of oil, gas, and other hydrocarbon substances. Exhibit CN-3: Oil Production and Mineral
Resource Zones, shows the locations of the City’s oil producing zones.
Related Plans and Programs
There are a number of land use documents which have been adopted, through ordinance or resolution,
which bear a relationship to the General Plan. Relevant plans and documents are listed as follows:
Parks and Recreation Master Plan
The updated Yorba Linda Parks and Recreation Master Plan was adopted in August 2014. The Master
Plan provides direction to continue the orderly and consistent planning, acquisition, development, and
administration of the parks and recreation programming in Yorba Linda. The Master Plan guides the

and strategies identified in the updated Parks and Recreation Master Plan are incorporated into the
General Plan Update.
Regional Plans and Initiatives
        County of Orange Resources Element – The County of Orange Resources Element contains
        official County policies on the conservation and management of resources within Orange
        County. The Element is comprised of six components including Natural Resources, Energy
        Resources, Water Resources, Air Resources, Open Space, and Cultural-Historical Resources.
        The Resources Element sets forth the strategy for the development, management, preservation,
        and conservation of resources that are necessary to meet Orange County’s existing and future
        demands. The Resources Element primarily focuses on the unincorporated areas in Orange
        County.
        Chino Hills State Park Plan – The Chino Hills State Park General Plan establishes objectives for
        the area’s natural and cultural resources, visitor use, facility development, interpretation,
        general operation, and coordination with other public and private entities. The Plan, developed
        by the California Department of Parks and Recreation, provides goals, policies, and
        implementation actions that affect the interface and trail linkages with the Park with significant
        open space areas of Yorba Linda.
        Yorba Linda Stormwater Program – The federal Clean Water Act (CWA) was enacted for the
        purpose of restoring the health of the Nation’s waters to point of being fishable and swimmable
        for all. The CWA established the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
        permitting program to regulate discharges, including urban and stormwater runoff, into the
        waters of the United States. One of the functions of the NPDES program is to issue permits for
        stormwater discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) entering the waters
        of the United States. The County of Orange has prepared a Drainage Area Master Plan (DAMP)
        to comply with the NPDES permit requirements for Orange County. The DAMP identifies the
        stormwater management practices, control techniques, system design and engineering methods
        to be implemented to protect beneficial uses of receiving water to the maximum extent
        practicable. Each permittee city implements programs of the DAMP through its Local
        Implementation Program.
        The City, as an Orange County permittee, has developed its Local Implementation Plan, the
        Yorba Linda Stormwater Program, to manage stormwater runoff and water quality protection
        practices. The purpose of the stormwater management program is to ensure that new
        development incorporates measures, to the maximum extent practicable, to reduce the quantity

5. Economic Development Element
Introduction
The Economic Development Element
provides a framework to allow the City to
increase the local tax base and improve
the standard of living of all residents in
Yorba Linda. Recognizing that the City
operates within a broader regional and
global economic setting, the following
policies and programs support a diverse,
competitive, and sustainable local
economy. Such an economy allows the
City to increase municipal revenues in
order to continue to deliver quality services
and enhance the prosperity of residents.
The Economic Development Element includes a variety of policies that have a less direct effect on land
use, but are designed to achieve a solid tax base to provide ongoing and enhanced City services. These
include policies aimed at supporting existing and new businesses that reflect changes in industry and
creating the types of jobs most beneficial to the local economy. A vibrant economy supports the quality
of life enjoyed by Yorba Linda residents and enhances the financial stability of the City.
Authority and Scope
The Economic Development Element is an optional element of the General Plan, pursuant to Section
65303 of the California Government Code, which allows that, “the general plan may include any other
elements or address any other subjects which, in the judgement of the legislative body, relate to the
physical development of the county or city.”
Background
Yorba Linda has been cited as one of the “100 Best Places to Live” in the United States,1 so it is no
surprise that the community continues to attract new residents. The City is home to the Richard M. Nixon
Presidential Library and Museum, which draws an average of 95,000 visitors a year. The Arthur Hills
championship designed Black Gold golf course is located in the foothills of Yorba Linda and has been
named one of the top three public golf courses in Orange County by the Orange County Register.

Future Developments
Looking forward, Yorba Linda has two future developments that will benefit the local economy.
       Savi Ranch - Savi Ranch is an approximately
       158 acre mix of industrial, retail and
       automotive uses located in the southeastern
       portion of the City, directly north of the
       California State Route 91. Currently, over 60
       percent of the City’s sales tax revenue is
       generated by the area’s business. Savi Ranch
       is also the City’s major employment center,
       with 25 percent of the community’s jobs.
       Analysis of the existing conditions of Savi Ranch have shown that there is potential to
       accommodate 1.4 million square feet of additional development of commercial, office and
       industrial uses.
       Yorba Linda Town Center - The City of Yorba
       Linda has partnered with a private developer
       to enhance the City’s downtown area. The
       Yorba Linda Town Center is projected to be
       completed by the end of 2017. The project will
       provide a pedestrian-friendly, high-end retail,
       entertainment, and restaurant district in the
       heart of Yorba Linda. The Town Center will
       consist of over 125,000 square feet of theater, grocery, retail, and restaurant uses centered on
       a common open space area.

13. Growth Management Element
Introduction
The Growth Management Element
provides a framework to guide growth and
development based upon the City’s ability
to provide an adequate circulation system
and public facilities. Planning and
provision of mobility improvements, public
services, and public facilities are important
considerations for orderly and sustainable
growth and development to occur. Given
the broad scope of the Growth
Management Element, many related goals
and policies are addressed elsewhere in the General Plan, particularly the Land Use, Circulation, Public
Services, and Public Health and Safety elements.
Authority and Scope
This Element is not required per California Government Code Section 65302; however, as growth
management is of importance to the community, it is prepared as an optional element per California
Government Code Section 65303.
Legislative Context
Measure M
Since 1991, Measure M has been an important aspect behind traffic congestion relief in Orange
County. Measure M is the half-cent sales tax for transportation improvements first approved by Orange
County voters in 1990, and renewed by voters for a 30-year extension in 2006. The combined measures
raise the sales tax in Orange County by one-half cent through 2041 to help alleviate traffic congestion.
Revenue generated by both measures is returned to local jurisdictions for use on local and regional
transportation improvements and maintenance projects. To receive Measure M funds, the city must
submit to OCTA a statement of compliance with the Countywide Growth Management components that
are summarized below.
    1. Adoption of a Growth Management Element that includes
              Traffic level of service standards
              A development mitigation program
              A development phasing and annual monitoring program
    2. Participation in inter-jurisdictional planning forums
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                            Page GM-1

Yorba Linda General Plan
    3. Development of a seven-year capital improvement program
    4. Assessment of housing options and job opportunities
    5. Adoption of a Transportation Demand Management Ordinance
Measure M1
Under the first Measure M program (M1), more than $4 billion worth of transportation improvements
for Orange County were achieved, including the widening of State Route 22 (SR-22). As a result, M1
was responsible for adding 192 freeway lane miles, improving 170 intersections and 38 freeway
interchanges, and implementing Metrolink service in Orange County, which now carries the equivalent
of one lane of traffic on Interstate 5 (I-5).
Measure M2
In 2006, voters approved a continuation of transportation improvements through the Measure M
Transportation Investment Plan (M2). The renewed measure plans to deliver approximately $15.5 billion
worth of transportation improvements to Orange County by the year 2041. Major improvement plans
focus on Orange county freeways, streets and roads, transit and environmental programs. Measure M2
no longer requires Orange County jurisdictions to prepare a Growth Management Element to comply
with program requirements, the City of Yorba Linda has amended its 1993 Growth Management
Element to continue its commitment to balance local growth with the ability of the local roadway system
to support it.
Proposition 111
In 1990, the California Legislature enacted the Congestion Management Program (CMP) to implement
Proposition 111, a state-wide transportation funding proposal that required local governments to
implement mitigation measures to offset the impacts from new development on the regional
transportation system.
The program required, among other things, that every county designate a congestion management
agency, which in turn would designate a regional roadway network for monitoring purposes and
develop a plan to address deficiencies in levels of service on the network. OCTA is the designated
congestion management agency (CMA) for Orange County and is responsible for the conformance
monitoring and biennial updating of Orange County’s CMP.
Many of the Proposition 111 requirements are the same or similar to the requirements of Measure M,
such as requirements to include traffic level of service (LOS) standards and a seven-year capital
improvement program.

7. Historic Resources Element
Introduction
The purpose of incorporating a Historic
Resources Element into the General Plan is to
provide the basis for enabling legislation and
policy guidance that will allow the City of Yorba
Linda to effectively preserve, enhance and
maintain buildings, sites and areas which have
been deemed architecturally and/or historically
significant. This is important in Yorba Linda
because the city contains many individual
properties and several neighborhoods that are
associated with the city’s cultural and
architectural values and which cannot be
replaced if demolished, altered, or neglected.
Authority and Scope
The authorization to prepare a Historic Resources Element and the scope of such an element are
contained in Section 65303 of the California Government Code which states:
The general plan may include any other elements or address any other subjects which, in the judgment
of the legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city.
In many cities throughout the State, communities have turned to historic preservation, adaptive reuse,
and compatible design controls to strengthen their economies and enhance their city’s attraction to
residents, tourists and visitors. The benefits associated with including historic preservation as an integral
element of the City’s General Plan include social, aesthetic, and economic benefits.
The social benefits of historic preservation are expressed as increased awareness in the physical and
cultural heritage of Yorba Linda and increased community pride in the city’s early built environment.
Enthusiasm and popular interest in the community’s past can sustain a recognizable identity for Yorba
Linda as a source of civic pride and identity, as well as reinforce the city’s historic character as a “small
town” amidst modern development.
The aesthetic benefits of historic preservation are realized by the protection of architecturally significant
buildings and neighborhoods which provide unique visual interest within the community. The retention,
rehabilitation, and enhancement of architectural landmarks and districts can ensure that Yorba Linda
remains an aesthetically attractive place to live, work, and visit as it continues to grow and develop. The
aesthetic benefits of historic preservation are the most tangible of all its benefits.
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                                Page HR-1

Yorba Linda General Plan
The economic benefits of historic preservation may occur at the community level and at the level of
individual property owners. Recognition and promotion of landmarks and districts by the community
can have the effect of stimulating economic growth in a previously stagnant area. General increases in
property values and tax revenues can result. Financial incentives that can be realized by individual
property owners include tax savings, rehabilitation grants, and building code alternatives for historic
properties. Other economic benefits are realized by construction and related work that is involved in
rehabilitating and adapting older buildings to newer uses, rather than demolishing and rebuilding with
new construction. Rehabilitation generally requires fewer materials and it employs more labor than new
construction. In an era of diminishing material resources and rising building costs, the rehabilitation
and restoration of older buildings is a practical alternative to demolition and new construction. Historic
preservation inherently promotes sustainable development and economic well-being.
A Historic Resources Element outlines goals, objectives, and implementation measures that are adopted
by the community as priorities within the broader context of community planning and development. A
Historic Resources Element lays the groundwork for a comprehensive historic preservation ordinance.
This ordinance will ensure the City’s commitment to an enforceable preservation program.
Background
The following section is a very brief history
of the physical development of the City of
Yorba Linda. This section provides a
general overview of the historical themes,
periods, and patterns of development that
occurred in Yorba Linda. This section is not
a comprehensive overview of the history of
the city, nor is it intended to be used as a
framework for conducting research or
identifying and evaluating historical
properties located within the city. Rather, it
is intended to convey a broad sense of the
historical character of Yorba Linda.
Historical Overview of Yorba Linda
Yorba Linda is a postwar residential community of suburban character that originated as a small farm
town in the early 1900s. The land that was to become Yorba Linda was occupied by Gabrielino Indians,
who were named for their later association with the San Gabriel Arcángel Mission. Following arrival of
Europeans, the area was lightly settled by Spanish and Mexican settlers in the late eighteenth century
and nineteenth century. The earliest efforts to urbanize the area for rural agricultural development
occurred under U.S. governance in the late 1800s, but failed largely due to a lack of potable water.
  Page HR-2                                                                           Adopted Oct 2016

                                                                     Yorba Linda General Plan
In 1909, a tract map of the new town of Yorba Linda was completed. That same year, the Yorba Linda
Water Company was formed in order to create a new irrigation system. This increased agricultural
productivity in the area and it also attracted new settlers. Furthermore, a Pacific Electric Railway line was
extended from Los Angeles to Yorba Linda in 1911; the establishment of a passenger and freight depot
in 1912 solidified the new town’s identity as a growing urban center within a farming region. The core
of the town was created by the late 1910s, with a small commercial downtown concentrated primarily
along Main Street and residential development found in small tracts around downtown. The young
community was enhanced by social and cultural institutions located in downtown such as the Yorba
Linda School, the Friends Church, the Masonic Lodge, and a library.
In the 1910s, with available water and relatively inexpensive land, residents of Yorba Linda and its
surrounding area became great producers of citrus and avocadoes. These flourishing agricultural
industries sustained the small farming town throughout the first half of the twentieth century, despite
setbacks during the Great Depression and World War II. Urban development was slow during this period
of time as the town’s population increased gradually and residential neighborhoods expanded house-
by-house around the downtown core. In the late 1930s, the Imperial Highway was constructed between
Hawthorne/Inglewood and Yorba Linda, which essentially opened up Yorba Linda to Los Angeles
County. This set the stage for increased commercial and residential development in Yorba Linda
following the end of World War II in 1945.
During the postwar period, a construction boom occurred in California due to a statewide housing
shortage. This boom transformed a number of farming towns into suburbs, including Yorba Linda.
Beginning in the 1950s, the orchards began to give way to residential and commercial developments
leading to the town’s incorporation in 1967. A year prior to incorporation in 1967, the Yorba Linda
Citrus Association packing house closed after over 50 years of operation; this essentially signaled the
end of the citrus industry in Yorba Linda. Between 1957 and the mid-1960s, nearly 2,000 homes were
constructed. Thus the town transitioned from a rural farming town into a suburban residential community.
The postwar development of Yorba Linda also reflected the growing popularity of automobiles.
Construction of new highways coincided with creation of automobile-friendly shopping centers in
outlying areas and a gradual shift of businesses away from the traditional downtown core.
During the 1970s, continued population growth prompted the city to extend its boundaries. By 1980,
the city had annexed over 10,000 acres. The city of Yorba Linda also made efforts to revitalize its
downtown by physically improving its streetscapes during the late 1970s. In 1990, the Richard Nixon
Library was established at the birthplace of the former president at the northeast corner of Yorba Linda
Boulevard and Eureka Avenue. During the early twenty-first century, Yorba Linda continued to grow
through the development of single-family residences along the northern border of the city.
Despite changes that occurred over time, Yorba Linda has retained a “small town” character in its
historic downtown core and in its older residential neighborhoods. This historic character can be
observed in the architecture of older buildings and in the ways that groupings of properties relate to

6. Housing Element
I. Introduction
Role and Organization of the Housing Element
State law recognizes the vital role local
governments play in the availability,
adequacy and affordability of housing.
Every jurisdiction in California is
required to adopt a long-range General
Plan to guide its physical development;
the Housing Element is one of the seven
mandated elements of the General Plan.
Housing Element law mandates that
local governments adequately plan to
meet the existing and projected housing
needs of all economic segments of the
community. The law recognizes that in order for the private market to adequately address housing
needs and demand, local governments must adopt land use plans and regulatory systems that
provide opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain housing production. Housing element statutes
also require the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to review local
housing elements for compliance with State law and to report their findings to the local government.
California’s Housing Element law requires that each city and county develop local housing programs
to meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all income groups. The Southern
California Association of Governments (SCAG) is responsible for developing and assigning these
regional needs, or “RHNA”, to southern California jurisdictions. Pursuant to the RHNA planning
period, the Yorba Linda Housing Element is an eight-year plan extending from 2014-2021.
Yorba Linda’s Housing Element identifies strategies and programs that focus on:
                    1.  Preserving and improving housing and neighborhoods;
                    2.  Providing adequate housing sites;
                    3.  Assisting in the provision of affordable housing;
                    4.  Removing governmental and other constraints to housing investment; and
                    5.  Promoting fair and equal housing opportunities.
The City’s 2014-2021 Housing Element consists of the following major components:
     An analysis of the City’s demographic, household and housing characteristics and related
        housing needs (Section II);
Adopted Oct 2013                                                                            Page HE-1

Yorba Linda General Plan
     A review of potential market, governmental, and infrastructure constraints to meeting Yorba
        Linda’s identified housing needs (Section III);
     An evaluation of residential sites, financial and administrative resources for housing, and
        resources for energy conservation (Section IV);
     The Housing Plan for addressing the City's identified housing needs, constraints and
        resources; including housing goals, policies and program (Section V);
     Appendices documenting the residential sites inventory and public participation process.
Sources of Information
In preparing the Housing Element, and the Needs Assessment in particular, data is compiled from a
variety of sources. The following identifies the primary sources of information utilized, with the
specific source referenced beneath each data table in the Element.
       Demographic and housing data is derived from the 2010 Census, 2006-2010 American
          Community Survey, and the Southern California Association of Governments’ (SCAG)
          Existing Housing Needs Statement;
       SCAG’s 2008-2035 Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy
          Growth Forecast provides population, housing and employment projections;
       Household income data by type of household is derived from the Comprehensive
          Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) prepared by HUD;
       2012 housing market information is obtained through newspaper and internet rent
          surveys, and DataQuick sales transactions;
       Employment data by industry type and commuting patterns are provided through the Census
          2012, OnTheMap Application
       SCAG’s 2013-2021 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) provides information
          on projected housing needs; and
       Lending patterns for home purchase and home improvement loans are provided through
          the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) database.

                                                                  Yorba Linda General Plan
                                                      Public Participation
                                                      Section 6553(c)(6)(B) of the Government Code
                                                      states that, “The local government shall make
                                                      diligent effort to achieve public participation of
                                                      all economic segments of the community in the
                                                      development of the housing element, and the
                                                      program shall describe this effort.” Opportunities
                                                      for community stakeholders to provide input on
                                                      housing issues and recommend strategies are
                                                      critical to the development of appropriate and
                                                      effective programs to address the City’s housing
                                                      needs. Yorba Linda solicits input from the public
throughout the housing element process: during development of the draft element; during public review
of the draft element; and during the adoption process.
The City sought public input early during development of the draft Element through a public workshop
conducted at the Yorba Linda Community Center before the General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC)
on January 29, 2013. The Workshop was advertised through a display ad in the Yorba Linda Star
newspaper, with direct notices provided to various stakeholder groups and interested individuals,
including: for-profit and non-profit developers active in the City; residential property owners; civic
organizations; advocacy groups representing special needs populations; and local business
organizations, among others. Approximately forty people attended the Community Workshop. A
copy of the meeting notification list; agenda and PowerPoint presentation is included in Appendix A
of the Element. A second, similarly noticed public workshop was conducted before the GPAC on May
20, 2013 for review of the initial draft 2014-2021 Housing Element, with public hearings conducted
before the Planning Commission and City Council on June 12 and July 16 respectively.
Some of the common themes that arose out of the community meetings include:
         Majority of developmentally disabled residents living with parents – critical need for
            housing options as parents age and can no longer care for disabled child. Need a
            range of housing types, including:
                o   Affordable rental housing
                o   Supportive housing
                o   Small group homes
         Senior population will continue to grow as baby boomers age, necessitating focus on
            senior housing needs
         Aging infrastructure in the westerly area of the community may require improvements
            to accommodate higher density development
         Concern with the number of multi-family sites on the Westside - need better dispersal
            across the community
Adopted Oct 2013                                                                             Page HE-3

Yorba Linda General Plan
The housing needs and issues raised by the public are addressed within the Housing Element.
For example, the Element includes program actions to: 1) pursue supportive housing funds and
discuss with affordable housing providers options to integrate units for persons with developmental
disabilities; 2) conduct expanded education and outreach on opportunities for second units; and
3) develop and disseminate guidelines for Universal Design to better allow persons to age in
place. Information from the Yorba Linda Water District has also been incorporated into the Element
on the projected replacement timelines for aging water mains.
Upon submittal of the draft Housing Element to the State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) for review and comment, the City circulates a Notice of Availability to a variety
of interested organizations. The Notice defines a 60 day review and comment period, and identifies
locations for review of the draft document. In addition, the draft Housing Element is placed on the
City’s website at www.ci.yorba-linda.ca.us.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
Yorba Linda has initiated a comprehensive update of its current 1993 General Plan, along with
preparation of a Parks & Recreation Master Plan. The updated General Plan will revisit the
community’s priorities and visions for the future, looking out over the next 20 years. The Yorba Linda
General Plan will be comprised of the following elements:
         Land Use                                              Safety
         Housing                                               Noise
         Circulation and Mobility                              Economic Development
         Open Space and Parks and Recreation                   Community Design
         Conservation                                          Historic Resources
The City’s 2014-2021 Housing Element is being coordinated with the City’s overall General Plan
update and with the General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC). However, the Housing Element is being
prepared in a more expedited time frame and will be adopted in advance of the balance of the
General Plan in adherence to the mandatory update cycle for SCAG (Southern California
Association of Governments) jurisdictions. The City will ensure consistency between the Housing
Element and the other updated General Plan elements so that policies introduced in one element are
consistent with other elements. As now required upon adoption of the Housing Element (Government
Code Section 65302), the City’s Safety and Conservation Elements will include an analysis of policies
regarding           flood       hazards        and         flood         management         information
(http://www.hcd.ca.gov/hpd/hrc/plan/he/ab_162_stat07.pdf).

II. Housing Needs Assessment
This section of the Housing Element discusses the characteristics of the City’s population and housing
stock as a means of better understanding the nature and extent of unmet housing needs. The
Housing Needs Assessment is comprised of the following components:
Demographic Profile
Demographic changes such as population growth or changes in age can affect the type and amount
of housing that is needed in a community. This section addresses population, age, and race and
ethnicity of Yorba Linda residents.
Population Growth and Trends
Table II-1: Regional Population Growth Trends 1980-2010, presents population growth trends in Yorba
Linda from 1980-2010, and compares this growth to neighboring jurisdictions and the entire County
of Orange. Orange County experienced a high level of growth both during the 1980s (25%) and
1990s (18%), and reduced considerably in the 2000s (6%). Yorba Linda experienced dramatic growth
in the 1980s (86%) but was more similar to other neighboring cities in the 1990s (12%) and 2000s
(9%). Yorba Linda’s growth between 2000-2010 was higher than the County and neighboring
communities.
In terms of future trends, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) Regional
Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy Growth Forecast projects a 9.8 percent increase
in Yorba Linda’s population over the 2008-2020 period for an estimated population of just under
70,000 in 2020.

Age Characteristics
Table II-2: Age Distribution 1990-2010, displays the age distribution of the City’s population in
1990 and 2010, and compares this with Orange County as a whole. As displayed in the table,
24 percent of Yorba Linda’s population is comprised of children under the age of 18, which is
comparable to the countywide population. A comparison of the 1990 and 2010 Census shows a
decrease in the proportion of school age children (from 21% to 19%).
The biggest change in Yorba Linda’s age profile is a shift from a younger population to a more
mature population. This aging trend is borne out by an increase in the median age from 32.5 years
in 1990 to 41.7 years in 2010, well above the countywide median age of 36.2 years.
The City evidenced a sharp decline in its young adult (25-44 years) population over the two decades
(from 37% to 22%), while experiencing significant growth in the middle adult (45-64 years) and senior
(65+ years) populations. The middle adult population increased by over 11,000 persons (from 19%
to 33%), and the senior population grew by about 5,000 persons (from 5% to 12%). Factors
contributing to this shift in the City’s age structure include an aging in place of young adults into
middle age, a corresponding aging of the middle age population into senior citizens, and the
limited number of new young adults and families moving into the community due in part to high
housing costs. As discussed later in the section, Yorba Linda has also experienced a decline in both
the number and proportion of families with children over the past two decades.

Race and Ethnicity
Table II-3: Racial and Ethnic Composition 1990-2010, displays the racial/ethnic composition of Yorba
Linda’s population in 1990 and 2010, and compares this with the Countywide distribution. White
residents continue to represent the vast majority of the City’s population, though similar to the
region, have continued to decrease in relative proportion, declining from 79 percent in 1990 to 66
percent in 2010. The City’s Asian/Pacific Islander population nearly doubled between 1990-2010,
increasing from 10 to 18 percent, and for the first time reaching a level comparable to the Countywide
proportion. The City experienced a more modest growth in its Hispanic population, increasing from 9
to 14 percent over the past two decades, well below the 34 percent of Hispanics Countywide. The
African American population remained at about one percent of the population, and “Other Races”
and American Indians also remained at less than one percent. Despite Yorba Linda’s increasing
diversity, the City remains less ethnically diverse than Orange County as a whole.

Employment
The recent economic recession had a significant impact on job growth in Orange County, with the
loss in over 100,000 jobs between 2006 and 2010.1 Since that time, the economy has begun to
turn around, with the Orange County Business Council reporting an increase in 35,000 private
sector jobs in the County during the first three quarters of 2012, and projected continued job growth
in 2013 and 2014.2 Within Yorba Linda, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
documents 2008 employment levels at 19,000, with projected 2020 employment of 17,200 and 2035

Over 40 percent of Yorba Linda’s primary employment is in lower paying retail, hospitality, construction
and service-related industries, with wages generally below the level necessary to afford to live in the
City. The Census5 documents that 88 percent of the 11,400 persons employed within Yorba Linda
commute in from outside the City limits, indicative of the shortage of local affordable housing
opportunities for the community’s workforce. However, Yorba Linda is not unique among Orange
County communities in this regard, with the cities of Anaheim, Brea, Fullerton and Orange exhibiting
similarly high proportions of their workforce commuting in from outside the City limits. On a countywide
basis, 42 percent of persons employed within Orange County are commuting in from other counties,
compared to 24 percent in Los Angeles County and just 18 percent in San Diego County.
Workforce Housing Scorecard
In December 2012, the Orange County Business Council published the results of its second Workforce
Housing Scorecard. This report provides a comprehensive evaluation of the current and future state of
Orange County’s housing supply and demand, and its effect on business competitiveness. The initial
Workforce Scorecard published in 2008 identified the significant shortage of housing for the County’s
growing workforce, and its impact on the ability of employers to attract and maintain key workforce
talent. The challenge for young families to afford housing in Orange County is apparent, with over
50,000 residents aged 20 to 34 leaving the County between 2000-2010 while the more affordable
Inland Empire and San Diego regions experienced a 21 percent increase in this same age group. The
Scorecard warns that the continued loss of this younger population will weaken Orange County’s future
workforce pool and negatively impact the long-term regional economy.
      Based on the following criteria, the Scorecard rates each jurisdiction’s record over the 1991-
          2010 period in addressing workforce housing needs:
      Number of jobs, rewarding cities that promote job growth
      Housing unit density
      Housing growth, rewarding cities that promote housing growth
      Jobs/housing balance
Of the 34 cities in Orange County, Yorba Linda ranked 20th in its success over the past two decades
in generating both new jobs and the supply of homes necessary to house these new workers. In terms

Household Profile
Household type and size, income levels,
and the presence of special needs
populations all affect the type of housing
needed by residents. This section details
the various household characteristics
affecting housing needs in Yorba Linda.
Household Type
A household is defined as all persons
living in a housing unit. Families are a
subset of households, and include persons
living together related by blood, marriage,
or adoption. A single person living alone is also a household. “Other” households are unrelated
people residing in the same dwelling unit. Group quarters, such as dormitories or convalescent homes
are not considered households.
The 2010 Census documents 21,576 households in Yorba Linda, with an average household size of
2.97 persons and average family size of 3.29 persons (refer to Table II-6). This represents a decrease
in household size (3.12) from 1990, and is similar to the Orange County average household size of
2.99. The decrease in Yorba Linda’s household size reflects the decline in family households with
children, and increase in senior citizens over the past two decades.
Families comprise the overwhelming majority of households in Yorba Linda (82%), including families
with children (37%), and those without children (45%). However, over the past two decades, the number
of families with children decreased by approximately 400, resulting in a decline in their relative
proportion from 50 to 37 percent of all households. In contrast, the proportion of family households
without children increased from 35 to 45 percent, and single-person households increased from 11 to
14. Over 80 percent of the City’s net growth in 4,800 new households between 1990 and 2010 was
due to the growth in childless family households. Figure 2: Family Households with Children, depicts
the percentage of family households with children by census block group, and illustrates presence of
high concentrations (40–50%) in neighborhoods distributed throughout Yorba Linda.

Household Income
The State and Federal government classify household income into several groupings based upon the
relationship to the County adjusted median income (AMI), adjusted for household size. The State of
California utilizes the income groups presented in Table II-7: State Income Categories, which are thus
used throughout the Housing Element.

Table II-8: Household Income Distribution, presents the distribution of household income in Yorba Linda
by income category. Despite the City’s overall affluence, Yorba Linda does have its share of lower
income households, with 22 percent earning less than 80 percent of the County median. Extremely
low-income (ELI) households (<30% AMI) comprise five percent of households, and have significant
housing needs. According to the CHAS Data compiled by HUD, two-thirds of the City’s ELI households
are homeowners (761 households), with 72 percent of these ELI homeowners spending more than half
their income towards housing, placing them at risk of being unable to maintain, or potentially losing
their homes. Among the City’s estimated 380 ELI renter households, 73 percent spend more than half
their incomes on rent.

Yorba Linda General Plan
Many of the workers who make up Yorba Linda’ workforce earn modest incomes, making it challenging
to afford to live in the City. Table II-9: Orange County Wages for Select Occupations 2012, presents
a sampling of occupations in Yorba Linda, which falls within very low-, low- and moderate-income
thresholds (based on a single worker household). The analysis of housing costs and affordability
presented later in this section compares current market rents and sales prices in Yorba Linda with the
amount that households of different income levels can afford to pay for housing. This analysis illustrates
that very low and even most low income occupations, such as childcare workers and retail sales
managers, cannot afford the median rent in Yorba Linda.

Special Needs Populations
State law recognizes that certain households have more difficulty in finding adequate and affordable
housing due to special circumstances. Special needs populations include the elderly, persons with
disabilities, female-headed households, large households and farmworkers. In addition, many often
have lower incomes as a result of their condition. Table II-10: Special Needs Populations 2010,
summarizes the special needs populations in Yorba Linda. Each of these population groups, as well as
their housing needs, is described below.

Senior Households
The 2010 Census identifies 12 percent (7,606) of Yorba Linda’s residents as over the age of 65,
reflecting an increase in over 3,000 seniors over the past decade. Nearly one-third have some type of
disability related to self-care or mobility, which may limit their ability to live independently. About 21
percent of Yorba Linda’s households are headed by a senior, the majority of which are homeowners
(84%).
One-quarter of the City’s senior homeowners live alone, and over the long term may require supportive
services to remain independent in their homes. Figure 3: Senior (Age 65+) Homeowners Living Alone,
illustrates the percentage of homeowners in each census block group that are seniors living alone.
Neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of individual senior homeowners include: the northwest
corner of the City, which includes the Lake Park Mobile Home Community; the older neighborhoods
surrounding the Town Center and immediately south of Yorba Linda Boulevard; and neighborhood in
Travis Ranch located between Yorba Ranch Road and Yorba Linda Boulevard.
The elderly have a number of special needs including housing, transportation, health care, and other
services. Rising rents are a particular concern due to the fact that most seniors are on fixed incomes.
Of Yorba Linda’s 735 senior renter households, 80 percent are lower income, with nearly one-third
extremely low income. As shown later in Table II-22, Yorba Linda has two senior housing projects
providing 224 rental units affordable to a mix of very low and low-income households. The State of
California Community Care Licensing Division identifies 25 residential care homes for the elderly in
Yorba Linda, providing 235 beds for seniors age 60+ requiring 24 hour assisted living. In addition to
the 24 small residential care facilities (6 or fewer beds) “board and care” homes, there is one larger
facility with 93 beds.
For those seniors who live on their own, many have limited incomes and physical limitations, both of
which may inhibit their ability to maintain their homes or perform minor repairs. Furthermore, the
installation of grab bars and other assistance devices in the home may be needed. The City offers a
Residential Rehabilitation Program which provides grants to lower income home owners, including
senior and disabled households, with funding for home repairs and improvements. This program can
assist home owners with the cost of installing assistance devices.
The City of Yorba Linda and the Yorba Linda Senior Citizens Club coordinate a number of senior
activities at various community facilities throughout the community, including the Senior Citizens Center.
Programs offered include recreational and social activities, a senior lunch, food distribution,
preventative healthcare, and transportation services.

Large Households
Large households consist of five or more
persons and are considered a special
needs population due to the limited
availability of affordable and adequately
sized housing. The lack of large units is
especially evident among rental units.
Large renter households are vulnerable to
overcrowding due to the shortage of
adequately sized rentals, and insufficient
income to afford available units of
adequate size.
In Yorba Linda, large households comprise 15 percent of total households in the City (2010 Census).
Of these large households, just 16 percent, or 485 households, are renters, with45 percent of these
renter households earning lower incomes. Based on the CHAS (Comprehensive Housing Affordability
Strategy) Databook prepared by HUD, approximately 62 percent of Yorba Linda’s large renter
households suffer from one or more housing problems, including housing overpayment,
overcrowding and/or substandard housing conditions.
Yorba Linda’s housing stock includes approximately 1,500 rental units with three or more bedrooms,
in general, the appropriate sized unit to house the city’s 485 large renter households (2006-2010
American Community). While numerically there may be a sufficient number of large rental units, the
problem is primarily related to the lack of affordability of these larger units, many of which are single-
family home rentals. However, market rents for a 3-bedroom apartment exceed the level of affordability
for lower income large family households.
Female-Headed Households
Single-parent households typically have a special need for such services as childcare and health care,
among others. Female-headed households with children in particular tend to have lower incomes,
which limits their housing options and access to supportive services. The American Community Survey
reports 1,775 female-headed family households in Yorba Linda; 835 of these households had children.
Of those households with children, 11 percent lived in poverty, compared to a poverty rate of just
one percent among all Yorba Linda families. Thus, female-headed households with children need
assistance with housing subsidies, as well as accessible and affordable day care.
The City of Yorba Linda sponsors an assortment of classes for youth and teens throughout the year.
The City has an Activity Center, a Field House, a number of parks, and shared school/park facilities
that provide two indoor gymnasiums, baseball and soccer fields, volleyball and basketball courts, and
horse trails.

Yorba Linda General Plan
Persons with Disabilities
A disability is defined as a long lasting condition that impairs an individual’s mobility, ability to work,
or ability to care for themselves. Persons with disabilities include those with physical, mental, or
emotional disabilities. Disabled persons have special housing needs because of their fixed income,
shortage of affordable and accessible housing, and higher health costs associated with their disability.
The 2008-2010 American Community Survey (ACS) identifies 4,424 Yorba Linda residents as having
one or more disabilities, representing seven percent of the City’s population. One- third of these adult
residents are unable to live independently. The ACS documents the presence of following types of
disabilities among Yorba Linda’s disabled residents:
              •  Ambulatory – 55%
              •  Cognitive – 31%
              •  Hearing – 27%
              •  Vision – 135
Of the City’s senior population, 30 percent suffer from a disability. As Yorba Linda’s population
continues to age, the number of residents with disabilities will also increase.
The living arrangements for persons with disabilities depends on the severity of the disability. Many
persons live at home in an independent environment with the help of other family members. To
maintain independent living, disabled persons may require assistance. This can include special housing
design features for the physically disabled, income support for those who are unable to work, and in-
home supportive services for persons with medical conditions. Accessible housing can also be provided
via senior housing developments.
The State Community Care Licensing Division identifies one adult residential facility (6 person
capacity) in Yorba Linda that provides 24-hour non-medical care for adults age 18- 59 who are
unable to provide for their own daily needs. A far greater number of licensed care facilities are
available for seniors in Yorba Linda, with 25 residential care facilities for the elderly, providing
capacity for 235 persons.
Developmental Disabilities6
The State Welfare and Institutions Code (Section 4512) defines a “developmental disability” as a
disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to
continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual, which includes mental
retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes disabling conditions found
   6
     SB 812, passed by the California legislature in 2010, now requires the housing element to specifically
   analyze the housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities, and to identify resources to
   serve this population.

to be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals
with mental retardation, but does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in
nature.
The Regional Center of Orange County (RCOC) is among 21 regional centers operated by the State
Department of Developmental Services to serve the developmentally disabled population. The goal
of these centers is to: 1) prevent/minimize institutionalization of developmentally disabled persons and
their dislocation from family and community; and 2) enable this population to lead more independent
and productive lives.
The RCOC serves approximately 17,000 individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.
Within Yorba Linda’s two zip codes, the Regional Center currently provides services to 297 residents
with developmental disabilities, generating an estimated need for 100 housing units:

 50% need hsg; age 23-54 35% need hsg; age 55-65 25% needhsg; age 65+ 20% need hsg.
The regional centers have identified a number of community-based housing types appropriate for
persons living with a developmental disability: licensed community care facilities and group homes;
supervised apartment settings with support services; SB 962 homes (for persons with special health
care and intensive support needs); and for persons able to live more independently, rent subsidized
homes, inclusionary housing, and Section 8 rental vouchers. In addition to services offered through the
Regional Center, Project Independence in Costa Mesa has assisted hundreds of developmentally
disabled individuals to gain the necessary skills to live independently.
Yorba Linda supports the provision of housing for persons with disabilities, and has adopted provisions
in its Zoning Code to enable community care facilities and supportive housing, and has adopted
provisions for reasonable accommodation. Housing Element programs to facilitate affordable housing
can also assist residents with developmental disabilities.

Homeless
Every two years, the Orange County Community Services Homeless Prevention Division and its
partners conduct a Point-In-Time Homeless Count and Survey (PITS) to collect data on the number
and characteristics of the homeless in Orange County. The 2011 PITS 7 identified 6,939 homeless
                                                                               7
individuals in the County, including 1,708 persons in families with children (25%). The following
summarizes some of the key findings of the survey:
         Nearly two-thirds (62%) of the homeless counted were unsheltered, with 38% in shelter
          facilities, including emergency shelters, transitional housing programs and motel voucher
          programs
         Job loss (39%) and alcohol/drug use (17%) were cited by homeless individuals as the top two
          causes for their current episode of homelessness
         55% of respondents indicated this was their first episode of homelessness
         Over half (57%) of homeless respondents indicated they had one or more disabling
          conditions, including 24% with a physical disability, 20% suffering from mental illness, 25%
          experiencing chronic health problems, and 33% currently using alcohol and/or other drugs
While the PITS does not enumerate the homeless count by jurisdiction, in the representative survey
sample of 794 homeless throughout the County, just 3 persons identified Yorba Linda as their
last place of residence. By comparison, the 2010 Census identifies no homeless individuals in
Yorba Linda. Most of the homeless observed in Yorba Linda are transient, moving through the
City along Imperial Highway and Yorba Linda Boulevard. However, on occasion, the police have
observed some small (1-2 people) encampments in the Featherly Regional Park area, when water is
low.
“2-1-1 Orange County” was established in 2005 to provide a comprehensive information and referral
system to link County residents with community health and human services support. The service is
available seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Callers are connected with certified, multi-lingual
information and referral specialists who utilize a database to provide information on services including
shelter and housing resources, food, and substance abuse assessment and treatment.

Yorba Linda General Plan
Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through seasonal
agricultural work. Farm workers have special housing needs because they earn lower incomes than
many other workers and move throughout the season from one harvest to the next. In their 2012
RHNA Existing Needs Statement, SCAG identifies just 31 Yorba Linda residents employed in the
industries of farming, fishing or forestry, representing 0.1 percent of the City’s labor force. Yorba
Linda retains some limited land dedicated to agricultural production. Therefore, given the extremely
limited presence of farmworkers in the community, the City has no specialized housing programs
targeted to this group beyond overall programs for housing affordability.

County region. Yorba Linda’s growth rate over the last three decades has consistently been above
that of its neighboring cities and Orange County as a whole. Yorba Linda’s housing stock increased by
91 percent between 1980 and 1990, 13 percent between 1990 and 2000, and another 14 percent
between 2000 and 2010. In comparison, Countywide housing growth was just eight percent over the
most recent decade.
The 2010 Census documents Yorba Linda’s housing stock at 22,305 units, reflecting the addition
of over 2,700 units since 2000. Upon completion of the Vista Del Verde and North Yorba Linda
Estates hillside communities, future residential development will be primarily limited to smaller infill
sites designated for medium and higher density development.

A vacancy rate of five percent for rental housing and two percent for ownership housing is generally
considered healthy and suggests that there is a balance between the supply and demand of housing.
As measured by the 2010 Census, the residential vacancy rate in Yorba Linda was 1.2 percent for
ownership units and 4 percent for rental units, indicating a modest pent-up demand for both ownership
and rental housing in the City.
Housing Type and Tenure
Table II-14: Housing Type 1990-2010, presents the mix of housing types in Yorba Linda. Of the City’s
22,305 housing units in 2010, 88 percent were single-family homes and 10 percent were multi-family
units, unchanged since 1990. As the areas remaining for large scale single-family development
diminish, the relative proportion of multi-family units in the City can be expected to increase. Yorba
Linda also has one mobile home park containing just under 300 mobile home units, comprising one
percent of the City’s housing.

Housing tenure refers to whether a housing unit is owned, rented or is vacant. Tenure is an important
indicator of the housing climate of a community, reflecting the relative cost of housing opportunities,
and the ability of residents to afford housing. Tenure also influences residential mobility, with owner
units generally evidencing lower turnover rates than rental housing. According to the 2010 Census,
84 percent of Yorba Linda’s households were homeowners, demonstrating stability since 1990 when
84 percent of the households were also owner-occupied (Table II-15: Housing Tenure 1990-2000).
Yorba Linda’s homeownership rate continues to be higher than the countywide homeownership rate
of 59.3 percent.

Housing Age and Condition
The age of a community’s housing stock can provide an indicator of overall housing conditions.
Typically housing over 30 years in age is likely to have rehabilitation needs that may include new
plumbing, roof repairs, foundation work and other repairs. Table II-16: Age of Housing Stock 2010,
displays the age of Yorba Linda’s occupied housing stock by owner/renter tenure as of 2010.
Almost half (45%) of Yorba Linda’s housing stock is 30 years or older in 2010 (built in the 1970s or
before). By 2020, an additional 30 percent of the housing stock (built during the 1980’s) will reach
30 years in age. Problems with property maintenance and housing deterioration have not been a
significant issue thus far in Yorba Linda. High property values and a strong sense of neighborhood
pride have contributed to well-maintained neighborhoods. Nonetheless, given the community’s aging
housing stock, combined with a growing senior population who may face difficulties maintaining
their homes, both code enforcement and housing rehabilitation programs are important and can be
focused on older areas of the City.

In terms of developing a general estimate of the number of units in need of rehabilitation in Yorba
Linda, the City used the following approach. Using 30 years as the benchmark when residential
structures begin requiring major systems replacement or repair, units built prior to 1980 can be
considered as potential candidates for rehabilitation needs. Of Yorba Linda’s approximately 1,800
pre-1980 rental units, an estimated 20 percent, or 360 units, may require some degree of
rehabilitation over the Housing Element planning period. Among the City’s 7,700 pre-1980 owner

units, an estimated five percent, or 385 units, may be in need of rehabilitation. No units have been
identified as needing replacement.
Housing Costs and Affordability
Rental Housing Market
Current rental information (January 2013) for Yorba Linda was obtained from Internet rental listings in
the Orange County Register, Craigslist and Rental Source websites. Table II-17: Survey of Vacant
Rental Units. January 2013, presents the results of the rent survey by unit type, including apartments/
condominiums/townhomes, single-family homes, and individual rooms for rent.
A total of 60 non-duplicative multi-family units were advertised for rent in Yorba Linda, including
15 apartments and 45 units identified as townhomes or condominiums. Median monthly rents were
$1,040 for a studio, $1,200 for a one-bedroom unit, $1,700 for a two bedroom unit, and $2,050
for a three bedroom unit. While no three bedroom apartments were advertised,
townhome/condominiums helped to fill the gap in larger unit rentals.
A greater number of single-family homes were listed for rent in Yorba Linda than multi-family units, with
81 home rentals identified in the rent survey. Median rents ranged from $1,800 for a two-bedroom
home, $2,550 for a three bedroom home, and $2,900 for a home with four or more bedrooms.
The significant number of single-family home rentals is likely a reflection of the “shadow market”
occurring in many California communities where homeowners looking to move are unable to sell
or are unwilling to take a large hit to their equity, and instead chose to rent out their homes.
In addition to the full rental units surveyed, 41 individual rooms were listed for rent within
condominiums and single-family homes, ranging in price from $350 to $850. Many of the rooms
were marketed to students as convenient to both California State University, Fullerton and California
State University, Pomona. Rooms provide a lower cost rental option for singles, as well as allowing
homeowners to supplement their income, particularly useful for senior homeowners on fixed incomes.

by zip code, and contrasts this with sales during the prior year. The Los Angeles Times reports 778
single-family homes sold in Yorba Linda in 2012. After several years of decline, sales prices were fairly
stable from the prior year, with a median sales price of $590,000 in zip code 92886 (generally west
of Fairmont Blvd) and $650,000 in zip code 92887 (east Yorba Linda). Home prices in Yorba
Linda were significantly higher than the countywide median of $500,000, as well as Anaheim,
Brea, Fullerton and Placentia.

Yorba Linda General Plan
Home Foreclosures
Nearly 1.5 million of the 8.7 million homes
and condominiums in California have been
involved in a foreclosure proceeding since
2007. While the number of mortgage default
notices in the State has been consistently
declining since its peak in 2010, the level
of foreclosure activity in California remains
among the highest in the country.
Approximately 49,000 Notices of Default
were recorded in the State during third
quarter 2012, comprising 20 percent of all
residential resales.
Within Yorba Linda, www.Realtytrac.com
identifies 197 single-family home and condominiums units (March 2013) in various states of
foreclosure: 71 units in “pre- foreclosure” having received a notice of mortgage default; 72 units
undergoing foreclosure with notice of a trustee sale; and 54 units with ownership taken over by the
bank. RealtyTrac reports a total of 23 new foreclosure filings in Yorba Linda in March 2013, 73
percent lower than the same time last year and representing 1 filing for every 1,033 residential units
in the City. In comparison, the ratio of March foreclosure filings to total housing units in the State,
Los Angeles and Orange counties, Diamond Bar and Placentia were higher than in Yorba Linda,
whereas the foreclosure ratio in Anaheim, Brea and Fullerton were below that of Yorba Linda. 8               8

While foreclosures have been on the decline, “short sales” - where the sales price falls short of what is
owed on the property - have been rising. In terms of distressed property sales, short sales are
preferable to foreclosures for several reasons: 1) units are typically occupied and in better condition;
2) they tend to be higher priced; and 3) short sales are more favorable financially for banks

     The foreclosure ratio is calculated by dividing the number of dwelling units in the jurisdiction by the
   total number of properties that received foreclosure notices that month. The lower the second
   number in the ratio, the higher the foreclosure rate.

which may translate into improved lending conditions. In third quarter 2012, short sales comprised 26
percent of statewide resale activity.
Housing Affordability
The affordability of housing in Yorba Linda
can be assessed by comparing market rents
and sales prices with the amount that
households of different income levels can
afford to pay for housing. Compared
together, this information can reveal who
can afford what size and type of housing as
well as indicate the type of households
that would most likely experience
overcrowding or overpayment.
For purposes of evaluating home purchase affordability, Table II-20: 2012 Orange County Maximum
Affordable Housing Cost (Moderate Income), presents the maximum affordable purchase price for
moderate income households (120% AMI), and compares this with the 2012 median sales prices for
single-family homes and condominiums in Yorba Linda as previously documented in Table II-18:
Single-Family Homes and Condominium Sales Jan-Dec 2012. As illustrated below, the maximum
affordable purchase price ranges from $382,000 for a two person household, $433,000 for a three
person household, and $481,000 for a four person household. While the median priced three-
bedroom single-family home is beyond the reach of households earning moderate incomes, the
median priced two-bedroom home ($421,000) falls just within moderate income affordability
($433,000). As the real estate market continues to improve and the number of distressed and below
market sales decline, the availability of affordably priced single-family homes in Yorba Linda will likely
diminish.
Condominiums provide an affordable homeownership option for many moderate income
households in Yorba Linda. For example, a four person moderate income household can afford a
purchase price up to $481,000, and is thus easily able to afford the $250,000 median priced
three-bedroom condominium. Expanding the supply of condominiums, combined with downpayment
assistance programs, can thus be an effective way to extend affordable homeownership opportunities
to moderate income households in Yorba Linda.

     Table II-21: 2012 Maximum Affordable Rents, Orange County, presents the maximum affordable
     rents for very low, low and moderate-income households by household size, and compares with
     median apartment rents in Yorba Linda (as documented previously in Table II-17). As the table
     below indicates, Citywide median rents are above the level of affordability for all very low
     income households, and for low income households with three or more persons. However, median
     rent levels on studio and one bedroom units are within the level affordable to smaller, one and
     two person households earning low incomes, and room rentals provide an affordable option for
     very low income individuals.

Assisted Housing At-Risk of Conversion
State Housing Element law requires an analysis of the potential for currently rent-restricted low income
housing units to convert to market rate housing, and to propose programs to preserve or replace
any units “at-risk” of conversion. This section presents an inventory of all assisted rental housing in
Yorba Linda, and evaluates those units at risk of conversion during the ten year 2013-2023 planning
period.
Assisted Housing Inventory
Yorba Linda has an active history of supporting
affordable housing in its community. As illustrated in
Table II-22: Assisted Rental Housing Inventory, the City
and its former Redevelopment Agency have facilitated
the development or acquisition/ rehabilitation of six
multi-family residential developments, totaling 489
lower income affordable rental units. This inventory
includes all multi-family units assisted under federal,
state, and local programs, including HUD, state/local
bond programs, density bonus, inclusionary, and local redevelopment or direct assistance programs.
All of the City’s affordable rental projects have long-term affordability restrictions and none are at-
risk of conversion to market rate.

In addition to the above projects, the prior Yorba Linda Redevelopment Agency purchased 26 units
at the 52 unit Evergreen Villas senior condominium complex that it rented to low income (<50%
AMI) seniors at affordable rents. In December 2009, Yorba Linda transferred its ownership in these
units to a non-profit purchaser (Orange Housing Development Corporation – OHDC). The former
Redevelopment Agency entered into an Affordable Housing Agreement with OHDC to acquire the
remaining 26 condominium units in Evergreen Villas as they become available for rehabilitation
for conversion to low income affordable senior rental housing. Since OHDC took ownership of
Evergreen in December 2009, four additional condominium units have been purchased for a total
of 30 units being provided as affordable rentals (June 2012).
Yorba Linda has expanded its Affordable Housing Agreement with OHDC to provide for the purchase
and conversion to affordable rentals of up to 48 units in the following identified condominium sites
with high rates of foreclosure and/or economic blight:
        The Hills Condominiums, located north of La Palma at Via Lomas de Yorba. This 296
         unit property exhibits a disproportionately high number of units undergoing foreclosure and
         short sales, and represents one-third of all condominium units currently on the market in the
         City.
        Yorba Linda Village Condominiums, located along Lakeview south of Yorba Linda
         Boulevard. This 42 unit complex has had no sales since 2008, with the two units
         currently on the market listed for over 150 days. The property evidences deferred
         maintenance and physical blight.

        Lakeview Retirement Homes, located at Lakeview and Lemon. This 62 unit property is
         limited to persons age 55+ years, and is characterized by economic blight. Of the three
         units currently listed for sale on the market, two are short sales.
        Jamestown Condominiums, located at Imperial and Valley View. This 120 unit complex
         currently has two units on the market, one of which is an REO and the other a short sale.
        Rancho Linda Condominiums, located at Yorba Linda Boulevard and Eureka. Property
         contains 60 one and two bedroom units and is nearing 50 years in age.
As of December 2012, OHDC had completed the purchase and rehabilitation of 30 units in these
complexes and conversion to affordable rentals
Housing Problems
A continuing priority of communities is enhancing or maintaining the quality of life for residents. A key
measure of the quality of life in Yorba Linda is the extent of “housing problems”. One measure of
housing problems used by both the State and Federal governments is the extent of housing overpayment
and overcrowding within a community.
Overpayment
Housing overpayment, as defined by the State and Federal government, refers to spending more than
30 percent of income on housing; severe overpayment is spending greater than 50 percent of income.
Table II-23: Housing Overpayment 2005-2009, shows the incidence of overpayment in Yorba Linda.

Yorba Linda General Plan
According to the 2005-2009 American Community Survey, 39 percent of owners and 51 percent
of renters in Yorba Linda were spending more than 30 percent of their total income on housing. This
level of overpayment represents a significant ten percent increase from 2000 when 30 percent of
owners and 41 percent of renters were overpaying. Severe overpayment among renters has also
increased, rising from 26 to 29 percent. In terms of overpayment among lower income households
(<80% AMI), an estimated 870 lower income renter households and 1,661 lower income owners
were faced with overpayment. The impact of housing overpayment on Yorba Linda’s lower income
households is significant, with the community’s special needs populations – seniors, persons with
disabilities, and female-headed households with children - most vulnerable to losing their housing due
to an inability to pay.
Overcrowding
The State defines an overcrowded housing unit as one occupied by more than 1.01 persons per room
(excluding kitchens, porches, and hallways). A unit with more than 1.51 occupants per room is
considered severely overcrowded. The incidence of overcrowded housing is a general measure of
whether there is an available supply of adequately sized housing units.
Table II-24: Overcrowded Households 2005-2009 shows the incidence of overcrowding in Yorba
Linda and Orange County by tenure, as measured by the 2005-2009 American Community Survey.
As indicated, just two percent of all households in Yorba Linda were living in overcrowded conditions,
well below the incidence of overcrowding Countywide where overcrowding impacts nine percent
of households. While the City’s renter households were more likely to experience overcrowded living
conditions than owner households, the level of renter overcrowding has declined over the past decade,
from nine percent in 2000 to four percent in 2010, well below the overcrowding seen Countywide
which impacted 17 percent of all renter households. Overall, household overcrowding remains a
relatively minor issue in Yorba Linda.

                                             Regional Housing Needs Allocation
                                             The Regional Housing Allocation (RHNA) is a state-
                                             mandated process, which determines the amount of future
                                             housing growth each city and county must plan for in
                                             their housing elements. This “fair share” allocation concept
                                             seeks to ensure that each jurisdiction accepts responsibility
                                             for the housing needs of not only its resident population,
                                             but also for the jurisdiction’s projected share of regional
                                             housing growth across all income categories. Regional
growth needs are defined as the number of units that would have to be added in each jurisdiction
to accommodate the forecasted number of households, as well as the number of units that need
to be added to compensate for anticipated demolitions and changes to achieve an “ideal” vacancy
rate.
The RHNA process begins with the California Department of Housing and Community
Development’s (HCD) projection of future statewide housing growth need, and the apportionment
of this need to regional councils of government throughout the state. As southern California’s
designated Council of Government, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is
the agency responsible for developing an allocation methodology to allocate the region’s assigned
share of statewide need to cities and counties by income level. In allocating the region’s future housing
needs to jurisdictions, SCAG is required to take the following factors into consideration:
        Market demand for housing
        Employment opportunities
        Availability of suitable sites and public facilities
        Commuting patterns
        Type and tenure of housing
        Loss of units in assisted housing developments
        Over-concentration of lower income households
        Geological and topographical constraints
SCAG has adopted the RHNA for the 2014-2021 Housing Element cycle, and has allocated Yorba
Linda the following share of the region’s housing needs:

          ** An estimated half of City’s 160 very low income housing needs (80 units) are for extremely low
          income households earning less than 30% AMI
The RHNA represents the minimum number of housing units each community is required to provide
“adequate sites” for through zoning and is one of the primary threshold criteria necessary to achieve State
approval of the Housing Element. As the RHNA represents a planning target for new residential growth
and not a building quota, so long as a jurisdiction provides sufficient sites and does not impose constraints
to development, it is not penalized for falling short of its RHNA target. Yorba Linda will continue to provide
sites for a mix of single-family, multi-family and mixed use housing, supported by a variety of programs
to enhance affordability, to accommodate its RHNA and contribute towards addressing the growing
demand for housing in the southern California region.

III. Housing Constraints
This section assesses the various governmental, market, infrastructure and environmental factors that
may serve as a potential constraint to housing development in Yorba Linda.
Governmental Constraints
Land Use Controls
The Yorba Linda General Plan provides for the following residential land use designations:
     Low Density Residential (R-A - Residential Agricultural, RLD – Residential Low- Density) – Designated
     for the steep terrain along the northerly and easterly boundaries of the planning area. Maximum
     density is 1 unit per acre, with clustering permitted at greater intensities to compensate for
     topographical constraints.
     Medium Low Density Residential (R-E – Residential Estate) – Intended for spacious single family
     homes. Lot sizes typically range from one-third to half an acre per dwelling unit. This
     category has been allocated in some cases to respond to terrain with topographical constraints.
     Maximum density is 1.8 dwelling units per acre.
     Medium Density Residential (R-S – Residential Suburban) – Designated for single- family detached
     residential subdivisions, or more innovative subdivision planning allowing clustered development
     in conjunction with provision of recreational facilities and preservation of open spaces. Average
     density is 3.0 dwelling units per acre.
     Medium High Residential (R-U – Residential Urban) – This category reflects conditions which
     include acreage of limited size for development and property with locational restrictions.
     Maximum density is 4.0 dwelling units per acre.
     High Density Residential (R-M-10 – Residential Multiple-Family) – Permits a variety of housing
     ranging from single-family detached homes to attached products and apartments. Average
     density ranges from 4.0 to 10.0 dwelling units per acre.
     High Density Residential (R-M-20 – Residential Multiple-Family) – Intended to promote
     development of multi-family rental and ownership dwellings at densities up to 20 units per acre.
     Envisioned uses include cluster homes, townhouses, rowhouses, triplexes, fourplexes, apartments
     and stacked condominiums.
     High Density Residential (R-M-30 – Residential Multiple-Family) – Providing more compact design
     than R-M-20, this land use category is intended for residential uses at densities up to 30 units
     per acre. Envisioned uses include apartments, stacked condominiums and studios.

Source: City of Yorba Linda Zoning Code, 2013.
As discussed in detail in the following Chapter IV Housing Resources, the residential sites analysis
conducted in support of Yorba Linda’s 2008-2014 Housing Element identified a shortfall of higher
density residentially zoned sites to address the City’s regional housing growth needs (RHNA) for
lower and moderate income households. To address this RHNA shortfall, through the Housing Element
public outreach process, the City identified 14 sites for rezoning at densities of 10, 20 and 30 units
per acre. The City Council has adopted the rezoning of these sites, as confirmed by a majority of the
voters through passage of measures H and I in June 2012, as required under the Measure B Right-to-
Vote Initiative.
As Yorba Linda did not previously have zoning in place to accommodate densities of 20 and 30 units
per acre, the City developed the two new zoning categories R-M-20 and R-M-30 identified in Table
III-1. The development standards for these new multi-family zone districts were established in
conjunction with an urban design professional to ensure their cumulative impact did not constrain the
ability to achieve maximum zoned densities. In conjunction with establishing the new higher density
zoning, Yorba Linda eliminated the prior multi-family Conditional Use Permit requirement and
established Multi-Family Design Guidelines to provide upfront direction to the development
community regarding the desired quality and character of multi-family development. Yorba Linda has
established a review process, development standards and design guidelines which facilitate, and do
not serve to constrain, quality multi-family housing.
Special Housing (SH) Combining Zone
The SH Combing Zone provides flexible development standards designed to facilitate senior housing
and functions as an overlay to the underlying zone district. Provisions of the SH Combining Zone
include:
      Densities shall not be more than allowed by the General Plan, except as may be provided
          through the granting of SH incentives. “Density averaging” may be used on a project-wide
          basis so as to permit higher density levels in certain project portions in exchange for
          advantageous project design features.
         Building height may be increased by one-half story to accommodate parking partially
          constructed underground.
         All public streets within or abutting the development shall be dedicated and improved to City
          specifications.
         Project design shall promote privacy, security, and use of passive solar heating and cooling,
          through placement of wall, windows and landscaping.
Adopted Oct 2013                                                                                Page HE-51

Yorba Linda General Plan
The following additional development incentives may also be offered to eligible projects:
        Density bonus increase of up to 100% of the existing maximum density, and, if necessary,
         modification of development and zoning standards which would otherwise inhibit use of the
         density bonus on the specific site;
        Fast track processing and development plans;
        Waiver of City fees, including but not limited to City-imposed development submittal and
         processing fees;
        Additional liberalization of development standards;
        Approval of mixed used zoning; and/or
        Combination of above incentives or other valid proposals from the developer or City.
Affordable Housing Density Bonus
In conjunction with adoption of the 2008-2014 Housing Element and associated implementation
programs, in October 2011 the Yorba Linda City Council adopted a new density bonus ordinance
(Zoning Code Chapter 18.19 “Density Bonus, Waivers and Incentives”) to conform to the new
requirements of California Government Code Section 65915. In summary, applicants of residential
projects of five or more units may apply for a density bonus and additional incentive(s) if the project
provides for construction of one of the following:
         a. Ten percent (10%) of the total units of a housing development for lower income
             households; or
         b. Five percent (5%) of the total units of a housing development for very low income
             households; or
         c. A senior citizen housing development or mobile home park that limits residency based
             on age requirements for housing for older persons; or
         d. Ten percent (10%) of the total dwelling units in a common interest development
             (condominium) for persons and families of moderate income.
The amount of density bonus to which the applicant is entitled varies according to the amount
by which the percentage of affordable housing units exceeds the minimum percentage established
in this section, but generally ranges from 20-35% above the specified General Plan density. In
addition to the density bonus, eligible projects may receive 1-3 additional development incentives,
depending on the proportion of affordable units and level of income targeting. The incentives are
offered:
         a. A reduction in site development standards (e.g., setback and square footage
             requirements, and/or parking requirements) or architectural design requirements.
         b. Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if
Page HE-52                                                                         Adopted Oct 2013

                                                                      Yorba Linda General Plan
              nonresidential land uses reduce individual unit costs, and the nonresidential land
              uses are compatible with the housing project and adjoining development.
         c. Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the permit applicant or the
              City that would result in identifiable cost reductions.
In addition to these incentives, at the request of the developer, the City will permit a parking ratio
(inclusive of handicapped and guest parking) of 1 space for 0-1 bedroom units, 2 spaces for 2-
3 bedroom units, and 2½ spaces for four or more bedrooms. Since adoption of the new ordinance,
the City has received one density bonus application
Planned Development (PD) Zone
The Yorba Linda Zoning Code establishes a Planned Development (PD) Zone (Chapter 18.16,
Article II) to facilitate large scale community planning on parcels two acres in size and larger. The
purpose of the PD zone is to:
                Provide for development of parcels as coordinated, comprehensive projects
                Provide for a zone encompassing various types of land uses, such as single- family
                 residential, multi-family housing, office areas, commercial centers, industrial parks
                 or any public or semipublic use or combination of uses
                Facilitate development of infill areas by permitting greater flexibility, and
                 consequently, more creative and imaginative designs
                Promote more economical and efficient use of the land while providing a variety of
                 housing choices, a higher level of urban amenities and preservation of natural and
                 scenic qualities of open spaces
The PD zone provides for clustered, higher density developments above the density ceilings on portions
of the property, provided that the overall average density is within the maximum established under the
General Plan. Prior to submitting an application for a PD zone, the City encourages applicants to
hold preliminary consultations with staff to obtain information and guidance before incurring expense
in the preparation of plans, surveys, and other data. A development plan for the property is required
to be submitted along with the application for PD zoning, and is subject to City Council approval.
Mobile Home Park (MHP) Zone
The Yorba Linda Zoning Code establishes a Mobile Home Park (MHP) Zone in Chapter 18.16,
Article I, intended for the exclusive development of mobile home parks. The Planning Commission
reviews and approves the design review of a proposed mobile home park development. The
general development standards include the following:

Provision for a Variety of Housing Types
Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available
through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of various
types of housing for all economic segments of the population. Table III-2: Housing Types for Residential
Zone Category, summarizes the housing types permitted in each of the Yorba Linda’s residential zoning
districts.

  1Transitional and supportive housing are permitted in residential zoning districts subject to the same standards
as similar residential uses. Thus, if transitional or supportive housing is configured as a multi- family structure it
would be regulated as such, whereas if it is configured as a single-family structure, it would be subject to single-
family regulations.

                                                                     Yorba Linda General Plan
Second Units
Second units are permitted as an accessory use in all single-family residential zone districts in the City,
pursuant to Chapter 18.20 of the Zoning Code. The second unit may be within, attached to, or
detached from the primary dwelling unit. The unit must fulfill the following conditions:
        –    The lot on which the second unit is proposed shall be a minimum of 15,000
             square feet, contain one single-family primary dwelling conforming to all applicable
             zoning regulations, and have no more than one second unit.
        –    The second unit shall conform to the development standards applicable to the
             primary unit.
        –    The maximum size of the second unit shall not exceed 30 percent of the primary
             dwelling, or 1,200 square feet, whichever is less.
        –    A minimum of one covered parking space is required for each second unit.
        –    The owner of the property shall reside in either unit as a principal residence. This is a
             perpetual requirement that runs with the land.
        –    The second unit may be rented or leased, but shall not be sold or owned
             separately from the primary dwelling.
        –    Neither the primary dwelling nor the proposed second unit shall be a mobile
             home.
        –    The design and materials of the second unit shall be of like material with the
             primary dwelling.
        –    The second unit shall be designed and built to minimize visibility from the public right-
             of-way.
        –    There shall be no more than one exterior entrance and one exterior stairway on the
             font or street side of the second unit.
During the last Housing Element RHNA planning period (January 2006 – December 2012), the City
issued building permits for nine second units. While the rent survey conducted for the Housing Element
Needs Assessment did not identify any second unit rentals, median rent levels for studio ($1,040)
and one bedroom apartment and condominium units ($1,200) can be used to approximate second
unit rents. These rent levels fall within levels affordable to low income households.
Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
Single Room Occupancy (SRO) residences are small, one room units occupied by a single individual,
and may either have shared or private kitchen and bathroom facilities. SROs are rented on a monthly
basis typically without rental deposit, and can provide an entry point into the housing market for
extremely low income individuals, formerly homeless and disabled persons.
As part of the zoning amendments to implement the 2008-2014 Housing Element, the City added
the following definitions to the Zoning Code:
Adopted Oct 2013                                                                            Page HE-55

Yorba Linda General Plan
           “Single-room occupancy unit, or SRO, is a room used or intended to be used as a
           residential housekeeping unit by not more than two occupants for living and sleeping, with
           or without cooking facilities, that contains not more than one habitable room
As presented in Table III-2, SROs are conditionally permitted within Yorba Linda’s three multi-
family zoning districts.
Manufactured Housing and Mobile Home Parks
In compliance with State law, the Yorba Linda Zoning Code permits manufactured housing that meets
the National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act in any residential zoning
district where single-family detached units are permitted. Manufactured/mobile homes are subject to
the same property development standards with design review added to the permitting process. The
City’s Zoning Code (Section 18.10.100.D) requires manufactured housing to be placed on a solid
concrete or masonry foundation, with exterior siding and roofing as customarily used in single-family
dwellings. Parking must comply with the requirements for any single-family dwelling.
Mobile and manufactured homes are also permitted in the Mobile Home Park (MHP) Zone. The MHP
Zone permits the development of mobile home parks subject to the standards presented above as
incorporated from State law. There is currently one mobile home park comprising approximately 288
mobile homes in northwest Yorba Linda. There is also a manufactured housing development in
eastern Yorba Linda with 202 units that was built in the early 1980s.
Community Care Facilities
The Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Lanterman Act) is that part of California
law that sets out the rights and responsibilities of persons with developmental disabilities. The
Lanterman Act impacts local zoning ordinances by requiring the use of property for the care of
six or fewer disabled persons to be classified as a residential use under zoning. More specifically, a
State-authorized, certified or licensed family care home, foster home, or a group home serving six
or fewer disabled persons or dependent and neglected children on a 24-hour-a-day basis is
considered a residential use that is to be permitted in all residential zones. No local agency can
impose stricter zoning or building and safety standards on these homes. Due to the unique
characteristics of larger (more than six persons) community care facilities, most jurisdictions require
a Use Permit to ensure neighborhood compatibility in the siting of these facilities.
Section 18.20, Article VIII of the Yorba Linda Zoning Code provides standards and guidance regarding
the establishment of community care facilities within the City. The Code identifies “community care
facility, small” (24-hour non-medical care for six or fewer occupants) as a permitted use in all
residential zoning districts, subject only to the development standards of the applicable zone.
“Community care facility, large” (24-hour non-medical care for seven or more persons) is conditionally
permitted in multi-family residential zoning districts, subject to approval by the Planning Commission.
The City does not impose any spacing requirements on community care facilities.
Page HE-56                                                                            Adopted Oct 2013

                                                                       Yorba Linda General Plan
The California courts have invalidated the following definition of “family” within jurisdictions Zoning
Ordinances: (a) an individual, (b) two or more persons related by blood, marriage or adoption, or (c)
a group of not more than a certain number of unrelated persons as a single housekeeping unit. Court
rulings state that defining a family does not serve any legitimate or useful objective or purpose
recognized under the zoning and land planning powers of the city, and therefore violates rights of
privacy under the California Constitution. A zoning ordinance also cannot regulate residency by
discrimination between biologically related and unrelated persons.
Yorba Linda’s Zoning Code contains the following definition of “family”:
       “Family" means two or more persons living together as a single housekeeping unit in a single
       dwelling unit. Family also means the persons living together in a licensed residential facility
       as that term is defined in Health & Safety Code Section 1502(a) (1), which serves six or
       fewer persons, excluding the licensee, the members of the licensee's family, and persons
       employed as facility staff who reside at the facility.
Review of the California Community Care Licensing Division inventory of community care facilities
identifies one adult residential facility in Yorba Linda that provides 24-hour non- medical care for
adults ages 18-59 who are unable to provide for their own daily needs, providing capacity for 6
adults. The City has 25 residential care homes for the elderly, providing 235 beds for seniors age
60+ requiring 24-hour assisted living. The City’s regulations have served to provide needed housing
opportunities for seniors and persons with disabilities, and do not treat such housing for persons
differently based on the personal characteristics of the residents.
Transitional Housing, Supportive Housing and Emergency Shelters
The 2011 Zoning Code amendments related to Housing Element implementation added the
following definitions to Yorba Linda’s Code:
           “Transitional housing means buildings configured as rental housing developments, but
           operated under program requirements that call for termination of assistance and
           recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined
           future point in time, which shall be no less than six months. (Health & Safety Code Section
           50675.2)”
           “Supportive housing is housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target
           population, and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive
           housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and
           maximizing his or her ability to live, and when possible, work in the community. (Health
           & Safety Code Section 50675.14)”
The Yorba Linda Zoning Code permits transitional and supportive housing in all residential zoning
districts, and specifies that such housing shall be considered a residential use of property and shall be
Adopted Oct 2013                                                                              Page HE-57

Yorba Linda General Plan
subject only to those restrictions and processing requirements that apply to other residential dwellings
of the same type in the same zone.
An emergency shelter is defined in the Yorba Linda Zoning Code as “a facility that provides immediate
and short-term housing and may offer supplemental services to homeless families and/or individuals
on a first-come, first-serve basis where people must vacate the facility each morning and have no
guaranteed bed for the next night. Supplemental services may include counseling, food, and access to
social programs. ”Pursuant to Ordinance 2011- 968, the City’s Zoning Code allows emergency shelters
with up to thirty occupants by right in the Light Manufacturing (M-1) zone district, and permits shelters
with more than thirty occupants in the M-1 zone subject to a Conditional Use Permit.
The M-1 Zone was determined by staff to be the most conducive to provision of an emergency homeless
shelter by right. The M-1 Zone is intended to allow uses light industrial and limited service commercial
uses that can meet high performance standards, but that frequently do not meet the site
development standards appropriate to planned research and development parks. The zone is
appropriate for research and development, assembly and/or storage of products, and wholesale
facilities. More intense uses require a Conditional Use Permit. The Light Industrial designation has
been applied to 288.3 acres of land within the planning area, including areas along La Palma
Avenue in the southeast portion of the City in close proximity to the AT&SF Railroad and the Riverside
Freeway and in SAVI Ranch area. Industrial uses are also found in the vicinity of Prospect Avenue
and Imperial Highway. These sites have reasonable access to public transit. Current uses in the area
suitable for conversion to an emergency shelter include larger buildings and warehouses. There are
sufficient properties within the City’s M-1 zone to provide opportunities for an emergency shelter.
The Yorba Linda Zoning code establishes the following objective standards to regulate emergency
shelters within the M-1 zone:
         1. The maximum number of beds/persons permitted to be served nightly shall be based on
            the individual capacity of the building and overall facility and shall not be less than fifty
            (50) square feet per person served;
         2. On-site client waiting and intake areas shall be located internally to the building
            where feasible. If not feasible, an exterior waiting area shall be provided which contains a
            minimum of 10 square feet per bed provided at the facility. Said waiting area shall be in
            a location not adjacent to the public right-of-way and shall be visibly separated from
            public view by a minimum 6-foot tall visual screening mature landscaping or a
            minimum 6-foot tall decorative masonry wall;
         3. Stays at the facility shall be on a first-come, first-served basis and facility clients must
            vacate the facility each morning and have no guaranteed bed for the next night;
         4. Maximum stay at the facility shall not exceed 180 days in a 365-day period for clients with
            Yorba Linda residency and shall not exceed 90 days in a 365-day period for all others;

      5. A minimum of one employee per 15 beds shall be on duty when the facility is open and
         shall be maintained during operational hours;
      6. Clients shall only be on-site and admitted to the facility between 6:00 p.m. and
         8:00 a.m. during Pacific Daylight Time and 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. during Pacific
         Standard Time;
      7. A minimum distance of 500 feet shall be maintained from any other emergency shelter,
         any residentially zoned property and any public or private school, as measured from
         the property line;
      8. A minimum of 1 parking stall for every 4 beds or ½ parking space for each
         bedroom designated for family units with children, plus 1 parking stall for each
         employee/volunteer on duty, shall be maintained. The number of parking spaces may
         be reduced by 25% if the shelter site is located within 1,000 feet of a public transit stop.
         Bicycle rack parking shall also be provided at the facility;
      9. Facility improvements shall provide:
          i)    A minimum of 1 toilet for every 8 beds per gender.
          ii)   A minimum of 1 shower for every 8 beds per gender.
          iii)  Private shower and toilet facility for each area
                designated for use by individual families.
      10. Adequate exterior lighting shall be provided for safety and security purposes;
      11. Client possession and/or use of the following are prohibited anywhere on the premises
         of an emergency shelter: alcohol, tobacco and illegal narcotics.
      12. An Operations Plan shall be provided for the review and approval of the Community
         Development Director, and shall remain active throughout the life of the facility.
         At a minimum, the Operations Plan shall address the following:
          i)    Security and safety - addressing both on and off-site needs.
          ii)   Loitering control - including specific measures regarding off-site controls to
                minimize congregation of clients in the vicinity of the facility during hours that
                clients are not allowed on-site.
          iii)  Management of outdoor areas - including a system for daily admittance and
                discharge procedures and monitoring of waiting areas.
          iv)   Staff training - including knowledge and skills to assist clients in obtaining
                permanent shelter and income.
          v)    Communications and outreach - with objectives to maintain good communication
                and response to operational issues which may arise from the public or City staff.

             vi)  Client storage areas (i.e., for the overnight storage of bicycles and personal
                  items).
             vii) Or similar services supporting the needs of homeless clients.
Accessibility Accommodations
Both the federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act impose
an affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e. modifications or
exceptions) in their zoning and other land use regulations when such accommodations may be
necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For example,
it may be a reasonable accommodation to allow covered ramps in the setbacks of properties
that have already been developed to accommodate residents with mobility impairments.
For new construction, the City’s building code requires new housing to comply with the 1998
amendment to the Fair Housing Act, with multi-family development also subject to the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. New apartment buildings are subject to requirements for unit
“adaptability” on ground floor units. Adaptable units are built for easy conversion to disabled access,
such as doorway and hallway widths, and added structural support in the bathroom to allow the
addition of handrails.
In 2004, the City adopted Section 18.36.340 of the Zoning Code “Adjustments for individuals with
disabilities” to provide a mechanism through which the City can grant reasonable adjustments
to its zoning regulations to avoid unequal treatment towards individuals with disabilities. The
procedures for reasonable accommodation are as follows:
       Reasonable accommodation requests are considered an administrative adjustment, with
Page HE-60                                                                                 Adopted Oct 2013

                                                                      Yorba Linda General Plan
           the Zoning Administrator serving as the decision-making body. Where the adjustment
           is combined with an application requiring discretionary action – such as a parcel map -
           the Planning Commission serves as the decision-maker.
         Administrative adjustments are a non-public hearing matter and are not subject to the
           public noticing requirements of Section 18.36.700. However, applications for
           adjustment shall include a list and notification of all abutting property owners.
         An individual with a disability, or designated representative, may request that any
           applicable development standard be modified to prevent discrimination on the basis of
           the individual’s disability. Adjustments shall not however be granted for deviations to
           standards related to gross floor area, density or lot coverage.
         Adjustments granted for an individual with a disability shall be a personal
           accommodation for the individual and shall not run with the land.
The decision-maker shall make the following findings upon granting an accommodation:
         The individual requesting the adjustment is a qualified individual with a disability.
         The requested adjustment is a reasonable modification made necessary by federal law to
           avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, and to assure that the disabled individual
           has the opportunity to enjoy the rights, privileges, and opportunities available to residents
           or property owners in the same zoning classification.
         Any necessary conditions have been imposed to ensure that the adjustment shall not be
           detrimental to the public health and safety.
Farm Employee Housing
An estimated 31 Yorba Linda residents are employed in farming, fishing and forestry occupations,
representing just 0.1 percent of the City’s labor force (source: SCAG 2012 RHNA Existing Needs
Statement). The City has limited parcels remaining in agricultural use. Therefore, given the extremely
limited presence of farmworkers in the community, the City has not identified a need for specialized
farmworker housing beyond overall programs for housing affordability.
Site Improvements
Developers of single-family residential tracts in the City are required to install arterial and local
streets; sewer; water lines; storm drainage; curbs, gutters, sidewalks; street lighting; underground
utilities; and landscaping in the public right-of-way within and adjacent to a tract. These facilities
are in most cases dedicated to the City or other agencies that are responsible for maintenance.
Without the site improvement requirement there are no other means of providing necessary
infrastructure to the City's land parcels. Requirements for site improvements are at a level necessary to
meet the City's costs and are necessary to protect health, safety, and welfare.
Adopted Oct 2013                                                                             Page HE-61

Yorba Linda General Plan
The cost of these required off-site improvements vary with the sales price of each unit depending
on the nature of development (i.e., hillside or flatland). The City may also impose development fees on
future housing developments in order to recover some of the cost of installing off-site improvements
including upgrading the circulation system and other urban service systems to serve increased density.
The developed portions of Yorba Linda have the majority of necessary infrastructure, such as streets,
electrical and water facilities, already in place.
Yorba Linda’s Circulation Element and Subdivision Ordinance establish the City’s street width
standards. Commuter arterials are required to have a right-of-way width of 56 feet and a standard
40 foot curb-to-curb width, with two travel lanes and two parking lanes. The primary purpose of this
roadway is to provide access to adjacent land uses in rural and residential areas. A Rural Secondary
roadway has a right-of-way width of 80 feet with 64 feet to edge of pavement. This roadway is
characterized by not having concrete curb, gutter and sidewalk. This roadway provides access to
adjacent land uses and shall only be used in approved areas.
Development Fees
The City collects various fees from development to cover the costs of processing permits, including
fees for planning approvals, subdivision map act approvals, environmental review, public works and
plan check services, and building permits, among others. The City also charges several impact fees
to offset the future impact of development on parks, and traffic and circulation.
Table III-3: Residential Development Fees, provides a listing of residential development fees in Yorba
Linda. As a means of assessing the cost that fees contribute to development in Yorba Linda, the City
has calculated the total Building, Planning and Engineering fees associated with development of two
different residential prototypes. The first prototype is a 77 lot. Single-family residential subdivision
consisting of 1,750 to 2,100 square foot units, and the second prototype is a 69 unit apartment
complex consisting of a range of one to three bedroom units ranging in size from approximately 700
to 1,050 square feet. As indicated in Table III-4: Development Fees- Prototypical Single-Family Project,
development fees for the prototypical single-family project run approximately $19,500 per unit,
with School District fees ($5,565), the Eastern Transportation Corridor fee ($3,620), Sewer
Connection fees ($3,370), and Parks and Recreation fees ($1,900) comprising the highest cost
fees. Per unit fees for the apartment development run approximately $8,700 (Table III-5:
Development Fees: Prototypical Apartment Project), with School fees, the Eastern Transportation
Corridor fee and Parks and Recreation fee representing the highest cost fees.

In summary, Yorba Linda’s development fees represent a small proportion of the overall valuation
of residential development. The fees are comparable to, if not lower than many Orange County
jurisdictions and have not served as a constraint to development. In addition, AB 641 (2007) helps to
address the cash flow problems inherent in many affordable housing projects during the construction
phase. For affordable housing developments in which at least 49 percent of the units are affordable
to low or very low income households, AB 641 prohibits local governments from requiring payment
of local developer fees on affordable housing projects prior to receiving a certificate of occupancy.
Local Processing and Permit Procedures
The evaluation and review process required by City procedures contributes to the cost of housing
in which developer holding costs are incurred. The Planning Commission in Yorba Linda is entrusted
with approval of applications. The Commission’s decision may be appealed to the City Council.
Pursuant the City’s Municipal Code, development of a single-family residence in any residential zone
is a permitted use. The typical review process for a single-family residence usually consists of an
“over-the-counter” plan check with the Planning Division in which plans are checked for compliance
with applicable codes and development standards. From there, the applicant brings their plans to the
Building Division for submittal of plans into plan check. Depending on the quality of plans submitted,

Yorba Linda General Plan
the entire process could take as little as 45 days but may take longer if subsequent plan checks
are required. The average processing time for single-family plan check/building permit in Yorba Linda
is 60 days.
The City’s development review process for multi-family residential projects involves the following
steps:
     1.      Submittal of an application to the Planning Division for Design Review (DR). If the
             project site includes two-story buildings that are located within 70 feet of an existing
             single-family residential structure, a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) shall be required.
             These two reviews may be processed concurrently. The DR is held as a public
             meeting and the CUP is held as a public hearing before the Planning Commission.
     2.      Review of application completeness by the Project Review Committee (PRC),
             composed of representatives from reviewing agencies. Application is reviewed within
             13 days of submittal. If application is complete, scheduled for next Planning
             Commission agenda. If incomplete, applicant has 1 week to complete and still
             remain on schedule for next Planning Commission.
     3.      Once application deemed complete, the project is presented to the Planning
             Commission within 4 to 6 weeks for Design Review, and as necessary, the CUP.
For example, a condominium project would submit concurrent applications for a subdivision tract map
and design review for the architecture of the buildings. All applications are reviewed by staff
(PRC) and then submitted to the Planning Commission for review and approval. Multiple-family
residential projects (defined as projects with densities of 10 units/acre and above) are reviewed by
staff for consistency with Yorba Linda’s Multi-Family Residential Design Guidelines. Project proposal
consistency with the Guidelines is an important component in the City’s goal of facilitating the
review and approval process for multi-family residential development projects.
As a means of providing a buffer between single and multi-family uses, the City’s RM development
standards require a 50 foot setback from any single-family zone for buildings exceeding 15 feet in
height. This setback encourages multi-family site design with a single- story component, and/or open
space and parking areas located closest to adjacent single- family zoned properties. In combination
with the City’s single-family setback requirements, multi-family structures adhering to the City’s
development standards would not typically be located within 70 feet of a single-family structure, and
thus would not trigger the requirement for a CUP. The City’s Multi-family Design Guidelines further
address potential privacy and view impacts between single and multi-story residential uses.
Standards for design of parking structures, lighting, mechanical equipment, roofs, and chimneys; height
determination; public access; exterior buildings/structure walls; trash enclosures; screening; fences,
walls, and hedges; perimeter walls/fencing; and street dedications and improvements are provided
in Chapter 18.26 of the Zoning Code. Guidelines for building articulation, signage, landscaping,

new additions to existing buildings, compatibility with adjacent uses, and air quality and energy
conservation improvements are also provided. The Planning Commission has the authority to
approve the design.
Residential projects in Yorba Linda generally receive concurrent processing and receive approval
from the Planning Commission. Table III-6: Development Processing Times in Yorba Linda and Nearby
Communities (in Months), compares typical processing times for residential projects in Yorba Linda,
Cypress, Huntington Beach, Costa Mesa, Irvine, and Orange County. Typical development
processing times in Yorba Linda are comparable or slightly less than most of these communities.

Building Code
As required of all jurisdictions in California, Yorba Linda has adopted the latest California Building
Code, which incorporates the most recent International Building Code and establishes construction
standards necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare. Yorba Linda has also incorporated
the 2010 California energy code and California Green Building Code Standards into the City’s
Municipal Code.
The City adopted a local amendment to the Building Code requiring an on-site, automatic fire-
sprinkler system in all new residential construction with a floor area of 5,500 or greater attached

square feet. This is due to the hot, dry and strong Santa Ana winds, particularly in the fall and spring
seasons and the potential of fires.
Market Constraints
Availability of Financing
The availability of financing in a community depends on a number of factors, including the type of
lending institutions active in the community, lending practices, rates and fees charged, laws and
regulations governing financial institutions, and equal access to those institutions. Through analysis
of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data on the disposition of residential loan applications, an
assessment can be made of the availability of residential financing within a community.
Residential lending activity in Yorba Linda was relatively modest in 2011, with just 1,334 applications
for conventional and FHA home purchase loans, reflecting purchase activity on approximately seven
percent of the city’s ownership housing. Table III-7: Status of Home Purchase Loans 2011, provides
information on the status of home purchase loan applications in both Yorba Linda and Orange
County. As illustrated by this table, at 75 percent, the loan approval rate in Yorba Linda was
comparable to the 74 percent approval rates Countywide. Review of loan approvals by census tract
does not indicate any significant discrepancies by area of the City. In summary, HMDA data supports
good access to mortgage financing in Yorba Linda.

Price of Land
The availability and price of land are potential constraints to the development of housing for all income
levels. Based upon a recent valuation by the non-profit developer National CORE of one of the City’s
multi-family rezone sites, vacant multi-family land is valued at roughly $30-$35 per square foot. In
addition, two recent appraisals of a large vacant site in Yorba Linda suggest an average land cost
ranging from $24-$29 per square foot. Per unit land cost is directly affected by density, with
higher densities allowing the cost of land to be spread across more units. By increasing permitted
densities on select multi-family sites, the City has helped to reduce per unit land costs.
Cost of Construction
Page HE-68                                                                                      Adopted Oct 2013

                                                                 Yorba Linda General Plan
A major cost associated with the development of housing is the cost of building materials, which
have risen dramatically in recent years. According to the U.S. Department of Labor Construction
Cost Trends for 2013, the overall cost of construction materials rose from approximately $178 to
$205 per square foot between 2006 and 2012, reflecting a 15 percent increase in materials costs.
The increase in construction costs is slowing, but were up 2- 2.5% in the first half of 2012, with
labor cost increases above that of materials (2.5% labor compared to 1.5% material cost increases).10
A reduction in amenities and the quality of building materials (above a minimum acceptability for
health, safety, and adequate performance) can result in lower development costs. As part of the City’s
density bonus program, the City allows for affordable units to be smaller in size (maintaining the same
number of bedrooms) and have different features and interior finishes than market rate units, provided
all project units were comparable in construction quality and exterior design. Another factor related
to construction costs is the number of units built at one time. As that number increases, overall costs
generally decrease as builders are able to take advantage of the benefits of economies of scale.
Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
A wide range of environmental factors may constrain the development of new housing in Yorba
Linda. The largest concentrations of undeveloped lands for new residential development are along
the City’s north and northeastern periphery extending into the foothills and hillsides of the Sphere of
Influence. These areas are likely to contain environmental habitats and constraints on development,
such as steep slopes, wild/brush fire potential, landslides, necessity for reclamation of oil operations,
and so on. Historically, development has varied in the degree and sensitivity to which it has
accounted for these constraints. Most have sited housing units in ways to maintain the hillside’s unique
character and resources. Others have extended typical flatland subdivisions into the hillside, using
mass grading altering natural resources and landform. As development demands and pressures
persist, the extent to which development will be permitted on the City’s hillsides is of particular
concern.
Areas of special environmental significance, potential safety hazards, and development constraints
will influence land use policy. The City of Yorba Linda Safety Element identifies a number of
environmental constraints for the City, including slope stability, wildfire, flooding, seismic hazards,
and oil well hazards. The Yorba Linda General Plan recognizes these hazards and identifies programs
to minimize them. The availability of public infrastructure and services for residential development is
another potential constraint to the development of housing. The following are more detailed
discussions of these environmental constraints and hazards which affect, in varying degrees, existing
and future residential developments.

Yorba Linda General Plan
Slope Stability – Landslides and Subsidence
As the City’s Safety Element points out, slope stability is a serious geologic problem in the northern
and eastern portions of the City. This area is underlain by siltstone and interbedded sandstone of
the Puente Formation and are often the most prone to landsliding and other forms of slope failure.
Along Telegraph Canyon and other east-west trending canyons, landslides are more common
than on south-facing slopes which are typically underlain by thick soil and slopewash. Soil creep
and shallow slope failures also occur more on the east-west trending slopes.
Wildfire
Yorba Linda is subject to wildfires due to the steep terrain, highly flammable vegetation of adjacent
Chino Hills and the high winds (Santa Ana winds) that correspond with seasonal dry periods. Major
fires have threatened the City in the past. High wildfire hazard areas include the northern and eastern
portions of the City.
Since 1980, the Yorba Linda area has experienced 25 separate wildland fires, burning a total of
82,734 acres; single events range from one to nearly 20,000 acres. Until the recent Freeway Complex
Fire, the most notable and devastating of these were the 1982 Gypsum Incident (19,986 acres), the
1980 Owl Incident (18,332 acres), the 1980 Carbon Canyon Incident (14,613 acres) and the 2006
Sierra Peak Incident (10,506 acres). The commonality of each of these larger fires is the Santa Ana
Wind and the effect it has on vegetation and fire behavior. The Santa Ana Canyon funnels the wind,
increasing its speed and magnifying the effects on the available fuel bed. The frequency of fire in
this area has allowed non- native vegetation of volatile grasses and weeds to become the dominate
fuel type.
On November 15, 2008, Yorba Linda experienced the Freeway Complex Fire. The Orange County
Fire Authority’s preliminary report (December 2, 2008) on the fire indicated that the fire consumed
30,305 acres; destroyed 187 residential structures (including multi-family residential buildings) and
damaged 127 residential structures. Four commercial properties were destroyed or damaged, along
with 43 outbuildings.
Flooding
The City has within its boundaries a number of identified 100-year floodplains. A 100-year floodplain
is defined as an area that has a one percent or greater chance of experiencing a flood inundation in
any given year. The floodplain areas in Yorba Linda has been established by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and are shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMS). The 100-
year floodplain poses minimal threats to developed lands in the City. The City has designated these
areas as “Open Space,” with a zoning designation overlay of Floodplain (FP-2). Allowable uses in
floodplain areas are limited to flood control and roadway projects, temporary structures, agricultural
uses, parks and wildlife/natural preserves and open space.
Seismic Hazards

                                                                   Yorba Linda General Plan
Like most other cities in Southern California, Yorba Linda is at risk of suffering structural damage and
loss of life during an earthquake of significant magnitude. The following regional and local active and
potentially active faults are all potentially hazardous to the City: Whittier, Elsinore, San Andreas,
Newport-Inglewood, Peralta Hills, Chino and San Jacinto. In particular, the Whittier fault line cuts
across Yorba Linda diagonally (northwest/southeast orientation). The Whittier fault zone (including
Whittier, Elsinore, and Chino faults) is an Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone. Surface fault rupture
hazard is high within the boundaries of this zone, according to the Safety Element. Yorba Linda is
located between 4 and 32 miles of the other faults with groundshaking hazards from each of the
faults. Most areas of Yorba Linda are assumed to be at low risk for liquefaction hazards, since the
water table in most places is deeper than 50 feet. The other threat in an earthquake is damage to
structures. In Yorba Linda, unreinforced masonry structures, built prior to 1930, are the primary
concern. Such remaining structures are most likely to be found in the downtown area.
Oil Well Hazards
The Yorba Linda oil field is primarily located in the northern area of the City. The topography of the
field is hilly with ground elevations ranging from approximately 400 to 650 feet above sea level. Issues
related to the oil field include occasional spills of crude oil and groundwater contamination. More
long-term issues involve the decommissioning of the oil field, abandonment of the wells and
development of ht earea after it is no longer used as an oil field. Wells must be vented to the
atmosphere and plugged for several hundred feet with cement or clay-based mud according to the
specifications in the Abandonment/ Reabandonment Guidelines published by the Division.
Public Services and Facilities
The majority of Yorba Linda has the necessary infrastructure, streets, electrical lines, and water
distribution, already in place for new development. New development is able to tap into existing
water and sewer lateral lines, with no new sewer or water mains necessary. The City’s 1993 General
Plan identifies adequate infrastructure and public service capacity to accommodate the City’s regional
housing needs of 2,039 additional dwelling units during the 2008-2014 Housing Element planning
period.
In 1990, Orange County voters approved Measure M, the Revised Traffic Improvement and Growth
Management Ordinance, which provides funding to Orange County for needed transportation
improvements over a 20-year period through the imposition of a one-half cent retail transaction and
use tax. Cities such as Yorba Linda can qualify for Measure M funds if they comply with the Countywide
Growth Management Program component requirements and have an established policy framework
for that Program. As part of the Program, Yorba Linda implemented a development mitigation program
establishing the following fees: Eastern Transportation Corridor Fee and a Traffic Impact/Mitigation
Fee. The City has established a Capital Improvement Program for the transportation systems
improvements to effectively manage the system based on the OCTA timetables. This is an on-going,
consistently updated program in Yorba Linda.

Yorba Linda General Plan
The City also participates in a variety of inter-jurisdictional efforts, related to Measure M; City and
County impact fees; traffic and land use; jobs/housing balance; Facility Implementation Plans; and
coordination of growth projections for the City and the County. These efforts enable Yorba Linda
to coordinate the provision of public services and adequate facilities with other adjacent cities and
the County of Orange.

IV. Housing Resources
The Housing Resources section describes and analyzes resources available for the development,
rehabilitation, and preservation of housing in Yorba Linda, including sites for new housing; financial
and administrative resources available to facilitate housing production and housing-related services;
and opportunities for energy conservation in existing and new housing and reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.
The City’s 2008-2014 Housing Element involved the rezoning of 14 sites at densities of 10 to 30
units per acre as required to accommodate Yorba Linda’s regional housing needs (RHNA) for the
planning period. All but three of the sites proposed for rezoning (which were previously designated
Commercial-General), were subject to a vote of the electorate under the Yorba Linda Right-to-Vote
Amendment (Measure B). In June 2012, Measures H and I were placed on the City ballot, and
passed by a majority of the Yorba Linda voters, thereby implementing the rezoning as proposed by
the Housing Element and adopted by City Council. These 14 rezoned sites provide the basis for
the 2014-2021 Housing Element residential sites inventory presented herein.
Availability of Sites for Housing
This section documents the availability of sites for future development and the adequacy of these sites
to address Yorba Linda’s regional housing needs for the 2014-2021 planning period. The City
plans to fulfill its share of regional housing needs using a combination of the methods below, which
are further described in the following narrative:
            Residential projects with development entitlements with occupancy post 12/31/2013
            Vacant and underutilized residential sites
            Second residential units
Table IV-1: Potential Housing Units During 2014-2021 Planning Period, summarizes the residential unit
potential from the above methods and provides a comparison with Yorba Linda’s 2014-2021 RHNA.

Yorba Linda General Plan
In terms of evaluating the adequacy of these sites to address the affordability targets established
by the RHNA, Housing Element statutes provide for the use of “default densities” to assess
affordability. Based on its population and location within Orange County, Yorba Linda falls within
the default density of 30 units per acre for providing sites affordable to very low and low income
households; sites suitable for moderate density households can be provided at 10 units per acre.
Allocating Yorba Linda’s residential sites inventory based on these density thresholds results in the
distribution of sites by targeted income group as presented in Table IV-1. A comparison of this income
distribution with the City’s RHNA identifies sufficient sites at appropriate densities to accommodate
Yorba Linda’s regional housing needs.
It is to Yorba Linda’s benefit that its residential site capacity exceeds the minimum RHNA required
within each income category to help offset any sites that may be developed with fewer units than
assumed in the Housing Element sites inventory. A healthy buffer above the required RHNA therefore
provides a “margin of safety” from having to rezone additional sites during the 2014-2021 planning
period of the element.
Projects with Entitlements
The Vista Del Verde (Shell) Master Planned Community
and the North Yorba Linda Estates represent the last
remaining areas for large scale single-family
development within Yorba Linda’s current city limits. Both
of these planned developments have planning
entitlements and are being built in phases, with 133
entitled units remaining to be built (April 2013). City planning staff estimates that half these entitled
units will be completed during the 2008-2014 planning cycle, with the balance (66 units) available
for occupancy after December 31, 2013 and therefore falling within the upcoming 2014- 2021
planning cycle.
The Successor Agency to the former Yorba Linda Redevelopment Agency has an active Affordable
Housing Agreement with the non-profit developer National CORE for development of a 3.2 acre
vacant site in SAVI Ranch. This site was provisionally rezoned to R-M-30 in conjunction with the
2008-2014 Housing Element adoption, and subsequently confirmed by the Yorba Linda voters
through passage of Measure H in June 2012. National CORE has received planning entitlements
from the City for development of Oakcrest Terrace – a 69 unit affordable rental development for
extremely low, very low and low income families. The developer has recently worked out provisions with
the Orange County Transit Authority (OCTA) to add a bus stop location near the site, and plans
to apply to the State for the next round of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (July 2013).
Oakcrest Terrace is the first project being developed under Yorba Linda’s new Multi- Family Design
Guidelines, and is designed with sustainability features for LEED Silver certification. An on-site

community room will offer joint use opportunities with the City, and will contain activity/meeting rooms,
office space and computer stations.
Vacant and Underutilized Residential Sites
As described in the beginning of this section, the City rezoned 14 sites at densities of 10 to 30 units
per acre in conjunction with its 2008-2014 Housing Element. One of these sites (described above)
has received planning entitlements for 69 units, and is thus counted as a “project” rather than a “site”
in the residential sites inventory. The development potential on the remaining 13 sites is summarized
in Table IV-2: Vacant and Underutilized Residential Sites, below, with the parcel-specific inventory and
corresponding map included in Appendix B to the Element. As indicated, the 13 rezone sites
comprise just under 50 acres and yield up to 931 dwelling units.

Realistic Development Capacity
The methodology used to determine the realistic development capacity of the rezone sites included
a combination of factors specific to each site. None of the sites has an unusual configuration that
would limit densities, almost all sites are flat, and none have any known environmental constraints
that would limit the developable area. The only exceptions are the Nixon Archive and
Lakeview/Mariposa sites (Sites 11 and 14 in Appendix B). While the Nixon Archive site has some
topographic site constraints, this site has been designated at the lowest multi-family density of 10
units per acre to reflect a realistic achievable density. Site 14 contains three operating oil wells,
although technical studies conducted in support of the previously proposed 23 unit/acre senior housing
project and recreation center on the site demonstrated that potential environmental impacts can be
mitigated with proper setbacks.
Yorba Linda’s newly adopted multi-family development standards support achievement of maximum
permitted densities on each of the rezone sites. Residential concept drawings utilizing these

Yorba Linda General Plan
development standards were prepared for two of the sites - the Savi Ranch Old Canal Road and
Lakeview/Strawberry-Field sites (Sites 5 and 7 in Appendix B) - and illustrate attainment of maximum
proposed densities.
Finally, market trends in Yorba Linda support development at the high end of the density range, as
indicated by the following two projects built during the past Housing Element cycle. The Meta
Housing apartment project was developed using the City’s Affordable Housing (AH) Overlay zone
(now SH, or “Special Housing” overlay) at the maximum 20 unit per acre density. Presidential Walk
was developed under RM standards as a single-family detached product at 9 units per acre.
Future Annexation Areas
Additional sites for single-family development will be provided through annexation of vacant land
located within Yorba Linda’s Sphere of Influence. The Murdock and Sage properties located in the
northeastern Sphere represent integrated tracts of undeveloped land likely to be annexed within this
Housing Element planning period. The Murdock (Esperanza Hills) and Sage (Cielo Vista) residential
development projects are currently being processed by the County of Orange. Esperanza Hills, as
proposed, encompasses 340 single-family lots on 486 acres, and Cielo Vista proposes 112 single-
family lots on 80 acres.
These areas are currently being studied within the context of Yorba Linda’s General Plan Update,
and given the presence of environmental and infrastructure constraints, may result in a reduction of
densities below those currently being proposed. Significant issues to be addressed in the
environmental analyses for these developments include the provision of adequate public services,
fire protection, access and circulation, resource protection and impacts to the adjacent Chino Hills
State Park. Giving the uncertainty regarding the timing of annexation and the level of permitted
development, the Murdock and Sage properties are not included within the sites inventory for the current
Housing Element.
Second Residential Units
Second units are self-contained living units with cooking, eating, sleeping, and full sanitation facilities,
either attached to or detached from the primary residential unit on a single lot. Second units offer
several benefits. First, they typically rent for less than apartments of comparable size, and can
offer affordable rental options for seniors, college students and single persons. Second, the primary
homeowner receives supplementary income by renting out their second unit, which can help many
modest income and elderly homeowners remain in or afford their homes.
Yorba Linda has significant additional site capacity to accommodate second units, and the market
supports their development, with nine second units issued building permits over the last RHNA
planning cycle (2006-2012). With enhanced marketing of second unit opportunities, the City
projects a modest increase in the rate of second unit production of twelve units during the 2014-
2021 planning period. As described previously in the Constraints Chapter of the Element, rents on
Page HE-76                                                                           Adopted Oct 2013

                                                                 Yorba Linda General Plan
second units in the Yorba Linda market area are generally affordable to lower income households,
and thus the affordability mix of the projected twelve new second units has been assumed at eight
low income and four moderate income units.
Availability of Infrastructure and Public Services
Yorba Linda is a younger community with the necessary infrastructure in place to support future
development in the established areas. The utility infrastructure is relatively new with the majority of
public service capacity not yet in need of repair or replacement. One exception is in portions of the
Yorba Linda Water District’s (YLWD) westerly service area where approximately 24,000 feet of
waterline was constructed in the 1920s through 1950s; YLWD reports that these lines are expected to
be replaced within the next 5 to 10 years. In summary, no sites included within the sites inventory for
the 2014-2021 Housing Element are constrained by infrastructure availability.
Financial Resources
The extent to which Yorba Linda can achieve its Housing Element goals and objectives is in large part
dependent upon the availability of financial resources for implementation.
The primary local source of funds for affordable housing in Yorba Linda has traditionally been its
Redevelopment Agency’s Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund, which generated approximately
$4.5 million per year for housing activities. However, due to passage of Assembly Bill (AB) 1X 26,
redevelopment agencies across California have been eliminated as of February 1, 2012, removing
the primary local tool for creating affordable housing. However, with the passage of AB 1484 in
June 2012, the Supplemental Educational Revenue Augmentation Funds (SERAF) borrowed by the
State from Redevelopment Agencies Low and Moderate Income Housing Funds are to be repaid, and
will be deposited into each Successor Agency’s Housing Asset Fund (pursuant to Health and Safety
Code Section 34191.4(b)(2)(B) and (C)).
The Yorba Linda Successor Agency is projected to receive a total of $5.7 in SERAF repayments,
to be received in semi-annual disbursements from the County Auditor- Controller from the City’s
available Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund (RPTTF) account. The repayment process is
proposed to generate $1.9 million annually and be completely repaid in fiscal year 2014/2015.
Residual receipts from the former Redevelopment Agency’s housing loans, in addition to sales proceeds
from land purchased with Low/Mod funds, will also be deposited into the Housing Asset Fund.
The City will continue to explore new funding sources and programs, and opportunities to partner
with the private sector and local non-profit organizations. Examples of new funding opportunities
include:
        The $93 million Golden State Acquisition Fund (GSAF) was launched in early 2013 by
         State HCD in partnership with seven Community Development Financial Institutions
         (CDFIs), providing developers and public agencies with access to favorably priced funds for
         developing and preserving affordable rental and ownership housing.

Yorba Linda General Plan
         Passage of SB 391, the California Home and Jobs Act of 2013, would generate
          approximately $525 million annually for affordable housing by imposing a $75 recording
          fee on real estate documents. The bill has secured a super majority in the Senate and two
          Assembly policy committees, and will remain on the Assembly Appropriations
          Committee’s calendar entering into the 2014 legislative session.

Yorba Linda General Plan
Administrative Resources
Described below are several non-profit developers active in Orange County and Yorba Linda in
particular. These agencies serve as resources in meeting the housing needs of the City, and are integral
in implementing activities for acquisition/rehabilitation and development of affordable housing.
National Community Renaissance (CORE): National CORE is a
nonprofit developer with a portfolio of more than 8,500 multi-
family units throughout Southern California. National CORE
staffs community resource centers at all its properties,
administered by the Hope through Housing Foundation.
National CORE has completed two projects in Yorba Linda –
Arbor Villas and Villa Plumosa – and has project entitlements to
develop a third affordable project in Savi Ranch.
Habitat for Humanity: Habitat is a non-profit, Christian
organization that builds and repairs homes for sale to very low
income families with the help of volunteers and
homeowner/partner families. Habitat homes are sold to partner
families at no profit with affordable, no interest loans. Yorba
Linda completed a three unit affordable ownership project in
partnership with Habitat.
Orange Housing Development Corporation (OHDC): OHDC is a non-profit housing developer
founded in 1990 in the City of Orange. OHDC’s primary focus is within Orange County, but has
expanded to develop over 3,000 units in communities throughout the State. Through its Affordable
Housing Agreement with the Yorba Linda Successor Agency, OHDC purchases existing condominiums
– many of which are in foreclosure – for rehabilitation and conversion to affordable rental housing.
Jamboree Housing Corporation (JHC): JHC is an experienced
non-profit developer with affordable housing projects throughout
Orange County and Southern California as well as the State.
Founded in the City of Irvine in 1990, Jamboree now owns and
manages over 6,600 units of affordable housing in 67 different
communities. Jamboree has also established a social services
division to assist residents in maintaining self-sufficiency which
now operates at most Jamboree projects.
Meta Housing Corporation: Since its inception in 1969, Meta Housing has developed over 12,000
affordable and market-rate apartment units for families and seniors in Southern California. In 2006,
Meta completed Yorba Linda Palms, providing 44 affordable units for lower income families in Yorba
Linda.

Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Housing Element statutes require an analysis of opportunities for energy conservation with respect to
residential development. The energy conservation section of the element must inventory and analyze
the opportunities to encourage the incorporation of energy saving features, energy saving materials,
and energy efficient systems and design for residential development. Planning to maximize energy
efficiency and the incorporation of energy conservation and green building features can contribute to
reduced housing costs for homeowners and renters, in addition to promoting sustainable community
design and reduced dependence on vehicles. Such planning and development standards can
also significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gases.
Green Building Practices
Conventional building construction, use and demolition along with the manufacturing of building
materials have multiple impacts on our environment. Nationwide, the building industry accounts
for:
            65% of electricity consumption
            30% of greenhouse gas emissions
            30% of raw materials use
            30% of landfill waste
            12% of potable water consumption
Green buildings are structures that are designed, renovated, re-used or operated in a manner
that enhances resource efficiency and sustainability. These structures reduce water consumption,
improve energy efficiency, generate less waste, and lessen a building’s overall environmental impact.
The 2010 California Building Standards Code establishes mandatory Statewide green building
standards; Yorba Linda has adopted the California Green Building Standards Code (CALGREEN)
in its entirety.
The City’s Multi-Family Design Guidelines, adopted in October 2011, integrate sustainable
development principles derived from the LEED ND criteria (Leadership for Energy and
Environmental Design for neighborhood Development). The Design Guidelines include provisions
for sustainable site planning and streetscape, and encourage multi-family development to achieve
LEED certification. The first project being developed under the new Guidelines, Oakcrest Terrace in
Savi Ranch, is being designed to be LEED Silver Certified.
Yorba Linda’s comprehensive update of the General Plan and Park & Recreation Master Plan,
currently underway, will be integrate principles of environmental sustainability and pedestrian
orientation through the Land Use, Conservation, and Circulation Elements
Adopted Oct 2013                                                                        Page HE-83

Yorba Linda General Plan
Energy Conservation Programs Offered through Local Utilities
In addition to green building, Yorba Linda can promote energy conservation by advertising utility
rebate programs and energy audits available through Edison and Southern California Gas, particularly
connected to housing rehabilitation programs. Lower-income households are also eligible for state
sponsored energy and weatherization programs.
Southern California Edison (SCE) provides a variety of energy conservation services under its Customer
Assistance Programs (CAP). These services are designed to help low-income households, senior
citizens, permanently disabled, and non-English speaking customers control their energy use. The
Southern California Gas Company offers an energy conservation service known as the Community
Involvement Program (CIP). This service provides weatherization for the homes or apartments of low-
income families, provided they meet the federally-established income guidelines. These services are
provided to the low- income families free of charge while later being reimbursed by the Gas Company.
Income-qualified Edison and So Cal Gas customers may be eligible for the State’s Energy Savings
Assistance program, and/or a 20% bill discount under the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE)
program.
Energy Upgrade California (EUC)
This new statewide program offers up to $4,000 in incentives to homeowners who complete select
energy-saving home improvements on a single-family residence and two-to-four-unit buildings. The
incentive packages encourage customers to take the “whole house” approach by combining several
improvements at one time to achieve greater energy efficiencies and savings. Homeowners are
required to hire a contractor and perform an initial assessment. EUC has a list of participating
contractors and raters. Southern California Edison (SCE) and Southern California Gas are among the
five utilities that participate in the EUC program across the State.

V. Housing Plan
Sections II, III and IV of the Housing Element establish the housing needs, opportunities and constraints
in Yorba Linda. This final Housing Plan section begins by evaluating accomplishments under the
City’s adopted 2008 Housing Element and then presents Yorba Linda’s Housing Plan for the 2014-
2021 planning period. This Plan sets forth the City’s goals, policies and programs to address identified
housing needs.
Evaluation of Accomplishments under Adopted Housing Element
Under State Housing Element law, communities are required to assess the achievements under their
adopted housing programs as part of the five-year update to their housing elements. These
results should be quantified where possible (e.g. the number of units rehabilitated), but may be
qualitative where necessary (e.g. mitigation of governmental constraints). The results should then
be compared with what was projected or planned in the earlier element. Where significant shortfalls
exist between what was planned and what was achieved, the reasons for such differences must be
discussed.
The City of Yorba Linda 2008-2014 Housing Element sets forth a series of housing programs with
related objectives for the following areas:
          •     Conserving the existing supply of affordable housing;
          •     Assisting in the provision of housing;
          •     Providing adequate sites to achieve a variety and diversity of housing;
          •     Removing governmental constraints as necessary; and
          •     Promoting equal housing opportunity.
This section reviews the City’s progress to date in implementing these housing programs and their
continued appropriateness for the 2014-2021 Housing Element. Table V-1: 2008-2014 Housing
Program Accomplishments, summarizes the City’s housing program accomplishments, followed by a
review of its quantified objectives. The results of this analysis will provide the basis for developing the
comprehensive housing program strategy presented in Part C of this section

 2014 period.                           Effectiveness: While the program has been effective, with
                                        53 households assisted over a four year period, the City fell
                                        slightly under its goal to provide assistance to 15
                                        households annually.
                                        Continued Appropriateness: With the ongoing need to

                                        providing affordable housing, and in stemming the negative
                                        impact of foreclosures on neighboring properties.

                                        continues to age, second units can provide an option to allow
                                        seniors to remain in their homes, and thus the continuation of
                                        a second unit program remains appropriate to the Housing

                                      voters approved Measure H & I to rezone all 14 sites as
                                      identified in the Housing Element.
                                      Effectiveness: The program was effective in providing
                                      adequate sites to address Yorba Linda’s regional housing
                                      needs (RHNA). With the rezoning in place, combined with the

                                      substantial interest in development on several of the rezone
                                      sites.
                                      Continued Appropriateness: The rezoning of identified sites
                                      was completed, and is no longer necessary for the Housing

                                      Specific Plan for the Town Center.
                                      Continued Appropriateness: The City will carry out the Town

Summary of Housing Element Accomplishments
The City of Yorba Linda has made significant progress in implementing its 2008-2014 Housing
Element. Major accomplishments include the following:
            •   Establishing new multi-family zoning categories to accommodate densities of 20
                and 30 unit/acre, and adopting Multi-family Design Guidelines to ensure the
                quality of new development without requiring a CUP.
            •   Conducting a Measure B public education process, facilitating the passage
                of Measures H and I which provided for rezoning of the ten multi-family sites
                identified in the Housing Element.
            •   Providing planning entitlements for 69 lower income units on one of the rezone

New Construction: Yorba Linda’s new construction objective for the 2006-2014 planning period
reflects its assigned RHNA of 2,039 units. Like much of California, the collapse of the residential
real estate market, combined with constraints on the availability of financing for development,
dampened the level of residential development in Yorba Linda below SCAG’s pre-recessionary
RHNA projections. Between January 2006 – November 2012, the City issued 1,330 residential
building permits, including 1,117 single-family home/condominium units, the 75 unit Villa Plumosa
affordable family rental complex, 66 market-rate apartment units, nine second units, and a three
unit affordable Habitat for Humanity project. As indicated in the Housing Needs Assessment,
depending on unit size, apartment rents in Yorba Linda are at levels affordable to low and moderate
income households, and are thus divided between these two affordability levels in Table V-2. Rents on
second units are generally affordable to lower income households (refer to Constraints chapter), and
thus the affordability mix has been divided 2/3s low income and 1/3 moderate income. Housing
production was also achieved through the City’s Affordable Housing Agreement with the Orange
Housing Development Corporation (OHDC) to purchase for sale units and provide as long term

affordable rentals to extremely low, very low and low income households (consistent with the
requirements of Government Code Section 65583.1(c)).
An additional 133 single-family units in the City’s northern hillside areas (97 in Vista Del Verde
and 36 units in North Yorba Linda Estates) have entitlements for development. City staff estimates
that half of these will receive certificates of occupancy by 2013 year end and thus 67 units have been
credited towards the City’s 2008-2014 Housing Element. National CORE also has planning
entitlements for development of Oakcrest Terrace – a 69 unit affordable rental development for
lower income families. The developer has recently worked out provisions with the Orange County
Transit Authority (OCTA) to add a bus stop location near the site, and is well positioned to re-apply to
the State for the next round of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (July 2013). Due to the delay in
receiving tax credit financing, this project will not be completed until 2014 and is thus credited in the
future 2014-2021 Housing Element planning period.
Rehabilitation: The City’s Housing Element rehabilitation goal was to assist 15 lower income
households on an annual basis, for a total 90 households over the six year period. During the four
year period June 2008 – June 2012, 53 lower income households were provided rehabilitation
loans or grants, translating to approximately 13 households annually. Due to reductions in CDBG
funds to support this program, the City’s future goal will be to provide rehabilitation assistance to 12
households on an annual basis.
Conservation: Yorba Linda’s goal for conservation was to maintain the existing level of Section 8
rental assistance to 76 extremely low and very low income households. The City was successful in not
only maintaining this level of rental assistance, but increasing the number of Section 8 rental
vouchers in use to 90 households.

Housing Programs
The goals and policies contained in the Housing Element address Yorba Linda’s identified housing
needs, and are implemented through a series of housing programs. Housing programs define
the specific actions the City will undertake to achieve the stated goals and policies. The City’s overall
strategy for addressing its housing needs has been defined according to the five issue areas previously
described under goals and policies.
The City’s Housing Element programs encompass existing programs; programs revised in response
to the review of program accomplishments; and several new programs added to address unmet
housing needs. The Housing Program Summary Table V-3 located at the end of this section specifies
the following for each program: 2014-2021 objectives; funding sources; and agency responsible for
implementation. Overall quantified objectives for new construction, rehabilitation and conservation
are provided in Table V-4.
Conserve and Improve Housing
  1. Residential Rehabilitation Program. The City’s program assists lower income home owners,
  including senior and disabled households, with funding for necessary materials and supplies for
  home repairs and improvements. The program provides grants for the following activities: exterior
  or interior home repair, repair of fencing and/or landscaping, plumbing, exterior painting, roof
  repair, and similar activities. The maximum grant amount is $5,000 per household, unless for
  exceptional circumstances as approved by the Community Development Director. This program is
  also used to provide funds for neighborhood clean- ups which have included (but are not limited
  to) trash and debris removal, clean-up of unmaintained conditions, removal of inoperable vehicles,
  restoration of vandalized building, and removal of public nuisances.
  To qualify for the program, a household needs to meet the following conditions:
           •    Current household income must be at or below 80 percent of the County median
                income based upon family size.
           •    The head of the household must be at least 55 years of age, or have a physical
                handicap that makes him/her unable to maintain the home.
           2014-2021 Objective: The City will continue to use CDBG funds to assist senior and/or
           disabled households with needed home repairs and improvements. The City’s objective
           will be to provide assistance to 12 households per year, or 96 households over the 8 year
           planning period.
  2. Housing Community Preservation and Abatement. The City’s Community Preservation program
  is designed to bring substandard housing units into compliance with City codes. The City’s program
  combines a pro-active canvassing of the City to identify substandard housing and a re-active
  complaint driven inspection process. The City’s goal is code compliance and vacation of substandard
  housing is not anticipated. Property owners in violation of City codes are provided information on
Adopted Oct 2013                                                                          Page HE-101

Yorba Linda General Plan
 rehabilitation loans or grants they may be eligible for in correcting code violations.
          2014-2021 Objective: The City will continue to operate its community preservation and
          abatement program to stem housing deterioration.
 3. Multifamily Acquisition and Improvement. A key program in Yorba
 Linda’s overall strategy to provide affordable housing to lower income
 households has been through the acquisition and rehabilitation of
 aging and/or deteriorating apartment complexes. The City and its
 prior Redevelopment Agency have funded non-profit developers to
 complete two large scale multi-family acquisition/rehabilitation projects
 to date: the 64 unit Arbor Villas and 76 unit Villa Plumosa. Covenants
 are placed on the properties acquired by the non- profit to ensure
 long-term affordability and strong property management.
 Building on the successes of Arbor Villas and Villa Plumosa, the City
 was working towards the acquisition and rehabilitation of a third property when Redevelopment
 Agency housing funds were eliminated by the State. Given the program’s success, the City will
 continue to support non-profit sponsors in securing outside funds to acquire additional properties
 in the future.
          2014-2021 Objective: Coordinate with multi-family property owners and non-profit sponsors
          in identifying potential apartment complexes for acquisition. Assist in preparation of funding
          applications for outside funds (such as Tax Credits).
 4. Section 8 Rental Assistance. The Section 8 rental assistance program extends rental subsidies to
 extremely low and very low income households, including families, seniors and the disabled. The
 Section 8 program offers a voucher that pays the difference between the current fair market rent
 (FMR) as established by HUD and what a tenant can afford to pay (i.e. 30% of household income).
 The voucher allows a tenant to choose housing that costs above the payment standard, providing
 the tenant pays the extra cost. The Orange County Housing Authority (OCHA) coordinates Section
 8 rental assistance on behalf of the City, with 90 households receiving assistance as of August
 2012.
           2014-2021 Objective: Maintain current levels of assistance. Encourage landlords to register
           units with the Orange County Housing Authority and undergo education on the Section 8
           program
Provisions of Affordable Housing
 5. Affordable Housing Development Assistance. The City can play an important role in facilitating
 the development of quality, affordable and mixed-income housing through the provision of
 regulatory incentives, and direct financial assistance. The following are among the types of incentives
 the City can offer:
          •     Reduction in development fees
Page HE-102                                                                           Adopted Oct 2013

                                                                                    Yorba Linda General Plan
             •      Flexible development standards
             •      Density bonuses
             •      Financial assistance (through the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund 11
                    of the former Redevelopment Agency)
   The City also provides technical assistance to developers in support of affordable housing
   development, including: evaluation of projects for appropriate use of funding sources; assistance in
   completion of funding applications; and assistance in moving projects forward through the public
   review process. As a means of specifically encouraging the provision of housing affordable to
   extremely low income (ELI - <30% AMI) households, the City will waive 100% of Planning
   Department entitlement application processing fees for projects with a minimum ten percent ELI
   units, or not less than one unit.
             2014-2021 Objective: Continue to provide regulatory and financial assistance for the
             development of affordable and mixed income housing, with particular consideration given
             to projects that include ELI units. Provide information on incentives during individual dealings
             with development applicants. Within one year of Element adoption, update the Code to
             specify the waiver of 100% of application fees for projects with a minimum 10% ELI units.
   6. Purchase of Existing Multi-family Ownership Units to Create Affordable Rental Units. Since
   December 2009, the City and its former Redevelopment Agency have funded Orange Housing
   Development Corporation (OHDC) in the purchase, rehabilitation and conversion of thirty
   condominium units, many of which were in foreclosure, to affordable rentals. The Affordable
   Housing Agreement between OHDC and the Successor Agency is an existing obligation of the
   former Redevelopment Agency, allowing the continuation of the program until funds are exhausted.
             2014-2021 Objective: Implement the City’s 2009 Affordable Housing Agreement with
             OHDC to allow the continued purchase of multi-family ownership units as they become
             available for-sale, provide of rehabilitation improvements, and convert to rental housing
             affordable to extremely low, very low and low income households. Seek to complete ten
             additional units with available funds.
7. Sustainability and Green Building. Green buildings are structures that are designed, renovated,
   re-used or operated in a manner that enhances resource efficiency and sustainability. These
   structures reduce water consumption, improve energy efficiency, generate less waste, and lessen a
   building’s overall environmental impacts. Yorba Linda has incorporated the 2010 California Energy
   Code and the State of California’s 2010 Green Building Code Standards into the City’s Municipal
   11
      Yorba Linda is projected to receive $5.7 million in Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Funds over the planning period from
   SERAF repayments, with additional Housing Asset Funds generated from housing loan repayments to the former Redevelopment
   Agency, and proceeds from land purchased with Low/Mod funds (refer to page IV-5)

  related to planning and design, energy efficiency, water efficiency and conservation, material
  conservation and resource efficiency, and environmental quality.
  A key goal of the Yorba Linda General Plan Update is to establish the foundation for creating
  a more sustainable community for existing and future residents. The City’s Multi- Family Design
  Guidelines, adopted in October 2011, integrate sustainable development principles derived
  from the LEED ND criteria (Leadership for Energy and Environmental Design for neighborhood
  Development). The Design Guidelines include provisions for sustainable site planning and
  streetscape, and encourage multi-family development to achieve LEED certification. The Town
  Center Specific Plan also incorporates numerous sustainable design criteria specified in the LEED
  Neighborhood Design Program, as well as encouraging sustainability features such as cool roofs,
  solar panels, permeable paving, and water efficient irrigation and landscaping.
          2014-2021 Objective: Implement sustainability policies and actions within the City’s updated
          General Plan, Town Center Specific Plan and Multi-family Design Guidelines. Provide
          outreach and education to developers, architects and residents on the Green Building Code,
          and ways to incorporate sustainability in project design and existing structures.
Provide Adequate Residential Sites
  8. Residential Sites Inventory. As part of the 2008-2014 Housing Element, the City undertook
  an extensive public process to identify suitable sites for rezoning as required to accommodate
  Yorba Linda’s regional housing needs (RHNA). A total of 14 sites were ultimately rezoned at
  densities of 10 to 30 units per acre, and confirmed by the electorate in June 2012 under the Yorba
  Linda Right-to-Vote Amendment (Measure B). These rezoned sites provide the basis for the 2014-
  2021 Housing Element residential sites inventory.
          2014-2021 Objective: Maintain a current inventory of vacant and underutilized residential
          sites, and provide to interested developers in conjunction with information on available
          development incentives.
9. Second Units. A second unit is a self-contained living unit with cooking,
eating, sleeping, and full sanitation facilities, either attached to or detached
from the primary residential unit on a single lot. Second units typically rent
for less than apartments of comparable size, and can offer affordable
rental options for extremely low to lower i n c o m e seniors, college students
and single persons. The primary homeowner receives supplementary
income by renting out their second unit, which can help many modest
income and elderly homeowners remain in or afford their homes.
Pursuant to current State law, Yorba Linda permits second units through a
ministerial, non-discretionary process in all single- family residential zone districts. During the prior
Page HE-104                                                                            Adopted Oct 2013

                                                                     Yorba Linda General Plan
planning period (2006-2012), nine second units were developed in Yorba Linda. With enhanced
marketing of second unit opportunities, the City projects a modest increase in the rate of second unit
production of twelve units during the 2014-2021 planning period.
          2014-2021 Objective: Through implementation of the City’s second unit ordinance, provide
          additional sites for the provision of rental housing. Educate residents on the availability of
          second units through development of informational materials for distribution at the public
          counter, and through advertisement on the City’s website. Seek to achieve twelve second
          units during the planning period.
 10. Annexation of Areas in Sphere of Influence. Future housing growth can be accommodated
 through annexation of undeveloped land within Yorba Linda’s northern Sphere of Influence. The
 468 acre Murdock and 80 acre Sage properties located in the northeastern Sphere represent
 integrated tracts of undeveloped land likely to be annexed within this Housing Element planning
 period. The City’s current General Plan provides for up to 536 new units within the northeastern
 Sphere Area Plan, and encourages clustering in response to topographical and other physical
 limitations. The area is currently being studied within the context of the General Plan Update, and
 given the presence of environmental and infrastructure constraints, may result in a reduction of overall
 densities.
          2014-2021 Objective: Initiate discussions to annex areas within the Sphere of Influence
          and provide infrastructure and services necessary to support future development.
Removal of Governmental Constraints
 11. Multi-family Development Standards and Processing Procedures. In conjunction with
 identifying sites for rezoning in the 2008-2014 Housing Element, the City established two new
 zoning categories to accommodate densities of 20 and 30 units per acre. The development
 standards for these new multi-family zone districts R-M-20 and R-M-30 were established in
 consultation with an urban design professional to ensure their cumulative impact did not constrain
 the ability to achieve maximum zoned densities. In tandem with establishing the new higher
 density zoning, Yorba Linda eliminated the prior multi-family Conditional Use Permit requirement
 and established Multi-Family Design Guidelines to provide upfront direction to the development
 community regarding the desired quality and character of multi-family development. Yorba Linda
 has established a review process, development standards and design guidelines which facilitate, and
 do not serve to constrain, quality multi-family housing.
          2014-2021 Objective: Implement the City’s new multi-family development standards and
          Design Guidelines to facilitate quality, sustainable multi-family housing.
 12. Affordable Housing Density Bonus. Zoning Code Chapter 18.19 sets forth the City’s density
 bonus incentives consistent with State law (Government Code Section 65915). In summary,
 applicants of residential projects of five or more units may apply for a density bonus and
Adopted Oct 2013                                                                           Page HE-105

Yorba Linda General Plan
 additional incentive(s) if the project provides for one of the following:
         •   10% of the total units for lower income households; or
         •   5% of the total units for very low income households; or
         •   A senior citizen housing development or mobilehome park that limits residency based
             on age requirements for housing for older persons; or
         •   10% of the total dwelling units in a condominium for moderate income
             households.
 The amount of density bonus varies according to the amount by which the percentage of
 affordable housing units exceeds the established minimum percentage, but generally ranges from
 20-35% above the specified General Plan density. In addition to the density bonus, eligible
 projects may receive 1-3 additional development incentives, depending on the proportion of
 affordable units and level of income targeting. The following development incentives may be
 requested:
         •   Reduced site development standards or architectural design requirements.
         •   Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing project.
         •   Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the applicant or the City that
             would result in identifiable cost reductions.
         •   In addition to development incentives, developers may request and receive reduced
             parking as follows: 1 space for 0-1 bedroom units, 2 spaces for 2-3 bedroom units,
             and 2½ spaces for four or more bedrooms.
         2014-2021 Objective: Maintain a local density bonus ordinance consistent with State
         requirements as a means of enhancing the economic feasibility of affordable housing
         development.
 13. Administrative Adjustment Process. The City uses an Administrative Adjustment Process as
 a means of providing flexibility in residential development standards, improving feasibility and
 reducing development costs. Specific administrative adjustments pertaining to residential uses
 include the following:
         •   A decrease of not more than 10% of the required building site area, width, or depth;
         •   A decrease of not more than 20% of the required width of a side yard or the yard between
             buildings;
         •   A decrease of not more than 15% of the required front or rear yard with the
             combined total not to exceed 20%; and
         •   An increase of not more than 10% of the permitted projection of steps, stairways,
Page HE-106                                                                        Adopted Oct 2013

                                                                     Yorba Linda General Plan
               landings, eaves, overhangs, masonry chimneys, and fireplaces into any required front,
               rear, side or yard between buildings.
 Unlike the conditional use permit and variance processes, the Administrative Adjustment Process
 is a non-public hearing process and is not subject to the public noticing requirements of the
 Government Code. However, Administrative Adjustment applications do provide notice to all abutting
 property owners adjacent to the subject property.
          2014-2021 Objective: The City will continue to use the Administrative Adjustment Process
          to provide flexibility in residential development requirements.
 14. Zoning Code Amendment: In 2011, Yorba Linda incorporated provisions for emergency
 shelters within its Zoning Code in compliance with SB 2, as detailed in the Constraints Chapter
 of the Housing Element (page III-10). Review of the City’s adopted shelter standards by the State
 Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) have identified three standards as being
 overly restrictive:
     1. Minimum 500 foot separation between shelters (State statutes do not permit a
          mandatory separation requirement of greater than 300 feet)
     2. Minimum 1 parking stall for every 4 beds
     3. Minimum 1 toilet for every 8 beds per gender
 The City will review other jurisdiction’s shelter standards, and adjust its standards to provide greater
 consistency with current practices. For instance, State HCD provides an example of shelter standards
 on its website, including a parking standard of one space for every 10 beds.
          2014-2021 Objective: Amend the emergency shelter provisions in the Zoning Code within
          one year of Element adoption to: 1) reduce the separation requirement between emergency
          shelters from 500 to 300 feet consistent with State requirements; and 2) adjust parking and
          toilet ratio requirements to be less restrictive. As part of the City’s Annual Housing Element
          Report, evaluate the effectiveness of the M-1 zone in facilitating the provision of emergency
          shelters.
Equal Housing Opportunities and Special Needs
 15. Fair Housing. The City uses the services of the Fair Housing Council of Orange County to
 implement the regional Fair Housing Plan (AI), and to offer the following services:
          •    Fair Housing Community Education
          •    Fair Housing Enforcement
          •    Tenant Legal Assistance
          •    Housing Dispute Evaluation and Resolution
Adopted Oct 2013                                                                            Page HE-107

Yorba Linda General Plan
          •   Mediation Program
 The role of the Council is to provide services to jurisdictions, agencies, and the general public
 to further fair housing practices in the sale or rental of housing.
          2014-2021 Objective: Continue to promote fair housing practices, and provide
          educational information on fair housing to the public. The City will refer fair housing
          complaints to the Orange County Fair Housing Council.
 16. Housing Opportunities for Persons Living with Developmental Disabilities. The City
 understands the significant and wide ranging housing needs faced by person with disabilities
 and their families. The Orange County Regional Center (OCRC) reports that nearly 60 percent
 of their adult clients with developmental disabilities live with their parents, and as these parents age
 and become frailer, their adult disabled children will require alternative housing options. The
 OCRC has identified several community-based housing types appropriate for persons living with
 a developmental disability, including: licensed community care facilities and group homes;
 supervised apartment settings with support services; and for persons able to live more
 independently, rent subsidized, affordable housing. The City will work with the OCRC to implement
 an outreach program informing Yorba Linda families of housing and services available for
 persons with developmental disabilities, including making information available on the City’s website.
 Yorba Linda supports the provision of housing for its disabled population, including persons with
 developmental disabilities, through several means, including:
          •   By-right zoning for licensed residential care facilities (6 or fewer residents) in all
              residential zones, and provisions for larger care facilities (7 or more residents) in multi-
              family residential zones subject to a conditional use permit.
          •   Adoption of Zoning Code amendments in October 2011 to specifically define
              supportive housing as a residential use of property, and to permit in all residential zone
              districts subject only to those restrictions and processing requirements that apply to
              other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone.
          •   Implementation of Zoning Code Chapter 18.36.340 to provide a procedure for an
              individual with a disability to request a reasonable accommodation from zoning and
              building standards. No special permit or fee is required.
          •   Provision of residential rehabilitation loans and grants for lower income households
              which may be used for accessibility improvements.
          •   Programs        to     facilitate    affordable      housing,      including     Multi-family
              Acquisition/Rehabilitation through Non-Profit Developers, Density Bonuses, and
              Affordable Housing Development Assistance
Page HE-108                                                                              Adopted Oct 2013

           2014-2021 Objective: Continue to support a variety of housing types to help address the
           diverse needs of persons living with developmental disabilities, and work in cooperation with
           the OCRC to publicize information on available resources for housing and services.
           Pursue State and Federal funds available for supportive housing and services in future
           affordable housing projects, and apply for funds at least one during the planning period.
           Discuss with all affordable housing providers their ability to include units for the
           developmentally disabled population.
 17. Universal Design/Visitability. As Yorba Linda’s population continues to age, providing housing
 that is accessible to people of all abilities becomes increasingly important. The majority of the
 community’s housing stock was built prior to 1991, when current ADA accessibility standards took
 effect, and thus it is important for the City to facilitate the retrofit of existing housing to provide greater
 accessibility, as well as to promote accessibility in new construction.
 The goal of universal design is to accommodate a wide range of abilities, including children, aging
 populations, and persons with disabilities, by providing features in residential construction that
 enhance accessibility. Examples of universal design features include:
           •   Entrances without steps that make it easier for persons to enter the home;
           •   Wider doorways that enhance interior circulation and accommodate strollers and
               wheelchairs;
           •   Lever door handles that are easier to use, especially by parents with an infant or
               persons with arthritis; and
           •   Light switches and electrical outlets that are located at a height more convenient and
               accessible to the elderly.
 Housing that is “visitable” is accessible at a basic level, enabling persons with disabilities to visit the
 homes of their friends, relatives, and neighbors. Visitability can be achieved in new construction by
 utilizing two simple design standards: 1) providing a 32-inch clear opening in all interior and
 bathroom doorways; and 2) providing at least one accessible means of ingress and egress for
 each unit. As a means of promoting universal design, the City will:
       •   Develop a brochure on universal design and distribute to residential builders; and
       •   Work with local developers and other interest groups to establish a set of Universal
           Design Guidelines for adoption by City Council.
          2014-2021 Program Objectives: Develop universal design brochure in 2014, and establish
          City Universal Design Guidelines in 2015.
Adopted Oct 2013                                                                                   Page HE-109

3. Land Use Element
Introduction
The Land Use Element is often seen as the
primary framework for the General Plan,
as it sets forth the patterns of land use and
activities that will support and enhance the
character of the City. The Land Use
Element defines goals and policies that will
guide the way the City of Yorba Linda
grows and changes over the next 20 years.
It serves as a guide to both public officials
and private citizens in describing the type,
intensity, and general distribution of land
uses for housing, business, industry, open
space and public and semi-public uses.
Authority and Scope
The State of California Government Code Section 65302(a) requires that a General Plan include “a
Land Use Element which designates the proposed general distribution and general location and extent
of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space including agriculture, natural
resources, recreation and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings, and grounds, solid
and liquid waste disposal facilities and other categories of public and private uses of land. The Land Use
Element shall include a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity
recommended for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan.”
The Land Use Element has the broadest scope of any of the General Plan Elements. In addition to the
State requirements set forth in the California Government Code, it has also been legally established
that while the location of a particular land use may be expressed in general terms, a property owner
must be able to identify the General Plan designation for his/her parcel from the land use diagram
contained in the Land Use Element.
The primary implementing mechanisms of the Land Use Element is the Yorba Linda Municipal Code.
California Government Code requires a General Law City’s Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map be
consistent with the General Plan Land Use Element and Land Use Element Diagram. Specific Plans
adopted by the City of Yorba Linda must also be consistent with the General Plan they implement.
The goals, policies and implementation programs of the Land Use Element support and reinforce the
current quality of life in Yorba Linda as the "Land of Gracious Living". The Land Use Element establishes

Yorba Linda General Plan
the City of Yorba Linda’s official policies, programs and actions related to land use citywide. The Element
accomplishes this through the General Plan Land Use Map, narrative text, and quantifying tables. The
General Plan Land Use Map depicts the permitted type and density/intensity of use for all lands within
the City’s jurisdiction and sphere-of-influence. Lands are designated according to residential,
commercial, industrial, and open space uses. The land use policies contained in the Land Use Element
are visually represented by the General Plan Land Use Map and visually describe citywide land use
patterns.

document are advised to refer to the goals and policies, as well as the map when evaluating proposed
development and capital improvement projects. The majority of the land area within the City is
developed with single-family homes built between the 1960s and 1990s. Apartments, townhomes and
condominiums can also be found throughout the City. Commercial development is mainly located
along Yorba Linda Boulevard and Imperial Highway, along with smaller neighborhood-serving retail
centers scattered within residential areas. The City’s built-out nature presents opportunity for infill
development and redevelopment to accommodate changing needs, market conditions, and
demographics.

1993 General Plan Land Use
The vision of the 1993 General Plan was
focused on achieving and maintaining a
high quality of life for the residents of
Yorba Linda while maintaining the
pleasant residential suburban community
feel that residents value. The land use plan
in the 1993 General Plan was developed
to support this vision. The land use plan
generally categorized land use designation
according to residential, commercial,
industrial and open space uses. The issues
that the 1993 Land Use Plan hoped to
address included:
        Preserving the City’s low density character;
        Focusing new development opportunities in the north and northwestern areas of the City;
        Allowing infill development that also preserve the character of established neighborhoods;
        Enhance pedestrian activity in commercial areas;
        Provide better commercial services for residents;
        Develop a centralized community core;
        Develop sub-regional commercial opportunities;
        Address issues with the North Orange County Community College site;
        Continue providing affordable housing; and
        Maintain and enhance open space linkages.
Table LU-1: Land Use Summary, and Exhibit LU-1: Land Use Map, below summarizes the current land
use designations. Table LU-1:Land Use Summary, quantifies the acreage in Yorba Linda dedicated to
each land use and the allowable intensity and/or density of development for each land use designation.
The Land Use Map illustrates the dispersion of the General Plan land use designations in the City.

Existing (On-the-Ground) Land Use
The City of Yorba Linda is a mix of residential, open space, public, commercial, and industrial uses.
The existing land uses in the City reflects the low-density character of the community. As shown in Table
LU-2: Existing (On-the-Ground) Land Use, below, Yorba Linda consists predominantly of residential and
open space uses. Open space land uses are predominately located along the northern boundary of the
City. Commercial corridors are focused along Imperial Highway, Yorba Linda Boulevard and Savi
Ranch. The majority of industrial uses are located in the Savi Ranch area in the southeasterly portion of
the City. Exhibit LU-2: Existing Land Uses Map, illustrates the City’s existing land use pattern.

Related Plans and Programs
There are a number of land use documents
which have been adopted, through
ordinance or resolution, which bear a
relationship to the General Plan. Relevant
plans and documents are listed as follows:
Yorba Linda Zoning Code
The principal method by which a city
implements General Plan land use policy
is the zoning code. Policies and standards
which describe the types of uses permitted,
their density/intensity, and development
characteristics (design, property setbacks, etc.) are codified as precise requirements in the zoning
ordinance. The authority to zone is inherent in the police power delegated to cities by the California
Constitution. The Zoning Code consists of two basic elements: a map which delineates the boundaries
of districts in which uses develop with similar standards are permitted and text which explains the purpose
of the zoning district, lists the permitted uses, and defines the standards for development. In the event
that the Zoning Code becomes inconsistent with the General Plan by reason of an update, annexation
or amendment, the Zoning Code must be amended within a reasonable time to ensure consistency.
General Plan Environmental Impact Report (EIR)
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is a statute that requires state and local agencies to
identify potential environmental impacts, and to avoid or mitigate those impacts, if feasible. Pursuant to
CEQA, the City is required to prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR). The EIR analysis focuses
on potential environmental impacts that could arise from implementation of the General Plan Update
through development of land uses within the City’s planning area, as regulated and guided by General
Plan policies and implementation programs.
Parks and Recreation Master Plan
The updated Yorba Linda Parks and Recreation Master Plan was adopted in August 2014. The new
Master Plan provides direction to continue the orderly and consistent planning, acquisition,
development, and administration of the parks and recreation programming in Yorba Linda. The Master
Plan guides the City’s decision making with regard to overall policy and provides an inventory and
assessment of recreation programs and service offerings, operations, maintenance, and capital
improvements to be made over the next twenty years that will enhance the quality of life in Yorba Linda.
The goals, programs, and strategies identified in the updated Parks and Recreation Master Plan are
incorporated into the General Plan Update.
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                               Page LU-11

Yorba Linda General Plan
Specific Plans and Development Plans
State law authorizes cities to adopt specific plans and development plans for implementing their general
plans in designated areas. These plans are intended to provide more finite specification of permitted
uses, development standards, circulation and infrastructure improvements, and design guidelines. They
are often used to ensure that multiple property owners and developers adhere to a common
development plan.
        Yorba Linda Town Center Specific Plan – The Yorba Linda Town Center Specific Plan is a
        comprehensive document that implements the vision for the Town Center Specific Plan Area as
        established by the Blue Ribbon Committee Findings and Recommendations. The area is
        bounded by Imperial Highway to the west, Yorba Linda Boulevard to the south, Lakeview Avenue
        to the east and Lemon Drive to the north. The heart and backbone of the study area is Main
        Street, which runs north and south between Imperial Highway and Lemon Drive. The Town
        Center Vision established a vital center to the city of Yorba Linda by offering a mix of
        commercial, entertainment and recreation uses to energize and unify the Town Center.
        Shell Specific Plan – The Shell Specific Plan was developed to implement the Shell Property Area
        Plan and guide future uses through a Development Agreement between the City and the
        developer. The Specific Plan provided the regulatory framework for the development of
        infrastructure, housing, recreational, and other neighborhood supporting facilities in the Shell
        Property area.
Local Plans and Initiatives
The City of Yorba Linda has existing local policies that affect land use policy and decisions in the
community.
        Measure B - The Yorba Linda Right-to-Vote Amendment (Measure B), is a citizen-sponsored,
        voter-approved initiative, incorporated within the City’s Municipal Code. Measure B was passed
        in 2006 and requires citywide election for the approval of certain “Major Amendments” to the
        City’s “Planning Policy Documents” (as defined by Measure B) and imposed new noticing and
        public hearing requirements for “Regular Amendments”, and established height restrictions for
        structures. The Yorba Linda Municipal Code identifies the following as “Planning Policy
        Documents” that are subject to the provisions of Measure B:
                The text of the Yorba Linda General Plan’s Land Use Element,
                The Land Use Policy Map of the Yorba Linda General Plan,
                The text of the Yorba Linda Zoning Code,
                The Zoning Map of the City of Yorba Linda,
                Any Specific Plan for a geographic area within the City, or
                Any Development Agreement granting rights to develop private or public land.
 Page LU-12                                                                         Adopted Oct 2016

                                                                    Yorba Linda General Plan
        The Municipal Code further defines “Major and Regular Amendments” to the identified Planning
        Policy Documents. A “Major Amendment” of any of the Planning Policy Documents means an
        amendment which results in any of the following changes to the development standards for any
        parcel of land affected by the proposed amendment:
               Increases the number of residential units which may be constructed on a parcel
                designated for residential uses.
               Increases the number of separate parcels which may be created from an existing parcel.
               Changes any residential land use to allow any other land use.
               Changes any non-residential land use to allow any residential land use greater than 10
                net dwelling units per acre or allows a mix of commercial and residential uses.
               Increases the allowed maximum height of development.
               Provides for the private development of land owned by a government entity within five
                years of the date of the approval to develop the land.
               Repeals any of the Planning Policy Documents.
        A “Regular Amendment” of any of the Planning Policy Documents includes any amendment
        which is not a Major Amendment.
        Measure H & I - Following City Council approval of the 2008-2014 Housing Element and
        residential rezonings on October 4, 2011, a Measure B vote was placed on the June 5, 2012
        Primary Election to approve the Savi Ranch Planned Development (Measure H) and other
        specific rezoning sites (Measure I) to meet the City’s regional housing need per state law.
        Measure H and I identifies specific sites in the City. Both measures were passed by Yorba Linda
        voters.
Regional Plans and Initiatives
As part of Orange County and the larger southern California region, land use policy and decisions in
Yorba Linda are related to other planning efforts and implementation plans that are large in scope.
        SCAG RHNA - The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is mandated by State Housing
        Law as part of the periodic process of updating local housing elements of the General Plan.
        The RHNA quantifies the need for housing within each jurisdiction during specified planning
        periods. Communities use the RHNA in land use planning, prioritizing local resource allocation,
        and in deciding how to address identified existing and future housing needs resulting from
        population, employment and household growth. The RHNA does not necessarily encourage or
        promote growth, but rather allows communities to anticipate growth, so that collectively the
        region and sub-region can grow in ways that enhance quality of life, improve access to jobs,
        promotes transportation mobility, and addresses social equity, fair share housing needs.
        SCAG RTP/SCS- The Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy
        (RTP/SCS) is a is a long-range visioning plan that balances future mobility and housing needs
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                            Page LU-13

Yorba Linda General Plan
       with economic, environmental and public health goals. The RTP/SCS embodies a collective
       vision for the region’s future and is developed with input from local governments, county
       transportation commissions, tribal governments, non-profit organizations, businesses and local
       stakeholders within the counties of Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino
       and Ventura. What is at the heart of the 2016 RTP/SCS are over 2,000 transportation projects—
       ranging from freeway improvements, railroad grade separations, bicycle lanes, new transit hubs
       and replacement bridges. These future investments were included in county plans developed by
       the six County Transportation Commissions and seek to reduce traffic bottlenecks, improve the
       efficiency of the region’s network and expand mobility choices for everyone.
       The RTP/SCS is an important planning document for the region, allowing project sponsors to
       qualify for federal funding. The Southern California Association of Government’s (SCAG) plan
       takes into account operations and maintenance costs, to ensure reliability, longevity and cost
       effectiveness. In addition, the RTP/SCS will be supported by a combination of transportation
       and land use strategies that will help the region achieve state greenhouse gas emission reduction
       goals and federal Clean Air Act requirements, preserve open space areas, improve public health
       and roadway safety, support our vital goods movement industry and utilize resources more
       efficiently.
       AQMP- Periodically, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) develop,
       adopts, and implements an Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) for bringing their area of
       jurisdiction into compliance with the clean air standards established by national and state
       governmental legislation. Implementation of the AQMP requires a cooperative partnership of
       governmental agencies at the federal, state, regional, and local level. The AQMP sets forth a
       comprehensive and integrated program that will lead the South Coast basin into compliance
       with the federal 24-hour PM2.5 air quality standards, and provides an update to the basin’s
       commitment towards meeting the federal 8-hour ozone standards.
       Congestion Management Program (CMP) – A Congestion Management Program (CMP) is
       required in metropolitan areas with population exceeding 200,000, known as Transportation
       Management Areas (TMAs). Federal requirements state that in all TMAs, the CMP shall be
       developed and implemented as an integrated part of the metropolitan transportation planning
       process. The goals of the Orange County CMP are to support regional mobility and air quality
       objectives by reducing traffic congestion; to provide a mechanism for coordinating land use and
       development decisions that support the regional economy; and to determine gas tax fund
       eligibility. To meet these goals, the CMP contains a number of policies designed to monitor and
       address system performance issues.
       Measure M- The Renewed Measure M (Measure M2) program provides more than $15 billion
       to improve transportation in Orange County over a 30-year period beginning in spring 2011.
       M2 is designed to reduce traffic congestion and enhance overall mobility. Improvements in the

                                                                                 Yorba Linda General Plan
          plan include improving key freeways, upgrading major interchanges, and adding capacity and
          maintaining streets and roads. Other benefits include synchronization of traffic signals
          countywide, continuing support to grow a rail transit system, and protection of the environment
          from street runoff that may pollute waterways and beaches.
Description of 2016 General Plan Land Use
The City of Yorba Linda’s official land use policy is illustrated in Exhibit LU-3: 2016 General Plan Land
Use Map. The map presents the general patterns and relationship of the various land uses in the 2016
Yorba Linda General Plan. Table LU-3: 2016 General Plan Land Use Summary, summarizes the
intensity/density standards for the new land use designations. The assumed buildout will be used as
thresholds for evaluating impacts in the General Plan’s Environmental Impact Report.

Yorba Linda General Plan
General Plan Buildout
An acreage calculation of the land use policy is presented in Table LU-4: 2016 General Plan Buildout
Analysis. The acreages of various land uses on the General Plan Land Use Map are presented, along
with a number of dwelling units and the amount of non-residential square footage. The values in Table
LU-4: 2016 General Plan Buildout Analysis, include growth anticipated with the 2016 General Plan and
presents assumed buildout of the land use policies. The majority of growth in the City is anticipated to
occur in designated Focus Areas as summarized in Table LU-5: 2016 Buildout in Focus Areas. As further
discussed in this chapter, “Focus Areas” are selected areas in Yorba Linda for customized policy
treatment not generally applicable elsewhere in the City. “Focus Areas” differ from the “Area Plan”
designations in that Focus Areas provide broad planning objectives to guide future development of
larger, identified regions in the City and City’s sphere of influence, whereas Area Plans provide
specialized policy direction for smaller, particularized area in the City and City’s sphere of influence.
Consequently, some of the Focus Areas identified in the Land Use Element encompass parcels that are
part of the smaller, designated Area Plans. Policies, development types, and intensity of development
identified for parcels designated as “Area Plan” supersedes policy objectives identified for the larger
Focus Area. The development potential in the Focus Areas and Area Plans represents a portion of the
total buildout potential summarized in Table LU-4: 2016 General Plan Buildout Analysis. The following
assumed buildout was used in the environmental analysis of this General Plan

                                                                     Yorba Linda General Plan
2016 General Plan Land Use Designations
State General Plan law requires the Land
Use Element to establish standards for
development density and intensity for land
use designations described in the General
Plan Land Use Map. Land Use
designations describe the purpose and the
type and intensity of development allowed
in a given area. While terms like
“residential,” “commercial,” or “industrial”
are generally understood, State General
Plan law requires a clear and concise
description of the land use categories that
are depicted in the Land Use Plan.
Residential land uses are described in terms of density of dwelling units per an acre (du/ac). A dwelling
unit is a structure or part of a structure that is used as a residence by a single household. The acreage
is the gross acreage of all the land within a given boundary. The density allowed is defined by the
number of individual dwelling units that are permitted per a gross acre.
Intensity of development for non-residential land uses, such as commercial and industrial uses, is
determined using floor area ration (FAR). FAR is the total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot divided
by the total area of the lot. The maximum allowable FAR is represented as a number, such as 1.0, that
is multiplied by the total lot area to determine the total built area permitted on that site.
The Land Use Element and General Plan Land Use Map contain the following land use designations:
Residential Land Uses
         Residential – Low (1.0 du/ac) – The Low Density Residential category has been designated for
         the steep terrain along the northerly boundary of Yorba Linda as well as the historical
         “agricultural” areas that are centrally located within the planning area. Approximately 10
         percent of the land allocated to residential uses in the planning area falls within this designation.
         The average density of this designation is 1.0 dwelling unit per acre. However, clustering may
         occur at greater intensities to compensate for topographical constraints. Excessive grading to
         the natural hillside landform is discouraged. This is a definitive determinant in establishment of
         specific density allotments within the designation.
         Residential – Medium Low (1.8 du/ac) – The Medium-Low Density Residential category is
         intended for spacious single-family environments at an average density of 1.8 dwelling units per
         acre. Approximately one-third of the designated residential land in the Yorba Linda planning
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                                  Page LU-23

Yorba Linda General Plan
       area is allocated to this land use designation. This significantly contributes to the low density
       character of the City. Lot sizes per acre typically range from one-half to one-third of an acre per
       dwelling unit. The Medium-Low Density designation has been allocated to focus lower density
       development in the neighborhoods located in the northern and eastern portions of the City, as
       well as in some instances to respond to terrain with topographical constraints. This designation
       easily accommodates equestrian activities and properties permitting the keeping of horses.
       Residential – Medium (3.0 du/ac) – The Medium Density Residential category accounts for
       approximately 28 percent of the designated residential land in the planning area. The Medium
       Density designation accommodates an average density of 3.0 dwelling units per acre, allowing
       typical single-family detached residential subdivisions, or more innovative clustered
       development of units in conjunction with provision of community recreational facilities and
       preservation of common open space area. This provides a degree of flexibility in the execution
       of this land use designation, which is prevalent in the central and eastern portions of the City.
       Residential – Medium High (4.0 du/ac) – The Medium High Density Residential designation
       represents approximately 20 percent of the designated residential land in the planning area.
       Many of the older portions of the City on the west side, as well as newer development in the
       central and eastern portions of the City located in close proximity to the major Esperanza Road
       and La Palma Avenue east-west arterial, are designated for Medium High Density Residential
       development. This designation permits an average density of 4.0 dwelling units per acre, with
       minimum lot size of 7,500 square feet. This designation reflects development conditions which
       include acreage of limited size for residential development, proximity to arterial roadways and
       non-residential development, and property with locational restrictions which precludes
       development of high density development.
       Residential – High (4 – 30 du/ac) – High Density Residential areas permit a variety of dwelling
       types ranging from single-family detached homes to attached products and apartments. The
       High Density Residential designation permits a density range of 4.0 to 30.0 dwelling units per
       acre. The appropriate housing type is predicated based on the site, location, and adjacent land
       uses. Clustering of buildings allows for the provision of appropriate private recreational and
       open space amenities. High density designations have been advantageously located throughout
       the planning area for proximity to retail, commercial, and employment opportunities, as well as
       providing a rational land use transition between lower density residential areas and non-
       residential land uses. A number of high density residential development are established in the
       eastern portion of Yorba Linda, reflecting less traditional site planning techniques such as zero
       lot line, patio homes, and condominium ownership attached products. The High Density
       Residential designation also includes sites identified under the City’s Measure H and Measure I
       to meet the requirements of Housing Element law.

                                                                   Yorba Linda General Plan
Commercial Land Uses
       Commercial – General (0.25 FAR) – General Commercial areas provide for a variety of retail,
       services, and entertainment facilities. General Commercial uses include a full range of retail,
       furniture and appliances, convenience goods, restaurants, automotive establishments, and
       professional offices. Commercial services and entertainment uses, such as travel agents, dry
       cleaners, hair salons, sports clubs, movie theaters, and visitor services are also appropriate at
       these locations. Concentrations of General Commercial areas are located along Imperial
       Highway in the vicinity of Bastanchury Road and Valley View Avenue, at the intersection of Yorba
       Linda Boulevard and Richfield Road, along Yorba Linda Boulevard in the eastern portion of the
       City, and two centers along La Palma Avenue in the southeast section of the City. General
       Commercial is also designated as a use within portions of SAVI Ranch.
       Commercial – Office (0.35 FAR) –Office Commercial includes financial institutions, medical
       facilities, and a wide range of professional uses. The largest concentration of Office Commercial
       is located on the corner of Bastanchury Road and Rose Dive and support medical facilities and
       offices. The other locations of Office Commercial are smaller sites, located in proximity to
       Neighborhood Commercial and General Commercial centers.
       Commercial – Neighborhood (0.25 FAR) –The Neighborhood Commercial designation
       represents uses that provide convenience goods and services at a smaller scale and service
       radius in contrast to the more comprehensive General Commercial designation. The City
       contains three Neighborhood Commercial locations, two along Yorba Linda Boulevard in the
       East Lake Village area, and one within the Fairlynn county island.
Industrial Land Uses
       Light Industrial/Business Park (0 .40 FAR) – The Light Industrial is primarily concentrated in the
       SAVI Ranch area and along La Palma Avenue in close proximity to the AT&SF Railroad and the
       91 Riverside Freeway in the southeast portion of the City. Industrial uses are also found in the
       vicinity of Prospect Avenue and Imperial Highway. Industrial uses in Yorba Linda are appropriate
       for research and development, assembly and/or storage of products and wholesale facilities.
       The Light Industrial designation also permits commercial uses that support industrial uses, similar
       to uses in SAVI Ranch.
Open Space and Other Land Uses
       Open Space (0 .00FAR) – The Open Space designation is intended for active and passive
       recreation areas, passive open space, conservation and public safety land uses, either public or
       private in nature. Such uses include: developed parklands, private recreation facilities and
       recreation amenities, flood control area, natural resources and conservation areas, and open
       space lands that may be contained within private ownership, but due to access and other
       topographical constraints, are not to be improved or developed. Active recreation can be
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                              Page LU-25

Yorba Linda General Plan
         defined as recreational pursuits which are typically structured around organized riles and require
         man-made facilities and improvements, included graded spaces, tailored playing surface,
         buildings, parking areas, and similar modifications to the natural site. Passive recreation can be
         defined as generally unstructured recreational pursuits which occur within natural site features
         except for minor modifications to accommodate trails, limited vehicular access for service
         purposes, rest stops, enhance natural landscape materials, and similar non-intrusive changes
         to the site. Elementary, middle and high school facilities which contribute acreage to public
         recreation facilities are not reflected in the Open Space category.
Area Plans
The following areas are designated as “Area Plans,” each of which contains a certain degree of
specialized policy direction for the identified areas. Importantly, each Area Plan is not its own
independent land use category. Rather, each Area Plan is comprised of one or more types of land uses
(e.g.., residential, open space, commercial, or other) within the Area Plan’s boundaries, and each Area
Plan’s discussion is intended to supplement the policies for the underlying land use category or
categories in that Area Plan. Where a subject is not covered in a specific Area Plan discussion below,
the policies identified elsewhere in the General Plan apply. To the extent the policies identified in the
Area Plans’ discussion are inconsistent with any other polices in the General Plan, the relevant Area
Plan’s policies shall prevail.
         Community Core/Downtown Historical District Area Plan – The Community Core/Downtown
         Historical Area Plan focuses on an area around Old Towne Yorba Linda. Policies and
         implementation programs within this Area Plan will focus on maintaining compatibility between
         commercial and residential uses and preserving the “main street” character of the area. Within
         the Community Core designation, there are three subareas: Downtown Historical District,
         Community Commercial District, and Core Residential District. These areas are encompassed
         within and surround the Yorba Linda Town Center Specific Plan.
         Within the Community Core/Downtown Historical District Area Plan, there are three subareas
         for which specific policies and implementation measures apply. These subareas are summarized
         as follows:
             1. Downtown Historical District: This area is intended for downtown commercial and office
                  uses as the primary land use focus. Residential uses support the
                  daytime/evening/weekend intent of the area.
             2. Community Commercial District: The Community Commercial District is intended for
                  commercial, office, existing and proposed high density residential, and public uses
                  which are peripheral to the Downtown Historical District. Uses in this area will
                  encompass strip commercial centers, support retail and service uses, the Nixon Library,
                  visitor serving uses, public and quasi-public uses, high density residential, and office
                  uses.

                                                                      Yorba Linda General Plan
           3. Core Residential District: The Core Residential District consists of the Park Avenue/Park
                Place residential neighborhood. The primary use intended for this area is residential at
                densities up to 4 du/ac. Some portions of the Core Residential area may be developed
                at higher densities with adherence to historical theme guidelines. Significant historical
                structures may be required to be preserved for residential uses in this subarea.
       Since the adoption of the 1993 General Plan, development projects have been completed and
       constructed within the Area Plan. In 2011, the City adopted the Town Center Specific Plan,
       which includes parcels in the Downtown Historic District subarea and the Community
       Commercial District subarea. Some remaining capacity for residential development may exist
       within the Area Plan, however the 2016 General Plan does not extend development capacity
       beyond the 1993 General Plan buildout.
       Recommendations:
               Promote enhanced development in the Commercial Core/Downtown Historical District.
               Establish a pedestrian orientation through promotion of concentrated commercial and
                office uses and adoption of streetscape/landscape design guidelines.
               A combination of resident-serving uses and uses that draw activity, which perform well
                fiscally, will be promoted.
               Allow higher density residential uses, including townhomes and other quality attached
                single family products, based on the fiscal analysis, to support daytime, evening, and
                weekend activity to the area.
               Actively pursue lot consolidation opportunities, comprehensive infill development and
                intensification of underutilized parcels to create a cohesive Community Core.
               Establish an advisory theme in conjunction with the design guidelines to enhance the
                pedestrian opportunities and cohesiveness in the area.
               The eligibility of the Downtown Historical District for registry as a Historic District will
                continue to play a role in the establishment of a historic advisory theme.
               Retain specific structures identified as historically significant and target for rehabilitation
                and adaptive reuse on an individual basis in the Historical Downtown and Core
                Residential subareas. Use the identified structures as focal points emphasizing the
                historical theme.
               Require circulation improvements to promote pedestrian circulation and tie the public
                uses to the commercial and residential uses, as well as improve parking availability and
                access into the area.
       Shell Property Area Plan – The Shell Property Area Plan is an area to the northwest border of
       Yorba Linda, generally surrounding the Black Gold Golf Club. Policies and implementation
       programs within the Area Plan focus on open space and recreational uses and varying types of
       residential development. A combination of single-family detached, single-family attached, and
       attached multiple family residential uses is intended to be provided within this designation. This

Yorba Linda General Plan
       Area Plan has the potential capacity of 2,338 dwelling units according to the 1993 General
       Plan. However, since adoption of the 1993 General Plan, the Shell Property has significantly
       changed, with the extensive development of infrastructure, housing, recreational, and other
       neighborhood supporting facilities. A Specific Plan was adopted for the Shell Property area and
       a Development Agreement between the City and the developer was formally executed. Some
       remaining capacity for residential development may exist, however the 2016 General Plan does
       not provide development rights beyond the 1993 General Plan buildout capacity of 2,338
       dwelling units.
       Murdock Property Area Plan– The Murdock Property Area Plan is the 543 acres located at the
       northern border of Yorba Linda, outside of City limits, but within the City’s sphere of influence
       (SOI). The adjacent Open Space parcels are not included in the Area Plan, yet will play an
       important open space opportunity in the development of these properties as a unified,
       comprehensive project. The Area Plan designation for the Murdock Property is envisioned as a
       low density residential development and open space areas. A potential of 536 dwelling units
       are permitted within the Area Plan designation with an average overall density of 1.0 dwelling
       unit per acre. Residential uses will be sited for provision of open space in response to the
       topography of the property. Since adoption of the 1993 General Plan, there are two projects
       currently proposed in the Area Plan – Cielo Vista and Esperanza Hills. Moreover, given that
       these projects require discretionary approval by the County, the Cielo Vista and Esperanza Hills
       developments potentially may not be approved or completed as proposed. While some
       remaining capacity for residential development may exist within this Area Plan, the 2016
       General Plan does not provide development rights beyond the General Plan buildout capacity
       of 536 dwelling units.
       Recommendations:
                Require circulation improvements to San Antonio Road and Via Del Agua .
                Permit residential development at an average of 1.0 dwelling units per acre.
                Incorporate open space, educational facilities, and recreation amenities as needed and
                 to support the community.
       City Hall and Community Center Area Plan – The City Hall and Community Center Area Plan
       focuses on the area that includes Yorba Linda City Hall and Community Center. The Area Plan
       facilitates public or quasi-public uses, recreation, open space, or commercial recreation.

                                                                     Yorba Linda General Plan
Focus Areas
The California Government Code provides that “the General Plan may be adopted as a single
document or as a group of documents relating to subjects or geographic segments of the planning
area”. It is a common practice to focus special attention on selected areas of a community for
customized policy treatment not generally applicable elsewhere in the jurisdiction. In the Yorba Linda
General Plan, these portions of the community are referred to as “Focus Areas”. Some are presently
within the City limits; others are in adjacent unincorporated territory within the City’s Sphere of Influence.
The purpose of this special treatment is to recognize the need for targeted policy establishment where
an area:
         Is experiencing pressures for change and requires immediate guidance;
         Represents a special community resource or opportunity where preservation and/or change
          need encouragement;
         Is characterized by unusual conditions or unique combinations of circumstances not found
          throughout the community;
         Has the potential or need for customized regulatory techniques (specific plan, master plan,
          performance zoning, planned developed zoning, etc.) and therefore requires other than
          conventional policy treatment;
         Consists of an opportunity which must receive high priority in order to avoid its loss;
         Which is appropriately considered to have more than one development option, requiring further,
          more detailed examination in order to identify the optimum maximum direction; or
         Has any combination of these factors.
The areas identified in Exhibit LU-4: Focus Areas Map, are designated as Focus Areas, which are covered
by more specialized policy direction that complements and is consistent with citywide policies. Each
Focus Area includes a broad vision and planning objectives to guide future community-based planning
efforts. It is important to keep in mind that each Focus Area spans multiple parcels of land, and it is not
intended for all objectives to be met on each property. Rather, future community-based planning efforts
would seek to consider each Focus Area comprehensively. The City of Yorba Linda envisions that the
majority of growth and change in the community will occur in these Focus Areas.
“Focus Areas” differ from “Area Plan” land use designations in that Focus Areas provide broad planning
objectives to guide future development and they do not provide entitlement rights. Focus Area
descriptions provide broad policy guidance for future land use changes. Any future change in land use
policy within these Focus Areas would require a future General Plan Amendment.
Some of the Focus Areas may include parcels that are designated as Area Plan. Any policies,
development types, and intensity of development identified for parcels designated as “Area Plan”
supersedes policy objectives identified for the larger Focus Area.

of commercial, retail, and light industrial uses. The area will continue to serve as one of the City’s main
retail and commercial areas serving surrounding residential neighborhoods and residents citywide.
Future objectives and priorities will focus on improvement of existing commercial areas to create strong
retail centers that offer a variety of contemporary retail businesses and services in settings that include
community gathering spaces and attractive landscape and hardscape features. Improvements to the
streetscape and a system of wayfinding signage will contribute to the area’s identity as a community
gateway.

12. Noise Element
Introduction
The Noise Element provides goals and
policies to protect local citizens from the
harmful effects of excessive exposure to
noise. Physical health, psychological
stability, social cohesion, property values,
and economic productivity are factors
affected by excessive amounts of noise.
Noise, as it has been simply defined, is
“unwanted sound,” and is an undesirable
by-product of activities within the
community         that      permeates        the
environment and causes disturbance.
To protect citizens from excessive exposure to noise, the Noise Element examines noise sources in the
City to identify and appraise the potential for noise conflicts and problems. Existing and future noise
environments and the compatibility of land uses are considered in the Element, as well as sensitive
receptors and generators of stationary noise. The Noise Element further identifies ways to reduce existing
and potential noise impacts.
Authority and Scope
The Noise Element recognizes the land use compatibility guidelines established by the State Department
of Health Services. The California Government Code Section 65302(f) requires a General plan include:
          A noise element that shall identify and appraise noise problems in the community. The noise
          element shall analyze and quantify, to the extent practicable, as determined by the legislative
          body, current and projected noise levels for all of the following sources:
              a)  Highways and freeways
              b)  Primary arterials and major local streets.

Existing Setting
Acoustic Fundamentals
Noise is generally defined as sound that is loud, disagreeable, or unexpected. Sound is mechanical
energy transmitted in the form of a wave because of a disturbance or vibration. Sound levels are
described in terms of both amplitude and frequency.
Amplitude
Amplitude is defined as the difference between ambient air pressure and the peak pressure of the sound
wave. Amplitude is measured in decibels (dB) on a logarithmic scale. For example, a 65 dB source of
sound, such as a truck, when joined by another 65 dB source results in a sound amplitude of 68 dB,
not 130 dB (i.e., doubling the source strength increases the sound pressure by 3 dB). Amplitude is
interpreted by the ear as corresponding to different degrees of loudness. Laboratory measurements
correlate a 10 dB increase in amplitude with a perceived doubling of loudness and establish a 3 dB
change in amplitude as the minimum audible difference perceptible to the average person.
Frequency
The frequency of a sound is defined as the number of fluctuations of the pressure wave per second. The
unit of frequency is the Hertz (Hz). One Hz equals one cycle per second. The human ear is not equally
sensitive to sound of different frequencies. For instance, the human ear is more sensitive to sound in the
higher portion of this range than in the lower and sound waves below 16 Hz or above 20,000 Hz
cannot be heard at all. To approximate the sensitivity of the human ear to changes in frequency,
environmental sound is usually measured in what is referred to as “A-weighted decibels” (dBA). On this
scale, the normal range of human hearing extends from about 10 dBA to about 140 dBA.
Human Response to Noise
The human response to environmental noise is subjective and varies considerably from individual to
individual. Noise in the community has often been cited as a health problem, not in terms of actual
physiological damage, such as hearing impairment, but in terms of inhibiting general well-being and
contributing to undue stress and annoyance. The health effects of noise in the community arise from
interference with human activities, including sleep, speech, recreation, and tasks that demand
concentration or coordination. Hearing loss can occur at the highest noise intensity levels. When
community noise interferes with human activities or contributes to stress, public annoyance with the
noise source increases. The acceptability of noise and the threat to public well-being are the basis for
land use planning policies preventing exposure to excessive community noise levels.

Noise Sensitive Land Uses
Noise-sensitive land uses are generally considered to include those uses that would result in noise
exposure that could cause health-related risks to individuals. Places where quiet is essential are also
considered noise-sensitive uses. Residential dwellings are of primary concern because of the potential
for increased and prolonged exposure of individuals to both interior and exterior noise levels. Other
land uses such as libraries, places of worship, and recreation areas are also considered noise-sensitive
land uses.
Noise-sensitive land uses within the City of Yorba Linda consist predominantly of residential land uses.
Other noise-sensitive land uses located within the City of Yorba Linda include schools, places of worship,
and community parks.
Noise Sources
Surface Transportation Sources
Roadway Vehicular Traffic
Noise from vehicular traffic on area roadways is a primarily source of ambient noise in the City. Major
sources of noise include the California State Route 91 (SR-91), Imperial Highway and Yorba Linda
Boulevard.
Railroad Traffic
The BNSF Railroad main line is generally located along the City’s southern boundary. Roughly 60 freight
trains travel along this corridor over a 24-hour period. The number of freight trains and hours of
operation can vary depending on market demands. Approximately 25 Metrolink and two Amtrak trains
also utilize this rail corridor on a daily basis. Approximately 76 percent of passenger train traffic along
this corridor occurs during the daytime hours, between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. As a result, average-
daily noise levels along this rail corridor are largely dominated by freight trains.
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                               Page N-3

Yorba Linda General Plan
Train noise events can be a source of intermittent noise, including noise generated by locomotive
engines, wheel squeal, and warning horns. These instantaneous noise events can contribute to increased
levels of annoyance to occupants of nearby noise-sensitive land uses. To partially mitigate noise
produced by trains on surrounding land uses, a barrier has been constructed along the Esperanza Road,
between Yorba Linda Boulevard at the eastern extent to the City’s western boundary near Echo Hill Lane.
However, the proposed Fairlynn County Island and East Gateway Focus areas are largely unshielded
from train noise.
Aircraft Overflights
There are no airports or airfields located within the City. The nearest airports include the City of
Fullerton’s Municipal Airport, located roughly 7 miles to the west, the LA/Ontario International Airport
located roughly 12 miles to the northeast, and the El Monte Airport located approximately 16 miles to
the northwest. The Riverside Municipal Airport is located roughly 17 miles to the east. However, although
no airports or airfields are located in the City, noise generated by aircraft overflights may be noticeable,
particularly during the quieter nighttime hours. In addition, helicopter overflights may also contribute to
intermittent increases in ambient noise levels. Intermittent noise events associated with aircraft overflight
may result in increases in annoyance and potential sleep disruption to occupants of nearby residential
dwellings.
Stationary Sources
From a land-use planning perspective, stationary-source noise control issues focus on two goals: (1)
preventing the introduction of new noise-producing uses in noise-sensitive areas; and (2) preventing
encroachment of noise-sensitive uses upon existing noise-producing facilities. The first goal can be
achieved by applying noise performance standards to proposed new noise producing uses. The second
goal can be met by requiring that new noise-sensitive uses near noise-producing facilities include
mitigation measures to ensure compliance with noise performance standards. Each of these goals
stresses the importance of avoiding the location of new uses that may be incompatible with adjoining
uses.
Within the City of Yorba Linda, non-transportation noise sources are predominantly associated with
commercial and light industrial activities. Depending on the type of operation, noise sources associated
with commercial and industrial activities may include mechanical equipment, loading and unloading of
vehicles and trucks, as well as amplified or unamplified communications. To a lesser extent, stationary
sources of noise may also include common building or home mechanical equipment, such as air
conditioners, ventilation systems, or pool pumps. These noise sources can be continuous or intermittent
and may contain tonal components that are annoying to individuals who live nearby. Noise generated
by stationary sources are often directional and can vary depending on various factors, including site
conditions, distance from source, shielding provided by intervening terrain and structures, and ground
attenuation rates.

Construction Activities
Construction noise typically occurs intermittently and varies depending upon the nature or phase (e.g.,
demolition/land clearing, grading and excavation, erection) of construction. Noise generated by
construction equipment, including pile drivers, material handling equipment, pavers, jackhammers, and
portable generators, can result in intermittent and prolonged increases in ambient noise levels. Although
construction noise impacts are generally short-term, they can result in increased levels of annoyance to
occupants of nearby residential dwellings. Noise-generating construction activities are currently
regulated through implementation of the City’s Noise Control ordinance, which generally limits these
activities to the less noise-sensitive daytime hours.
Related Plans and Programs
Federal
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
In 1974, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Noise Abatement and Control
published a report entitled Information on Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public
Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety. Although this document does not constitute
EPA regulations or standards, it is useful in identifying noise levels at which increased levels of
annoyance would be anticipated. Based on an annual-average day-night noise level (expressed as Ldn
or DNL), the document states that “undue interference with activity and annoyance” will not occur if
outdoor noise levels in residential areas are below 55 dBA Ldn and indoor levels are below 45 dBA Ldn
(EPA 1974).
Department of Housing and Urban Development
The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) guidelines for the acceptability of
residential land uses are set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 24, Part 51, “Environmental
Criteria and Standards.” These guidelines identify a noise exposure of 65 dBA Ldn, or less, as
acceptable. Exterior noise levels of 65 to 75 dBA Ldn are considered normally acceptable, provided
appropriate sound attenuation is provided to reduce interior noise levels to within acceptable levels.
Exterior noise levels above 75 dBA Ldn are considered unacceptable. The goal of the interior noise
levels for residential, hotel, and hospital/nursing home uses is 45 dBA Ldn. These guidelines apply only
to new construction supported by HUD grants and are not binding upon local communities.
State
California Building Code
Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations contains standards for allowable interior noise levels
associated with exterior noise sources (California Building Code, 1998 edition, Volume 1, Appendix
Chapter 12, Section 1208A). The standards apply to new hotels, motels, dormitories, apartment houses,

and dwellings other than detached single-family residences. The standards state that the interior noise
level attributable to exterior sources shall not exceed 45 dBA CNEL in any habitable room. Proposed
multi-family residential structures to be located where the CNEL exceeds 60 dBA shall require an
acoustical analysis showing that the proposed building design would achieve the prescribed allowable
interior noise standard.

                                                               provides guidance for the acceptability of
                                                               projects within specific noise environments.
                                                               Based on these guidelines, residential uses,
                                                               churches, libraries, and hospitals are
                                                               “normally unacceptable” in areas where
                                                               the exterior noise level exceeds 70 dBA
CNEL and “conditionally acceptable” within exterior noise environments between 60 and 70 dBA CNEL.
Noise levels of up to 60 dBA CNEL are considered “normally acceptable”. The goal of these noise
standards is, in part, to allow for a “normally acceptable” interior noise level of 45 dBA CNEL. For
instance, assuming an average exterior-to-interior noise reduction of 15 dBA (with windows partially
open), an exterior noise level of 60 dBA CNEL, or less, would be sufficient to achieve an interior noise
level of 45 dBA CNEL. Higher exterior noise levels may be allowed provided that noise-reduction
measures are incorporated to achieve acceptable interior noise levels. Within “conditionally acceptable”
exterior noise environments, conventional construction with incorporation of fresh air circulation systems
sufficient to allow windows to remain closed would normally suffice. Compliance with current building
code requirements and with windows closed, exterior-to-interior noise reductions typically average
approximately 25 dBA or more. However, the state stresses that these guidelines can be modified to
reflect communities’ sensitivities to noise. Adjustment factors may also be used in order to arrive at noise
acceptability standards that reflect the noise control goals of the community, the particular community’s
sensitivity to noise, and the community’s assessment of the relative importance of noise pollution. The
State recommended noise criteria for land use compatibility are summarized in following Criteria for
Noise-Compatible Land Use table summarizes the suggested use of the CNEL/Ldn metrics for evaluating
land use noise compatibility as outlined in the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research General
Plan Guidelines.

City of Yorba Linda General Plan Noise Element
The existing Noise Element of the City of Yorba Linda General Plan (1993) includes noise standards
intended to ensure compatibility of proposed land uses within exterior noise environments and that noise
levels at adjacent land uses do not exceed acceptable levels. These standards are also designed to
protect existing land uses, including transportation and industry, from encroaching urban uses.
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                                  Page N-9

City of Yorba Linda Municipal Code
The City of Yorba Linda Municipal Code (Title 8, Health & Safety, Chapter 8.32, Noise Control) includes
various provisions intended to protect community residents from prolonged unnecessary, excessive, and
annoying sound levels that are detrimental to the public health, welfare, and safety, or are contrary to
the public interest. Examples of noise sources subject to the City’s municipal Code include, but are not
limited to, industrial and commercial machinery and equipment, pumps, fans, compressors, generators,
air conditioners and refrigeration equipment. Section 8.32.060 of the City’s noise ordinance establishes
exterior noise standards for noise-sensitive land uses, which include residential areas, hospitals, schools,
and churches. These exterior noise standards are summarized in the following Table N-1: Municipal
Code Exterior Noise Standards. In addition, Section 8.32.070 establishes interior noise standards for
residential uses, which are summarized in Table N-2: Municipal Code Interior Noise Standards for
Residential Uses.

               The following exterior standards shall not exceed:
               1.The noise standard for a cumulative period of more than thirty minutes in any hour;
               2.The noise standard plus five dB(A) for a cumulative period of more than fifteen minutes in any hour;
               3.The noise standard plus ten dB(A) for a cumulative period of more than five minutes in any hour;
               4.The noise standard plus fifteen dB(A) for a cumulative period of more than one minute in any hour; or
               5.The noise standard plus twenty dB(A) for any period of time.
               In the event the ambient noise level exceeds any of the five noise limit categories stated in subsection B
               of this section, the cumulative
               period applicable to said category shall be increased to reflect said ambient noise level. Furthermore,
               the maximum permissible noise level
               shall never exceed the maximum ambient noise level.
               Each of the noise limits specified in this section shall be reduced by five dB(A) for impact or simple tone
               noises or for noises consisting of
               speech or music.

8. Open Space and Recreation Element
Introduction
The Open Space and Recreation Element
provides policies and programs to
enhance the overall quality of life in Yorba
Linda and direct the management and
protection of open space land in the City.
The Open Space and Recreation Element
provides guidance for the acquisition,
maintenance, and development of parks,
trails, and recreational facilities and
programs throughout the City.
The Open Space and Recreation Element
provides policies and programs to protect, maintain, and enhance the City’s open space land for the
betterment of current residents and future generations. The City of Yorba Linda is strongly committed to
the continued development and programming of park facilities, trails, and recreation programs to meet
the needs of the community and uphold the community’s quality of life. This Element allows the City to
continue to plan, develop, maintain, and provide quality active and passive park facilities, trails, and
recreational programs to ensure that residents and visitors can enhance health and well-being through
outdoor experiences.
Authority and Scope
California Government Code Section 65302(e) requires that a General Plan include an Open Space
Element. Section 65560(b)(3) requires that the General Plan address “ . . . Open space for outdoor
recreation, including but not limited to, areas of outstanding scenic, historical and cultural value; areas
particularly suited for park and recreation purposes, including access to lakes, shores, beaches, and
rivers and streams; and areas which serve as links between major recreation and open space
reservations, including utility easements, banks of rivers and streams, trails, and scenic highway
corridors . . .”
Recreation Elements are an optional element of the General Plan, pursuant to Section 65303 of the
Government Code. Other relevant sections of the Government Code that are applicable to the Open
Space and Recreation Element include Sections 65560, 65562, 65563, 65564, 65566, and 65567,
as well as Public Resources Code Section 5076, which allows cities to consider the demands for trail-
oriented recreational use. In addition, Government Code Section 66477, more commonly referred to
as the Quimby Act, allows cities to adopt ordinances addressing dedication of park land and/or
payment of fees in conjunction with approval of new residential subdivisions.
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                              Page OR-1

Yorba Linda General Plan
The Open Space and Recreation Element must contain goals and policies concerning the management
and enhancement of all open space and recreation facilities. The Open Space and Recreation Element
identifies those undeveloped lands that contain open space for the preservation of natural resources,
open space for the managed production of resources, and open space for public health and safety.
Background
The residents of Yorba Linda value open
space as a resource that contributes
significantly to community character and
quality of life. Open space provides a
multitude of functions that are beneficial to
the community, including the provision of
recreation areas; protection of viewsheds;
preservation      of    natural    resources;
avoidance of development in hazardous
areas; and the establishment of buffers
between incompatible land uses. Open
space is one of the key features defining
the character and form of the City.
Parks and Recreational Facilities
Existing recreational facilities and trails within the Yorba Linda planning area are categorized into a
local classification system in the City’s Parks and Recreation Master Plan. Each of these classifications
is based on standards derived specifically to suit the City’s aspiration to maintain a balance of recreation
facilities and trails throughout the community. The classifications and parks and recreation facilities
include:
Mini-Park Standards – A mini-park typically contains less than 2.5 acres of land. Mini-parks, also termed
“vest pocket” parks, contain specialized facilities that serve a concentrated or limited population or
specific group such as tots or senior citizens. The service radius is sub-neighborhood, at approximately
one-quarter mile maximum. Desirable site characteristics include location within neighborhoods in close
proximity to housing developments or senior housing. Limited equipment is provided at these locations,
such as tot lot play equipment, benches and picnic areas.
Neighborhood Park Standards – A neighborhood park is any general use local park developed to serve
the needs of a particular neighborhood within a community. The size of the park depends on the
population within its service area and the extent of desired amenities, but usually ranges from 2.5 to
5.0 acres. Typical neighborhood parks may be within walking or bicycling distance of park users with a
service radius of approximately 1/2 mile. These parks may feature such amenities as children’s play
areas, ball fields, and open turf areas.

                                                                      Yorba Linda General Plan
Community Park Standards – A community
park is typically a 5.0 to 20.0+ acre site
designed to meet the active recreational
needs of several neighborhoods. These
parks are intended to serve drive-to
clientele within a radius of up to three
miles. They contain facilities which require
more space than neighborhood parks and
which may include playfields, basketball
courts, tennis courts, swimming pools,
community centers and off-street parking.
Greenbelt/Passive Park Standards – Greenbelt parks include landscaped greenbelts areas, parkways,
trail easements, and landscape buffers, with a minimum of active recreation equipment. Activities are
limited to passive recreation, such as picnicking. Greenbelt parks range in size from 1/2 acre to 3 acres.
Yorba Linda’s current parkland is summarized in Table OR-1: Existing Parkland. The locations of parks
and recreational facilities are illustrated in Exhibit OR-1: Parks and Recreational Facilities.

Yorba Linda Trails
Yorba Linda has 30 multi-use trails, both paved
and earthen, which are over 100 miles (160 km)
in aggregate length. The Santa Ana River Trail
runs along the Santa Ana River and provides a
regional bicycle connection to areas east and
west of the City. The City of Yorba Linda Master
Plan of Trails establishes a coordinated system of
riding and hiking trails and bikeways including
connections to Chino Hills State Park. The last
update to the riding, hiking, and bikeway trails
component (also known as the Master Plan of
Trails) was complete in 2005 and is illustrated in
Exhibit OR-2: Trails. The standards for the various types of trails located in Yorba Linda are described
below:
Earthen Multipurpose Trails – Soft surfaces intended for use by equestrians, hikers, joggers, and some
mountain bicyclists where appropriate.
Paved Multipurpose Trails – Trails for multiple users (hikers, joggers, equestrians, bicyclists) that do not
necessarily meet Class I bikeway standards because of varying widths and surfaces.
Paved Trails (Class I Bikeway) – Paved paths intended primarily for use by bicyclists, pedestrians, those
in wheelchairs and those with strollers.
Bike Lanes (Class II Bikeway) – Striped, stenciled and signed lanes on streets or highways for the use of
bicycles.
Bike Routes (Class III Bikeway) – Signed routes along streets or highways where bicycles share travel
lanes with motor vehicles.

Civic Center
Yorba Linda’s Civic Center is easily accessible to the community, located between Imperial Highway
and Yorba Linda Boulevard. The Civic Center is a community meeting place which includes City Hall,
the Yorba Linda Community Center, Hurless Barton Park, Veterans Park, and the Yorba Linda Middle
School. The Yorba Linda Library and the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum are located
within close proximity to the Civic Center.
Equestrian Facilities
Yorba Linda has a rich equestrian tradition stemming from the days when ranches and agriculture were
the main land uses in the area. Over the years, the City has developed into residential neighborhoods
and commercial centers, much like the rest of Orange County. City leaders took great pride during the
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                               Page OR-11

Yorba Linda General Plan
development process to preserve the equestrian and semi-rural lifestyles and environment in Yorba
Linda.
The Yorba Linda planning area currently has over 100 miles of equestrian access trails and the City has
a dedicated area known as the Phillip S. Paxton Equestrian Center where equestrian clubs offer lessons,
training, shows and events for the local equestrian community. The City also maintains equestrian
arenas within the park site for unreserved use by local horse owners. Yorba Linda also contains
numerous residential equestrian properties with horse boarding amenities.
Recreational Programs
The Yorba Linda Parks and Recreation
Department operates parks and recreation
facilities that provide the opportunity for
leisure activities for about 65,000
residents. The City maintains an extensive
schedule of recreational programs and
activities for all ages and segments of the
community at various locations throughout
Yorba Linda. These locations include City,
school, and private facilities.
Yorba Linda’s Parks and Recreation Department provides adult and youth programs, adventure
playground, aquatics, and tennis programs. Residents have the ability to register on-line or in-person
for programing. Additionally, the City provides senior programs and services for adults who are 55 years
and older that includes a wide variety of activities, classes and trips offered at the Yorba Linda Senior/
Community Center.
To provide extensive recreational programs for residents, the City works with community groups and
private businesses to develop recreational programs. This includes the summer concert series and family
movies in the park. Yorba Linda also provides facilities for use by private recreation providers such as
Little League and Pop Warner Football. The City is committed to providing outstanding facilities for its
youth.
Regional Facilities
Regional Parks are defined as large open spaces of approximately 100 acres or more providing facilities
which attract visitors from a broad geographic area and are located within a convenient traveling
distance. Regional recreation facilities are an important resource for the City’s residents, because they
provide supplemental recreational opportunities that may not be offered by the City. Regional park
facilities offer additional amenities such as hiking trails fishing, boating, and swimming. As shown in
Table OR-3: Regional Facilities, there are three parks within Yorba Linda’s planning area classified as
regional facilities, along with Chino Hills State Park, which is accessible from the City.

Yorba Regional Park – Yorba Regional Park, once a part of the expansive cattle ranch of Bernardo
Yorba, is located between the Santa Ana River and La Palma Avenue, east of Imperial Highway, in the
City of Anaheim. The 106-acre park is a linear day use park over one-mile-long and recaptures the
river setting of the adjacent Santa Ana River. Yorba Regional Park provides an abundance of family and
group picnicking facilities with more than 400 picnic tables, many with permanent shade structures. A
series of four lakes with connecting streams provides opportunities for fishing and model boat sailing.
The park includes bicycle trails connecting to the Santa Ana River Trails as well as playground and
restroom facilities throughout. Additionally, the park has group shelters, volleyball courts, horseshoe
puts, two ball diamonds, a physical fitness course and some 200 barbecues. Yorba Regional Park is
part of the OC Parks system.
Carbon Canyon Regional Park – The 124-acre Carbon Canyon Regional Park is located upstream of
the Carbon Canyon Dam in a protected valley northwest of the City of Yorba Linda in the City of Brea.
Sixty acres of the park are developed with grassy areas for picnicking, sports facilities including
backstops and lighted tennis courts, and a 4-acre lake with piers for fishing. The undeveloped portion
of the park has a trail that leads to Orange County’s only grove of redwoods. Carbon Canyon Regional
Park is part of the OC Parks system.
Featherly Regional Park – Located in the City of Yorba Linda, Featherly Regional Park provides 364
acres of mostly natural riparian wilderness area. The park is located in Santa Ana Canyon and public
access is restricted. The only developed portion of the park is Canyon R.V. Park, a privately-operated
facility. The Canyon R.V. Park offers RV sites with full hook-ups, small cabins, youth group camping and
areas for group events.
Chino Hills State Park – Chino Hills State Park is located directly to the north and east of Yorba Linda.
There are multiple access points from the City: Quarter Horse Staging Area located at Quarter Horse
Drive and Winners Circle; Casino Ridge Staging Area located at Casino Ridge Road; Rim Road off
Condor Ridge Road; and Rimcrest Drive off Fairmont Boulevard. Chino Hills State Park encompasses
stands of oaks, sycamores, and rolling, grassy hills that stretch nearly 31 miles, from the Santa Ana
Mountains to the Whittier Hills. Chino Hills State Park provides overnight campsite facilities, RV access,
hiking and horseback riding trails, and picnic areas. The park also features the Chino Hills State Park
Discovery Center and multiple interpretive exhibits throughout the area. The park provides ideal nature
and wildlife viewing and is considered a critical link in the Puente-Chino Hills biological corridor.1

Parkland Standards
In January 2014, the Yorba Linda City Council revised the City’s Park Dedication and Park In-Lieu Fee
Ordinance. The policy amendments included the following:
         Increasing the amount of parkland dedication and in-lieu fee requirements from two acres to
          three acres per 1,000 residents.
         Removal of previously allowed credit of up to 50% of any required in-lieu fees where the
          proposed development provided private open space for park and recreation purposes.
         Adding a Section to the Municipal Code consistent with recent changes in State law (AB 1359)
          allowing the City to use Quimby Act fees outside the neighborhood of the development from
          which the fees were collected.
In addition to Quimby Act requirements, the Yorba Linda Parks and Recreation Master Plan (PRMP)
recommends a local neighborhood and community parkland standard of four acres per 1,000 residents
(which includes joint use of property pursuant to agreement with other agencies such as the school
district). The PRMP also strives to have one acre of mini-park/greenbelt parkland per 1,000 residents;
and ten acres of regional parkland per 1,000 residents. When combined (mini, local, neighborhood,
and regional), the Yorba Linda PRMP’s recommended parkland standard is 15 acres of parkland per
1,000 residents.
Overall, the City exceeds the recommended combined parkland standard of 15 acres per 1,000
residents, but only because of the proximity of three regional parks, the use of school fields and
recreation facilities covered by joint-use agreements, and the 219-acre Black Gold Golf Club. The
Yorba Linda PRMP determined that the City has a deficit of 101.2 acres of local parkland per the master
plan’s recommended requirement of four acres per 1,000 residents. This deficit figure is derived as
follows:
Current total local city parkland acreage equals: 158.8 acres
 Page OR-14                                                                          Adopted Oct 2016

                                                                    Yorba Linda General Plan
A total local city parkland standard of 4 acres per 1,000 residents would require a total of 260 acres
(4 acres x 65,000 residents/1,000 = 260 acres) to meet the standard.
The local city parkland deficit is 101.2 acres to meet the recommended standard (260 acres minus
158.85 acres).
The Yorba Linda PRMP states that if the City wishes to follow the recommended local parkland standard
of four acres per 1,000 residents instead of the current policy of three acres per 1,000 residents then it
should consider acquiring at least an additional 68.9 acres of local City parkland in order to accomplish
this goal.
The Yorba Linda PRMP includes the following strategies and recommendations for parkland
acquisition:
        The City’s current standard is to require a minimum of 3 acres to be dedicated or the
         corresponding in-lieu payment per the Quimby Act which was accomplished by amending the
         General Plan and the Park Dedication and In-Lieu Fee Ordinance to require the dedication of
         3 acres per 1,000 persons. The City amended and adopted the Park Dedication and In-Lieu
         Fee Ordinance most recently in January 2014. Park acquisition efforts, along with Park
         Dedication/In-Lieu Fee requirements, should concentrate on local neighborhood and
         community parks where the largest deficits exist. The City should ensure that future residential
         developments are required to dedicate a minimum of 3 acres per one thousand residents, which
         is the Quimby Act standard for these types of parks (i.e. neighborhood and community parks).
        Acquire or obtain parkland in underserved areas of the City. The City should seek to acquire
         through parkland, open space, and trail dedication requirements; lease and extended long term
         lease agreements, joint use agreements; and easements of balance of mini parks,
         neighborhood parks, community parks, passive open space, special use parks, and trails in
         underserved areas of the City based on equity maps in the Park and Recreation Master Plan by
         working with the residential developers, Placentia- Yorba Linda Unified School District, private
         schools and churches, non-profit agencies and organizations, commercial developers, and the
         County of Orange to meet the adopted parkland standards for Yorba Linda.
In November 2013, the City Council approved an update to the in-lieu fee amount imposed on the
development of new residential subdivisions parks and recreation purposes under the Quimby Act. This
fee increase was based upon a City-commissioned land appraisal establishing the current fair market
value for vacant residential property in the City. At the same time that the City approved the fee update,
it also directed staff to bring back an ordinance increasing the acreage variable of the Quimby Fee
equation, so that developers would be required to provide three acres per 1,000 population, as
specifically authorized by the Quimby Act, instead of the previously required two acres.
Adopted Oct 2016                                                                             Page OR-15

Related Plans and Programs
There are a number of land use documents which have been adopted which bear a relationship to the
General Plan. Relevant plans and documents are listed as follows:
Parks and Recreation Master Plan
The updated Yorba Linda Parks and
Recreation Master Plan was adopted in
August 2014. The Master Plan provides
direction to continue the orderly and
consistent       planning,     acquisition,
development, and administration of the
parks and recreation programming in
Yorba Linda. The Master Plan guides the
City’s decision making with regard to
overall policy and provides an inventory
and assessment of recreation programs
and service offerings, operations, maintenance, and capital improvements to be made over the next
twenty years that will enhance the quality of life in Yorba Linda. The goals, programs, and strategies
identified in the Parks and Recreation Master Plan are incorporated into the General Plan Update.
Regional Plans and Initiatives
         County of Orange Recreation Element – The County of Orange Recreation Element contains
         official policies pertaining to the acquisition, development, operation, maintenance, and
         financing of the County’s recreation facilities, which include regional recreation facilities, local
         parks, and riding and hiking trails. The Recreation Element primarily focuses on the
         unincorporated areas in Orange County. The City of Yorba Linda’s sphere of influence includes
         unincorporated County lands.

       of the functions of the NPDES program is to issue permits for stormwater discharges from
       municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) entering the waters of the United States. The
       County of Orange has prepared a Drainage Area Master Plan (DAMP) to comply with the
       NPDES permit requirements for Orange County. The DAMP identifies the stormwater
       management practices, control techniques, system design and engineering methods to be
       implemented to protect beneficial uses of receiving water to the maximum extent practicable.
       Each permittee city implements programs of the DAMP through its Local Implementation
       Program.
       The City, as an Orange County permittee, has developed its Local Implementation Plan, the
       Yorba Linda Stormwater Program, to manage stormwater runoff and water quality protection
       practices. The purpose of the stormwater management program is to ensure that new
       development incorporates measures, to the maximum extent practicable, to reduce the quantity
       of storm flow and the discharge pollutants in the urban/stormwater runoff to protect water
       quality, biological habitats, and recreational uses of downstream receiving waters. The General
       Plan incorporates policies and programs to support the stormwater management and water
       quality protection requirements and practices in the Yorba Linda Stormwater Program.

10. Public Health and Safety Element
Introduction
The Public Health and Safety Element provides
policy guidance for the provision of quality public
safety services needed to serve the existing and
expected future population in Yorba Linda. The
Public Health and Safety Element identifies
natural and man-made hazards which have the
potential to impact the population, property, and
the natural environment.
Through the investigation of hazard risks, and
careful land use planning to reduce or restrict
development in high risk areas, the potential for disaster can be reduced. The Public Health and Safety
Element seeks to sustain and improve the City’s commitment to safety through proactive and
comprehensive police, fire, building, and code enforcement services that encourage community
outreach and education, maintain local agency partnerships, promote prevention, and enhance the
technical, logistical, and technological systems to prepare for and respond to public safety needs.
Authority and Scope
The State of California Government Code Section 65302(g) requires that a General Plan include “a
safety element for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risk associated with the effects
of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure;
slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence, liquefaction; and other seismic hazards
identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8 (commencing with Section 2690) of Division 2 of the Public Resources
Code, and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and wildland and urban
fires.”
The State of California Government Code Section 8876 requires that the Safety Element discuss
hazardous buildings due to Yorba Linda’s location within a seismically active region and potential for
structures which were built prior to uniform building code restrictions (pre 1930).
Background
Geologic events, seismic activity in particular, are the primary natural hazards to the residents and
property of Yorba Linda.

Seismic Hazards
Earthquake Faults
There are several large active faults in the Southern California region that could potentially impact the
City of Yorba Linda including the San Joaquin Hills Thrust Fault, the Newport-Inglewood Fault, the San
Andreas Fault, the Peralta Hills Fault and the Whittier-Elsinore Fault. The San Andreas Fault system
distributes shearing across a complex system of primarily northwest-trending faults. The Whittier-Elsinore
Fault cuts along the base of the southwestern slopes of the Puente and Chino hills.1 Table PS-1: Existing
Faults, below shows the significant faults and potential earthquake effects in the areas surrounding
Yorba Linda.

Notes:
1. Active faults are known to have surface displacements within Holocene times (past 11,000 years). Potentially active faults
have evidence of surface faulting within Quaternary time (past 2-3 million years).
2. Maximum magnitude based on estimated rupture length and empirical relationships between historical rupture and
earthquake magnitude.
The Whittier Fault is believed to be the main spur from the larger Elsinore Fault which follows a general
line easterly of the Santa Ana Mountains into Mexico. Accordingly, the surface fault rupture hazard in
Yorba Linda is high within the boundaries of this zone. The Whittier fault extends over 20 miles from the
Whittier Narrows near Whittier, southeast to the Santa Ana River, where it merges with the southeasterly
trending Elsinore fault. Collectively, these two faults combined with smaller faults are known as the
Whittier-Elsinore Fault Zone. The Whittier-Elsinore Fault Zone traverses the Planning Area in a generally
northwest to southeast direction. Exhibit PS-1: Whittier-Elsinore Fault, shows the locations of these nearby
faults that could potentially impact the planning area.

Surface Rupture and Ground Shaking
As discussed above, there are several active and potentially active faults in the vicinity of Yorba Linda
which make the risk of structural damage and loss of life due to ground shaking considerable. According
to the County of Orange Safety Element, portions of the City of Yorba Linda could experience “intensities
of VI” (according to the Modified Mercalli Scale) in the event of a maximum credible earthquake on the
San Andreas or Newport-Inglewood faults. Intensity, which differs from magnitude, refers to the
perceived strength of an earthquake as it affects local residents and construction. Intensity depends on
magnitude, distance from the epicenter, acceleration, period duration and amplitude of seismic waves,
type of ground, water table, type and quality of construction, and the natural fundamental period of
structures and their foundations. Intensity scales are a measure of perceived impact based on interviews
and observations. Table PS-2: Richter and Modified Mercalli Scale Comparison, describes the Modified
Mercalli Scale for Earthquake Intensities.

Liquefaction
Liquefaction-induced ground failure has historically been a major cause of earthquake damage in
Southern California. Localities most susceptible to liquefaction-induced damage are underlain by loose,
water-saturated, granular sediment within 50 feet of the ground surface. These geological and ground-
water conditions exist in parts of Yorba Linda. In addition, the potential for strong earthquake ground
shaking is high because of the nearby active faults. The combination of these factors constitute a
significant seismic hazard in areas of Yorba Linda.2 Areas that are prone to liquefaction due to
geological and ground-water conditions are located within liquefaction zones. In Yorba Linda, the
liquefaction zone is located primarily within a mile of the Santa Ana River.3 Exhibit PS-2: Liquefaction
Zones, shows the portions of the planning area that are located with the liquefaction zone.

Hazardous Buildings
One of the major threats to public safety in an earthquake is the damage that the earthquake causes
to structures that house people and/or essential civil functions. Continuing advances in engineering
design and building code standards over the past decade have greatly reduced the potential for collapse
in most new construction during an earthquake. However, many structures in the City of Yorba Linda
were built before earthquake design standards were incorporated into building codes. The following
specific building types are of particular concern in this regard:
Unreinforced Masonry Structures – Following the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, seismic requirements
were added to local building codes for the first time, and the Field Act of 1934 instituted statewide
standards which applied to existing unreinforced masonry structures. These structures are still recognized
as the most hazardous type of structure in an earthquake. Because of the development that occurred in
Yorba Linda during the 1930s, unreinforced masonry buildings potentially may still exist within the City.
Most of the development that took place in the 1930s is concentrated in the downtown area.
Senate Bill 547 requires local jurisdictions to enact structural hazard reduction programs by (a)
inventorying pre-1934 unreinforced masonry structure, and (b) developing mitigation programs for
structural hazards.
Soft-Story Buildings – Soft-story buildings are structures that have at least one story (commonly the
ground floor) which has significantly less rigidity and/or strength than the rest of the structure. This can
form a weak link in the structure, unless special design features are incorporated to give the building
adequate structural integrity. Typical examples of soft-story construction are buildings with glass curtain
walls on the first floor only, or buildings placed on stilts or columns, leaving the first story open for
landscaping, street-friendly building entry, parking, or other purposes. In the early 1950s to early 1970s,
soft-story structures were a popular construction style for low- and mid-rise concrete frame structures.
Landslide Hazards
Landslides triggered by earthquakes have been a significant cause of earthquake damage. Areas that
are most susceptible to earthquake-induced landslides are steep slopes in poorly cemented or highly
fractured rocks, areas underlain by loose, weak soils, and areas on or adjacent to existing landslide
deposits.4
Slope stability is a serious geologic problem in the northern and northeastern parts of the City of Yorba
Linda. Exhibit PS-3: Landslide Zones, shows the portions of the planning area that are at risk of landslides
due to geological conditions. This area is underlain by siltstone and interbedded sandstone of the Puente
Formation and is often prone to landslides and other forms of slope failure. Along Telegraph Canyon
and other east-west trending canyons, landslides are more common than on south-facing slopes which

are typically underlain by thick soil and slope wash. Soil creep and shallow slope failures also occur
more on the east-west trending slopes. Conditions which contribute to the slope failures are evident in
the Chino Hills area, particularly in areas of well-bedded siltstone and sandstone within the Puente
Formation. The Puente Formation underlies the Puente and Chino hills and is comprised of four
members: the Sycamore Canyon, Yorba, Soquel, and La Vida members.5 Rockfalls and rockslides are
also identified as a hazard where resistant, thick-bedded or massive sandstone is exposed on steep,
high-slopes such as in areas underlain by the Soquel Member of the Puente Formation.

Drainage and Flood Hazards
Flooding
Historic flooding in Orange County has occurred
largely along the Santa Ana River. Flood flows
have been documented since 1825. The greatest
flood in the history of California occurred in
1862 when it was estimated that the flow in the
Santa Ana River was 315,000 cubic feet per
second (cfs), more than three times larger than
any subsequently measured flow. The history of
flooding along the Santa Ana River has been the
impetus behind the Santa Ana River Mainstream
Project which is designed to provide flood
protection to communities in Orange, Riverside,
and San Bernardino Counties. The project will increase levels of flood protection for more than 3.35
million people and include the Seven Oaks Dam, Mill Creek Levee, San Timoteo Creek, Oak Street
Drain, Prado Dam, Santiago Creek, and the Lower Santa Ana River.6
The City of Yorba Linda has within its boundaries a number of identified 100-year floodplains. A 100-
year floodplain is defined as an area that has a one percent or greater chance of experiencing a flood
inundation in any given year. The floodplain areas in Yorba Linda have been established by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and are shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMS). Exhibit
PS-4: Flood Hazards, shows the floodplain areas designated by FIRMS that are located within the
planning area.
The designated floodplain within the boundaries of the City of Yorba Linda can be broken into two
categories – tributaries to the Santa Ana River and the Santa Ana River. The Santa Ana River floodplain
in Yorba Linda extends approximately four miles along the southern border of the City and encompasses
approximately 690 acres. The floodplains that are tributaries to the river generally follow the area
topography that flows roughly south to southwest. Some of these designated areas have been improved
to contain floodwaters, but many are in an unimproved state.
The Yorba Linda Municipal Code, Chapter 15.12 Flood Damage Protection, helps to minimize public
and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. Flood hazard areas in the City of Yorba
Linda are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, and disruption of commerce and governmental services. Special flood hazard areas are

Dam Inundation
Prado Dam and Reservoir, completed by the Corps of Engineers in 1941, are intended to provide flood
protection to the Lower Santa Ana River, including the City of Yorba Linda. The earthen dam and its
reservoir were deigned to control floods of magnitudes that could be reasonably expected to occur
under anticipated future development of the watershed (typically a 200-year flood). Since the Prado
Dam was built, changes have occurred in the drainage area. Historical data on rainfall and runoff,
coupled with advances in predicting future flood potential, have shown Prado Dam offers only 70-year
flood protection. A serious concern is that the existing Prado Dam and spillway could not accommodate
a probable maximum flood, resulting in overtopping of the dam.7
According to the County of Orange Safety Element, portions of southern Yorba Linda along the Santa
Ana River are located within the Prado Dam Inundation Area that could potentially be impacted by
flooding from Prado Dam, as shown in Exhibit PS-5: Dam Inundation Areas.

Fire Hazards
The City of Yorba Linda is subject to wildfires due to the City’s geographical location, steep terrain,
highly flammable chaparral vegetation, and the Santa Ana winds that occur during seasonal dry periods.
Major fires have threatened the City in the past. Fire hazards are typically greatest in the late summer
and early fall when vegetation is dry. Early fall is also when the warm dry Santa Ana winds blow from
the north and northeast.
The Santa Ana Canyon, which begins to the east of Yorba Linda, has an extensive wildland fire history.
The canyon’s geographical location plays a major role in directing wildland fire into Orange County.
Since 1980, the Santa Ana Canyon area has experienced 25 separate wildland fires, burning a total of
82,734 acres with the events ranging from one to more than 30,000 acres. Table PS-3: Significant
Wildfires in Yorba Linda, below lists the most notable and devastating fire events that have impacted
Yorba Linda since 1980.

The 2008 Freeway Complex Fire was one of the largest wildland fires in Orange County history. The
fire consumed over 30,000 acres, impacted six cities in four counties, and destroyed over 381 homes,
commercial structures and out-buildings. The fire started in the City of Corona and was swiftly spread
by the Santa Ana winds, causing widespread damage in the cities of Yorba Linda, Anaheim, and
Corona, as well as to the Chino Hills State Park. The estimated cost for fighting the Freeway Complex
Fire was approximately $16.1 million.8
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) identifies Fire Hazard Severity
Zones (FHSZ) and shares that information with local agencies. CAL FIRE map areas of FHSZ within
Local Responsibility Areas (LRAs) and State Responsibility Areas (SRAs). Wildland fire protection in the
State is the responsibility of either the local government, the State, or the federal government. LRAs
include incorporated cities with service provided by municipal fire departments or fire protection districts.

Yorba Linda General Plan
SRAs include areas of California in which the responsibility of preventing and stopping fires is the
responsibility of the State.
Elements that are considered in determining the FHSZ include:
         Vegetation- Vegetation is “fuel” to a wildfire and fire hazard considers the potential vegetation
         over a 50 year time period.
         Topography- Fire burns faster on steep slopes.
         Weather- Fire burns faster and with more intensity when air temperature is high, relative
         humidity is low, and winds are strong.
         Crown fire potential- Under extreme conditions, fires burn up into trees and tall brush.
         Ember production and movement- Fire brands are blown ahead of the main fire.
         Likelihood of wildfire- The likelihood of an area burning over a 30 to 50 year time period.

Oil Well Hazards
Yorba Linda has a long history of oil production, dating back to the 1930s. There are several active
wells in Yorba Linda; however, oil extraction in the City has been declining over the past several decades
as resources are depleted. Several of the sites previously used for oil extraction have been redeveloped
into residential, recreational or commercial uses. The large Shell oil field was redeveloped into the Black
Gold Golf Course.
Hazards exist for both active and abandoned oil wells. Potential hazards from active oil wells include
potential soil and groundwater contamination, as well as release of methane gas. The abandonment of
oil wells falls within the jurisdiction of the California Department of Conservation, Oil, Gas, and
Geothermal Resources (DOGGR). Oil wells are subject to regulations and oversight by DOGGR.
Additionally, DOGGR provides regulations regarding the placement of structures on abandoned oil
well sites. Abandoned wells must be vented to the atmosphere and plugged. A well is plugged by placing
cement in the well-bore or casing at certain intervals as specified in California laws or regulations.
Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials are substances that may pose a significant present or potential hazard to human
health and safety and/or to the environment if released into the community. Hazardous materials are
found in household cleaners, industrial solvents, paint, etc. Storage, transport and disposal of hazardous
materials requires careful and sound management practices.
Hazardous Waste Management
Hazard waste management in the City of Yorba Linda is regulated by the County of Orange. The
Orange County Environmental Health Division is designated as the Certified Unified Program Agency
(CUPA) for the County of Orange. The CUPA is the local administrative agency that coordinates the
regulation of hazardous materials and hazardous wastes in Orange County through the following six
programs:
        Hazardous Materials Disclosure (HMD)
        Business Emergency Plan (BEP)
        Hazardous Waste (HW)
        Underground Storage Tank (UST)
        Aboveground Petroleum Storage Tank (APST)
        California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP)
Additionally, the Orange County Environmental Health Division has a specialized Health Hazardous
Materials Team (Health HazMat Team). The Health HazMat Team responds to incidents County-wide
that involve a release or potential threat of hazardous materials and wastes that pose a physical,
chemical, biological, or radiological hazard to the community. The Health HazMat Team responds to:

Yorba Linda General Plan
        Hazardous materials spills
        Clandestine drug lab operations
        Terrorism incidents
        Hazardous materials complaints
The City of Yorba Linda is responsible for informing the emergency service personnel in the County of
the use and dangers of hazardous materials in the community in order to plan for and respond to
potential emergencies and exposure to such materials; provide a system of disclosure to allow
firefighters, health officials, planners, elected officials, and other emergency service personnel to meet
their responsibilities for the health and welfare of the community while respecting trade secrecy; and to
keep the community informed on the use and disposal of hazardous materials in the County.
Transportation of Hazardous Materials
The Federal Department of Transportation (DOT) is the primary regulatory authority for the interstate
transport of hazardous materials. The DOT establishes regulations for safe handling procedures, such
as the packaging, marking, and routing of the transport of hazardous materials. The California Highway
Patrol enforces the interstate transport of hazardous materials and hazardous waste.
In Yorba Linda, trucks are the primary mode of transportation for the movement of hazardous materials.
The City of Yorba Linda has instituted truck restrictions on all streets within the City limits except for
Imperial Highway. This truck restriction requires that trucks use Imperial Highway and that local and
collector roads can only be used for local deliveries. Trucks must use the shortest route to the delivery
site possible from Imperial Highway. There are no other designated routes or travel time restrictions for
hazardous waste haulers who transport hazardous materials on City roads to access the State Route 91
Freeway (SR-91). The SR-91 is a major east-west transportation corridor in the region and is located
just south of Yorba Linda.
While trucks are the primary mode of transportation, the Atchinson, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad
travels through the southeast portion of Yorba Linda and is used to transport hazardous materials among
other freight.

California Division of Mines and Geology
The California Division of Mines and Geology identifies and evaluates specific geologic and seismologic
hazards with respect to their impact on land use planning and makes this information available to the
public.

allow individual fire departments to establish plans and policies for land within their respective
jurisdiction.
Orange County Hazardous Waste Management Program
Developed pursuant to the Tanner Act (1986), the Orange County Hazardous Waste Management Plan
identifies current and projected future hazardous waste generation and management needs in Orange
County. The plan provides the framework for the development of facilities to manage hazardous wastes
and also sets in motion policy directives towards developing county-wide programs in areas such as
waste reduction, and collection of hazardous wastes from households and small quantity businesses.
County Hazardous Waste Material Incident Response Plan
The County of Orange has developed a comprehensive plan which establishes the County’s response
organization, command authority, responsibilities, functions and interactions required to mitigate
hazardous substance emergency incidents affecting Orange County. The plan identifies local, state, and
federal responsibilities designed to minimize damage to human health, natural systems, and property
caused by the release of hazardous substances.
Orange County’s Household Hazardous Waste Element
The City of Yorba Linda participates in Orange County’s Household Hazardous Waste Element. Its
participation includes working with the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery
(CalRecycle) office. The goals for the plan include education, places for disposal, monitoring of

regulation requirements and ultimately to significantly reduce disposal of household hazardous waste
in solid waste landfills. The City of Yorba Linda supports these goals and assists the County with
implementation.
Yorba Linda Source Reduction/Recycle Element
In compliance with AB 939, the City of Yorba Linda adopted a Source Reduction and Recycle Element,
which is a separate document and not included in the General Plan. The Source Reduction component
of the Element identifies specific objectives that are achievable, and, when possible, measurable and
time specific. The objective of this component is to minimize the quantity of solid waste generated by
targeting specific waste types.
The Recycling component of the Element identifies several programs that are aimed at increasing the
recycling of waste. In addition to developing the programs, this Element describes programs to reduce
waste, special disposal methods, and who is responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the
programs.
Yorba Linda Emergency Response Plan
The Emergency Response Plan addresses the City’s planned response to extraordinary emergency
situations associated with natural disasters, technological incidents, and nuclear defense operations.
The plan does not apply to normal day-to-day emergencies. The Emergency Response Plan focuses on
potentially large-scale disasters which can generate unique situations requiring unusual responses.
Specifically, this includes emergencies which threaten life and property, and potentially impact the well-
being of large numbers of people.

Water System
The City receives water service from both the Yorba Linda Water District (YLWD) and the Golden State
Water Company, which is a for-profit agency regulated by the Public Utilities Commission. YLWD is a
ratepayer-owned, non-profit agency licensed by the California State Water Resources Control Board.
YLWD is allowed to use wells to pump approximately 60-70 percent of demand from the Lower Santa
Ana River Groundwater Basin and pays fees to the Orange County Water District. The remaining water
demand is purchased from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California through the Municipal
Water District of Orange County. Groundwater is pumped from nine active wells located throughout
the YLWD and imported water is treated at the Diemer Filtration Plant and is delivered to the YLWD
system through four imported water connections.
Development projects are assessed fees for new water provision facilities by the YLWD to ensure that
the water infrastructure in Yorba Linda is capable of meeting the demands of domestic and commercial
water usage.
Wastewater System
The Yorba Linda Water District (YLWD)
maintains the sewer systems within the City.
The YLWD owns and maintains nearly 150
miles of various diameter sewer pipes and
one sewer lift station. Wastewater collected
within the YLWD is delivered to the Orange
County Sanitation District (OCSD) trunk
sewer line for treatment and disposal.
Wastewater flows by gravity to OCSD’s
Reclamation Plant No. 1, which is located in
the City of Fountain Valley. The plant
provides advanced primary and secondary
treatment and supplies secondary-treated water to the Orange County Water District which further treats
and distributes the water for various uses, including groundwater recharge, and operation of an ocean
water intrusion barrier system. Development projects are assessed fees for new sewer provision facilities
by the YLWD.
Storm Drain System
In Yorba Linda, storm drains flow directly to local creeks and rivers, like the Santa Ana River, and
eventually into the Pacific Ocean. Maintenance of the City’s storm drain system is the responsibility of
Yorba Linda’s Department of Public Works. In addition to managing the day-to-day maintenance work,
Public Works also designs and constructs new storm drain facilities as well as major capital
improvements to existing facilities. Two important planning considerations in regards to storm drain

Yorba Linda General Plan
systems are 1) ensuring adequate capacity to collect and carry storm water; and 2) working to reduce
pollutants in storm water.
The 1972 Federal Clean Water Act (CWA) established the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) Permit Program to regulate the discharge of pollutants from point sources, such as
sewage treatment plants and industrial facilities, to the waters of the United States. The City of Yorba
Linda participates in the NPDES permit program, which includes public education, regulatory
requirements for existing and new development, increased inspections, monitoring, revision, and the
adoption of more restrictive development standards.
