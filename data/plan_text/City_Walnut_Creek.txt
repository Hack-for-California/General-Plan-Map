Rural character neighborhoods are usually
found in the hillside areas of the city and the
unincorporated parts of the planning area.
Parcels in these areas are often larger than
elsewhere in the planning area and have build-
ing constraints because of slopes or other natu-
ral features. Roads in rural–character areas can
be narrow and winding and often lack side-
walks, curbs, gutters, and streetlights, all of
which makes on-street parking limited or, in
some cases, hazardous.

Open Space
Walnut Creek’s open spaces are critical com-
ponents of the city’s identity. They provide
physical orientation, boundaries for urban de-
velopment, and a sense of place. The views
from the city to the surrounding open spaces
and hills are extremely important to the resi-
dents and to patrons of many businesses.

     COMMERCIAL AREAS
      OUTSIDE THE CORE
Outside the Core Area, the city’s commercial
activity takes place in neighborhood shopping
centers, along commercial corridors, and in
employment districts.
Neighborhood Shopping Centers                                 Medical offices in Shadelands Business Park
As in most communities, Walnut Creek’s
neighborhood shopping centers are located on
arterial streets and serve adjacent and nearby
residential neighborhoods. More often than
not, these shopping centers have a “strip com-
mercial” character, with buildings at the back
of the property and large parking areas
between the storefronts and the arterial street.
Commercial Corridors
Commercial corridors are commercial areas
that border residential areas, creating edges or
transitions that require care in both land use
and design. Commercial corridors tend to be
underutilized and, thus, offer opportunities for
redevelopment or intensification that can cre-
ate more successful and vibrant places.

      LOCAL NETWORKS
The local road system is a hierarchy of streets
comprising routes of regional significance, ar-
terials, collectors, and local roads. Except for a
third phase improvement of Geary Road be-
tween Buena Vista Avenue and Pleasant Hill
Road, the local road system in Walnut Creek is
complete. Figure 3 on page 5-8 shows the ma-
jor streets in Walnut Creek by classification.
Routes of Regional Significance are the major
roadway and freeway corridors that serve re-
gional traffic, as identified in Action Plans
adopted by the Contra Costa Transportation
Authority as part of the countywide Measure
C program. Facilities within Walnut Creek
designated as Routes of Regional Significance
are Ygnacio Valley Road, Treat Boulevard,
Geary Road, North Main Street (from I-680 to
the north city limits) and Pleasant Hill Road.
Arterials provide intra-city travel and access
to the regional roadway network. Arterials in
Walnut Creek include California Boulevard,
Broadway, Tice Valley Boulevard, Olympic
Boulevard, Mt. Diablo Boulevard, Bancroft
Road, and Oak Grove Road, which provide
connections between Walnut Creek and the
surrounding communities of Concord, Pleas-
ant Hill, Lafayette, and Alamo.
Collectors provide access within and between
neighborhoods, and carry trips from Local
Streets to Arterials. Collectors in the city in-
clude Boulevard Way, La Casa Via, San Luis
Road, Buena Vista Avenue, Walnut Boulevard,
and San Carlos Drive.
Local Streets are roadways not otherwise clas-
sified. They provide direct access to fronting
properties. Travel speeds and traffic volumes
are generally low on these streets.

Parking is a vital component of the city’s
transportation system, particularly in the Core
Area. The availability of parking and loading
facilities affects the circulation and the vitality
of the downtown.
As of 2001, 2 the city had more than 20,600 non-
residential parking spaces in the area bounded
by Walden Road on the north; Carmel Drive,
Margarido Drive and San Miguel Drive on the
east; and I-680 on the south and west). Of this
total, 46 percent were in private and public
surface parking lots; the remaining spaces
were in private or public garages (45 percent)
or on-street parking (9 percent).

            ENVIRONMENT
Noise measurements conducted in Walnut
Creek as part of General Plan 2025 reflect a va-
riety of noise environments. The loudest noise
source is Interstate 680. In a typical location
250 feet from the center of the highway, the
Ldn was 75 dBA. At or near the freeway, the
noise level ranged from 78 Ldn to 80 Ldn.
BART generates a noise level of 66 Ldn , as
measured along Minert Street, 80 feet from the

later, the town council and city council (Coun-
cil minutes, October 25, 1929).
The City governs through a council/manager
system, one of two main variations of repre-
sentative municipal government. The other
system is the mayor-council system.
In the council-manager system, an elected city
council is responsible for making policy,
passing ordinances, voting appropriations,

the city government. The mayor performs
ceremonial duties and acts as a member and
presiding officer of the council. The council
hires a city manager who is responsible for
supervising government operations and
implementing policies adopted by the council.
The manager serves at the pleasure of the
council, usually with a contract that specifies
duties and responsibilities.
The role of city government is the focus of one
segment of the Vision and Principles that un-
derlie this plan (see pages 1-12 through 1-14).
