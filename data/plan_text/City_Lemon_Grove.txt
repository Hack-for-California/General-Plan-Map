EXECUTIVE SUMMAR

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The California State Legislature enacted legislation to assure the attainment of the State housing goal by
requiring that counties and cities prepare and implement housing elements. The Housing Element for the
City of Lemon Grove is an element of the City’s General Plan and covers the time period from January 1,
2010 to December 31, 2020.
This document presents a plan to achieve the City’s housing goal while meeting the requirements of the
State of California (Article 10.6 of the Government Code) and includes: analysis of the previous Housing
Element (2005-2010) and current housing factors (physical, fiscal, regulatory); identification of constraints
to achieving the goal; and proposed modifications and refinements to the objectives, policies and
programs identified in the previous Housing Element.
The goal of the City of Lemon Grove Housing Element is to help ensure that suitable, safe housing is
available at a cost that is affordable to all current and future residents of this community. To this end, the
City will encourage a variety of individual choices of tenure, type, and location of housing throughout the
community. Lemon Grove adopted its first housing element in 1980 with an amendment in 1983 and
subsequent updates occurring in 1992, 2005, and 2010.
2005-2010 HOUSING ELEMENT
The previous Housing Element incorporated the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) adopted by
the SANDAG Board of Directors. The RHNA distributes allocation of dwelling units to satisfy housing
needs throughout the 19 jurisdictions in San Diego County. The RHNA process occurs during each
Housing Element cycle and the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) delegates
the allocation of regional dwelling units to SANDAG. The RHNA for the City of Lemon Grove for the
period 2005 through 2010 allocated 242 new units, consisting of 46 units for very low income, 32 units for
low income, 46 units for moderate income, and 118 units for above moderate income households. During
that same time period, a total of 81 units were constructed, one-third of the quantified RHNA allocation.
Construction exceeded the 32 unit low income housing allocation (35 units were constructed).
During the previous Housing Element cycle, the City was able to advance the overall housing goal by
issuing several entitlements and construction permits for residential projects. From January 1, 2005 to
December 31, 2010, the City approved revitalization requests of existing housing stock including: a multi-
family alteration, 210 roof improvements, 162 single-family additions, and 172 single-family alterations.
The City also issued entitlements (some of which have been issued building permits) for a total of 10
housing projects (301 dwelling units). This activity was due in part to the adoption of the Downtown
Village Specific Plan (DVSP) in 2005 (with a potential yield of up to 719 new dwelling units). The City
also approved plans to relocate the major entrance to the City (Lemon Grove Avenue Realignment) and
to construct a new downtown park (Main Street Promenade) both in the DVSP area. The City expects
these projects to spark further interest for future development in the DVSP area.
                                                        3

Within the past five years, the City also amended its Municipal Code to:
●    Reduce certain zoning regulations (parking, uses, setbacks);
●    Incorporate State requirements (water conserving landscape, senior housing, daycare facilities,
     CALGreen, and construction debris regulations);
●    Streamline and clarify permitting processes reducing discretionary permit requirements, increasing
     waiver opportunities, reducing processing time, and modifying flat fees to a deposit system.
All of these efforts and actions indicate that the previous Housing Element was successful in promoting
and achieving the overall goal for housing in the City of Lemon Grove. This update describes
demographic changes and refinements to the City’s objectives and programs to incorporate recent
legislation, public feedback, and the recent inventory and assessment of local and regional housing
needs.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The City was diligent with its efforts to achieve public participation of all economic segments in the
development and adoption of the Housing Element. The outreach program was extensive and
participants provided feedback on housing topics as well as broader community issues. Various
objectives, policies, and programs from the 2010-2020 Housing Element address the participants’
feedback.
LEGISLATION
Redevelopment agencies were dissolved by the State of California on February 1, 2012 (Supreme Court
decision). Redevelopment monies are one of the three main funding sources used to make affordable
developments viable statewide. The others are State bond funds and Federal funds administered
through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The City cannot directly apply for Federal
housing funds as they are administered through the County of San Diego.
The proposed State budget redirects much of redevelopment’s tax increment to local agencies and
services, but does not provide for ongoing funding of affordable housing, although, there is pending
legislation to direct the 20 percent set-aside to local housing authorities. The budget, however, does
provide that existing housing funds that were already in redevelopment agencies’ (now successor
agencies) accounts be transferred to local housing authorities. These funds are available to complete
affordable housing projects already entitled, but no projects beyond those.
Although the impacts involved in the California Supreme Court decision may be unknown for several
years, many speculate that this decision will result in a loss of approximately one billion dollars of annual
funding designated for affordable housing throughout California. It is expected that new avenues for
funding economic development and affordable housing will be created and tested in the coming years,
but because of the uncertainty of available funds at this time, a conservative approach to affordable
housing programs is recommended throughout this document.

Existing and new legislation relating to the purpose of Housing Elements is described and considered in
the analysis of programs to be implemented for the 2010-2010 Housing Element cycle. The legislation is
identified, analyzed, and a recommendation regarding programs is listed.
NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The Needs Assessment utilizes socio-economic data to discuss the major components of housing needs
in Lemon Grove. In comparison to the region, Lemon Grove has:
●   A smaller percentage of residents in the 18-34 age group than in the region.
●   A median household income of $43,781, which is $8,138 (18 percent) lower than the region.
●   A limited supply (71 acres) of vacant developable residential land.
●   A limited supply (87 acres) of redevelopment and infill lands available for residential development.
●   An older housing stock, with 46 percent of the dwelling units built before 1960.
●   A median cost of dwelling units sold at $260,300, approximately $90,000 lower than in the region.
●   Lower rents than in the region.
The last Housing Element used the SANDAG 2030 Regional Growth Forecast which stated Lemon Grove
is expected to gain 1,253 new residents and 230 new dwelling units between 2000 and 2010. This
Housing Element Update uses the SANDAG 2050 Regional Growth Forecast which projects that Lemon
Grove will gain 1,177 new residents and 255 new dwelling units between 2008 and 2020.
Lemon Grove experienced notable demographic changes from the 2005-2010 Housing Element cycle to
the 2010-2020 cycle that were generally experienced by the region. These notable changes to the City’s
population, housing, land inventory, and employment are summarized below:
   Rental housing costs increased (35-70 percent depending on bedroom number).
   Cost of a median priced home decreased 35 percent.
   Vacancy rates decreased from 7.2 to 4.2 percent.
   Households that pay 30 percent or more of their income for housing increased 17 percent.
   Owner-occupied dwelling units increased 6 percent.
   Overcrowded dwelling units decreased 60 percent.
   Employment (primarily retail and government sectors) decreased 13 percent.
   Persons with disabilities residing in Lemon Grove decreased 56 percent.
   Homeless persons in Lemon Grove decreased 52 percent.
                                                    5

In comparison to the region, Lemon Grove has difficulty achieving housing stock for above moderate
income households and all jurisdictions remain challenged in achieving extremely low income housing.
As a part of this Housing Element cycle, existing policies were refined and emphasized to encourage
maintenance and improvements that would attract development for higher income households.
GOALS, OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
In order to achieve suitable, safe housing available to all current and future residents of the community at
a cost that is within the reach of the diverse economic segments that comprise this community, the City
has established objectives and programs to meet its stated goal. The previous Housing Element
objectives were analyzed and have been reorganized with specific policies and programs.
The State of California recognizes that total housing need may exceed the locality’s ability to meet those
needs with existing resources. For that reason, jurisdictions are required to estimate and categorize the
number of dwelling units likely to be constructed, rehabilitated or conserved/preserved (quantified
objectives) according to each allocated RHNA income level. In October, 2011, SANDAG adopted the
RHNA and Lemon Grove allocations of the Regional Share Needs are as follows:
                                                  Table 1
                                           Regional Share Needs
                            Income Category              Regional Share Needs
                            Very Low                                 77
                            Low                                      59
                            Moderate                                 54
                            Above Moderate                          119
                            Total                                   309
Based on its existing General Plan and Municipal Code, the City’s active development projects, and the
Downtown Village Specific Plan (DVSP), Lemon Grove’s zoning has the capacity to accommodate its
share of the region’s housing needs in the “constructed” quantified objective.

INTRODUCTION
HOUSING ELEMENT
The Housing Element is an important planning tool for the City of Lemon Grove. It identifies the housing
needs of the City and recommends ways to meet these needs while balancing other community
objectives and resources.
CITY PROFILE
Incorporated in 1977, Lemon Grove is a city with unique small town charm in the midst of a bustling
metropolis. The idyllic community of approximately 25,320 residents and spanning only 3.9 square miles
ranks the third smallest jurisdiction in the San Diego region based on population and geographic size.
Lemon Grove is known for being centrally located – providing easy access to downtown San Diego,
mountains, and beaches. Residents enjoy larger lots, lower property taxes, and fewer assessment fees
compared to other communities in the County, and developers benefit from less regulatory constraints
and impact fees. Diverse housing opportunities, an award-winning school district, and a variety of free
community activities are also among many reasons the City appeals to homeowners.
The City’s location in the region helps explain its suburban and semi-rural patterns of development. Its
western and southern boundaries are adjacent to suburban parts of the City of San Diego such as Skyline
Paradise Hills. To the north is the City of La Mesa, and its eastern border adjoins an unincorporated area
of San Diego County known as Spring Valley. Residents and visitors steadily flow through Lemon
Grove’s downtown business district via the San Diego Trolley, making Lemon Grove a dynamic central
hub. State Route 94 borders the City on the north, providing access to downtown San Diego. The
completion of State Route 125 has also enhanced regional access to the City.
First settled in 1869 by sheep rancher Robert Allison, Lemon Grove is known for having the "Best Climate
on Earth," recalling the community's agricultural origins of plentiful citrus groves. Few groves remain
today, but the "Best Climate" motto still refers to a simple way of life that seems to have vanished from
other parts of the County. Although just seven minutes from downtown San Diego, and nestled in the
middle of a $20 billion a year trade area, Lemon Grove has maintained its authentic small town feel.
STATE POLICY AND AUTHORIZATION
The California State Legislature has identified the attainment of a suitable home and suitable living
environment for every Californian as the State’s main housing goal. Recognizing the important part that
local planning programs play in pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all cities and
counties prepare a housing element as part of their comprehensive general plans.
State law requires housing elements to be updated at least every eight years to reflect a community’s
changing housing needs. State law has allowed eleven years for the current cycle. Lemon Grove’s
Housing Element was last updated in 2006. This document is the 2010-2020 update required for
jurisdictions within the San Diego region.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The City of Lemon Grove’s General Plan is comprised of Community Development, Mobility, Housing,
Public Facilities, Safety, Noise, and Conservation and Recreation Elements. The content of the Housing
Element is consistent with the goals and policies of all elements of the General Plan. Furthermore, when
any element in the General Plan is amended, the Housing Element will be reviewed and modified, if
necessary, to ensure continued internal consistency among elements.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) requires jurisdictions to make a
diligent effort to achieve public participation of all economic populations during the Housing Element
update.
As part of the Housing Element update process, two Housing Element workshops and a housing survey
were conducted with members of the public. The City also held noticed public hearings before the City
Council and Planning Commission: first, for authorization of the submittal of the Administrative Draft and
second, for the approval of the adopted Housing Element.
The following outlines the public outreach tasks accomplished by the City of Lemon Grove:
1. Housing Element update workshop flyers were distributed for both workshops. The flyers included
     recommendations from HCD, details on the Housing Element Update workshops, text in both English
     and Spanish, and links to the housing survey, the 2005-2010 adopted Lemon Grove Housing
                                                      17

   Element, the workshop registration, and staff’s email address. These flyers were distributed as
   follows:
   a. The workshop flyers were posted at the entryways of public facilities (City Hall, local County
        Library, Fire Department, Senior Center, Community Center, and Recreation Center).
   b. Copies of the workshop flyers were made available at City Hall.
   c.   A newsflash announcement on the City of Lemon Grove website home page provided links to the
        workshop flyers.
   d. The workshop flyers were emailed to the City’s automatic electronic services notification
        subscriber’s lists including the newsletter, community events, community news, and City Council
        agenda email lists. Reminders were emailed the day before the event.
   e. The workshop flyers were mailed or emailed to housing stakeholders, the Lemon Grove Planning
        Commissioners, the Lemon Grove City Council members, San Diego County jurisdictional
        housing agents, and potentially interested parties. Reminders were emailed the day before the
        event.
2. Media advisory announcements were emailed to the media advisory list. The announcements
   included details on both Housing Element Update workshops with links to the housing survey, the
   City of Lemon Grove website, the City of Lemon Grove Development Services Department home
   page, the workshop registration, and staff’s email address. Reminders were emailed the day before
   the event. The Union Tribune newspaper and Lemon Grove Patch online newspaper reported the
   workshop announcements in their news as a result of the announcements.
3. The Eventsbrite workshop registration page was utilized to register participants. Registration
   included a printed ticket as a reminder. Eventsbrite automatically posts community events through
   Fwix on other site calendars like msn.com.
4. One housing survey question was posted (three total over a nine week period) on the City of Lemon
   Grove website home page.
5. Two public notices, one for each workshop, were published in the East County Californian
   newspaper.
6. A three minute community housing survey was made available at City Hall and a link to it was listed
   on the Housing Element update workshop flyers and Media Advisory announcements. Besides
   specific questions regarding the Lemon Grove community, the survey included questions
   recommended from HCD.
7. Two public community workshops (# 1- Thursday, November 17, 2011; # 2- Wednesday, December
   14, 2011) were conducted. Attendees were notified of the availability of the Draft Housing Element
   Update and public hearings scheduled during regular meetings of the Planning Commission and City
   Council.
                                                      18

8. The Draft Housing Element Update was prepared and copies were made available for viewing at City
     Hall and posted on the City’s website home page.
9. A public hearing notice was published for the Planning Commission meeting on the Housing Element
     Update in the East County Californian newspaper.
10. The Planning Commission Agenda for the Housing Element Update Public Hearing was emailed to
     the Planning Commission agenda email list.
11. The Planning Commission conducted a public hearing for the review of the Draft Housing Element
     Update with a recommendation to City Council.
12. A public hearing notice was published for the City Council meeting on the Housing Element Update in
     the East County Californian newspaper.
13. The City Council Agenda was emailed for the Housing Element Update Public Hearing, using “Notify
     Me”, to the City Council agenda email list.
14. The City Council conducted a public hearing for the review of the Draft Housing Element Update with
     a recommendation to forward to HCD.
15. The Draft Housing Element Update was submitted to HCD for review.
During the course of two workshops, workshop participants (17 separate individuals) suggested that the
Housing Element update include the following programs: residential design guidelines, promotion of
maintenance standards, increasing above moderate housing stock, landscaping and open space areas,
promoting senior housing opportunities, and revisions to the second dwelling unit ordinance. In addition
to housing related programs, participants also suggested that broader community programs be
considered, including: improved public lighting, attraction of quality businesses, improvement of public
transit and freeway access, and improved sustainability.
During the workshops, staff described several existing projects that may help to address many of the
workshop participant’s suggestions such as the Main St. Promenade linear park (under construction), the
Main St. Promenade park extension (under consideration), the Lemon Grove Avenue freeway ramp
realignment (in process), the Citronica II transit oriented senior housing development (80 dwelling units),
and the second unit program (existing). In addition, staff has recommended new programs to further
address the participant’s suggestions, including a Street Design Manual program, a program encouraging
energy conservation and sustainable best practices, a greater utilization of the current code enforcement
program, a program promoting community based neighborhood improvement districts, and a program
promoting the implementation of the Crime Prevention through Environmental Design.
The workshop participant’s suggestions were forwarded to the City Council for their goal setting sessions
and were considered as a part of the budget process. Additionally, the workshop priorities and the results
of the survey were incorporated into the Planning Commission and City Council Staff Reports for review
and were considered and incorporated into the updated plan where appropriate. Staff included an
analysis and recommendation regarding the suggestions raised during the public outreach sessions.
During the course of public hearings regarding this Housing Element update, any direction to staff from
                                                       19

the Planning Commission and City Council in consideration of the public comments was incorporated in
the preparation of the final Housing Element.

EVALUATIO

2005-2010 HOUSING ELEMENT PROGRAM EVALUATION
An important component of this revised Housing Element is the evaluation of the 2005-2010 Housing
Element. It is important to determine if the housing needs have changed, if the goals, objectives, and
policies are still relevant, and if the programs were effective. This includes the differences between what
was planned in the previous element and what was achieved. These questions were systematically
considered as part of the 2010-2020 Housing Element update. The analysis is summarized in the
following paragraphs and is reflected throughout the 2010-2020 Housing Element. The updated goals,
objectives, policies, and programs incorporate what has been learned from the results of the previous
element.
OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS
The City did not meet the goals and objectives of the 2005-2010 Housing Element for total dwelling units,
but met the objectives for low income dwelling units (35 units constructed where 32 units were allocated).
The City made a significant start toward its affordable housing goals by implementing a number of
programs, entitling two affordable housing projects in the Downtown Village Specific Plan area, entitling a
linear park adjacent to the Main Street trolley station, and conducting Municipal Code amendments to
attract residential construction and supportive businesses. Although the actual production fell short of
goals, much of the effort in the 2005-2010 Housing Element cycle has set the stage for the
implementation of mixed-use and infill (re-)development as a key program during the 2010-2020 Housing
Element cycle.
GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND POLICIES
The goals, objectives, and policies contained in this section describe a general vision for Lemon Grove
during the 2005-2010 Housing Element cycle to satisfy the community’s housing needs and meet the
requirements of State law. These goals, objectives, and policies were followed by the programs that were
proposed to be implemented to meet this vision.
The 2005-2010 Housing Element’s primary goal for the City of Lemon Grove was to help ensure that
suitable, safe housing is available at a cost that is affordable to all current and future residents of this
community. To this end, the City will strive to maintain a reasonable balance between rental and
ownership housing opportunities and to encourage a variety of individual choices of tenure, type, and
location of housing throughout the community.
To achieve this goal, the following objectives and policies were incorporated into the element:
                                                      23

Objective 1:       Maintain and enhance the quality of residential neighborhoods in Lemon
                   Grove.
Policy 1.1: Advocate the rehabilitation of substandard residential properties by homeowners and
landlords.
Policy 1.2: Use the City’s code enforcement program to bring substandard dwelling units into
compliance with City codes and to improve overall housing quality and conditions in Lemon
Grove.
Objective 2:       Provide programs for the development and preservation of lower and
                   moderate income housing.
Policy 2.1: Provide support to both for profit and nonprofit development corporations for the
development of affordable housing.
Policy 2.2: Preserve existing housing opportunities for low and moderate income families
currently living within the community, and maintain existing housing stock in good condition.
Policy 2.3: Attempt to preserve restricted low income housing in the City that is “At-Risk” of
converting to market-rate housing by: a) identifying financial and organizational resources
available to preserve these dwelling units; and b) assisting interested agencies and/or tenants
groups in forming partnerships and gaining access to financial and technical resources.
Policy 2.4: Apply the density bonus requirements as established by SB 1818.
Policy 2.5: Implement the City‘s adopted resolution on smart growth and explore opportunities to
identify sites for their potential as “Smart Growth Opportunity Areas.”
Policy 2.6: Identify opportunities for the application of an Inclusionary Housing Program.
Policy 2.8 Update the City’s policies on the conversion of apartments to condominiums.
Objective 3:       Encourage the adequate provision of housing in a variety of costs, types,
                   styles, locations, and tenures to meet the existing and future needs of
                   Lemon Grove residents.
Policy 3.1: Provide a variety of residential development opportunities in the City including low
density single-family homes, moderate density town homes, higher density apartments and
condominiums, and residential/commercial mixed-use to fulfill regional housing needs.
Policy 3.2: Encourage both the private and public sectors to produce or assist in the production of
housing in accordance with the SANDAG RHNA quantified objectives for all four income
categories (very low, low, moderate and all other households), with particular emphasis on
housing affordable and accessible to lower and moderate income households, persons with
disabilities, elderly households, large households, female-headed households, and homeless
persons.
                                               24

Policy 3.3: Ensure that low income housing is developed in areas with adequate access to
employment opportunities, community facilities and public services, and is not concentrated in
any single area within the City.
Policy 3.4: Encourage development of new dwelling units designated for lower income and
special needs households within close proximity to public transportation and community services.
Policy 3.5: Encourage development of childcare facilities to coincide with new housing
development if appropriate based upon the project circumstances and evaluate the use of
incentives to encourage development of childcare facilities when appropriate.
Policy 3.6: Implement State senior housing requirements.
Policy 3.7: Address the impediments to affordable housing: density bonus; CUP requirements for
multi-family housing, explicit provisions for mobile homes, manufactured housing, transitional
housing and emergency shelters; and ADA compliance. Propose specific development standards
for multi-family housing and propose an amendment to ministerially process multi-family housing
development permits.
Policy 3.8: Prohibit the conversion of existing residential units to condominiums in commercial
zones.
Policy 3.9: Implement State requirements for large family daycare facilities.
Policy 3.10: Consider pedestrian circulation patterns for new development projects near the
trolley (MTS) right-of-way to ensure safety within the rail corridor. Safety factors to consider
include, but are not limited to, planning for grade separations for major thoroughfares,
improvements to existing at-grade highway-rail crossings due to increase in traffic volumes and
appropriate fencing to limit the access of trespassers onto the railroad right-of-way.
Objective 4:      Provide increased opportunities for home ownership.
Policy 4.1: Assist low and moderate income residents in achieving home ownership.
Policy 4.2: Encourage alternative forms of home ownership, such as shared equity ownership and
limited equity cooperatives.
Objective 5:      Promote equal opportunity for all residents to reside in housing of their
                  choice.
Policy 5.1: Support the prohibition of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing with regard to
race, ethnic background, religion, handicap, income, sex, age, and household composition.
Policy 5.2: Assist in the enforcement of fair housing laws by providing support to organizations
that receive and investigate fair housing allegations. Monitor compliance with fair housing laws,
and refer possible violations to enforcing agencies.
                                              25
Overall, these goals, objectives, and policies were retained, but some modifications were conducted. The
recent Needs Assessment shows that Lemon Grove has a greater need for above moderate housing
because most market rate dwelling units constructed during the last Housing Element cycle were
affordable to moderate and low income households. This sentiment was incorporated into the revised
objectives. The pursuit of an inclusionary housing policy was abandoned due to cost constraints on
developers and legal challenges on rental inclusionary housing ordinances. The State requirements for
senior housing and daycare facilities were incorporated into the Municipal Code during the 2005-2010
Housing Element cycle. Ministerially approving discretionary permits for multi-family housing projects was
incorporated into the Downtown Village Specific Plan area, but discretionary review was retained in high
density residential zones.        Prohibiting the conversion of existing residential dwelling units to
condominiums in commercial zones was abandoned to further encourage housing.                       A more
comprehensive evaluation of these goals, objectives, and policies is included in the specific program
evaluation.
PROGRAMS
The programs contained in this section describe specific actions the City of Lemon Grove proposed to
carry out during the 2005-2010 Housing Element cycle to satisfy the community’s housing needs and
meet the requirements of State law. Each housing need and requirement in the 2005-2010 Housing
Element was followed by programs that were proposed to be implemented. The City’s quantified
objectives for the five-year Housing Element followed the program descriptions.
ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Program 1: Density Bonus
Program Description Summary
Density bonus projects are projects in which the developer received an increase in allowable density in
exchange for an agreement to keep a percentage of the dwelling units affordable or for senior citizens.
Section 65915 of the Government Code requires that if a developer agrees to construct a percentage of
the total dwelling units of a housing development for lower income households or seniors that a
jurisdiction is required to grant a density bonus over the otherwise maximum allowable density and
additional incentives for the project site.
Program Accomplishment
The City relied upon the State density bonus law for implementation of this program. A revision to the
existing density bonus ordinance was not adopted, but did not hinder the utilization of the State provision.
Two projects utilized the density bonus provisions, but because of the economic downturn have not yet
been constructed. The associated land use entitlements have not expired. The City also adopted a
                                                     26

process that allows for waivers of other standards not identified in the State Code to relieve constraints on
residential development projects while creating a project acceptable to the community.
The City has thirteen density bonus dwelling units entitled as part of the Marchesini development and has
22 density bonus dwelling units entitled as part of the Brencick development.
Program Evaluation
This program has had success and will be continued in accordance with State law. The City intends to
update its density bonus ordinance and continue to make the density bonus program available in order to
encourage the development of affordable housing and comply with changes to State law.
    Retain      Modify    Omit
Program 2: Inclusionary Housing Program
Program Description Summary
Within 18 months from the date of Housing Element adoption, the City will conduct an analysis to
consider the establishment of an inclusionary housing program.
Program Accomplishment
The City did not conduct an analysis for an inclusionary housing program. In 2009, the Palmer/Sixth
Street Properties vs. City of Los Angeles court ruling found that inclusionary housing requirements on
rental developments violate the Costa-Hawkins Rental Act of 1995, thereby invalidating many local
jurisdictions’ inclusionary requirements for rental housing.
Program Evaluation
Because of the Palmer/Sixth Street Properties vs. City of Los Angeles court ruling and the increased cost
of inclusionary housing to developers, the City will not pursue an inclusionary housing program at this
time.
    Retain      Modify    Omit
Program 3: Multi-Family Revenue Bond Financing
Program Description Summary
The State of California implements the tax-exempt Multi-family Housing Revenue Bond Program. Under
this program, the State issues tax-exempt revenue bonds and the proceeds of the bond sales provide
below market construction and permanent financing for rental housing developments. Bond-financed
developments must reserve either 20 percent of the total dwelling units for households whose annual
income is at or below 50 percent of San Diego's Area Median Income (AMI) or 40 percent of the total
dwelling units for households whose annual income is at or below 60 percent of San Diego's AMI.
                                                      27

Program Accomplishments
No projects were financed within the City with this program during the 2005-2010 Housing Element cycle.
Program Evaluation
Bonds provide a cost-effective mechanism the City can utilize to promote affordable rental opportunities.
The City will continue to encourage prospective developers to take advantage of available bond financing
through the State. Where smaller rental projects are proposed, the City will act as liaison with individual
developers and the State to consolidate bond issues. The City will continue to examine opportunities to
continue to work with the State if any potential applications arise.

Program 4: Cooperation/Coordination with For-Profit and Non-Profit Housing
Developers
Program Description Summary
The City of Lemon Grove compiled a list of current non-profit developers who have been active in the
area. The City of Lemon Grove will continue to augment and refine this list of non-profit developers for
purposes of soliciting their involvement in affordable housing construction in the City. The City will
continue to utilize non-profit housing organizations to provide financial assistance and technical support in
the development of affordable housing. The City also will continue to work with for-profit developers to
insure that all opportunities are assessed. The actions that the City will take specifically include but are
not necessarily limited to: potential funding assistance (using potentially redevelopment monies, or other
State and Federal funds if they were to become available); identification of sites available for
development, infill and/or redevelopment; entitlement process(es) incentives as may be necessary and
appropriate; and others as may be added by the City.
Program Accomplishments
The City maintained the list of non-profit developers and added Cascade Housing Association (limited
partners with Hitzke Development) to the list. Cascade Housing Association is a non-profit investor who
works with Hitzke Development that developed the Citron Court affordable housing project (36 dwelling
units) and entitled Citronica I and II, both affordable housing mixed-use projects (136 dwelling units). A
22 dwelling unit townhome density bonus project with affordable dwelling units obtained entitlements, but
has not been constructed. Several market rate housing project subdivisions were approved. The City
consulted with Habitat for Humanity on potential sites for development.
                                                      28
Program Evaluation
The City of Lemon Grove will continue to augment and refine this list of non-profit housing developers for
purposes of attracting their involvement in affordable housing construction in the City. The City will
continue to support opportunities for non-profit housing organizations to provide financial and technical
expertise, to encourage affordable housing, especially development within the STAs.

Program 5: Pursue Affordable Housing Funding Sources
Program Description Summary
The City of Lemon Grove will actively pursue funding to assist in the development, preservation, and
rehabilitation of affordable housing. The City will identify these funding opportunities to both for-profit and
non-profit developers as part of the residential development processes, especially those projects that
have the potential for affordable housing. The actions that the City will take specifically include, but are
not necessarily limited to: identify potential funding assistance (potentially using redevelopment monies,
or other State and Federal funds if they were to become available); identification of sites available for
development, infill and/or redevelopment; consideration of entitlement process (es) incentives as may be
necessary and appropriate; and others as may be added by the City. The following funding sources were
available for these uses:
1. Community Development Block Grants and Home Funds
2. Low income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC)
The City will semi-annually refer to the State of California’s Department of Housing and Community
Development’s (HCD) Program Directory to expand its potential funding sources and determine the
availability of funding.
Program Accomplishments
The City worked with Hitzke Development (limited partners with Cascade Housing Association, a non-
profit investor) that utilized redevelopment monies and other State and Federal funds to develop Citron
Court, an affordable housing project (36 dwelling units), and to entitle Citronica I and II, both affordable
housing mixed-use projects containing a total of 136 dwelling units.
                                                       29

Program Evaluation
The City will continue to work with the County of San Diego, Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD), as a major resource for the implementation of the appropriate housing programs.
The CDBG and HOME funds programs will continue to be used for ongoing tenant/landlord mediation
services and street rehabilitation. The City will semi-annually refer to the HCD Program Directory to
expand its potential funding sources and determine the availability of funding. The State of California
eliminated redevelopment agencies in January 2012 with an effective date of February 2012. At this time,
the effects of this action on housing support are not known.

Program 6: Lemon Grove Redevelopment Project
Program Description Summary
Included in the goals of the redevelopment plan are the encouragement of residential, commercial, and
industrial development environments which positively relate to adjacent land uses and upgrade and
stabilize existing land uses; the promotion of the rehabilitation of existing housing stock where
appropriate; and the provision of adequate housing to the extent feasible. The City also will use its
ministerial processes wherever feasible in order to expedite development and facilitate residential
development, especially higher density, affordable housing proposals.
The City will apply its development review guidelines and standards of specific plans to the proposed
Redevelopment Area. The City estimated that a total of up to 800 dwelling units could be privately
and/or publicly constructed over the 40-year duration of the specific plan for Special Treatment Area
(STA) I. Based upon this forecast, the City proposed to analyze and address the application of an
inclusionary requirement within STA I to produce 72 affordable units (no analysis was conducted), 29 of
which must be available to very low income households during the 2005-2010 Housing Element cycle.
Program Accomplishments
The City worked with Cascade Housing Association, a non-profit investor who works with Hitzke
Development, that developed the Citron Court affordable housing project (36 dwelling units) and entitled
Citronica I and II, both affordable housing mixed-use projects (136 dwelling units). A 22 dwelling unit
townhome density bonus project with affordable dwelling units obtained entitlements, but has not been

Street Promenade) is under construction.
The State of California eliminated redevelopment agencies in January 2012 with an effective date of
February 2012. At this time, the effects of this action on housing support are not known.
                                                      30
Program Evaluation
The City of Lemon Grove will no longer continue to set-aside housing funds as part of their
redevelopment. The discontinuance of the City’s Community Development Agency created a significant
loss of a valuable source of revenue for developing affordable housing.

Program 7: Reduce Governmental Constraints to Provision of Housing
Program Description Summary
State law requires that housing elements address, and where appropriate and legally possible, remove
governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing. The City’s
Zoning Ordinance includes a variety of density ranges that provide opportunities for housing to be built for
all income levels. Although constraints to the provision of housing in Lemon Grove are minimal, the City
will continue to take the following steps:
    Address the impediments to affordable housing as identified in the San Diego Regional Analysis of
     Impediments: density bonus; CUP requirements for multi-family housing, explicit provisions for mobile
     homes, manufactured housing, transitional housing and emergency shelters; and ADA compliance
     (within 12 months of adoption of the Housing Element).
    Continue to monitor its development process and zoning regulations to identify and remove other
     constraints to the development of housing, as appropriate (ongoing and specifically within 12-24
     months of the adoption of the Housing Element).
    Continue to provide flexibility in the assessment of development fees to facilitate affordable housing,
     including reduced fees for provision of affordable housing (ongoing and specifically within 12-24
     months of the adoption of the Housing Element).
    Continue to minimize project holding costs on affordable housing developments and establish priority
     review processing for affordable housing projects (ongoing).
    Propose specific development standards for multi-family housing and propose an amendment to
     ministerially process multi-family housing development permits within two years of the adoption of the
     Housing Element.
    Establish a formal, reasonable accommodations procedure to allow waivers of various development
     standards when providing housing for persons with disabilities in residential zones within two years of
     the adoption of the Housing Element.
In addition, the City provides, and will continue to provide, incentives to developers of affordable housing.
These incentives include, but are not limited to, expedited processing, density bonuses, and capital
improvements.

Program Accomplishments
Through changes to the Municipal Code, the City has reduced the parking requirement for commercial
properties, and offers more land uses with less discretion in various zones. The transition to a deposit
system from a fee based system encourages designers to accomplish a complete application early in the
process. Most projects cost more than the previous fee based system, but decisions are made faster.
The deposit system encourages diligence in regulation compliance and typically reduces the number of
reviews in the development process.
Program Evaluation
This program has been clarified in the program section of the 2010-2020 Housing Element to reflect its
continued implementation. The City will continue this program, as clarified, as part of the 2010-2020
Housing Element.

CONSERVE AND IMPROVE EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Program 8: Nonconforming Dwelling Units
Program Description Summary
The City of Lemon Grove Development Code provides for the reconstruction of substantially destroyed
nonconforming residential buildings and uses located in residential zones. Section 17.24.090F-I
(Nonconforming Uses) of the Development Code provides for the issuance of Reconstruction Permits to
allow the restoration of substantially damaged or destroyed residential dwelling units. The City will
continue to implement this provision of the Development Code.
Program Accomplishments
Since the adoption of Section 17.24.090(F)(I) of the Municipal Code, which provides for the restoration of
substantially damaged or destroyed residential dwelling units in residential zones, the City has not had an
occasion to issue a reconstruction permit because nonconforming residential structures have not been
damaged or substantially destroyed.

Program 9: Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers
Program Description Summary
The City will continue to coordinate with the Housing Authority of San Diego County (who administers the
Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program) and will support the County’s applications for additional
Section 8 allocations. This program provides rental assistance to eligible very low and low income
households. The subsidy represents the difference between the rent that exceeds 30 percent of a
household’s monthly income and the actual rent charged.
Program Accomplishments
In 2009, 422 Lemon Grove residents were receiving Section 8 vouchers.
Program Evaluation
This program will be continued in the 2010-2020 Housing Element. The City’s ability to expand this
program or even maintain it at its current level is dependent upon the Federal budget process.
The City will make the information available at City Hall and will provide periodic reminders and updates
through City-wide information dissemination venues (web site, mail outs, notices, etc.). In addition to
these steps, the City will work with the County to insure that the County marketing efforts include

Program Accomplishments
The City continued to support this program and information was provided upon request. One person
residing in Lemon Grove participated in this program.
Program Evaluation
As the City’s housing stock ages, the need for housing rehabilitation to preserve neighborhood quality will
continue to increase. Therefore, the City will continue to promote these rehabilitation programs. The loan
and grant criteria has changed. This program will be continued in the 2010-2020 Housing Element.
The City will make information available about these programs at City Hall. It will also provide periodic
reminders and updates through City-wide information dissemination venues (web site, mail outs,

Program 16: Identify Sites for Homeless Shelters/Transitional Housing
Program Description Summary
State law requires that cities identify sites that are adequately zoned for the placement of homeless
shelters and transitional housing. Additionally, they must not unduly discourage or deter these uses. The
City will conduct analysis to consider the necessary changes to its Zoning Ordinance to add homeless
shelters and transitional housing into the residential definitions and to consider the removal of the
discretionary review process for homeless shelters and transitional housing.
In conjunction with other East County jurisdictions, the City of Lemon Grove proposes to continue
participation in the Regional Task Force on the Homeless. The City will consider participating in a
voucher program administered by the County that will provide motel accommodations for seniors, families
with children, and persons with disabilities. The City also will consider participating in an effort to fund a
cold weather shelter in the East County for persons who do not have the voucher.
The City will address the impediments to affordable housing as identified in the San Diego Regional
Analysis of Impediments, especially regarding the addition of explicit provisions for mobile homes,
manufactured housing, and transitional housing and emergency shelters to the City residential codes
within 12 months of adoption of the Housing Element.

New Construction
The City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) identified the need for zoning to accommodate at
least 242 new dwelling units from 2005 through 2010. This represents an average of 48 dwelling units
per year and is consistent with SANDAG’s projected growth for the City as found in the 2030 Regional
Growth Forecast. This forecast used a variety of factors, including land available for residential
development, to project the amount of new development in each jurisdiction. Within the County, the City
anticipated that much of the new construction would result from under-developed lands, especially as part
of the development plan for the Downtown Village Specific Plan area.
In addition to the goal of 242 new dwelling units, SANDAG set the affordability of the new dwelling units.
As shown, the goals of the City under the RHNA allocations are for 46 of the dwelling units to be available
to very low income, 32 to low income, 46 to moderate income, and 118 to above moderate income
households.
The City constructed fewer dwelling units than the RHNA during the 2005-2010 Housing Element period.
From 2005 through 2010, a total of 81 dwelling units were constructed, one-third of the quantified
objective. Several factors help to explain this shortfall: (1) increased State regulations increased the cost
of development; (2) the downturn in the economy and more stringent lending regulations created a
decrease in housing sales and housing prices (more affordable for potential home buyers, but
                                                     43

unprofitable for development investors when the cost of housing construction is higher than the sale
price); (3) the region produced less than its regional quantified objectives; and (4) the previous RHNA did
not accurately represent development trends (historical trends are 11.37 net new dwelling units from 1991
to 2009) and land availability (approximately 3 percent vacant) in Lemon Grove.
The City took a number of steps that would enable it to construct a substantial number of dwelling units
through under-developed lands during the 2010-2020 Housing Element cycle. Ten housing projects have
been either approved and/or entitled for a total of 301 dwelling units (3 moderate, 44 low, 49 very low,
and 11 extremely low income household deed restricted dwelling units). The development plans offer
significant potential for substantial infill development and redevelopment; the Downtown Village Specific
Plan contains a minimum density that may yield up to 819 dwelling units.
Rehabilitation
The City anticipated that 50 dwelling units would be rehabilitated between 2005 and 2010 through
participation in the housing rehabilitation programs. The income level goals are estimates based upon
the income requirements of the various rehabilitation programs. From January 1, 2005 to December 31,
2010, the City approved 1 multi-family alteration, 210 roof improvements, 162 single-family additions, and
172 single-family alterations. Based on comparable analyses, multi-family dwellings are assumed to be
affordable to low income households and single-family dwelling are assumed to be affordable to
moderate income households. The County of San Diego Home Repair Loan/Grant Program was utilized
by one person residing in Lemon Grove.
Conservation
The City’s quantified conservation Section 8 housing objective for the 2005-2010 Housing Element cycle
is 466 Section 8 certificates and vouchers. There were 466 Lemon Grove households receiving Section
8 vouchers in 2005, an increase of 188 vouchers over the previous five years. The City’s ability to
expand this program or even maintain it at its current level is dependent upon the Federal budget
process. Indications from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in
2005 were that Federal support for Section 8 would not be expanded and program retrenchment would
be likely through 2010. In 2009, 422 Lemon Grove residents were receiving Section 8 rental certificates
and vouchers, a decrease of 44 certificates/vouchers over the last four years.
Preservation
During the 2005-2010 Housing Element cycle, there were eight affordable dwelling units ““At-Risk”” of
converting to market rates (the Viazaga Apartments). The City monitored these affordable units and
considered measures to preserve their affordability prior to the expiration of their contracts. The Viazaga
project converted to market rates in 2007. Redevelopment monies were used to assist in the
development of Citron Court, an affordable housing project (total of 36 dwelling units). Citronica I and II,
both affordable housing mixed-use projects obtained land use entitlements (total of 136 dwelling units),
and Citronica I is under construction.

    available for development).
These changes show there continues to be a need for housing and jobs in the City. These changes also
show that the objectives, policies, and programs during the 2005-2010 Housing Element cycle were
effective in meeting the housing needs of the community. More emphasis on job creation is needed, but
is not the subject of the Housing Element. Providing affordable housing is expected to be more difficult
during future housing element cycles with the loss of the City’s redevelopment agency. However, the City
has sufficient higher density land and entitlements to meet its Regional Housing Needs during the 2010-
2020 Housing Element cycle.
As a result of the needs assessment, input received during the public workshops and hearings, and
discussions with staff, two issues and three opportunities were identified as among the key issues and
opportunities upon which the update to the housing element should focus:
        Two Key Issues:      (1) housing affordability and (2) the intensity of residential development
         (density).
                                                     48

        Three Key Opportunities: (1) using mixed-use and/or residential infill techniques; (2) programs
         for the provision of affordable dwelling units; and (3) using nonprofit housing developers.
These issues and opportunities are regional in nature, but the City of Lemon Grove is better positioned
than many other cities in the region to address these due to its proximity to major transit nodes, higher
affordable housing stock, and more progressive land use planning processes.
KEY ISSUES
The first issue, housing affordability within the San Diego region, is a combination of two factors: (1) the
cost of housing, both new construction and re-sale purchases and rentals; and (2) residents’ incomes.
Thus, housing price is correlated to resident income. Since 2004, the cost of rental housing increased
between 24 and 70 percent depending on the number of bedrooms. Although the cost of a median priced
home decreased 35 percent during the same time frame, a rapid increase in the cost of land and/or
housing construction will decrease the affordability of housing in Lemon Grove further.
The second issue, the amount of land available for residential development (especially higher density
land), also is less troubling in Lemon Grove than most other areas in the County. The City has a limited
amount of vacant land suitable for residential development. This issue is compounded by the perception
that, due to this lack of vacant available land, the City is becoming “built out.” The concept of being “built
out” often ignores the reality of underutilized commercial centers that can be converted into residential
mixed-uses. A number of unique opportunities exist within the City to capitalize on these processes and
proactively manage such change so that the City can not only address its housing needs but also provide
strong vibrant neighborhood centers. Much of its land may be already developed but the City will never
really be “built out.”
Relating to both housing affordability and the intensity of residential development is the dissolution of
redevelopment agencies. Redevelopment agencies were dissolved by the State of California on
February 1, 2012 (Supreme Court decision). Redevelopment monies are one of the three main funding
sources used to make affordable developments viable statewide. The others are State bond funds and
Federal funds, administered through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Federal
government is also expected to cut back on funding.
The proposed State budget redirects much of the redevelopment’s tax increment to local agencies and
service but does not provide for ongoing funding of affordable housing although there is pending
legislation to keep the 20 percent set-aside going. The budget however, does provide that existing
housing funds already in the redevelopment agencies’ (now successor agencies) accounts be transferred
to local housing authorities. These funds are available to complete affordable housing projects already
entitled, but no projects beyond those.
Although the impacts involved in the California Supreme Court decision may be unknown for several
years, many speculate that this decision will result in a loss of approximately one billion dollars of annual
funding designated for affordable housing. It is expected that new avenues for funding economic
development and affordable housing will be created and tested in the coming years, but because of the
uncertainty of available funds at this time, a conservative approach to new or continued programs is
recommended throughout this document.
                                                       49

KEY OPPORTUNITIES
The first key opportunity that offers the City a significant advantage as it prepares its housing strategies
has to do with the potential to better use the City’s available land, both vacant and already developed,
through a more proactive planning and design approach to development opportunities, using mixed-use
and/or residential infill techniques. The City has a number of opportunities where these concepts actually
could be applied in a way that would advance some new land use planning concepts.
The design development of the Downtown Village and neighborhoods, within the City’s existing density
and community character, would strategically position the City to not only better manage change and
create special places within the City but also help meet its housing challenges. The City already has
taken a number of important steps upon which it can build. For example, a key step in this process is the
ongoing efforts around the Trolley stations (Massachusetts and Lemon Grove Avenue - STA II) and
emerging efforts around the historic downtown Lemon Grove (Downtown Village Specific Plan). Other
important opportunities should arise as a result of normal private market development cycles, especially
of older, marginal strip commercial centers. The City is in a good position to leverage “smart growth”
resources in order to take the necessary steps to meet its share of the housing needs and to manage that
change in a proactive manner, resulting in new and vibrant neighborhood villages that are completely
consistent with the character of Lemon Grove and that also could become valuable community assets.
The City is actively preparing and designing plans to create opportunities for “Smart Growth Focus Areas”
as defined by the Regional Comprehensive Plan.
Additional potential types of areas that such efforts could consider would include:
    1. Older commercial centers needing revitalization;
    2. "Smart growth" potential areas, especially those centering around high level of service transit
         nodes;
    3. Areas where planned infrastructure would enable infill or additional residential development to
         occur;
    4. Existing residential areas where vacant and/or infill lots provide potential for additional residential
         capacity; and
    5. Areas where housing funds and/or CDBG investments could be used to compliment residential
         development, especially affordable housing.
The second key opportunity has to do with the provision of affordable dwelling units. The City already
has a number of existing housing programs which provide important resources for more affordable
housing. Based on the assessment of the effectiveness of these programs, some modifications and/or
additions may be necessary to increase their scope and impact. The initial analysis has identified a
number of potentially significant opportunities upon which the updated element could utilize: density
bonuses, accessory units, inclusionary zoning, infill and redevelopment and others. Other efforts in the
context of “smart growth” (for example potential regional transportation incentives and combining
possibly, CDBG, capital improvement priorities, etc.) offer some potential. As part of the assessment of
the effectiveness of their current programs, the City looked closer at some key programs to determine the
extent that the City can address its housing challenges.
                                                      50

The third key opportunity that the City should capitalize upon is potential asset that nonprofit housing
developers can play in assisting the City to meet its affordable housing objectives. The City was recently
successful with the development of Citron Court and the entitlements of Citronica I and II, all affordable
housing projects working in conjunction with affordable housing developers. The City could place more
emphasis on collaborative efforts between the City and non-profit corporations that partner with public
agencies in the provision of affordable housing. During the past few years, these agencies have
developed additional experiences and capabilities that could be a valuable resource for the City. Their
expertise and experience could be used to complement City staff skills and talents to deliver affordable
housing products that would be a community asset as well as address housing needs.

NEEDS ASSESSMEN

NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This section of the Housing Element discusses the major components of housing needs in Lemon Grove.
The major components of this need are the City’s population, household, land use, economic and housing
stock characteristics. Each of these components is presented in a regional context, and, where relevant,
in the context of the surrounding areas such as City of La Mesa (Grossmont and Mount Helix), City of
San Diego (Skyline and Paradise Hills), and the County of San Diego (Spring Valley). This needs
assessment will be important to the identification of the appropriate goals, policies, and programs for the
City to implement during the 2010-2020 Housing Element cycle.
HOUSING DEMAND CHARACTERISTICS
Population Characteristics
The 2010 Census states that Lemon Grove’s population is 25,320. Since the Census data is only
conducted every ten years, the SANDAG Current Estimates were used to estimate population growth
during the 2005-2010 Housing Element cycle.
The population in the region is growing. The 2004 SANDAG Current Estimates indicate the population of
the San Diego region was 3,010,023. The 2010 SANDAG Current Estimates indicated that the region’s
population had grown to 3,224,432, an increase of 7 percent, as shown by Figure 1. During this same
time period, Lemon Grove’s population increased 2 percent, from 25,573 in 2004 to 26,131 in 2010.
These are estimates of growth only.

Projected Population
Figure 2 compares projected population growth in the City of Lemon Grove to that of the surrounding
areas and the San Diego region based on SANDAG’s 2050 Regional Growth Forecast. Between 2008
and 2020, it is anticipated that the population of the San Diego region will grow by approximately 12.8
percent, a gain of 403,448 new residents. During this time period, Lemon Grove is expected to grow by
4.6 percent, a gain of 1,177 new residents. Between 2020 and 2030, the region’s population is projected
to increase by 9 percent, while the population in Lemon Grove is projected to increase by 5.5 percent.

Age Characteristics
Housing demand within the market is often determined by the preferences of certain age groups.
Traditionally, both the young adult population (20-34 years of age) and the elderly population tend to favor
apartments, low to moderate cost condominiums, and smaller single-family units. Persons between 35
and 65-years-old often provide the major market for moderate to high-cost apartments and condominiums
and larger single-family units because they tend to have higher incomes and larger sized households.
In 2008, the median age in Lemon Grove was 34.8, exactly .1 years lower than the regional median age
of 34.9.
                                                     56

Figure 3 compares resident age in Lemon Grove to that of the region. Lemon Grove has a smaller
percentage of young adults, residents between the ages of 20 and 34, than the region as a whole, but
has a higher percentage of middle aged adults, residents between the ages of 45 and 59, than the region
as a whole.

Race/Ethnicity Characteristics
Information on ethnicity is important to an analysis of housing demand, as ethnicity tends to correlate with
other characteristics such as family size, location choices, and mobility. They are also reflective of
income, as shown in Figure 4. In the San Diego region, non-White populations tend to have a higher
incidence of poverty.

Projected Dwelling Units
Many household characteristic factors may contribute to the need for housing, some of which are
described in this section: projected dwelling units, household size, and household income. In 2008 there
were 1,140,654 dwelling units in the region, an increase of 15 percent since 2000. In 2008, 0.8 percent of
the region’s dwelling units (8,820 dwelling units) were located in Lemon Grove.
Figure 7 shows that between 2008 and 2020, it is anticipated that the number of dwelling units in the San
Diego region will grow by 121,834, a gain of approximately 11 percent. During this time period, the
number of dwelling units in Lemon Grove is expected to increase by 256 new households, a gain of about
3 percent. The City will continue to account for slightly less than one percent of the region’s households.

Household Size
Household size is a significant factor in housing demand. Often, household size can be used to predict
the unit size that a household will select. For example, small households (1-2 persons per household)
traditionally can find suitable housing in units with 0-2 bedrooms while larger households (3 or more
persons per household) can usually find suitable housing in units with 3-4 bedrooms. People’s choices,
however, also reflect preference and economics. Thus, many small households prefer, and obtain, large
units. Household size is also related to choice of locations.
In 2008, the average number of persons per household in the San Diego region was 2.85. Lemon Grove
had an average of 2.98 persons per household, representing an increase from 2000, when 2.87 persons
per household was the average. Table 5 compares household size in Lemon Grove to household size in
the surrounding areas. With the exception of La Mesa, each of the surrounding areas has a higher
                                                      62

household size than the regional average. SANDAG estimated that average household size in the region
will begin to decrease. This decrease can be attributed to the trend toward smaller families in the
United States today, a growing elderly population, postponement of childbearing, and an increased
divorce rate. Smaller households should result in an increased demand for smaller sized dwelling units
and apartments.

Household Income
Income levels influence the range of housing prices within a community and the ability of the population to
afford housing. As household income increases, it is more likely that household is a homeowner. As
household income decreases, households tend to pay a disproportionate amount of their income for
housing and the number of persons occupying unsound and overcrowded housing increases.
Household incomes in Lemon Grove tend to be lower than those in the region as a whole. Median
household income in Lemon Grove was $43,781 in 2008, $8,138 lower than the median income for the
San Diego region.
                                                   63
Figure 8 compares household income in Lemon Grove and in the San Diego region in 2008 Lemon
Grove had a greater percentage (51 percent) of households earning between $30,000 and $75,000 than
the region as a whole, and a smaller percentage (19 percent) earning over $75,000. Nearly 32 percent of
Lemon Grove households earned less than $30,000 annually.

Special Needs Groups
The following special needs groups have a significant impact upon the demand for housing. Often these
groups “compete” for the same housing due to the lack of affordable housing. Identifying special needs
groups is necessary to fully assess Lemon Grove’s housing needs and to meet Housing Element
requirements. The special needs groups analyzed include the elderly, persons with disabilities, homeless
and transitional people, female headed households, migrant and/or farm workers, large households,
students, and extremely low income households (persons living in poverty). Many of these groups
overlap, for example many migrant and/or farm workers are homeless and many elderly people have a
disability of some type. The majority of these special needs groups would be assisted by an increase in
affordable housing, especially housing located near transit stations.

Elderly
The limited income of many elderly persons often makes it difficult for them to find affordable housing. In
the San Diego region, the elderly spend a higher percentage of their income for food, housing, medical
care, and personal care than non-elderly families. Many single elderly persons need some form of
housing assistance.
Table 8 shows that in 2009 there were 2,844 persons age 65 and over in Lemon Grove. This accounts for
11 percent of the City’s residents, similar to the percentage of elderly residents in the region as a whole.
Of the 2,844 elderly persons in the City, 1,560, or about 55 percent were age 75 and over.

Persons with Disabilities (Including Development Disabilities)
According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, a person is considered to have a disability if he or she has
difficulty performing certain functions (seeing, hearing, talking, walking, climbing stairs, and lifting and
carrying), or has difficulty with certain social roles (e.g., doing school work for children, working at a job,
and around the house for adults). A person who is unable to perform one or more activities, uses an
assistive device to get around, or who needs assistance from another person to perform basic activities is
considered to have a severe disability.
Four factors—affordability, design, location, and discrimination—significantly limit the supply of housing
available to households of persons with disabilities. The most obvious housing need for persons with
disabilities is housing that is adapted to their needs. Most single-family homes are inaccessible to people
with mobility and sensory limitations. Housing may not be adaptable to widened doorways and hallways,
access ramps, larger bathrooms, lowered countertops, and other features necessary for accessibility.
Location of housing is also an important factor for many persons with disabilities, as they often rely upon
public transportation to travel to necessary services and shops.
Additionally disabilities can hinder the ability of a person to earn an income adequate to afford housing.
According to 2010 American Community Survey Estimates, there are 130,295 persons with disabilities
                                                        71

between the ages of 18 to 64 who reside in San Diego County. Of those 1,108 (2,667 total in all age
ranges) live in Lemon Grove. Approximately 14 percent of these individuals residing in Lemon Grove are
living below the poverty level and could need additional support for affordable housing. Housing
advocacy groups report that persons with disabilities are often the victims of discrimination in the home
buying market. Persons with disabilities, whether they work or receive disability income are often
perceived to be a greater financial risk than persons without disabilities with identical income amounts.
According to the 2010 American Community Survey One Year Estimates, approximately 12 percent of the
total population of the United States has some kind of a disability compared to 10 percent for the City of
Lemon Grove. The likelihood of having a disability increases with age — nationally 37 percent of seniors
age 65 and over have a disability. Of the 2,778 persons age 65 and over residing in Lemon Grove in
2010, about 38 percent have some kind of disability. These numbers highlight a need to support and
encourage housing that is accessible and affordable to persons with disabilities.
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from working, restrict one’s
mobility, or make it difficult to care for oneself. Thus, persons with disabilities often have special housing
needs related to limited earning capacity, a lack of accessible and affordable housing, and higher health
costs associated with a disability. Some residents suffer from disabilities that require living in a supportive
or institutional setting.
                                                       72

As shown in Table 10, according the American Community Survey, approximately 9 percent (2,267) of
Lemon Grove residents five years of age and over had a disability. The Lemon Grove School District has
stated that there are 400 persons, aged 18 and under, enrolled in special education programs within the
District (statistic excluded from Table 10). The Census tallied the number of disabilities by type for
residents with one or more disabilities. Among Lemon Grove’s total population, approximately 3 percent
had hearing disabilities, 2 percent had vision disabilities, 4 percent had cognitive disabilities, 5 percent
had ambulatory disabilities, 2 percent had self care disabilities, and 4 percent had independent living
disabilities. The American Community Survey reported that 10.8 percent of persons with disabilities in
Lemon Grove were living below the poverty level. It is also estimated that 23 percent of the 463 people
with disabilities in the labor force between the ages of 18 and 64 years in the City were unemployed.

 The ACS definition of disability is based on six questions. A person is categorized as having a disability
if he or she or a proxy respondent answers affirmatively for one or more of these six categories:
      1. Hearing Disability (asked of all ages): Is this person deaf or does he/she have serious difficulty
           hearing?
      2. Visual Disability (asked of all ages): Is this person blind or does he/she have serious difficulty
           seeing even when wearing glasses?
                                                                     73

     3. Cognitive Disability (asked of persons ages 5 or older): Because of a physical, mental, or
          emotional condition, does this person have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or
          making decisions?
     4. Ambulatory Disability (asked of persons ages 5 or older): Does this person have serious difficulty
          walking or climbing stairs?
     5. Self-care Disability (asked of persons ages 5 or older): Does this person have difficulty dressing
          or bathing?
     6. Independent Living Disability (asked of persons ages 15 or older): Because of a physical, mental,
          or emotional condition, does this person have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a
          doctor’s office or shopping?
A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs of persons
with developmental disabilities. As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe,
chronic disability of an individual that:
         Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical
          impairments;
         Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
         Is likely to continue indefinitely;
         Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life
          activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-
          direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self- sufficiency;
         Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or
          generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or
          extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S. Administration on
Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of the population that can be defined
as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. This equates to 379 persons in the City of Lemon Grove with
developmental disabilities, based on the 2010 Census population.
According to the State’s Department of Developmental Services, as of June 2012, at least 121 Lemon
Grove residents with developmental disabilities were being assisted at the Developmental Center and
Regional Center and 36 of these persons with developmental disabilities were under the age of 18.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional housing
environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is
provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical
attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood,
the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
                                                         74

The most obvious housing need for persons with disabilities is housing that is adapted to their needs.
Most single-family homes are inaccessible to people with mobility and sensory limitations. Housing may
not be easily reconfigured to accommodate widened doorways and hallways, access ramps, larger
bathrooms, lowered countertops, and other features necessary for accessibility. Location of housing is
also an important factor for many persons with disabilities, as they often rely upon public transportation to
travel to necessary services and shops. “Barrier free design” housing, accessibility modifications,
proximity to services and transit, and group living opportunities are important in serving this group.
Incorporating barrier-free design in all new multi-family housing is especially important to provide the
widest range of choices for the disabled.
State and federal legislation mandate that a specified number of units in new or rehabilitated multi-family
apartment complexes be accessible to individuals with limited physical mobility. The City proposes to
offer flexibility in development standards for projects proposing housing affordable to seniors and persons
with disabilities. The City has not kept records of single-family homes that have been designed to
accommodate barrier-free elements. The City will begin a program to quantify these facilities.
As shown in Table 11, there are a number of residential care facilities that are located in Lemon Grove to
accommodate persons with disabilities.

Homeless
Throughout the country and the San Diego region, increases in homelessness are a growing concern.
Factors contributing to the rise in homelessness include a lack of housing affordable to low and moderate
income persons, increases in the number of persons whose incomes fall below the poverty level,
reductions in public subsidies to the poor, and the de-institutionalization of the mentally ill.
Legislation governing housing elements (Section 65583(1)(6)) mandates that municipalities address the
special needs of homeless persons within their jurisdictional boundaries. “Homelessness” as defined by
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, describes an individual (not imprisoned or
otherwise detained) who:
1. Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and
                                                                   75

2. Has a primary nighttime residence that is:
       A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living
        accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing for the
        mentally ill);
       An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized;
        or
       A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping
        accommodation for human beings.
This definition does not include persons living in substandard housing (unless it has been officially
condemned); persons living in overcrowded housing (e.g., doubled up with others), persons being
discharged from mental health facilities (unless the person was homeless when entering and is
considered to be homeless at discharge), or persons who may be at risk of homelessness (e.g. living
temporarily with family or friends.)
The Regional Task Force on the Homeless is San Diego County’s resource for information on issues of
homelessness. Established in 1985, the Task Force promotes a regional approach as the best solution to
ending homelessness in San Diego County. The Task Force is a public/private effort to build a base of
understanding about the multiple causes and conditions of homelessness. According to the Task Force,
the San Diego region’s homeless population can be divided into two general groups: (1) Sheltered, and
(2) Unsheltered. It is important to recognize that homeless individuals may fall into more than one
category (e.g., a homeless individual may be a veteran and a substance abuser), making it difficult to
accurately quantify and categorize the homeless.
Census information on homeless populations is often unreliable, due to the difficulty of sufficiently
counting a population without permanent residences. Given this impediment, local estimates of the
homeless and anecdotal information are often the source for homeless population numbers. The Task
Force produces estimates that are obtained using observations of homeless service providers; estimates
from local officials; reports from local surveys and studies; utilization rates of homeless facilities, services,
and meal programs; and estimated counts of persons observed at known locations. Table 12 shows that
the Task Force estimates that in Lemon Grove there were 24 homeless persons in 2012 compared to 50
homeless persons in 2004.

In addition to these services there is a church in Lemon Grove that provides shelter and assistance to
homeless persons periodically as part of the Interfaith Shelter Network. Churches that belong to the
Network rotate the responsibility of sheltering homeless families and individuals weekly during the winter
months. Saint John of the Cross Catholic Church provides volunteers and food for the homeless, and
allows the use of its facilities for up to one week to shelter the homeless. There are two case
management agencies located in El Cajon, CA, that function as screening agencies for the Network’s
East County Branch. The agencies are the Crisis House and Volunteers of America.
In compliance with State Senate Bill SB2, the Lemon Grove Municipal Code will be amended to allow
emergency shelters as a permitted use by right for all parcels within one of five suitable areas in the City
as shown in Map 5. A General Plan amendment, creating an emergency shelter overlay zone, is required
if the County Facility, North Avenue, and/or East Broadway areas are chosen to permit homeless
shelters.

                78
The areas shown on Map 5 are further described in Table 13. All five areas were specifically chosen as
possible locations to meet the potential needs for emergency shelters due to their commercial zoning and
proximity to transit, grocery stores, and social services. Land uses within these areas are required to
comply with performance standards related to noise, glare, traffic circulation, exposure to fire, explosion,
and hazardous materials, airborne emissions, and liquid and solid wastes. Many lots throughout these
areas are underutilized, containing only a small building on a portion of the lot. Existing uses within these
areas include office, auto repair, storage, warehousing uses, nonconforming single- and multi-family
residences, special needs housing, and churches. These sites could be redeveloped or converted for
appropriate shelter uses. Table 13 shows the number of parcels in each area, the average parcel size,
the area of undeveloped parcels, the average square footage of on-site buildings, the current vacancy
rate of buildings (based upon lack of business licenses). Using a ratio of 200 square feet per homeless
person and the 24 estimated homeless persons, a 4.800 sq. ft. building could accommodate Lemon
Grove’s estimated homeless population. A building of this type could be built or converted in all of the
areas shown in Table 13. There are realistic opportunities within each of these five areas for the
development or conversion of an emergency shelter.

Single Parents
Single parents with dependent children represent another important group with special housing needs.
Single-parent households often require special consideration and assistance because they tend to have
lower incomes and a greater need for daycare, health care, and related facilities. Table 14 shows that in
2009, Lemon Grove had 1,785 single parent households (up 572 households since 2000). Of these, the
majority (68 percent) were female-headed households. Approximately 12 percent of female-headed
households (down from 24 percent in 2000) in Lemon Grove lived below the poverty level, compared to
about 22 percent region-wide.

Migrant and/or Farm Workers
Due to the high cost of housing and low wages, a significant number of migrant and/or farm workers have
difficulty finding affordable, safe, and sanitary housing. It is estimated that a number of migrant and/or
farm worker camps are located throughout the San Diego region, primarily in rural areas. These
encampments range in size from a few people to a few hundred and are frequently found in fields,
hillsides, canyons, ravines, and riverbeds, often on the edge of their employer’s property. Some workers
reside in severely overcrowded dwellings, in packing buildings, or in storage sheds.
The housing needs of farm workers are frequently overlooked due to the migratory nature of farm labor.
Thus, farm workers are given low priority when addressing housing needs, and often receive the least
hospitable housing. Table 15 shows that in 2009 there were no agricultural or mining jobs reported to the
State of California’s Employment Development Department (EDD) for the City of Lemon Grove.
Agriculture does not play a significant role in Lemon Grove; therefore, it is unlikely that there is much, if
any, migrant/farm worker housing needs in the City.

Large Households
The U.S. Census Bureau defines large households as households in which 5 or more people reside.
Large households are identified as a group with special housing needs because of the limited availability
of adequately sized (four bedrooms or more) affordable dwelling units. Large households often have
lower incomes and frequently live in overcrowded smaller dwelling units, which can result in accelerated
unit deterioration. Table 16 compares the number of large households in Lemon Grove to that in the
region as a whole. In 2009, there were 1,041 households (1,290 in 2000) in Lemon Grove that consisted
of five or more persons. This accounts for almost 13 percent (reduced from 15 percent in 2000) of total
households in Lemon Grove, about 2 percent more than the region as a whole, indicating a slightly higher
percentage of large families in the City compared to the region. Large families generate a need for larger
dwelling units. However, one factor mitigating this need in Lemon Grove is the high proportion of single-
family homes and their relative affordability compared to the rest of the region.

Figure 11 shows that in Lemon Grove, large households tend to have a higher rate of homeownership.
Approximately 8 percent of the total households in Lemon Grove are owner occupied large households,
compared to about 5 percent that are renter occupied.

Students
The need for student housing is another significant factor affecting housing demand. Although students
may produce only a temporary housing need, the impact upon housing demand is critical in areas that
surround universities and colleges. Typically, students are low income, and are therefore affected by a
lack of affordable housing, especially within easy commuting distance from campus. They often seek
shared housing situations to decrease expenses, and can be assisted through roommate referral services
offered on and off campus. The lack of affordable housing also influences choices students make after
graduation, often with a detrimental effect upon the region’s economy if a student chooses to relocate.
College graduates provide a specialized pool of skilled labor that is vital to the economy; however the lack
of affordable housing often leads to their departure from the region.
Figure 12 shows that in 2009, approximately 9 percent (up from 7 percent in 2000) of Lemon Grove
residents were enrolled in college. Lemon Grove does not have a college or university within its
boundaries nor any housing specifically designated for students. However, several colleges, such as San
Diego State University, University of San Diego, and University of California, San Diego, are all within 15
miles of Lemon Grove.

Extremely Low Income Households
Households with extremely low income have a variety of housing situations and needs. Extremely low
income households may require specific housing solutions such as deeper income targeting for subsidies;
housing with supportive services; single-room occupancy (SRO’s) and/or shared housing; and rent
subsidies (vouchers). Extremely low income is defined as households with income less than 30 percent
of the area median income. However, the Official State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) Income Limits for 2011 revised the extremely low, very low, and low income
                                                      85

categories for San Diego County to be nine percent higher than the defined parameters. The area
median income in the County is $74,900. For extremely low income households, this results in an income
of $24,550 or less for a four-person household or $17,200 or less for a one-person household. Many
extremely low income households receive public assistance, such as social security insurance (SSI),
disability insurance, and/or Section 8 housing certificates and vouchers. Also, many extremely low
income households earn minimum wage or marginally higher. California’s minimum wage is $8 an hour.
A full time minimum wage worker makes approximately $16,640 a year which is considered extremely low
income for all household sizes.
Table 17 displays that, in 2009, approximately 2,129 extremely low income households resided in the
City representing 25.8 percent of the total households. Approximately 39 additional extremely low income
households are presumed to be located in Lemon Grove through 2020 (50 percent of the very low income
households from the RHNA). Table 43 shows that Lemon Grove has entitled housing projects to
accommodate 11 extremely low income households by 2020. This equates to a need to accommodate
28 extremely low income households through 2020. Most (63.6 percent) extremely low income
households are renters and experience a high incidence of housing problems. For example, 90.2 percent
of renting and 71.6 percent of ownership extremely low income households faced housing problems
paying greater than 30 percent of their income towards housing. Many extremely low income households
are overcrowded and/or without complete kitchen or plumbing facilities.

To address the needs for 28 extremely low income households, the City has listed sites ideal for
affordable housing (Table 44), prospective affordable housing developers (Program 14), and funding
possibilities for affordable housing projects (Program 17); has adopted a second unit housing program
                                                     86

(Program 2) and a density bonus program (Program 6); has entitled 303 dwelling units that could be
restricted to extremely low income households (Appendix D); and has the capacity for 1240 additional
dwelling units through 2020 (Table 39).
Land Use Characteristics
In 2008, most (96.8 percent) land in Lemon Grove was developed, as shown by Figure 13. None of the
land in Lemon Grove was undevelopable due to physical or environmental constraints such as steep
slopes, flood plains, or wetlands. This excludes properties with open space restrictions and easements.
Approximately 3.2 percent of land (80 acres total; 70.67 acres residential) was vacant and available for all
development.

Figure 14 compares development in Lemon Grove to that in the San Diego region. Lemon Grove has
significantly more residential development than the region as a whole. In 2008, nearly 60 percent of the
developed land in Lemon Grove was used for residential purposes, compared to nearly 18 percent in the
San Diego region. Lemon Grove has the highest proportion of residential land of all jurisdictions in the
region.

          Employment Characteristics
          To achieve a better balance between jobs and housing, it is important to consider the employment
          characteristics of a region. In the San Diego region, population growth out-paced employment growth
          between 2000 and 2008. This eight year period recorded a gain of more than 116,404 jobs, an increase
          of 8.4 percent, while population increased by 317,719 people, a growth rate of 11.3 percent.1
          Table 18 shows that in 2000 over 1.38 million San Diego region residents were employed. Region-wide,
          this figure represents an increase (15.8 percent) from 1990. Lemon Grove employment increased by
          nearly 13 percent between 1990 and 2000, from 7,639 residents employed to 8,582, but decreased to
          7,640 between 2000 and 2008 (13 percent).
          Lemon Grove is projected to have an increase in jobs by the year 2050. According to the SANDAG 2050
          Regional Growth Forecast, between 2008 and 2050, Lemon Grove is projected to gain approximately
          2,020 new employment opportunities within its boundaries, an increase of 26 percent. Furthermore,
          Approximately 501,958 new employment opportunities will be generated region-wide, an increase of 33
          percent.

Figure 15 shows that within Lemon Grove, the services sector was the largest employer (37 percent).
This sector encompasses a wide variety of occupations, including construction, finance, technical
services, insurance, real estate rental and leasing, and other miscellaneous services. The second
highest percentage of employment comes from retail trade (19 percent). Commercial development in
Lemon Grove has boosted the City’s retail business. A lack of anchor stores and an abundance of
discount retailers characterize the retail sectors in the City.

Table 19 shows that employment within Lemon Grove between 2010 and 2050 will add 671 employment
opportunities in the services sector and 328 employment opportunities in the manufacturing,
warehousing, transportation, and wholesale trade sector. Sectors with high levels of growth will include
finance, insurance, real estate, wholesale trade, and information services. The higher numerical increase
in the service and manufacturing, warehousing, transportation, and wholesale trade sectors, which often
consist largely of part-time and lower paying employment opportunities, may cause an increased demand
for affordable housing.

Commuting Patterns
Commuting patterns demonstrate the relation of housing to employment opportunities and are a
component in the allocation of growth to localities. As a result of the increase in the economic base,
employment levels, and physical separation of housing and employment sites, the number of people
commuting to work has increased.
Table 20 shows that in 2009, 77 percent of Lemon Grove residents drove alone to work, two percent
more than the San Diego region. Approximately 13 percent of residents carpooled, 1 percent walked, and
3 percent worked from home. Four percent of Lemon Grove residents used a form of public
transportation compared to three percent for the region as a whole. Lemon Grove is served by the San
Diego Trolley with two trolley stations, as well as major bus lines.

Housing Type
Figure 17 shows that in 2010, the largest percentage (65.6 percent) of dwelling units in Lemon Grove
were single-family detached units. Approximately 33.62 percent were multi-family and other, and 0.78
percent were mobile homes.

Table 23 shows that that while the overall number of single-family units in the Lemon Grove is projected
to increase by 2050, the percentage of these units as a component of the entire housing stock will
decrease slightly as more multi-family housing is added to the City’s downtown area. This trend, which
mirrors regional trends, will occur in response to limited land availability for single-family homes and a
continuing demand for housing.

Mobile Homes
Because of the potential cost advantages of manufactured housing and mobile homes, they often are
considered a significant source of affordable housing opportunities. Table 24 shows that in 2010, there
were 63 occupied mobile homes in Lemon Grove, accounting for 0.7 percent of the City’s total housing
stock and less than one percent of the total mobile homes region-wide.

Housing Age
Age of housing is an important characteristic because it is often an indicator of housing condition. Many
Federal and State programs use age of housing as one factor to determine housing needs and the
availability of funds for housing and/or community development. Figure 18 shows that the housing stock
in Lemon Grove is relatively old. Lemon Grove’s housing stock grew significantly between 1950 and
1959. Approximately 46 percent of dwelling units were built before 1960, 26 percent more than in the
region as a whole. This high percentage of older housing stock could indicate a growing need for housing
rehabilitation at varying levels to maintain the existing housing stock.

Housing Condition
Housing condition, or more specifically housing that has been identified as substandard, is an indicator of
housing need. Substandard dwelling units include those in need of repair and those in need of
replacement. The primary source of information about the number of substandard units within a
jurisdiction is the U.S. Census. The census includes data on units lacking plumbing facilities or the
percentage of units built before 1940 (although these are not always indicators of substandard
conditions).
Plumbing Facilities
Lemon Grove did not have a significant amount of substandard housing when considering such factors as
available plumbing facilities and housing age. According to the 2009 American Community Survey 3-Year
Estimates, 106 dwelling units in Lemon Grove lacked plumbing facilities.
Sewer Facilities
Lemon Grove currently has 6,723 parcels paying for City sewer services. There are 42 residential parcels
still on septic. This means there are at least 42 dwelling units in need of sewer services. Of the
remaining parcels in Lemon Grove, 28 may have no sewer or septic services and be in need of sewer
facilities.
Pre-1940 Housing
Dwelling units may be considered substandard by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) if they were built before 1940 and have a value less than $35,000. Table 25 shows
that only 3.7 percent of the housing stock in Lemon Grove was built before 1940.

Substandard Housing
The information presented above is only a partial indicator of housing conditions. The City has minimal
dwelling units in need of repair and/or rehabilitation. Code Enforcement staff receives complaints
regarding substandard housing and forwards these complaints to the San Diego County Department of
                                                    99
Environmental Health (DEH). DEH investigates the complaint; requires compliance with housing codes to
improve the overall quality and conditions of the site; notifies appropriate agencies as applicable; and
coordinates warnings, fines, abatement, and liens as appropriate until compliance is resolved. The code
enforcement process is continuously monitored for effectiveness.
City staff estimates that approximately 30-50 units in the City would be considered substandard. This
estimate is based upon a combination of statistics for housing units lacking plumbing and sewer facilities
and housing units built before 1940 and “windshield surveys” including observations and experiences of
City employees. Many of the rehabilitated units that are identified in the Quantified Objective portion of
the Housing Element are considered substandard and are eligible for the Home Repair and Home
Improvement Programs.

Housing Tenure
Tenure is an important market characteristic because it is directly related to housing types and turnover
rates. Figure 19 shows that in 2009, the majority (62 percent) of households in Lemon Grove were owner
occupied, compared to 56 percent region-wide. This high rate of ownership can partially be attributed to
the large number of detached single-family homes in the City and the relatively low cost of homes
compared to the region.

Existing Affordable Housing Developments
There are several affordable and senior housing developments in the City of Lemon Grove. Table 26 lists
those projects that are regulated by a government agency. Two of these projects are density bonus
projects. Density bonus projects are projects in which the developer received an increase in allowable
density in exchange for an agreement to keep a percentage of the dwelling units affordable or for senior
citizens. According to the San Diego County Analysis to Fair Housing Choice, the City of Lemon Grove
has 422 households with active Section 8 vouchers (rent subsidies restricting payments to no greater
than 30 percent of the household income). In addition to developments monitored by governmental
agencies, many potentially affordable units exist in the City that are not officially monitored or regulated,
such as second dwelling units, both illegally and legally developed.

Assisted Dwelling Units “At-Risk” of Converting to Market Rate Rents
Thousands of assisted dwelling units in San Diego are eligible to change from low income to market rate
housing during the next decade due to the termination of various government subsidy programs and/or
restrictions on rental rates. As rent subsidies and restrictions expire, lower income tenants may face
steep rent increases or even be displaced outright. The affected dwelling units are referred to as “At-
Risk” units. In 1989, Housing Element law was amended to require an assessment of at- risk units, along
with programs to reduce adverse impacts on lower income tenants.
The “At-Risk” units include projects receiving State and/or Federal assistance and units created through
local inclusionary housing, density bonus, or bond financing programs. The analysis of expiring subsidies
must include the period covered by the Housing Element, plus another five year period beyond that time.
The analysis below addresses all units in jeopardy of conversion by 2025.
                                                     103

Housing element law requires jurisdictions to provide an analysis and program for preserving affordability
of assisted housing developments. Currently two assisted housing developments in Lemon Grove are at
risk of conversion to market rate housing through 2025 and no units are at risk during the next cycle.
Lemon Grove has one rent restricted rental housing project that is subject to losing its low income use
restrictions during the 2010-2020 Housing Element cycle. The Hillside Terrace Apartments low income
units are subject to subsidy termination in 2017. Lemon Grove has a HUD Section 8 rental assistance
housing project (St. John’s Plaza) that is subject to losing its low income assistance during the 2010-2020
Housing Element cycle. St. John’s Plaza’s Section 8 contract will expire on August 25, 2016 unless
renewed. The property manager for St. John’s Plaza, Royal Property Management, has stated that the
owner plans to renew the Section 8 contract.
The City has initiated a program (Program 13) and conducted the following analysis regarding the
projects.
Based upon the existing County of San Diego programs and policies, the Hillside Terrace units are to
remain available to the low income tenants then occupying such units until one of four events happen: 1)
household income exceeds 80 percent of the income at which such household would qualify as a low
income tenant, 2) the household voluntarily moves out or is evicted for "good cause", 3) thirty years after
the commencement of the project period, and 4) the owner pays for the relocation of the tenant(s). At this
point the owner has not indicated what his intentions are.
Section 65583(a)(9)(b) requires the analysis of “At-Risk” housing to identify “the total cost of producing
new rental housing that is comparable in size and rent levels, to replace the units that could change from
low income use, and an estimated cost of preserving the assisted housing developments.” As mentioned
in the previous section, there are 133 units “At-Risk” of conversion by 2017. These units are located in
two projects that are privately owned.
Cost of Replacement Housing
For the Hillside Terrace Apartments, assuming 700 square feet for one bedroom units (19 dwelling units);
900 square feet for two bedroom units (15 dwelling units); total construction and land cost of about
$180/square foot; land cost of about $65 per square foot (the range has been $50 to $75 per square foot,
depending on location and views (none for this site)); and $115 per square foot for construction of a Type
5 building (wood and stucco over podium parking), the replacement costs would be $4,824,000 for land
and construction and another $1,173,000 for parking ($23,000 per parking stall (assume a total of 1.5 per
unit for a total of 51 spaces ). Thus, the cost to replace the “At-Risk” units with new construction would be
approximately $6 million.
For St. John’s Plaza, assuming 400 square feet for studio units (24 dwelling units); 540 square feet for
one bedroom units (75 dwelling units); and total construction and land cost of about $180/square foot
($65 per square foot for land (none for this site) and $115 per square foot for construction of a Type 5
building (wood and stucco over podium parking)), the replacement costs would be $9,018,000 for land
and construction and another $3,427,000 for parking ($23,000 per parking stall (assume a total of 1.5 per
unit for a total of 149 spaces ). Thus, the cost to replace the “At-Risk” units with new construction would
be approximately $12.4 million.
                                                      104

Preservation Cost Analysis
To determine the estimated market value of these units, current data on average assessed parcel prices
in Lemon Grove was used. Table 27 shows that the market value of the 133 “At-Risk” units is about $8.6
million. However, given the current high demand for housing, it is likely that acquisition costs would be
higher than these estimates.

Preserving the affordability of existing dwelling units is a primary goal of the City of Lemon Grove. This
analysis will estimate the potential cost of preserving these units through the purchase of an affordability
covenant or acquisition. The cost to acquire the units and preserve them as affordable would also be
substantial. Table 27 shows that the cost of acquiring an apartment building is approximately $65,221
per unit. A constraint to acquisition is the owners of the units in question may not be interested in selling
the properties (or selling a share in ownership to a local non-profit to manage the affordable units).
The cumulative gap between the market-rate rents and affordable rents for the 133 affordable units would
be approximately $66,500 to $79,800 a month ($500-600 per month depending on the occupant’s income
multiplied by 133 units) or $798,000 to $957,600 a year.
Conclusions
Although direct subsidies to tenants and/or landlords to close the gap are not proposed at this time, the
analysis suggests that it would be more cost-effective to subsidize the existing units, or acquire the
properties outright, than to build new units. Citronica I development was issued building permits on
December 5, 2011 and includes 55 new affordable housing units (6 extremely low; 26 very low; and 23
low). Phase I of the Citronica II development is entitled and includes 49 new affordable housing units (5
extremely low; 23 very low; and 21 low).
Government Code section 65583 requires the City to identify local non-profit corporations which have the
“legal and managerial capacity to acquire and manage” the “At-Risk” units or the apartment complexes
containing “At-Risk” units. The City also is required to identify the Federal, State, and local financing and
subsidy programs that may be considered to preserve these units. A number of non-profit housing
developers are active in East San Diego County and could assist the City in the preservation of the “At-
Risk” units:
                                                             105

   Cascade Housing Association (limited partners with Hitzke Development)
   Interfaith Housing
   Habitat for Humanity
   Metropolitan Area Advisory Committee (MAAC)
There also are private developers in the east county, including the owners of the “At-Risk” projects
themselves, who might be interested in participating in their preservation. The property manager for St.
John’s Plaza stated that the property owner intends to renew their Section 8 contract. Developers may
have access to State and Federal tax credit funding, and to rehabilitation loans.
Potential funding sources to assist in the preservation of “At-Risk” units include CDBG and Home funds,
the Low income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), the Tax-Exempt Multi-Family Housing Revenue Bond
Program, the Tax Credit for Low Income Rental Housing Program, and the Housing Opportunities for
Persons with AIDS (HOPWA). Developers can use these programs to help acquire an ownership share
in the complexes containing “At-Risk” units. These program funds are typically used to leverage
additional investment from the private sector. The California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) may also
provide subsidy assistance for the acquisition of below market projects.
Redevelopment agencies were dissolved by the State of California on February 1, 2012 (Supreme Court
decision). Redevelopment monies are one of the three main funding sources used to make affordable
developments viable statewide. The others are State bond funds and Federal funds, administered
through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Federal government is also expected
to cut back on funding.
The proposed State budget redirects much of the redevelopment’s tax increment to local agencies and
service but does not provide for ongoing funding of affordable housing although there is pending
legislation to keep the 20 percent set-aside going. The budget however, does provide that existing
housing funds that are already in the redevelopment agencies’ (now successor agency) accounts be
transferred to local housing authorities. These funds are available to complete affordable housing
projects already entitled, but no projects beyond those. It is expected that new avenues for funding
affordable housing will be created and tested in the coming years.
The City also will explore direct negotiations with “At-Risk” project owners to extend the terms of the
affordability restrictions. There may be financial incentives the City can offer, or disincentives to raising
the rents to market levels. This is particularly true if the owner is seeking additional bond financing,
rehabilitation assistance, or conducting other transactions which require City approval or participation. To
the extent feasible, extensions of below market rental agreements should keep the units affordable for as
long as possible. In the event preservation of any of the “At-Risk” units is infeasible, the City and County
program requirements, as described above, may protect tenants and avoid displacement.
There are 133 assisted dwelling units in Lemon Grove at risk of converting to market rates by 2017. The
City will work proactively with the owners of these properties and with local non-profits in an attempt to
preserve the long-term affordability of the units. The City will obtain existing information published by
HCD summarizing the timelines and requirements associated with converting subsidized housing to
market rates. The City will gather and make available to its citizens information identifying local agencies
that provide tenant relocation assistance and rental subsidies. A copy of California Government Code

Sections 65838.10 and 65838.11 describing federal noticing requirements for landowner submitting Intent
to Pre-Pay or Opt-Out Notices for federally funded housing shall be made available within the City. This
information will be provided on the City website and/or will be made available at the City’s public
information counters.
MARKET INDICATORS
Housing Costs
Housing costs are indicative of housing accessibility to all economic segments of the community.
Typically, if housing supply exceeds housing demand, housing costs will fall. If housing demand exceeds
housing supply, housing costs will rise. In Lemon Grove, housing costs tend to be lower than in the San
Diego region. The lower cost of housing can be attributed to factors such as the older housing stock, the
City’s inland location, associated lower land costs, and slow economic growth.
Renter Costs
The primary source for renter costs in the San Diego region is the San Diego County Apartment
Association (SDCAA). The SDCAA conducts two surveys of rental properties per year. For the
spring 2011 survey, nearly 6,000 surveys were sent out to rental property owners and managers
throughout San Diego County. Responses were received from over 25,000 dwelling units. Although this
survey sampled a broad variety of rental housing, it was not a scientific sampling.
                                                     107

Table 28 shows that in the spring of 2011, average monthly rents in Lemon Grove ranged from $850 for a
studio apartment to $1,362 for a three-bedroom apartment. The average apartment rent in Lemon Grove

Owner Costs
Figure 20 shows that the vast majority (approximately 80 percent) of owner-occupied housing in Lemon
Grove had values less than $500,000 in 2009. By comparison, nearly 50 percent of the owner occupied
houses in the San Diego region had values greater than $500,000.

Vacancy Rates
Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator because they show the degree of choice available. High
vacancy rates usually indicate low demand and/or high supply conditions in the housing market. Too high
of a vacancy rate can be difficult for owners trying to sell or rent. Low vacancy rates usually indicate high
demand and/or low supply conditions in the housing market. Too low of a vacancy rate can force prices
                                                      110

up making it more difficult for low and moderate income households to find housing. Vacancy rates
between two to three percent are usually considered healthy for single-family housing; and five to six
percent for multi-family housing. However, vacancy rates are not the sole indicator of market conditions.
They must be viewed in the context of all the characteristics of the local and regional market.
The San Diego County Apartment Association (SDCAA) is the primary source of vacancy rate information
in the San Diego region. The Apartment Association sends out surveys to rental property owners and
managers throughout San Diego County twice a year. As this represents only a sampling of rental
properties, the numbers do not represent the entire housing stock, but they assist in analyzing vacancy
trends throughout the region.
Table 30 shows that of the 165 dwelling units surveyed in Lemon Grove in the spring of 2011, there were
7 vacancies. This equates to a vacancy rate of 4.2 percent. The SDCAA estimates that the regional
vacancy rate was approximately 3.9 percent in the spring of 2011.

Overcrowding
The combination of low incomes and high housing costs has forced many households to live in
overcrowded housing conditions. The Census Bureau defines an “overcrowded” dwelling unit as one
occupied by 1.01 or more persons per room in the house (including kitchen, living room, etc., but
excluding bathrooms). Under State law a dwelling unit is considered overcrowded if there is less than 120
square feet of livable space (all space except the bath, kitchen and hallways) for the first two people and
less than an additional 50 square feet for each additional person. Overcrowding can indicate that a
community does not have an adequate supply of affordable housing and/or dwelling units, especially for
large families.
                                                    111

Table 31 shows that using the Census definition of 1.01 or more persons per room, approximately 5
percent of households in Lemon Grove were overcrowded in 2009, similar to the number of overcrowded
households in the region as a whole.

Figure 22 shows that owner occupied households in Lemon Grove are less overcrowded than renter
occupied households (again using the Census definition of overcrowding). In Lemon Grove,
approximately 63 percent of overcrowded households are renter occupied (renters comprise only 38

 Overpayment
 Measuring the portion of a household’s gross income that is spent for housing is an indicator of the
 dynamics of demand and supply. This measurement is often expressed in terms of overpaying:
 households paying an excessive amount of their income for housing, therefore decreasing the amount of
 disposable income available for other needs. This indicator is an important measurement of local housing
 market conditions as it reflects the affordability of housing in the community. Federal and State agencies
 use overpayment indicators to determine the extent and level of funding and support that should be
 allocated to a community. State and Federal programs typically define overpayers as those lower income
 households paying 30 percent or more of household income for housing costs.
 Table 32 shows that in 2009, approximately 49 percent of all households in the San Diego region were
 paying 30 percent or more of their income towards housing costs. In Lemon Grove, 53 percent of all
 households were overpaying. Renters were more likely to overpay than owners; in Lemon Grove; 61
 percent of renters overpaid, compared to 49 percent of owners. The distinction between renters
 overpaying for housing and owners overpaying for housing is important because while homeowners may
 financially overextend themselves to afford the option of home purchase, the owner always maintains the
 option of selling the home. Renters, on the other hand, are limited to the rental market and generally are
 required to pay the rent established by that market.

Table 36 shows the 2011 San Diego County Income Limits for a four person household. These income
limits can be used to calculate the affordability of market rate dwelling units. Affordability is calculated by
dividing the monthly rent or mortgage by 30 percent (expected percentage of income towards housing),
times twelve (number of months in a year), and categorizing according to income and size of household
(number of bedrooms plus one) utilizing HCD’s Official State Income Limits for 2011 (excludes utilities,
home owner’s association fees, etc).

HOUSING RESOURCES
This section evaluates the potential residential development that could occur based on the Lemon Grove
General Plan, specific plans, the Municipal Code, and approved projects.
LAND INVENTORY
Availability of Suitable Sites
Housing Element law mandates that a city must show that it has adequate sites with required public
services and facilities for a variety of housing types for all income levels. In this section, adequate sites
will be discussed in terms of the City’s regional share goals  the City’s share of the region’s housing
needs for 2010-2020.
Regional Share Goals
According to State law, local jurisdiction’s housing needs assessments must include their share of the
projected needs for housing in the region (regional share). The San Diego Association of Governments
(SANDAG) has identified Lemon Grove’s share of regional housing needs for 2010-2020. The figures are
contained in the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), which was adopted in October 2011. Each
jurisdiction must identify the sites (capacity) to meet their share of the region’s housing needs. The
regional share identifies the need for new dwelling units for each jurisdiction and distributes the projected
housing need to all income groups: very low, low, moderate, and above moderate. As part of the RHNA
process, SANDAG designated minimum default density standards for both suburban and metropolitan
jurisdictions in lieu of restricting dwelling units to lower income households. These sites must demonstrate
their ability to be affordable to lower income households. Housing projects that have obtained
entitlements or have been constructed shall be based on either their deed restricted affordability or their
monthly rent or mortgage (monthly mortgage based on actual purchase price with loan amortized for 30
years at 4.75 percent annual interest plus 30 percent for property mortgage insurance, lender fees,
mortgage brokerage fees, property taxes, etc. and excludes Home Owner's Association (HOA) dues).
Affordability shall be based on 30 percent or less of the household income of each income level and shall
be based on the size of the household (number of bedrooms plus one). The 2011 State Department of
Housing and Community Development Income Limits for San Diego County released June 24, 2011 were
used to determine each income level.
                                                         121

Table 38 shows Lemon Grove’s regional share goal and the income distribution of the goal as
established by SANDAG. Lemon Grove accounts for 0.2 percent of the region’s projected housing needs,
or 309 dwelling units. Lemon Grove may supply very low and low income housing, as required by the
RHNA, by providing sufficient vacant, infill or redevelopment land to accommodate for dwelling units at a
minimum density of 30 dwelling units per acre or more.

Capacity to Meet Regional Share Goals
Table 39 shows that by using vacant, redevelopment and infill residential land, the City has the capacity
to meet its regional share goals for all income levels. Based on these three categories, the City has the
capacity for an additional 1240 dwelling units of housing – over 4 times the City’s regional share need of
309 units. Of the 143 acres of land, 8 acres can be developed at densities high enough to support the
construction of 403 very low and low income dwelling units, as defined by SANDAG, and 23 acres can be
developed at densities high enough to support the construction of 450 moderate income units. The
remaining 112 acres can be developed at densities more suitable to above moderate income housing
speculated to yield 387 additional units. The Lemon Grove Vacant and Infill Developable Land Housing
Resource Study, 2011 is attached as Appendix B which contains a list of parcels by APN and a site by
site assessment in response to the requirements of Government Code Section 65583.2.
During the last Housing Element cycle, Lemon Grove has developed approximately 14 dwelling units per
year. With the adoption of the Downtown Village Specific Plan (DVSP) area, the City has the capacity to
develop 819 additional dwelling units within the next 38 years. The Main Street Promenade District in the
DVSP will yield approximately 242 new dwelling units at densities greater than 30 dwelling units per net
acre. Citronica I, located in the Main Street Promenade District, is under construction and provides 56
dwelling units. Citronica II, also located in the Main Street Promenade District, will provide 86 senior
dwelling units. The City’s largest vacant parcel on the southwest corner of the City is expected to be
developed during this Housing Element cycle and would yield an additional 78 single-family dwelling
units.

     Redevelopment Land Inventory Analysis for STA I and II, and the Lemon Grove Downtown Village Specific
     Plan
The City’s overall dwelling unit capacity is based on vacant residential land capacity and infill and
redevelopment land capacity. Each of these categories is described in greater detail below. All sites
included in the land inventory were reviewed with the standards of Government Code Section 65583.2 as
part of the analysis:
    Environmental Constraints: The inventory takes into account any environmental constraints (habitat,
     flood and noise hazards, steep slopes, and other constraints) in two mutually compatible layers.
     First, the SANDAG regional land use inventory and GIS layers eliminate, or limit, unit yield of sites if
     they are environmentally constrained lands. Secondly, as part of the City’s more parcel specific land
     inventory, additional site specific constraints are applied. Any environmental constraints that would
     lower the potential yield (e.g. steep slopes) have already been accounted for in the site/unit analysis
     and in essence double checked.
    Existing and Planned Infrastructure Capacity: Full urban level services are available, or are planned
     as part of the City’s Capital Improvements Program (CIP), throughout the City and specifically to each
     site in the inventory. Such services are, or will be, in place and more than adequate for the potential
     unit yield on each site. Specifically, water and sewer service are available, or are programmed to be
     made available, for all the sites included in the inventory. The City has sufficient total water and
     sewer capacity to accommodate its total residential capacity, 1240 dwelling units, well above its total
     share of the regional housing need.
    Method Used to Calculate Realistic Capacity: Specific assumptions are identified for each category in
     the following analysis, basically density as applied to the specific site times the number of
     developable acres. The net lot area is utilized to calculate the project density. This capacity
     assumption accounts for site improvements and land use controls and represents realistic
     assumptions for the planning period (Table 40 Recent Development Trends). This analysis
     demonstrates that the City’s zoning and development standards does not impede the City’s ability to
     achieve maximums; 150 percent of minimum density is assumed to be maximum density based on
     the development standards of the DVSP area.
                                                      123

    Zoning Considered Appropriate to Encourage and Facilitate Housing for Lower Income Households:
     Each category was considered on the underlying zoning category for its potential to encourage and
     facilitate housing for lower income housing. See the specific assumptions for each category.
Table 40 indicates that since 1990, Lemon Grove developed its dwelling units at an average of 88
percent of the maximum allowable density for all major subdivisions. Lemon Grove conservatively
assumes that future dwelling units will be developed at 75 percent of maximum density. The assumption
is less than that shown because minor subdivisions were not factored into the average shown in the table.
Minor subdivisions yield a lesser density because there is a greater remainder per lot when calculating
the maximum number of units allowed.

Residential Infill and Redevelopment Land
In addition to vacant land, the City has identified 87.49 acres of land that have infill or redevelopment
potential as shown in the next table. Redevelopment areas are currently developed areas with the
potential to change their land use based on general plan/zoning designations, such as an existing single-
family development in an area where the plan allows multi-family densities. Infill areas are developed
areas with the potential to intensify the existing land use, such as adding more single-family units to a
single-family area through lot splits. Of the total 87.49 acres, 46.22 acres have infill potential and 41.27
acres have redevelopment potential.
Mixed-Use Special Treatment Areas (STAs)
Residential development potential exists on land designated as mixed-use. The City has designated
23.88 acres of land for mixed-use development. Mixed-use development allows a mix of retail, office,
apartment, and condominium development.
The mixed-use designations are located in two areas of the City, Downtown Village Specific Plan (DVSP)
area and Special Treatment Area (STA) II. In both locations, the mixed-use concept is primarily intended
to encourage increased transit use and would provide a residential population to help support local
commercial uses. As shown in Table 42, the DVSP area and STA II account for 1,610 additional dwelling
units.
The DVSP area is a traditional downtown commercial district located around the intersection of Broadway
and Lemon Grove Avenue. A mix of retail and office uses presently dominates this area, but some
multiple family residences also are situated there. Other important features include the downtown trolley
station, the Main Street Promenade, City Hall, and Fireman’s Park.
The development potential of the DVSP area includes the following assessments:
1. Environmental: No significant environmental issues or mitigations were identified during the
     environmental analysis.
2. Development Trends and Market Conditions: Lemon Grove has not experienced any redevelopment
     on the scale as proposed in the DVSP area. The surrounding East County cities have had remarkable
     success with redevelopments very similar to the DVSP area. For example, both the cities of La Mesa
     and El Cajon, the immediate adjacent cities, have had major redevelopment projects completed
     recently and are proceeding on to their next stages at residential capacities equal to, or in excess of,
     the DVSP area. As the residential development community in the San Diego region restructures itself
     to take advantage of the potential for infill and redevelopment (due to the dramatic decline in available
     large new planned communities), it is important to note that every city in the San Diego region
     surrounding Lemon Grove that has proceeded with redevelopment with a residential component has
     succeeded: National City, San Diego (especially in the Central Business District), Chula Vista, the
     eastern community planning areas in the City of San Diego, and Santee. The residential component
     has played a significant part in the more recent projects. Lemon Grove, while no one can guarantee
     private market behavior, certainly appears to be well positioned to realize a significant and successful
     redesign of their downtown community and provides additional housing opportunities.

3. Redevelopment Characteristics: The existing uses in the DVSP area and the remaining STA’s are
     very favorable to redevelopment. The sites are strategically located downtown; close to transit
     (Trolley Station on site and close to the I-94 interchange); existing low density; marginal economic
     uses; large tracts of undeveloped lands; and elements of deterioration.
4. Regulatory Framework:           The DVSP establishes a very encouraging development regulatory
     framework.
Massachusetts Station (STA II) - The Massachusetts Station STA encompasses the existing commercial
site across from the Massachusetts Avenue trolley station. Currently, the site is within the Central
Commercial Zone. Redevelopment of the site with a mix of residential and neighborhood commercial is
planned to achieve two primary goals: 1) increase the number of residents that can walk to the trolley
station and use the trolley to commute, and 2) establish neighborhood shopping opportunities to reduce
driving and encourage walking and bicycling.
The dwelling unit potential for DVSP and STA II is included in the City’s redevelopment and infill dwelling
unit potential described in Table 42.
In addition, the City allows dwelling units above commercial establishments in the General Commercial
(GC) zone as accessory uses and are subject to a conditional use permit.
A more detailed list of each parcel in the DVSP area and STA II are listed in Appendix C. These
development areas offer a number of favorable characteristics that strongly suggest the successful
implementation of the plans: the size of the parcel aggregation (41 acres); the absence of any
environmental or geographic constraints (flat, relatively undeveloped land); the proximity of the sites to full
service transit (the Trolley station is adjacent to the site); the recent market success of similar projects in
adjacent East County jurisdictions (La Mesa, Santee, and El Cajon); the relatively small amount of
displacement of existing uses; the support of the Regional Comprehensive Plan by SANDAG and its
designation of the sites as part of the “Smart Growth Opportunity Areas”; and the presence of strong
political and community support for the projects.
Residential Special Treatment Areas (STAs)
In addition to the DVSP area and STA II, the City also has designated STA IV, West Central Residential,
and STA VIII, Eastern Central Avenue for residential development.
Located in the vicinity of Central Avenue and College Avenue intersection, the vacant and infill land within
the West Central Residential STA IV was originally designated as future right-of-way for the College
Avenue extension project. The City abandoned the project and designated the right-of-way area for
residential development, similar to nearby land use patterns. STA IV consists of a mixture of individually
owned lots and some land owned by the City. The topography slopes moderately towards the center of
the site and features a ravine running westward. This STA is intended for new, low density residential
development consistent with the neighboring community to the southwest.
STA VIII, Eastern Central Avenue, allows for residential development of up to 29 dwelling units per acre
and building heights of two stories or 25 feet.

Second Units
Second Units, also referred to as “Accessory Rental Dwelling Units” (or “Granny Flats” in other
jurisdictions), are permitted by right in Lemon Grove’s residential zones and have accounted for 32
percent of housing units constructed during the last Housing Element period (4.33 dwelling units per year
on average from 2005-2010). This development trend is expected to continue at the same rate from
2012-2020 equating to 39 anticipated swelling units. Historically, Second Units have been affordable to
low income households and this affordability trend is also expected to continue.
Anticipated Dwelling Units by Income Category 2010-2020
Appendix D identifies existing approved and/or constructed projects since January 1, 2010 that are
expected to be developed during this Housing Element cycle. There are 98 dwelling units anticipated in
the Village Commercial 5 area (VC5) that are not associated with an approved project; however, the VC5
area is identified as a site opportunity for affordable housing in Table 44. Non-profit low-income housing
developers are attracted to Lemon Grove’s Downtown Village Specific Plan Area (DVSP). Hitzke
Development, a non-profit low income housing developer, is actively developing low-income housing
within this area. Low income housing within the DVSP area is the most common inquiry from developers
at this time.
Each project identified in Appendix D is categorized by its affordability to various income levels. Based
on these projects, Table 43 demonstrates that Lemon Grove has the potential to have building permits
issued or finaled for 548 dwelling units between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020, exceeding the
RHNA by 239 dwelling units. Of the 136 very low and low income RHNA, Lemon Grove has the potential
to have building permits issued or finaled for 248 dwelling units between January 1, 2010 and December
31, 2020, exceeding the RHNA by 112 dwelling units.

The projects listed in Appendix D, “Existing Projects Inventory, 2011”, do not include six vacant properties
zoned Residential Medium/High (RM/H) with an allowable density of up to 29 dwelling units per net acre
(Appendix B). These six vacant properties are anticipated to yield 69 additional housing units affordable
to low income households.
Table 44 identifies potential affordable housing sites that could increase the anticipated affordable
dwelling units. Further, recent development trends show that market rate rentals of new second units in
Lemon Grove are affordable to low or very low income persons and market rate rentals or sales of new
single-family residences are affordable to moderate income persons.2 The San Diego Apartment
Association rent analysis in 2011 shows that average rents are affordable to low income households for
studios and two and three bedroom apartments and very low income households for one bedroom
apartments.3 Therefore, the 294 market rate above moderate income dwelling units identified in Table
43, consisting of single-family residences, condominiums, townhomes, and apartments, will most likely be
affordable to very low, low, and moderate income households. This creates a greater need for above
moderate housing in Lemon Grove.
Site Opportunities for Affordable Housing
Table 44 shows existing sites ideal for new affordable housing. Fourteen sites are identified. Four of
these sites encompass the Village Commercial 5 (VC5) mixed-use area in the DVSP and two encompass
the Central Commercial (CC) mixed-use area. These mixed-use sites were identified based upon their
larger lot size, their proximity to the trolley stations, and their allowable density being greater than 30
dwelling units per acre. The other sites are identified because of their availability and entitlements. Table
44 can be utilized by prospective affordable housing developers and will be updated on an ongoing basis.

Opportunities for Siting Homeless Shelters, Transitional Housing, and Single
Room Occupancies (SRO)
State law requires that cities identify sites that are adequately zoned for the placement of homeless
shelters and transitional housing. Additionally, they must not unduly discourage or deter these uses. A
transitional housing facility is defined as housing for people transitioning from temporary housing into
permanent housing. People usually stay in transitional housing for a term of about 18-24 months.
Currently, the City does not specifically define or classify homeless shelters or transitional housing in its
Municipal Code but allows Residential Care Facilities in certain zones with approval of a Conditional Use
Permit. During the 2010-2020 Housing Element cycle, the City will amend its ordinance to include the
process for siting these uses.
One site at 1790-1822 Dayton Drive contains 24 studios with shared kitchen facilities (four studios per
kitchen) within an established single-family residential area. In 2011, this site was for sale for $1.1 million
and may be an ideal SRO and/or transitional housing site.
Opportunities for Siting Farmworker Housing
Housing Element Law requires that cities identify adequate sites that will be made available through
appropriate zoning and development standards and with services and facilities, to facilitate and
encourage the development of housing for agricultural employees. In Lemon Grove, there is not a
specific need for farm worker housing, as demonstrated in the Needs Assessment of this document.
Agriculture does not play a significant role in Lemon Grove as the City had no agricultural jobs as of 2009.
Availability of Public Services and Facilities
The City of Lemon Grove currently has adequate public services and facilities to serve all residential
developments within the City. Additionally, development impact and permit processing fees are assessed
to support the development of any additional infrastructure that may be needed to support new
development.
Opportunities for Energy Conservation
The primary uses of energy in urban areas are transportation, lighting, water heating, and space heating
and cooling. The high cost of energy demands that efforts be taken to reduce or minimize the overall level
of urban energy consumption.
Title 24, Building Energy Standards for Residential Development, establishes energy budgets or
maximum energy use levels. The standards of Title 24 supersede local regulations, and State
requirements mandate Title 24 requirements through implementation by local jurisdictions. The City will
continue strict enforcement of local and State energy regulations for new residential construction, and will
continue providing residents with information on energy efficiency. Information about San Diego Gas &
Electric energy conservation and retrofit programs will be provided at City Hall and periodic articles in the
City newsletter will educate the community about the benefits of energy conservation.
                                                     134
The City’s goal is to achieve maximum use of conservation measures and alternative, renewable energy
sources in new and existing residences. New development including public projects will incorporate
energy efficient equipment and building techniques to reduce overall power consumption. Site design,
structural orientation, and building materials influence energy requirements.
By encouraging and assisting residents to utilize energy more efficiently, the need for costly, new energy
supplies, and the social and economic hardships associated with any future shortages of conventional
energy sources will be minimized.

 CONSTRAINTS TO THE
PROVISION OF HOUSING

CONSTRAINTS TO THE PROVISION OF HOUSING
Actual or potential constraints to the provision and cost of housing affect the development of new housing
and the maintenance of existing dwelling units for all income levels. Governmental and non-governmental
constraints are discussed below.
GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Governmental constraints can limit the operations of the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, making it
difficult to meet the demand for affordable housing and limiting supply in a region. Governmental
constraints include growth management measures, inclusionary zoning, land use controls, building codes,
processing fees, and site improvement costs.
Land Use Controls
Land use controls can take a number of forms that affect the development of residential units. The
General Plan, a comprehensive, long-range and general policy statement, establishes the overall
character and development of the community. The City’s General Plan identifies a broad range of
residential land use categories. The plan provisions in Lemon Grove do not constrain the opportunity for a
broad range of housing types and densities.
Zoning ordinances directly shape the form and intensity of residential development by providing controls
over land use, heights and volumes of buildings, and open space on a site. According to SANDAG’s 2050
Regionwide Forecast, 1,453 acres (62 percent) of the City’s total land inventory are in residential uses,
including single-family homes, multi-family units, and mobile homes. Residential densities in Lemon
Grove cover the following categories:
1. Residential Low Density:                        RL (4 DU/acre max.)
2. Residential Low/Medium Density:                 RLM (7 DU/acre max.)
3. Residential Medium Density:                     RM (14 DU/acre max.)
4. Residential Medium/High Density:                RMH (29 DU/acre max.)
5. Residential Professional (Mixed-Use):           RP (43 DU/acre max.)
6. Transit Mixed-Use 3 (Mixed-Use):                TMU3 (25 DU/acre min.)
7. Transit Mixed-Use 5 (Mixed-Use):                TMU5 (35 DU/acre min.)
8. Transit Mixed-Use 7 (Mixed-Use):                TMU7 (45 DU/acre min.)
                                                     139

9. Village Commercial 3 (Mixed-Use):          VC3 (25 DU/acre min.)
10. Village Commercial 5 (Mixed-Use):         VC5 (35 DU/acre min.)
The City of Lemon Grove Municipal Code was recently modified to allow for accessory residential uses in
commercial and industrial zones.
Table 45 provides a summary of the City of Lemon Grove’s Land Use Controls.

In addition to the residential categories listed in Table 45, the City’s Municipal Code was amended to
include several Special Treatment Area Overlay Zones. These zones were established to ensure the
optimal utilization of each of the Special Treatment Areas designated in the Lemon Grove General Plan in
terms of unity of development, open space preservation and enhancement, expanded housing
opportunities, and support for community aesthetic and economic goals.
Special Treatment Area (STA) Overlays are areas with significant development potential. The use of
STAs has successfully allowed the City to closely monitor and direct development in these critical areas.
The City amended its General Plan in 1996 and continued the STA planning system by extending the
definition to include areas warranting special planning attention in addition to areas with significant
development potential. The Land Use Plan designates eight STAs.
Senior housing is permitted in zones RM/H, RM, RP, RLM, Central Commercial Zone and the General
Commercial Zone subject to the approval of a conditional use permit. Residential units are conditionally
permitted above the first floor over commercial uses in the Central Commercial Zone and the General
Commercial Zone. The Downtown Village Specific Plan provides for both first floor residential uses and
residential uses above commercial uses.
Residential projects are reviewed for compliance with all of the City’s General Plan Elements and
Municipal Code, which is a standard process required under State law. The review process ensures that
the goals, policies, and purposes of the General Plan elements and Zoning Ordinance are carried out in
the physical plan of a residential development. This review includes density, height, setbacks, open
space, infrastructure, and other improvements to promote harmonious and workable relationships among
land uses in accordance with planned long-term build-out of community areas. The City’s project review
process, which uses the State mandated land use tools of General Plan Elements and Zoning Ordinance,
does not create impediments or onerous governmental constraints upon the residential development.
Manufactured Housing and Mobile Homes
Manufactured housing and mobile homes provide opportunities for lower cost housing. The siting and
permit process for manufactured housing and mobile homes are subject to the same development
standards as single-family dwellings (Lemon Grove Municipal Code Section 17.08.030 “Dwelling, Single-
Family”).
Accessory Units
Accessory rental dwelling units are permitted on any residentially zoned lot with one single-family
residence. The City anticipates an average of 1 to 5 accessory rental units will be built per year (down
from 5 to 10 in 2006) in the City of Lemon Grove. The accessory unit is required to be architecturally
similar to the main structure. If the accessory unit is detached, it shall not be closer than ten (10) feet to
other buildings or within the required setbacks. The City recently amended the Municipal Code to reduce
the required parking spaces from a maximum of two spaces to one space. Other exceptions apply
toward the placement of the accessory unit, but do not constrain the ability to provide such units. The City
has adopted its procedures in accordance with the State’s accessory unit requirements.
                                                     143

Parking Requirements
For multi-family developments in residential zones, the City requires 2 parking spaces (one of which must
be covered) per dwelling unit, with the exception of senior complexes, which require 1 parking space per
unit. Studio apartments require only 1.5 spaces, one of which must be covered. These parking
requirements have been found to be appropriate, and do not act as a constraint to the development of
multi-family housing. Additionally, the City’s parking requirements may be waived or reduced for
affordable housing developments on a case by case basis.
Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of Lemon Grove adopted and enforces the California Building Code that ensures that all dwelling
units are built to specified standards. The code is determined by the International Conference of Building
Officials and the State of California. No local amendment to the code has either been initiated or
approved that directly impacts housing standards or processes.
Code enforcement is conducted by the City on a complaint basis. The Code Enforcement Division works
with property owners and renters to assist them in meeting local and State health and safety codes.
On and Off-Site Improvements
Site improvements in the City consist of those typically associated with development for on-site
improvements (fronting streets, curbs, gutters, sewer/water, and sidewalks) and off-site improvements
(drainage, parks, traffic, schools, and sewer/water). These improvements are required dependent on the
project. On- and off-site improvements are costs associated with the provision of services necessary for
the health and safety of the public. Because residential development cannot take place without the
addition of adequate infrastructure, site improvement requirements are not seen as a constraint to the
development of housing within the City.
Lemon Grove does impose standardized infrastructure requirements. Adopted policies in other elements
of the General Plan call for street and sidewalk improvement standards adequate to serve and protect
public safety. The improvements and exactions required for residential development are limited to those
improvements needed to allow the project based on its impacts.
For single-family residential developments, examples of typical on-site improvements might include storm
water detention facilities, roads, sidewalks, perimeter walls, fire hydrants, and emergency access drives.
The Fire Department may require fire breaks and fuel management areas if a project is within or near
brush areas. Multi-family developments also may include common open space and recreation areas.
Typical off-site improvements for both single-family and multi-family developments might include: new
curbs, gutters, and sidewalks, road improvements and traffic control needed to serve the development,
street trees, and landscaping. Utilities may need to be upgraded or installed to serve the development,
including water mains, sewer mains, storm water pollution prevention measures, and under grounding of
electric utilities.
Residential street widths vary depending upon the classification.

Residential Collector:      36’ curb to curb/56”            7,500
Infill residential projects may be required to install a variety of improvements depending on site-specific
circumstances and neighborhood needs. As mentioned previously, required site improvements are
limited to just those needed to serve the project and offset related impacts.
For residential projects, the landscaping requirement is 15 percent of the total site area. Projects subject
to discretionary review, such as single-family subdivisions and multi-family projects are required to submit
landscaping plans as part of the overall project. The City recently amended the Municipal Code to
incorporate the State mandated water conservation provisions. For projects not subject to discretionary
review (e.g., a new single-family home on an individual lot), a calculation of water allowance is required.
Open space requirements will apply to residential projects under certain circumstances such as the
presence of steep slopes, flood plains, sensitive habitat, or other environmentally constrained features.
The purpose of such restrictions is to protect environmentally or geologically sensitive areas from
potential adverse effects of development.
Processing and Permit Procedures
Overview
The time required to process permits in the City of Lemon Grove varies upon the scope and type of
project. The amount of time involved in processing applications/permits depends on the type and the
applicant’s compliance with the City’s ordinances and the completeness of the applications. Certain types
of permits are discretionary and require a public hearing (conditional use permits, planned development
permits, and tentative maps), while others are processed administratively by staff. Permitted uses are
processed ministerially analyzing a projects compliance with regulations and minor use permits and
tentative parcel maps are processed with discretion by staff. Through administrative approval, the
applicant bypasses the public hearing requirement and shortens the processing time. Discretionary
approval may take a longer time to secure final approval because there is often significant environmental
impacts and/or can involve a General Plan amendment or rezoning. For all projects requiring a planning
permit (excludes building permits), applicant’s submit for review and reviews are conducted within 30
days. Upon which, the application is either found to be complete or incomplete. Incomplete applications
are required to be resubmitted for further 30 day reviews until the application is found to be complete.
The developers are often responsible for delays by failing to provide information or requesting
continuances in a timely manner. Discretionary permit approval requires more time for public notice,
public hearings, and negotiations of design modifications to resolve problems.
                                                      145

Environmental Requirements
Requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) can add to processing complexity.
Under CEQA, developments or actions that are defined as projects must undergo an assessment of their
impacts on the environment. These projects often include uses requiring a conditional use permit, minor
use permit, or planned development permit.
Processing
The City estimates that typical processing time and procedure requirements include:
Tentative Maps (TM) and Associated Planned Development Permit (PDP): The approval process for a
tentative map requires approximately three to five months from receipt of a complete application,
including recommendation by the Planning Commission and final action by the City Council. Final
approval is obtained once all conditions of approval have been satisfied.
Conditional Use Permit (CUP) or Planned Development Permit (PDP): two to four months from receipt of
a complete application, depending upon the complexity of the project, is a typical time frame needed
during the discretionary review process. Final action is required by the Planning Commission unless
appealed. Final approval is obtained once all conditions of approval have been satisfied.
Minor Use Permit (MUP) and Tentative Parcel Maps (TPM): one to two months from receipt of a complete
application, depending upon the complexity of the project, is a typical time frame needed during the
discretionary review process. Final action is required by the Development Services Director unless
appealed. Final approval is obtained once all conditions of approval have been satisfied.
General Plan Amendment (GPA) or Zone Reclassification/Zoning Ordinance Amendment (ZA): These
applications take an average of four to six months from receipt of a complete application until completion.
Applications are first submitted to staff, who may work with applicants to ensure completeness. These
applications require recommendation by the Planning Commission and final action by the City Council.
Final approval is obtained once all conditions of approval are satisfied.
The City of Lemon Grove does not have a separate design review process, thereby shortening the review
period.
Findings Required
For Tentative Maps and Tentative Parcel Maps, the approving body must make the following findings:
1. The proposed map is consistent with applicable general and specific plans.
2. The design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is consistent with the applicable general and
     specific plans.
3. The site is physically suitable for the type of development.
4. The site is physically suitable for the proposed density of development.
5. The design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements is not likely to cause substantial
     environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat.
6. The design of the subdivision or the type of improvements is not likely to cause serious public health
     problems.
                                                     146
7. The design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will not conflict with easements of record or
     easements established by court judgment, acquired by the public at large, for access through or use
     of, property within the proposed subdivision. In this connection, the approving body may approve a
     map if he or she finds that alternate easements, for access or for use, will be provided, and that these
     will be substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public.
For Planned Development Permits, the approving body must make the following findings:
1. The development is not detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, or general welfare.
2. The development complies with applicable provisions of this title and/or deviations that comply with
     applicable provisions in subsection D.
3. The development is consistent with general plan policies and standards and other applicable plans or
     policies adopted by the City Council.
4. The development density or intensity does not exceed general plan limitations.
5. Existing infrastructure such as utilities, transportation systems, and communication networks
     adequately serve the development or will be upgraded to efficiently accommodate the additional
     burdens imposed.
For Minor Use Permits and Conditional Use Permits, the approving body must make the following
findings:
1. The use is compatible with the neighborhood or the community.
2. The use is not detrimental to the health, safety, convenience or general welfare of persons residing or
     working in the vicinity.
3. The use complies with performance standards according to Section 17.24.080 of the Municipal Code.
4. The use is consistent with applicable provisions of the particular zoning district and with policies and
     standards of the general plan.

Fees and Exactions
Within the San Diego region, a variety of fees are charged to new developments. These fees include, but
are not limited to, development impact fees, permit issuance fees, engineering and public works fees, and
subdivision processing fees. Each of these fees is used to pay for the necessary local infrastructure
needed to support the development and to cover the cost of processing the permits. See the above
discussion on site improvements for related analysis.
Development impact and permit issuance fees are used to support a variety of functions including
checking submitted plans, paying local facilities management fees, special road assessments, and public
service related fees for other agencies such as school districts, water districts, and utility providers.
Engineering and public works fees perform a similar function. Permit processing fees are used to cover
the City’s administrative costs incurred through the processing of subdivision and development
applications and plans. The City amended the Master Fee schedule in 2010 to a cost recovery deposit
system for planning and engineering permits. The current Master Fee Schedule is posted on the City of

The Total Helix Capacity Fee has two components: (1) the Buy-in portion and, (2) the New Water Supply
portion. The buy-in portion of the total fee ensures that new customers are on par with old customers in
that old customers have paid to construct Helix’s current water system. The new water supply portion
covers costs associated with obtaining additional water supplies needed to serve new customers.
The hydraulic capacity factor represents the demand factor for larger meter sizes. When compared to a
standard 3/4-inch meter, larger meters have a larger flow capacity. The hydraulic capacity factor is used
to calculate the capacity fees for each meter size (i.e. a 2-inch meter is 5.33 times the capacity fee of a
3/4-inch meter).
The Helix Capacity Fee is only charged to users creating additional demand on the Helix system. A
customer not placing new water demands on the system, such as a business or a homeowner who wants
to install an irrigation meter and separate their interior water usage from their irrigation water without
increasing the size of the meter, would not be charged the Helix Capacity Fee.

The City of Lemon Grove’s development fees are respectively lower than most jurisdictions in the San
Diego region and the East County area. The transition to a deposit system demonstrates that fees have
generally increased in most cases, but have decreased in some discretionary projects where designers
can accomplish a complete application early in the process. This system encourages diligence in
regulation compliance and typically reduces the number of reviews. The impact on the cost and
affordability of housing is statistically insignificant. For example, the deposit amount for a CUP permit is
$1,500, a cost that does not impact the overall affordability of housing. The cost of addressing the
condition(s) obviously varies depending on the circumstances of each application, but there are few, if
any, instances in the City of Lemon Grove where the cost of addressing the removal of a constraint was
significant or resulted in the loss of an opportunity for affordable housing.

Growth Management Measures
Local zoning regulations establish density restrictions for each residentially zoned parcel. The City of
Lemon Grove does not have any established growth management activities that would limit the number of
dwelling units built in a specified time period.
Inclusionary Housing
The City does not have an inclusionary housing ordinance. Inclusionary housing programs are seen as a
constraint to the provision of housing.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
As noted in the Special Needs section of the Housing Element, persons with disabilities have a number of
specific housing needs, including design and location. Design needs generally include the removal of
                                                      155
architectural barriers that limit the accessibility of structures and the construction of wheelchair ramps,
railings, etc. Location needs include accessibility to public transportation, commercial services,
healthcare, and supportive services. Some persons with disabilities need group housing opportunities,
especially those who are very low income or homeless.
Procedures for Ensuring Reasonable Accommodations
The City ensures that new housing developments comply with the Title 24 standards of the California
Building Code. The City implements and enforces Title 24 of the 2010 California Code, which has
regulations comparable to those found in the American Disabilities Act (ADA). The City provides
information to applicants or those inquiring of City regulations regarding accommodations in zoning,
permit processes, and application of building codes for persons with disabilities.
Applicants of development projects may apply for a variance from development standards if
circumstances warrant. Certain minor variances may be granted by the City’s Development Services
Director, while other variance requests must be approved by the Planning Commission. In either case,
the findings required in the Government Code must be made in order to grant a variance. As such, the
formal variance procedure may not be the appropriate vehicle to consider requests for reasonable
accommodations. While the City has no formalized procedures for obtaining a waiver of development
standards which may be necessary to make improvements for reasonable accommodations pursuant to
ADA, the City considers such requests on a case-by-case basis. Development standards did not hinder
any accessibility improvements during the previous housing element cycle. Individuals with disabilities
can contact the Development Services Department to request a waiver or modification from the
requirements of City zoning or building codes in order to facilitate a reasonable accommodation. Such
requests are reviewed by the Director of the Development Services Department, or designee. Decisions
of the Development Services Director can be appealed to the Planning Commission and then to the City
Council.
Encroachment Permit Procedure
Encroachment permits for structures within public right-of-way are handled administratively by the
Engineering Department. Improvements designed to improve accessibility (e.g. a wheelchair ramp) that
encroach into the public right-of-way requires an encroachment permit.            The applicant provides a
drawing of the proposed improvements in relation to the public right-of-way, which is then reviewed by the
City Engineer. The improvements must be completed by a licensed and insured general contractor.
There is a nominal permit fee. The City’s permit processes for waivers and encroachments are relatively
simple and expeditious and do not constitute a constraint to reasonable accommodations for persons with
disabilities.
Efforts to Remove Regulatory Constraints for Persons with Disabilities
Existing State law supersedes City discretion for review of small group home projects (six or fewer
residents). The City does not impose additional zoning, building code, or permitting procedures other than
those allowed by State law.
Residential care facilities providing 24 hour care for seven or more persons require a conditional use
permit within the City’s residential zones, but are permitted by right for six or fewer persons. The City
does not restrict the number of facilities within the City or the proximity to one another (small only). The
                                                      156

City does not have particular conditions for residential care facilities for seven or more persons, but
conditions may include requiring public street improvements, landscaping, open space improvements,
and improvements related to vehicular circulation and safety.
The City also allows residential retrofitting to increase the suitability of homes for persons with disabilities
in compliance with ADA requirements. Such retrofitting is permitted under Title 24 provisions of the 2010
California Building Code. The City works with applicants who need special accommodations in their
homes to ensure that application of building code requirements does not create a constraint.
Residential parking standards for persons with disabilities are not different from other parking standards.
The City will consider a 25 percent reduction of the parking space requirement for senior projects.
The City does not have occupancy standards that apply specifically to unrelated adults and occupancy
standards comply with Fair Housing laws.
Permits and Processing
The City does not impose special permit procedures or requirements that could impede the retrofitting of
homes for accessibility. The City’s requirements for building permits and inspections are the same as for
other residential projects. City officials are not aware of any instances in which an applicant experienced
delays or rejection of a retrofitting proposal for accessibility to persons with disabilities.
The City allows group homes of six of fewer persons by right, as required by California State law. No
conditional use permit or other special permitting requirements apply to such homes. The City does
require a conditional use permit for group homes of more than six persons in all residential zones that
allow for residential uses.
The City does not impose special occupancy permit requirements for the establishment or retrofitting of
structures for residential use by persons with disabilities. Generally, if structural improvements were
required for an existing group home, a building permit would be required.
Building Codes
The City provides reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities in the enforcement of building
codes and the issuance of building permits through its flexible approaches to retrofitting or converting
existing buildings and construction of new buildings that meet the shelter needs of persons with
disabilities. The City adopted and implements the 2010 California Building, Plumbing, Mechanical and
Fire Codes and the 2009 California Electrical Code. The 2010 California Residential Code requires
sprinklers in all new residential structures. A Lemon Grove local amendment to the 2010 California
Building Code requires sprinklers in residential dwellings where an addition exceeds 50 percent of the
existing square footage.
Universal Design Element
The City has not adopted a universal design ordinance governing construction or modification of homes
using design principles that allow individuals to remain in those homes as their physical needs and
capabilities change.
                                                       157

 Conclusion
 In light of current and proposed planning policies and zoning regulations, the City believes that it has
 mitigated any potential constraints to the availability of housing for persons with disabilities. However, to
 date, no formal review of its procedures or Municipal Code has been conducted as required by State law.
 The City analyzed its Municipal Code and procedures to ensure that it is providing flexibility in, and not
 constraining the development of, housing for persons with disabilities (Program 15). If constraints are
 found in the future, the City will modify its Municipal Code and/or develop procedures for reasonable
 accommodation to facilitate housing for persons with disabilities.
 NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
 Land and Construction Costs
 Residential land prices contribute significantly to the cost of new housing. In Lemon Grove, there is little
 vacant land upon which to base estimates of land costs. However, information does exist on parcel costs.
 These costs include the total assessed value of real property in the City, including the cost of the home.
 Table 50 shows the average assessed parcel values in the City of Lemon Grove in 2011. The average
 parcel cost for a single-family home was $178,916. The average parcel cost for duplex and multi-family
 homes of 2 or more dwelling units ranged from $194,361 for a 2-unit lot to $5,217,659 for a multi-family
 lot with the capacity for 61 or more units. Lemon Grove, being an inland city, has land costs that are lower
 than those in the coastal cities of the San Diego region. Land costs are not a significant constraint to the
 development of affordable housing in the City.

In addition to this information, the following anecdotal information from the development community
working in the East County sub-region provides further insight to land and construction costs. Land costs
are approaching $250,000 per acre in the Lemon Grove area (higher in areas depending on site
configuration, views, etc.). Construction costs for multi-family runs about $120 per square foot for Type 5
construction (wood and stucco over parking) with one bedroom units ranging between 600 to 1,100
square feet (averaging about 720 square feet) and two bedrooms at 1,000 to 1,200 square feet. Parking
(podium style with stalls under the units) runs about $25,000 per stall. Type 5 construction generally is
used until the development reaches higher densities (60 units per acre or higher) and then construction
type would probably be Type 3 (for rent) or 1 (for sale) which involves steel and concrete. In those cases,
construction costs would rise to about $200 per square foot.
Availability of Financing
Interest rates affect homeownership opportunities region wide. In October, 2011, the posted interest rate
on resale single-family homes was 4.00 percent on a 30-year, fixed rate loan with a 20 percent down
payment. On a median priced home in San Diego County costing approximately $429,000, the monthly
interest and principal payment was $1,638.4
Table 51 uses Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data to analyze mortgage lending patterns in San
Diego County. With only preliminary data available, we are not able to determine what percentage of
loans were approved (which is based on the number of loans approved but not accepted and the number
purchased). Table 51 also shows that a higher percentage of applications from lower income groups
were denied homeownership loans than those from the higher income groups.

PROGRAM

PROGRAMS
This section of the Housing Element contains the programs the City will implement to address the primary
goal, objectives, and supporting policies.
Program 1: Continue to Implement Nonconforming Unit Ordinance
Program Description
The City of Lemon Grove Development Code provides for the reconstruction of substantially destroyed
nonconforming residential buildings and uses located in residential zones. Section 17.24.090(F)(I)
(Nonconforming Uses) of the Development Code provides for the issuance of Reconstruction Permits to
allow the restoration of substantially damaged or destroyed residential units. The City will continue to
implement this provision of the Development Code.
Implementing Agency: City of Lemon Grove.
Funding Source: City of Lemon Grove General Fund
Schedule: Ongoing.

Program 2: Encourage Second Dwelling Units
Program Description
The City amended its accessory unit ordinance to comply with State law and allows second dwelling units
in any residential area through ministerial actions. The process was revised so that second dwelling units
no longer require special use permits but are processed through only the building permit requirements.
The City, in an effort to encourage more second dwelling units, recently decreased the parking
requirements.
The City has made handouts available about the second dwelling unit program at City Hall. It also will
provide periodic reminders and updates through City-wide information venues (web site, mail outs,
electronic notifications, public notices, etc.).

Program 3: Facilitate Development of Higher Density Housing
Program Description
As a means of reducing residential land costs, the City will encourage minimum densities in Special
Treatment Area I (STA I) and Special Treatment Area II (STA II), both near a trolley station. As part of the
project review process, Planning Department staff will work with applicants to achieve the residential
densities identified in existing and future specific plans.
The City has established minimum densities between 25 and 45 dwelling units to the acre as part of its
Downtown Village Specific Plan (DVSP), also known as STA I. The unit yield for the DVSP may by itself
enable the City to meet its total regional share need as well to meet its quantified objectives for new
construction. The City has adopted not only minimum densities at a high density level but it has also
established development standards that facilitate higher densities, including reduced parking standards
for the nearby transit services (trolley station and bus stops).
The City will continue to support the application of this program when the specific plan for STA II is
prepared while ensuring development standards are met and community character is maintained.

Program 6: Utilize Density Bonus Provisions
Program Description
Section 65915 of the Government Code (Appendix A) contains the requirements for the City if a
developer requests a density bonus for providing affordable housing as part of a development proposal.
The State requests that the City modify the Municipal Code to be consistent with State Law.
1. Local governments may still grant density bonuses greater than what is provided under these
     provisions.
2. Requires local governments to provide a developer one or more incentives or concessions if below
     market rate units are included within the project. Incentives or concessions offered by the local
     government shall result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.
3. Allows, upon sale of the unit, the seller to keep the value of any improvements, the down payment,
     and the seller's proportionate share of appreciation.
4. Provides that the local government shall recapture its proportionate share of appreciation, which shall
     be used within three years for promotion of affordable homeownership.
5. Limits parking standards upon the developer's request.

Program 7: Prepare or Modify Plans for Special Treatment Areas
Program Description
The first Lemon Grove General Plan was adopted in 1980. Because most of the City was developed
when this plan was prepared, a system of Special Treatment Areas (STAs) was established to identify
areas with significant development potential. Specific guidelines are established for each STA and focus
on the unique site characteristics and development opportunities. The STAs involving potential
residential development are identified herein and previous and potential actions within each of these
STAs are noted.
A. Downtown Village Specific Plan (STA I)
The Downtown Village Specific Plan (DVSP), previously known as Special Treatment Area 1 (STA 1),
surrounds the intersection of Lemon Grove Avenue and Broadway and includes the Lemon Grove Depot
Trolley Station. The DVSP includes mixed-use development featuring commercial, office, and multi-family
residential land uses, with opportunities for high density and affordable housing. The DVSP is anticipated
to yield 719 additional dwelling units.
B. Special Treatment Area II (STA II), Massachusetts Station
STA II, Massachusetts Station, is planned to be a neighborhood residential and commercial mixed-use
center adjacent to the Massachusetts Avenue Trolley Station. The residential component will consist of
condominiums and/or apartments, including affordable units. The specific plan development will analyze
densities to achieve a successful transit-oriented development.
C. Special Treatment Area IV (STA IV), West Central Avenue Residential
STA IV, West Central Avenue Residential, located near the intersection of College Avenue and Federal
Boulevard is intended for new, residential development consistent with surrounding development.
D. Special Treatment Area VIII (STA VIII), Eastern Central Avenue
STA VIII, Eastern Central Avenue, allows for residential development of up to 29 dwelling units per acre
and building heights of two stories.

Program 8: Promote Community Based Neighborhood Improvement Districts
Program Description
This program allows property owners and/or business owners to target an area for improvement then levy
a special tax on their respective properties or businesses to provide funds for the improvements. Similar
districts include Business Improvement Districts (BIDs), Local Improvement Districts (LIDs), Community
Service Districts (CSDs), Municipal Improvement Districts (MIDs), and Public Improvement Districts
(PIDs). The services provided and the geographic boundaries are decided by the members of the district
and can include a number of services: landscaping, security, recreation, historic preservation, and vehicle
parking management. The districts share the ability to fund themselves through taxes or special
assessments.

Program 10: Prepare and Adopt a Street Design Manual
Program Description
Complete Streets is a national movement that promotes accessibility for all users and promotes healthier
lifestyles. Typical Complete Streets components accommodate pedestrians, bicycles, transit users,
personal vehicle and freight trucks. Streets play a major role in shaping the form of the environment. The
quality of the street experience is a key element in the quality of a neighborhood. The purpose of the
street design manual is to provide information and guidance for the design of the public right-of-way that
                                                    173

recognizes many and varied purposes that a street serves incorporating neighborhood beautification,
active living opportunities, walkability, bicycle paths, bicycle lockers, street lighting, street trees, pocket
parks, the use of excess right-of-way, and most importantly the principles of Complete Streets such as
accommodating for pedestrians, bicycles, transit users, and vehicles.

Program 11: Encourage Energy Conservation and Sustainable Best Practices
Program Description
A. Encourage Energy Conservation
The primary uses of energy in urban areas are transportation, lighting, water heating, space heating, and
cooling. The high cost of energy demands that efforts be taken to reduce or minimize the overall level of
urban energy consumption.
The City will continue enforcing local and State energy regulations for new residential construction, and
will continue providing residents with information on energy efficiency. Information about San Diego Gas
& Electric energy conservation and retrofit programs will be provided at City Hall and periodic articles in
the City newsletter will educate the community about the benefits of energy conservation.
The City’s goal is to achieve maximum use of conservation measures and alternative, renewable energy
sources in new and existing residences. New development including public projects will incorporate
energy efficient equipment and building techniques to reduce overall power consumption. Site design,
structural orientation and building materials influence energy requirements. Discretionary planned
developments may utilize energy conservation elements to offset waivers of certain development
standards.
By encouraging and assisting residents to utilize energy more efficiently, the need for costly, new energy
supplies, and the social and economic hardships associated with any future shortages of conventional
energy sources will be minimized.
B. Encourage Sustainable Best Practices
Sustainable best practices seek to reduce negative impacts on the environment, and the health and
comfort of building occupants, thereby improving building performance. The basic objectives of
sustainability are to reduce consumption of non-renewable resources, minimize waste, and create
healthy, productive environments.
Sustainable design principles include the ability to:
                                                      174

        Optimize site potential;
        Minimize non-renewable energy consumption;
        Use environmentally preferable products;
        Protect and conserve water;
        Enhance indoor environmental quality; and
        Optimize operational and maintenance practices.
Utilizing a sustainable best practices philosophy encourages decisions at each phase of the design
process that will reduce negative impacts on the environment and the health of the occupants, without
compromising the bottom line. It is an integrated, holistic approach that encourages compromise and
tradeoffs. Such an integrated approach positively impacts all phases of a building's life-cycle, including
design, construction, operation, and decommissioning.
Sources of information on sustainable best practices include:
     1. The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) Green Building Rating System
         (Provided by the U.S. Green Building Council) provides a tool for evaluating and measuring
         achievements in sustainable best practices. The use of LEED® ensures that sustainable
         strategies are considered in building projects.
     2. Sustainable Facilities Tool (Provided by U.S. General Services Administration) provides cost-
         effective green building practices you can implement into any project.
     3. The Sustainability webpage (Provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) provides
         education and resources on sustainable best practices.
This list of sustainable best practices sources will be updated as needed and will be made available at
City Hall. The City will continue to encourage the use of sustainable best practices for all projects.

Program 12: Maintain Residential Site Inventory
Program Description
The previous 2005-2010 Housing Element includes a list of vacant, redevelopment, and infill land
(Appendices B and C) to identify suitable sites for residential development (with an emphasis on multi-
                                                     175

family use). This list emphasizes Lemon Grove’s capacity to meet its’ share of the Regional Housing
Needs. The City updated this land inventory as a part of the SANDAG 2050 regional growth forecast
process in 2009.
The 2010-2020 Housing Element includes a subsequent update to the list of vacant, redevelopment, and
infill land and adds an Existing Projects Inventory (Appendix D) and a list of Potential Affordable Housing
Sites (Table 44). The Existing Projects Inventory lists all projects that are readily available and that
potentially could be developed during 2010 through 2020 Housing Element planning period. The list of
Potential Affordable Housing Sites lists sites best suited for affordable housing developments within the
City at this time.
The City will continue to monitor its land inventory, especially residential land available for development
as well as non-residential and underdeveloped lands that may be suitable for residential development.
Specifically, the City will continue to identify potential sites for their potential as “Smart Growth
Opportunity Areas” as defined by the Regional Comprehensive Plan and specific sites to meet the State
requirements for regional share and affordable housing. These lists will be made available at City Hall.

Program 13: Preserve Affordable Dwelling Units “At Risk” of Converting to
Market Rates
Program Description
The City will monitor affordable dwelling units that are at risk of converting to market rates during the
housing element cycle and will consider measures to preserve their affordability prior to expiration of
affordability contracts. These measures will include the purchase of affordability contracts, working with
non-profit housing organizations to preserve affordability, coordination with the County Department of
Housing and Community Development, securing continued subsidies, and/or committing available
housing set-aside monies from the Housing Agency. The Hillside Terrace Apartments located at 3264
College Place and St. John’s Plaza located at 8150 Broadway are the only units identified as being “At-
Risk” of converting to market rates through 2025.
Out of 168 total units at Hillside Terrace, 34 are deed restricted for low income households and seniors
(age 65+). The monitoring agency is Urban Futures, and the point of subsidy termination is January
2017.
Out of 100 total units at St. John’s Plaza, 99 are rent subsidized beyond 30 percent of the renters income
(HUD Section 8). The monitoring agency is the Archdiocese of San Diego and the point of subsidy
termination is August 2016.
                                                     176

The City will acquire existing information published by HCD summarizing the timelines and requirements
associated with converting subsidized housing to market rates. The City will gather and make available
to its citizens information identifying local agencies that provide tenant relocation assistance and rental
subsidies. A copy of California Government Code Sections 65838.10 and 65838.11 describing federal
noticing requirements for a landowner submitting an Intent to Pre-Pay or Opt-Out Notices for federally
funded housing shall be made available within the City. This information will be provided on the City
website and/or will be made available at the City’s public information counters.

Program 14: Cooperate/Coordinate with Housing Developers, Agencies, and
Tenant Groups
Program Description
For-profit and non-profit housing developers promote and develop housing. Non-profits are often a critical
component in the development of low and moderate income housing. The City of Lemon Grove compiled
the following list of non-profit developers who have been active in the area. The City will maintain a
current list of developers and potential development sites:
    Cascade Housing Association (limited partners with Hitzke Development)
    Interfaith Housing
    Habitat for Humanity
    Metropolitan Area Advisory Committee (MAAC)
The City will continue to augment and refine this list of developers for purposes of soliciting their
involvement in affordable housing construction in the City. The City will continue to work with developers
to insure that all opportunities are assessed. The City will annually contact developers and provide
information about development opportunities.
The City will encourage interested agencies and/or tenant groups to form partnerships to obtain housing
resources.
The City will continue to utilize housing organizations to provide financial assistance and technical
support in the development of affordable housing, including housing development within Special
Treatment Areas (STAs). The actions that the City will take specifically include but are not necessarily
limited to: identify potential funding assistance (State and Federal funds if they were to become
available); identify sites available for development; establish entitlement process incentives as may be
                                                     177

necessary and appropriate; and others as may be added by the City. The Downtown Village Specific
Plan (DVSP) encourages dwelling units to be developed in the City's downtown corridor.

Program 15: Reduce Governmental Constraints for the Provision of Housing
Program Description
State law requires that housing elements address, and where appropriate and legally possible, remove
governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing. The Lemon
Grove Municipal Code includes a variety of density ranges that provide opportunities for housing to be
built for all income levels and persons with special needs. The City will utilize State codes where local
codes are not consistent. Although constraints to the provision of housing in Lemon Grove are minimal,
the City will take the following steps:
A. The City will continue to monitor its development process and zoning regulations to identify and
     remove other constraints to the development of housing, as appropriate (ongoing). Specifically, the
     City will review the conditional use permit process in the Residential Medium/High zone to determine
     if it’s a constraint to the provision of multi-family housing development and revise as appropriate
     (within two years).
B. The City will utilize development waiver provisions in the Municipal Code for the provision of housing
     as appropriate (ongoing).
C. The City will analyze Second Unit (ARDU) regulations to reduce governmental constraints (within one
     year of adoption of the Housing Element).
D. The City provides, and will continue to provide, incentives to developers of affordable housing. These
     incentives may include, but are not limited to, expedited processing, flexible development standards,
     density bonuses, and potential assistance with infrastructure improvements. The City will monitor
     development regulations in the Municipal Code to determine if adequate incentives or concessions
     are available for the provision of affordable housing (ongoing).
E. The City will monitor the permit processing cost structure as appropriate (ongoing).
F. The City will continue to minimize project holding costs on affordable housing developments and
     establish priority review processing for affordable housing projects (within one year of adoption of the
     Housing Element).
G. Water and sewer service providers are required to grant priority for the provision of these services to
     proposed developments that include dwelling units affordable to lower income households in
                                                      178

   accordance with Government Code Section 65589.7.              The City shall monitor project processes
   (ongoing).
H. The City has historically treated emergency shelters for the homeless as "residential care facilities".
   However, these provisions do not comply with current State law. Pursuant to State Senate Bill SB 2,
   the City will amend its Zoning Ordinance within one year of adoption of the Housing Element to
   explicitly address emergency shelters. To accommodate all homeless persons within the City, the
   City will permit homeless shelters by right, without discretionary review, within at least one of the
   following zoning districts or overlay zones consistent with State law:
        o     East Broadway
        o     North Avenue
        o     General/Heavy Commercial (GC/HC)
        o     County Facility
        o     Light Industrial (LI)
I. To encourage transitional and supportive housing, the City will include transitional and supportive
   housing in the definition of “Family” and “Household” in the Municipal Code as defined in Section
   50675 of the Government Code (within one year of adoption of the Housing Element). This
   amendment will permit transitional and supportive housing as a residential use, subject only to those
   regulations that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zoning (i.e. multi-
   family in a multi-family zone)
J. In order to facilitate the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons with
   disabilities the City will include “accessibility improvements for persons with disabilities” as a deviation
   of the development standards by the minor modification process provisions (within one year of
   adoption of the Housing Element).              This zoning amendment adopts a written reasonable
   accommodation procedure to provide exception in zoning and land-use for housing for persons with
   disabilities. The minor modification procedure is a ministerial process, with minimal fee, subject to
   approval by the Development Services Director and the variance findings. The request may be used
   by an individual with a disability protected under fair housing laws. The requested accommodation is
   required to be necessary to make housing available to an individual with a disability protected under
   fair housing laws.
K. The City will amend the Municipal Code to comply with the density bonus requirements as
   established by Government Code Section 65915 (within one year of adoption of the Housing
   Element).
L. The Governor’s Office of Planning and Research is proposing additions to the California
   Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines developed pursuant to Senate Bill SB 226 (Simitian,
   2011). The proposal sets forth a streamlined CEQA review process for infill projects and contains
   performance standards that will determine an infill project’s eligibility for streamlined review. The City
   will utilize project streamlining provisions within the CEQA (ongoing). Existing and future provisions
   for streamlining affordable housing projects will be utilized where appropriate (ongoing).

Program 16: Participate in Regional Analysis of Housing Need
Program Description
Pursuant to State housing law (Government Code Section 65584, et seq.), the State Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) is required to provide the San Diego Association of
Governments (SANDAG) with the determination of San Diego County’s existing and projected housing
need prior to each Housing Element cycle; also known as the Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA). SANDAG coordinates with housing stakeholders and city and county officials to allocate the
region’s housing needs amongst the region’s 18 cities and the County of San Diego in four income
categories (very low, low, moderate, and above moderate). A methodology for the distribution amongst
the jurisdictions is developed in accordance with the objectives and factors contained in State law. The
City will participate in the Regional Analysis of Housing Needs during each RHNA cycle.

Program 17: Pursue Affordable Housing Funding Sources
Program Description
Successful implementation of housing element programs to create and maintain affordable housing will
depend on a variety of State, Federal, and local funding sources. The City of Lemon Grove will actively
pursue funding to assist in the development, preservation, and rehabilitation of any housing type. The City
will identify these funding opportunities to both for-profit and non-profit developers as part of the
residential development processes, especially those projects that have the potential for affordable
housing. The actions that the City will take specifically include, but are not necessarily limited to: identify
potential funding assistance ( State and Federal funds if they were to become available); identification of
sites available for development and infill opportunities; consideration of entitlement process(es) incentives
as may be necessary and appropriate; and others as may be added by the City. The City will continue to
work in concert with the County of San Diego, Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD), as a major resource for the implementation of the appropriate housing programs. The following
funding sources currently are available for these uses:
A. Community Development Block Grants and Home Funds
As an incentive for developers to provide a sufficient level of affordable housing, CDBG funds and HOME
funds are available through the County. These Federal funds are made available through a Notice of
                                                     180

Funding Availability (NOFA) process administered through the County Department of Housing and
Community Development. Housing development, or acquisition, or acquisition and rehabilitation
proposals are evaluated and rated based on the development’s housing affordability and other important
criteria. In 2005, the City began contracting with the County HCD to encumber for a three year period,
rather than on an annual basis.
The program will continue to be used for ongoing tenant/landlord mediation services and street
rehabilitation.
B. Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC)
This State program provides tax credits for owners of or investors in low income rental housing. The tax
credits are available for use over a 10-year period. The credits are normally sold to investors to help
finance the initial development of a project. For a period of 15 years, the tax credit recipients must meet
certain affordable rental rate and occupancy requirements for low or very low income households. At a
minimum, the owner must reserve, at affordable rental rates, either 20 percent of the total units for
households with income at or below 50 percent of regional median, or 40 percent of the units for
households with income at or below 60 percent of regional median.
The City will assist developers in gaining funding for the development of affordable housing through the
LIHTC program. Investors receive a credit against Federal tax owed in return for providing funds to
developers to build or renovate housing for low income households. The capital subsidy allows rents to
be set at below market rates. The possible tax credits available range from 4 to 9 percent depending on
the extent of the project's affordability.
C. Tax-Exempt Multi-Family Housing Revenue Bond Program
Under this program, the County issues tax-exempt revenue bonds and uses the proceeds to provide
below market construction and permanent financing for rental housing developments. Bond-financed
development must reserve, at a minimum, either 20 percent of the total units for households whose
annual income is at or below 50 percent of San Diego’s Area Median Income (AMI), or 40 percent of total
units for households whose annual income is at or below 60 percent of San Diego’s AMI. Affordable
rental rate restrictions and occupancy requirements for the reserved units shall remain in place for a
minimum of 20 years.
D. Tax Credit for Low Income Rental Housing Program
This program is administered by the State of California Tax Credit Allocation Committee and provides tax
credits for owners of or investors in low income rental housing. The tax credits are available for use over
a 10-year period. The credits are normally sold to investors to help finance the initial development of a
project. For a period of 15 years, the tax credit recipients must meet certain affordable rental rate and
occupancy requirements for low or very low income households. At a minimum, the owner must reserve,
at affordable rental rates, either 20 percent of the total units for households with income at or below 50
percent of regional median, or 40 percent of the units for households with income at or below 60 percent
of regional median.
                                                    181

E. Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA)
County HCD administers the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Program, a Federal
housing program of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Established in
1992, the HOPWA Program is designed to provide states and localities with resources and incentives to
devise long-term comprehensive strategies for meeting the housing and housing-related support service
needs of low income persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or related diseases and their families. Housing and service providers
compete for these funds through a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) application process. The NOFA
is made available contingent on the availability of funds from HUD.
The planning process for the HOPWA Program encourages community participation and input through
consumer and provider surveys, focus groups, and one-to-one interviews. Additionally, the community
has the opportunity to participate through the HIV Housing Committee, which serves as an advisory body
to HCD.
Programs funded through the HOPWA Program must be housing related and funding is prioritized as
follows:
        Activities which provide affordable housing for low income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their
         families;

Program 18: Promote County of San Diego Home Repair Loan/Grant Programs
Program Description
As the City’s housing stock ages, the need for housing rehabilitation to enhance and preserve
neighborhood quality will continue to increase. Therefore, the City will continue to promote these
rehabilitation programs.
The City will make the information available about these programs at City Hall. Periodic reminders and
updates through City-wide information dissemination venues (web site, mail outs, electronic notifications,
public notices, etc.) will be provided. In addition to these steps, the City will work with the County to
insure that the County marketing efforts include outreach to the residents of Lemon Grove.
Grants: Grants of up to $12,000 are available to low income mobile home owners to repair their mobile
homes. To be eligible to receive this grant, the applicant’s family income must be below eighty percent
(80 percent) of San Diego County’s median income adjusted for family size and must be owner-occupied.
Deferred Loans: The County of San Diego Department of Housing and Community Development offers
the Home Repair Loan Program for Owner-Occupied Property that provides loans for the repair of homes.
The City will continue to advertise the Housing Authority of the County of San Diego’s Residential
Rehabilitation Assistance Program. This program offers low interest home improvement loans to eligible
homeowner occupants. To be eligible to receive this loan, the applicant’s family income must be below
eighty percent (80 percent) of San Diego County’s median income adjusted for family size. Deferred
loans are offered at three percent simple interest and calculated annually on the unpaid principal. The
total amount borrowed must be repaid when the property changes hands or the recipient moves from the
property. Owners may borrow up to $25,000 for a single-family home. The amount of the loan is
determined by the actual cost of rehabilitating the property as well as the borrower's ability to repay the
loan. The total amount borrowed must be repaid when the property changes hands or the recipient moves
from the property.

Program 19: Coordinate Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers and Public Housing
Program Description
The City will continue to coordinate with the Housing Authority of San Diego County who will continue to
administer the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program and the Public Housing Program. The
Housing Authority will support the County’s applications for additional Section 8 allocations. This program
provides rental assistance to eligible very low and low income households. The subsidy represents the
difference between the rent that exceeds 30 percent of a household’s monthly income and the actual rent
charged. For Public Housing, the household’s annual gross income shall be at or below 50 percent of
San Diego’s Area Median Income (AMI).
As of 2009, 422 Lemon Grove residents were receiving Section 8 vouchers. The City will make the
information available at City Hall. It also will provide periodic reminders and updates through City-wide
information dissemination venues (web site, mail outs, electronic notifications, public notices, etc.). In
addition to these steps, the City will work with the County to insure that the County marketing efforts
include outreach to the residents of Lemon Grove.

Program 20: Participate in the Fair Housing Council of San Diego’s (FHCSD) Fair
Housing Program
Program Description
The City of Lemon Grove supports fair housing laws and statutes. To promote equal opportunity, the City
participates in the Fair Housing Council of San Diego’s (FHCSD) Fair Housing Program. The City
distributes the FHCSD’s information on fair housing, and refers fair housing questions and housing
discrimination claims to the FHCSD.
The FHCSD will:
1.   Advocate for fair housing issues;
2.   Conduct outreach and education;
3.   Provide technical assistance and training for property owners and managers;
4.   Coordinate fair housing efforts;
5.   Assist to enforce fair housing rights;
6.   Collaborate with other fair housing agencies;
7.   Refer and inform for non-fair housing problems; and,
8.   Counsel and educate tenants and landlords.
Additionally, as part of the CDBG process, the City will explore additional opportunities to enhance fair
housing in the City (for example as a potential part of a FHCSD marketing campaign when the STA I units
                                                     184

are available for sale and rent and as part of the City’s overall fair housing activities associated with all
residential developments). The City will make the information available at its City Hall as well as the
Development Services Department. It also will provide periodic reminders and updates through City-wide
information dissemination venues (web site, mail outs, electronic notifications, public notices, etc.). In
addition to these steps, the City will work with the FHCSD to insure that its marketing efforts include
outreach to the residents of Lemon Grove.

Program 21: Promote Funding Opportunities for Home Ownership
Program Description
The City of Lemon Grove will actively promote funding to assist opportunities for home ownership. The
City will identify and update these funding opportunities and make the sources available at City Hall. The
City will continue to work in concert with the County of San Diego, Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD), as a major resource for the home ownership programs. The following
funding sources currently are available for these uses:
A. Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC)
Homeownership can be a key to maintaining a healthy community. The San Diego Regional Mortgage
Credit Certificate Program, which is administered by the County of San Diego, allows qualified first-time
homebuyers to reduce their Federal income tax by up to 20 percent of the annual interest paid on a
mortgage loan. With less being paid in taxes, the homebuyer’s net earnings increase, enabling him/her to
more easily qualify for a mortgage loan. The MCC may only be used to purchase single-family detached
homes, condominiums, townhouses, and manufactured homes on a permanent foundation. The City of
Lemon Grove will continue to distribute information on the MCC program. The City will make the
information available at its City Hall. It also will provide periodic reminders and updates through City-wide
information dissemination venues (web site, mail outs, electronic notifications, public notices, etc.). In
addition to these steps, the City will work with the County to insure that the County marketing efforts
include outreach to the residents of Lemon Grove.
                                               MCC Income Eligibility Limits
                        Family Size             Non Designated Area          Designated Area
                        1-2 Persons                    $79,500                   $94,200
                        3+ Persons                     $90,275                  $109,900
                                                        185

B. County of San Diego Down Payment and Closing Cost Assistance Program (DCCA)
The County of San Diego offers low interest deferred payment loans of up to $35,000 or 33 percent of the
purchase price (whichever is less) for low income first-time homebuyers. The loan funds may be used to
pay down payment and closing costs on the purchase of a new or re-sale home. Although the home may
be a single-family home, a condominium, or a townhouse, its appraised value may not exceed $451,250.
Eligible household’s annual gross income must be at or below 80 percent of San Diego’s Area Median
Income (AMI).
The City will continue to provide information to prospective homebuyers about the County of San Diego’s
DCCA program.
C. California Housing Finance Agency (Cal HFA) Homebuyer’s Down Payment Assistance Program
(CHDAP)
The City will continue to provide information to prospective homebuyers about CalHFA’s Homebuyer’s
Down Payment Assistance Program (CHDAP).
This Program is designed to provide up to 99.5 percent of the financing needs of prospective eligible first-
time homebuyers purchasing a home to be owner-occupied utilizing an FHA insured loan. It generally
consists of a standard FHA CalHFA fixed-rate 30- year mortgage (at CalHFA's published below market
interest rate at the time the loan is reserved) and a 3 percent CalHFA down payment assistance deferred
payment junior loan, which is also called a "sleeping" second. The contribution must be 1 percent of the
sales price or $1,000, whichever is greater. The sale price of the home cannot exceed CalHFA's sales
price limits established for San Diego County. The home shall be a single-family, one-unit residence,
including approved condominium/PUDs.
The household income must be less than the allowable CHDAP income limits (2011):
  County/Persons          1          2         3          4         5        6          7             8

D. National Homebuyer’s Fund (NHF)
ACCESS Program allows low and moderate income homebuyers to borrow money to pay for down
payment and closing costs in the form of a 15 year fixed rate second mortgage. Loan amounts can be up
to 3 percent of the home’s sales price. Borrowers do not need to be first-time homebuyers, but must
occupy the home they are purchasing.
CHF Platinum Program allows low and moderate income homebuyers money to pay for down payment
and closing cost in the form of a 15 year fixed rate first mortgage. Grant amounts can be up to 3 percent
of the home’s first loan. Borrowers do not need to be first-time homebuyers, but must occupy the home
they are purchasing.
For both programs, the household annual gross income must not exceed $90,600 (as of 2011) for FHA
loans.
                                                      186

 E. Community Land Trusts
Utilizing the Community Land Trust Model, affordability can be preserved for future owners through the
implementation of a 99-year ground lease. Permanent affordability can be achieved. The homeowner
owns the house and leases the land beneath it retaining exclusive rights to the land. The San Diego
Community Land Trust non-profit group has expressed interest in facilitating the Land Trust Model within
the City.
F. Other Programs
The City will semi-annually refer to the State of California Department of Housing and Community
Development’s Program Directory to expand its potential funding sources and determine the availability of
funding. The City also will contact County HCD for updates on a semi-annual basis to determine the
home ownership opportunities and the City’s potential to take advantage of any appropriate programs.

income for San Diego County. Specific emphasis shall be placed on the provision of family housing and
non-traditional housing types such as single-room occupancy units and transitional housing. The City will
encourage development of housing for extremely-low income households through a variety of activities
such as outreaching to housing developers on at least an annual basis, providing financial or in-kind
technical assistance or land-write downs, providing expedited processing, identifying grant and funding
opportunities, applying for or supporting applications for funding on an ongoing basis, reviewing and
prioritizing local funding at least twice during the planning period, and/or offering additional incentives

*The City estimates that 200-300 units will be remodeled and/or rehabilitated as part of the conventional market.
Source: Lemon Grove Development Services Department and SANDAG RHNA, October 2011
New Construction
SANDAG, as part of its Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), allocated 309 new dwelling units to
the City of Lemon Grove between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020. This represents an average
of 28 units per year. This average does not accurately represent historic development trends which are
11.37 net new dwelling units from 1991 to 2009 and, in part, disregards the lack of land availability
(approximately 3 percent vacant) in Lemon Grove. The average is also significantly higher than
SANDAG’s projected growth for the City (average of 19 units per year) as found in the 2050 Regional
Growth Forecast. This forecast used a variety of factors including land available for residential
development to project the amount of new development in each jurisdiction. The City anticipates that
much of the new construction will result from increased infill development, especially within the Downtown
Village Specific Plan area (up to 819 units).
In addition to the goal of 309 new dwelling units, the City has also set goals for the affordability of the new
units. As shown, the goals of the City under the RHNA allocations are for 39 of the units to be available
                                                               191

to extremely low income, 38 to very low, 59 to low income, 54 to moderate income, and 119 to above
moderate income households.
Rehabilitation
Based on past experience, the City anticipates that 200 units will be rehabilitated between 2010 and
2020. This will be achieved through owner initiated improvements and participation in the housing
rehabilitation programs. The income level goals are estimates based on the rehabilitation between 2005
and 2010. Many of these units were previously substandard units that have been rehabilitated.
Conservation
The City’s quantified conservation objective for 2010-2020 is 422. There are 422 Lemon Grove
households receiving Section 8 certificates and vouchers, a decrease of 44 vouchers from 2005 to 2009.
The City’s ability to expand this program or even maintain it at its current level is dependent upon the
Federal budget process. Recent indications from the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) are that Federal support for Section 8 will not be expanded and may be reduced.
Preservation
At the Hillside Terrace Apartments, there are 34 dwelling units deed restricted to low income households
at risk of converting to market rates during this housing element cycle. The deed restrictions are set to
expire in January of 2017. The City will monitor these affordable units and consider measures to preserve
their affordability prior to expiration of affordability contracts.

Amended Density Bonus Law per bill number AB 2280, effective September 27, 2008.
Section 65915 of the Government Code, relating to housing.
(a)       When an applicant seeks a density bonus for a housing development within, or for the donation of
land for housing within, the jurisdiction of a city, county, or city and county, that local government shall
provide the applicant with incentives or concessions for the production of housing units and child care
facilities as prescribed in this section. All cities, counties, or cities and counties shall adopt an ordinance
that specifies how compliance with this section will be implemented. Failure to adopt an ordinance shall
not relieve a city, county, or city and county from complying with this section.
(b)       (1) A city, county, or city and county shall grant one density bonus, the amount of which shall be
          as specified in subdivision (f), and incentives or concessions, as described in subdivision (d),
          when an applicant for a housing development seeks and agrees to construct a housing
          development, excluding any units permitted by the density bonus awarded pursuant to this
          section, that will contain at least any one of the following:
                   (A) Ten percent of the total units of a housing development for lower income households,
                   as defined in Section 50079.5 of the Health and Safety Code.
                   (B) Five percent of the total units of a housing development for very low income
                   households, as defined in Section 50105 of the Health and Safety Code.
                   (C) A senior citizen housing development, as defined in Sections 51.3 and 51.12 of the
                   Civil Code, or mobile home park that limits residency based on age requirements for

                   (D) Ten percent of the total dwelling units in a common interest development as defined
                   in Section 1351 of the Civil Code for persons and families of moderate income, as
                   defined in Section 50093 of the Health and Safety Code, provided that all units in the
                   development are offered to the public for purchase.
          (2) For purposes of calculating the amount of the density bonus pursuant to subdivision (f), the
          applicant who requests a density bonus pursuant to this subdivision shall elect whether the bonus
          shall be awarded on the basis of subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (1).
          (3) For the purposes of this section, "total units" or "total dwelling units" does not include units
          added by a density bonus awarded pursuant to this section or any local law granting a greater
          density bonus.
(c)       (1) An applicant shall agree to, and the city, county, or city and county shall ensure, continued
          affordability of all low and very low income units that qualified the applicant for the award of the
          density bonus for 30 years or a longer period of time if required by the construction or mortgage
          financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program. Rents for
          the lower income density bonus units shall be set at an affordable rent as defined in Section
          50053 of the Health and Safety Code. Owner-occupied units shall be available at an affordable
          housing cost as defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code.
          (2) An applicant shall agree to, and the city, county, or city and county shall ensure that, the initial
          occupant of the moderate income units that are directly related to the receipt of the density bonus
          in the common interest development, as defined in Section 1351 of the Civil Code, are persons
                                                        195
    and families of moderate income, as defined in Section 50093 of the Health and Safety Code,
    and that the units are offered at an affordable housing cost, as that cost is defined in Section
    50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code. The local government shall enforce an equity sharing
    agreement, unless it is in conflict with the requirements of another public funding source or law.
    The following apply to the equity sharing agreement:
             (A) Upon resale, the seller of the unit shall retain the value of any improvements, the
             down payment, and the seller's proportionate share of appreciation. The local
             government shall recapture any initial subsidy, as defined in subparagraph (B), and its
             proportionate share of appreciation, as defined in subparagraph (C), which amount shall
             be used within five years for any of the purposes described in subdivision (e) of Section
             33334.2 of the Health and Safety Code that promote home ownership.
             (B) For purposes of this subdivision, the local government's initial subsidy shall be equal
             to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale minus the initial sale price to
             the moderate income household, plus the amount of any down payment assistance or
             mortgage assistance. If upon resale the market value is lower than the initial market
             value, then the value at the time of the resale shall be used as the initial market value.
             (C) For purposes of this subdivision, the local government's proportionate share of
             appreciation shall be equal to the ratio of the local government's initial subsidy to the fair
             market value of the home at the time of initial sale.
(d) (1) An applicant for a density bonus pursuant to subdivision (b) may submit to a city, county, or
    city and county a proposal for the specific incentives or concessions that the applicant requests
    pursuant to this section, and may request a meeting with the city, county, or city and county. The
    city, county, or city and county shall grant the concession or incentive requested by the applicant
    unless the city, county, or city and county makes a written finding, based upon substantial
    evidence, of any of the following:
             (A) The concession or incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing
             costs, as defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code, or for rents for the
             targeted units to be set as specified in subdivision (c).
             (B) The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in
             paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon public health and safety or the
             physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of
             Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or
             avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low
             and moderate income households.
             (C) The concession or incentive would be contrary to State or Federal law.
    (2) The applicant shall receive the following number of incentives or concessions:
             (A) One incentive or concession for projects that include at least 10 percent of the total
             units for lower income households, at least 5 percent for very low income households, or
             at least 10 percent for persons and families of moderate income in a common interest
             development.
             (B) Two incentives or concessions for projects that include at least 20 percent of the total
             units for lower income households, at least 10 percent for very low income households,
             or at least 20 percent for persons and families of moderate income in a common interest
             development.
                                                 196
              (C) Three incentives or concessions for projects that include at least 30 percent of the
              total units for lower income households, at least 15 percent for very low income
              households, or at least 30 percent for persons and families of moderate income in a
              common interest development.
    (3) The applicant may initiate judicial proceedings if the city, county, or city and county refuses to
    grant a requested density bonus, incentive, or concession. If a court finds that the refusal to grant
    a requested density bonus, incentive, or concession is in violation of this section, the court shall
    award the plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees and costs of suit. Nothing in this subdivision shall be
    interpreted to require a local government to grant an incentive or concession that has a specific,
    adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health,
    safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily
    mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to
    require a local government to grant an incentive or concession that would have an adverse
    impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources. The
    city, county, or city and county shall establish procedures for carrying out this section that shall
    include legislative body approval of the means of compliance with this section.
(e) (1) In no case may a city, county, or city and county apply any development standard that will
    have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development meeting the criteria of
    subdivision (b) at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by this section. An
    applicant may submit to a city, county, or city and county a proposal for the waiver or reduction of
    development standards that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a
    development meeting the criteria of subdivision (b) at the densities or with the concessions or
    incentives permitted under this section, and may request a meeting with the city, county, or city
    and county. If a court finds that the refusal to grant a waiver or reduction of development
    standards is in violation of this section, the court shall award the plaintiff reasonable attorney's
    fees and costs of suit. Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local
    government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a
    specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon
    health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to
    satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. Nothing in this subdivision shall be
    interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards that would
    have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical
    Resources, or to grant any waiver or reduction that would be contrary to State or Federal law.
    (2) A proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards pursuant to this subdivision
    shall neither reduce nor increase the number of incentives or concessions to which the applicant
    is entitled pursuant to subdivision (d).
(f) For the purposes of this chapter, "density bonus" means a density increase over the otherwise
    maximum allowable residential density as of the date of application by the applicant to the city,
    county, or city and county. The applicant may elect to accept a lesser percentage of density
    bonus. The amount of density bonus to which the applicant is entitled shall vary according to the
    amount by which the percentage of affordable housing units exceeds the percentage established
    in subdivision (b).
    (1) For housing developments meeting the criteria of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of
    subdivision (b), the density bonus shall be calculated as follows:
                      Percentage Low Income              Percentage Density
                                Units                            Bonus

(2) For housing developments meeting the criteria of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of
subdivision (b), the density bonus shall be calculated as follows:
              Percentage Very Low Income             Percentage Density

    (5) All density calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole
    number. The granting of a density bonus shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a
    general plan amendment, local coastal plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary

(g) (1) When an applicant for a tentative subdivision map, parcel map, or other residential
    development approval donates land to a city, county, or city and county in accordance with this

    (2) This increase shall be in addition to any increase in density mandated by subdivision (b), up to
    a maximum combined mandated density increase of 35 percent if an applicant seeks an increase
    pursuant to both this subdivision and subdivision (b). All density calculations resulting in fractional
    units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed
    to enlarge or diminish the authority of a city, county, or city and county to require a developer to
    donate land as a condition of development. An applicant shall be eligible for the increased density
    bonus described in this subdivision if all of the following conditions are met:
             (A) The applicant donates and transfers the land no later than the date of approval of the
             final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application.
             (B) The developable acreage and zoning classification of the land being transferred are
             sufficient to permit construction of units affordable to very low income households in an
             amount not less than 10 percent of the number of residential units of the proposed
             development.
                                                  199
             (C) The transferred land is at least one acre in size or of sufficient size to permit
             development of at least 40 units, has the appropriate general plan designation, is
             appropriately zoned with appropriate development standards for development at the
             density described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) of Section 65583.2, and is or will be
             served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure.
             (D) The transferred land shall have all of the permits and approvals, other than building
             permits, necessary for the development of the very low income housing units on the
             transferred land, not later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel
             map, or residential development application, except that the local government may
             subject the proposed development to subsequent design review to the extent authorized
             by subdivision (i) of Section 65583.2 if the design is not reviewed by the local government
             prior to the time of transfer.
             (E) The transferred land and the affordable units shall be subject to a deed restriction
             ensuring continued affordability of the units consistent with paragraphs (1) and (2) of
             subdivision (c), which shall be recorded on the property at the time of the transfer.
             (F) The land is transferred to the local agency or to a housing developer approved by the
             local agency. The local agency may require the applicant to identify and transfer the land
             to the developer.
             (G) The transferred land shall be within the boundary of the proposed development or, if
             the local agency agrees, within one-quarter mile of the boundary of the proposed
             development.
             (H) A proposed source of funding for the very low income units shall be identified not later
             than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential
             development application.
(h) (1) When an applicant proposes to construct a housing development that conforms to the
    requirements of subdivision (b) and includes a child care facility that will be located on the
    premises of, as part of, or adjacent to, the project, the city, county, or city and county shall grant
    either of the following:
             (A) An additional density bonus that is an amount of square feet of residential space that
             is equal to or greater than the amount of square feet in the child care facility.
             (B) An additional concession or incentive that contributes significantly to the economic
             feasibility of the construction of the child care facility.
    (2) The city, county, or city and county shall require, as a condition of approving the housing
    development that the following occur:
             (A) The child care facility shall remain in operation for a period of time that is as long as
             or longer than the period of time during which the density bonus units are required to
             remain affordable pursuant to subdivision (c).
             (B) Of the children who attend the child care facility, the children of very low income
             households, lower income households, or families of moderate income shall equal a
             percentage that is equal to or greater than the percentage of dwelling units that are
             required for very low income households, lower income households, or families of
             moderate income pursuant to subdivision (b).
                                                   200
         (3) Notwithstanding any requirement of this subdivision, a city, county, or a city and county shall
         not be required to provide a density bonus or concession for a child care facility if it finds, based
         upon substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child care facilities.
         (4) "Child care facility," as used in this section, means a child daycare facility other than a family
         daycare home, including, but not limited to, infant centers, preschools, extended daycare
         facilities, and schoolage child care centers.
(i)      "Housing development," as used in this section, means a development project for five or more
residential units. For the purposes of this section, "housing development" also includes a subdivision or
common interest development, as defined in Section 1351 of the Civil Code, approved by a city, county,
or city and county and consists of residential units or unimproved residential lots and either a project to
substantially rehabilitate and convert an existing commercial building to residential use or the substantial
rehabilitation of an existing multi-family dwelling, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 65863.4, where
the result of the rehabilitation would be a net increase in available residential units. For the purpose of
calculating a density bonus, the residential units shall be on contiguous sites that are the subject of one
development application, but do not have to be based upon individual subdivision maps or parcels. The
density bonus shall be permitted in geographic areas of the housing development other than the areas
where the units for the lower income households are located.
(j)      The granting of a concession or incentive shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a
general plan amendment, local coastal plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval.
This provision is declaratory of existing law.
(k)       For the purposes of this chapter, concession or incentive means any of the following:
         (1) A reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code requirements or
         architectural design requirements that exceed the minimum building standards approved by the
         California Building Standards Commission as provided in Part 2.5 (commencing with Section
         18901) of Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code, including, but not limited to, a reduction in
         setback and square footage requirements and in the ratio of vehicular parking spaces that would
         otherwise be required that results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.
         (2) Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if commercial, office,
         industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development and if the
         commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses are compatible with the housing project and the
         existing or planned development in the area where the proposed housing project will be located.
         (3) Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the developer or the city, county, or
         city and county that result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.
(l)      Subdivision (k) does not limit or require the provision of direct financial incentives for the housing
development, including the provision of publicly owned land, by the city, county, or city and county, or the
waiver of fees or dedication requirements.
(m)      Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede or in any way alter or lessen the effect or
application of the California Coastal Act (Division 20 (commencing with Section 30000) of the Public
Resources Code).
(n)      If permitted by local ordinance, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a city, county,
or city and county from granting a density bonus greater than what is described in this section for a
development that meets the requirements of this section or from granting a proportionately lower density
bonus than what is required by this section for developments that do not meet the requirements of this
section.
(o)      For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
                                                         201
    (1) "Development standard" includes a site or construction condition, including, but not limited to,
    a height limitation, a setback requirement, a floor area ratio, an onsite open-space requirement,
    or a parking ratio that applies to a residential development pursuant to any ordinance, general
    plan element, specific plan, charter, or other local condition, law, policy, resolution, or regulation.
    (2) "Maximum allowable residential density" means the density allowed under the zoning
    ordinance and land use element of the general plan, or if a range of density is permitted, means
    the maximum allowable density for the specific zoning range and land use element of the general
    plan applicable to the project. Where the density allowed under the zoning ordinance is
    inconsistent with the density allowed under the land use element of the general plan, the general
    plan density shall prevail.
(p) (1) Upon the request of the developer, no city, county, or city and county shall require a vehicular
    parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, of a development meeting the criteria
    of subdivision (b), that exceeds the following ratios:
             (A) Zero to one bedroom: one onsite parking space.
             (B) Two to three bedrooms: two onsite parking spaces.
             (C) Four and more bedrooms: two and one-half parking spaces.
    (2) If the total number of parking spaces required for a development is other than a whole
    number, the number shall be rounded up to the next whole number. For purposes of this
    subdivision, a development may provide "onsite parking" through tandem parking or uncovered
    parking, but not through onstreet parking.
    (3) This subdivision shall apply to a development that meets the requirements of subdivision (b)
    but only at the request of the applicant. An applicant may request parking incentives or
    concessions beyond those provided in this subdivision pursuant to subdivision (d).

        Introduction
 The Introduction section provides a
 broad overview of the Health &
 Wellness Element and its            City of Lemon Grove Health & Wellness Element|1
 relationship to other elements.
Introduction
            In recent years, alarming community health statistics have generated concern by a
            wide range of parties including government leaders, public health professionals,
            educators, planners, and residents. The growing prevalence of chronic disease
            suggests that cities should take measures to improve the health of their residents.
            Chronic disease affects almost 50 percent of all Americans, and accounts for 7 of the
            10 most common causes of death. Chronic diseases and conditions, such as heart
            disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, asthma, and cancer, cause suffering and limit
            daily functioning. Preventable health risk factors such as insufficient physical activity
            and poor nutrition contribute greatly to the development and severity of many
            chronic diseases.
            Chronic disease is prevalent in San Diego County. Of particular concern are four
            diseases: cancer, cardiovascular disease (heart disease and stroke), type 2 diabetes,
            and respiratory conditions (e.g., asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,
            also known as COPD). These four chronic diseases result in over 50 percent of
            deaths in San Diego County, and over 60 percent of deaths in the East Region of the
            County, which includes the City of Lemon Grove.
            To combat chronic disease, the City adopted the Health & Wellness Element, which
            is a chapter of the City’s General Plan. The Vision of the Element is “A Healthy
            Community through Physical and Social Connections.” To achieve this Vision, there
            are four Goals:
                1.  Safe, connected neighborhoods,
                2.  Collaborative and positive attitudes about healthy and active living,
                3.  Access to healthy, affordable foods, and
                4.  A wide range of healthy activities.
            These goals include objectives and policies to promote community connectivity,
            healthy eating, and active living. Implementation of these goals, objectives, and
            policies are realized through the Program Section which provides succinct tasks and
            timelines to help create a healthier place to live.
            Element Organization
            The Health & Wellness Element presents an overview of health conditions within the
            community. The components of the existing land use and transportation network,
            and demographic factors that have a particular influence on public health are
            discussed, as is the current state of health in the City with regard to disease,
            obesity, and physical fitness.
            The Existing Conditions section provides an overview of existing health conditions in
            the community, as well as the demographic factors and components of the physical

                                                                                         Introduction
environment that have a key influence on the health of the community, such as race
and ethnicity, age, the transportation network, and zoning.
The Outreach section describes the public outreach efforts conducted during the
development of the Element, including participation at community events,
stakeholder meetings, and public workshops. Public input played a key role in the
development of the Vision Statement and supporting health policies.
The Health and Wellness Plan section highlights key community health needs as they
relate to Element goals. This section also identifies opportunities to address health
needs within Lemon Grove, and the City’s ultimate vision for good health in the
community.
The Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Programs section is the heart of the Health &
Wellness Element. The Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Programs are created to
address issues and challenges outlined in the Existing Conditions section. The Goals
and supporting Objectives represent the desired destination for public health in the
community, while the specific Policies and Programs function as implementing
agents for the Goals and Objectives. Any activities undertaken or projects approved
by the City will be measured against these Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Programs
for their impact on public health.
Co-Benefits of Health and Wellness Policies
The Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Progams in this Health & Wellness Element can
provide significant co-benefits in other areas of importance to the City. Co-benefits
are the positive, indirect effects of a particular policy. For example, improving the           Co-benefits:
walkability of the City’s downtown core as well as connections to the downtown will
                                                                                                The positive

                                                                                                secondary or
obesity, and produce positive economic impacts such as increased retail sales, higher
                                                                                                indirect effects of
employment rates, and less vacancies. Examples of other co-benefits of health and
                                                                                                a health policy,
wellness policies include:
                                                                                                which result in
       Increased walking and bicycling increases physical activity and social                  benefits across
        connections and decreases passenger vehicle use thereby decreasing air                  different sectors.
        pollution;i
       Planting trees increases aesthetics, reduces greenhouses gases, and lowers
        air temperature thereby reducing energy costs;ii and
       Increasing access to healthy foods encourages healthy eating thereby
        decreasing obesity and chronic disease.iii

Introduction
           Relationship to Other Elements
           By its nature, promoting public health requires an interdisciplinary approach to
           policymaking. The Goals, Objectives, and Policies included in the Health & Wellness
           Element are interrelated with many of the goals included in other Elements of the

Conditions
The Existing Conditions section describes the physical
conditions and demographic factors that affect the
health of the residents. Physical conditions include land
use, the transportation network, and healthy food
availability and demographic factors include age, race,
and educational attainment. This section assesses the
prevalence of particular diseases and health conditions
that are especially detrimental to the health of
residents. It also describes some of the City’s efforts
and key accomplishments related to community health
                                           City of Lemon Grove Health & Wellness Element|7
to date.

Existing Conditions
            Incorporated in 1977, the City of Lemon Grove is a community encompassing nearly
            four square miles with a population of approximately 26,000. Known for having the
            “Best Climate on Earth” (the City’s motto), the City has comfortable temperatures
            throughout the year and mostly sunny days. Lemon Grove’s residential
            neighborhoods and downtown village have a small-town charm. The City recognizes
            the connection between the built environment and public health. The built
            environment-–land use, transportation, housing, and open space—can have a strong
            influence on the health of a community’s residents.
            The City is located in southeast San Diego County, east of the City of San Diego, and
            south of the City of La Mesa. State Route 94 forms its northern border and State
            Route 125 borders the City on the east. The City’s central location provides easy
            access to popular regional destinations such as downtown San Diego and local
            beaches. Residents and visitors steadily flow through the City’s downtown business
            district via the San Diego Trolley’s Orange Line, which bisects the City.
            In many ways, the community is ideally planned for healthy living and includes a
            number of important strengths that promote community connection and elevate the
            health and wellness of its residents, however, there are some challenges the City is
            faced with as it progresses towards its public health goals.
            Key Strengths
            1. An extensive public transportation network, with two major trolley stations and
                 bus routes along Broadway, Massachusetts Avenue, Madera Street, and Skyline
                 Drive, provides strong mobility for non-drivers. Key destinations in the City are
                 located within a quarter mile of public transportation, such as the downtown
                 village, grocery stores, City Hall, and the library.
            2. Street systems are generally interconnected.
            3. Ample right-of-way exists for future walkways, bike lanes, and street trees.
            4. The majority of the City is developed with larger single-family residential lots
                 ideal for private gardens and fruit and nut trees.
            5. Several local grocery stores provide residents with healthy food choices such as
                 fresh produce, dairy, and meat products.
            6. Restaurants with healthy menu options.
            7. A walkable downtown business district.
            8. Public parks and schools dispersed throughout the City provide existing and
                 potential areas for physical activity for local residents.
            9. A school district with a strong commitment to student and employee health.
                 Students in the City are more physically fit than students in San Diego County

    overall. Elementary and middle schools have Safe Routes to School programs
    and a Wellness Policy.
10. Annual community events (e.g., the Community Bonfire, Concerts in the Park,
    and Movies in the Park) provide opportunities for residents to connect with one
    another.
11. Community institutions, such as churches and many clubs, are committed to the
    wellbeing of residents.
12. A family-focused community that is passionate about Lemon Grove.
13. An engaged and proactive City government.
14. A Historical Society that works actively to preserve the heritage of the City.
As part of the public outreach process, HEAL Zone Steering Committee members
identified some of the key strengths that contribute to positive health outcomes
Key Challenges
1. A shortage of basic infrastructure for active transportation, such as bike lanes,
    sidewalks, trails, street lights, street trees and parkways, and curbs and gutters.
2. Utility boxes, overhead utility poles, trash cans, and other street furniture that
    obstruct walking paths.
3. A need for more traffic calming infrastructure (e.g., narrow streets, raised
    medians, mid-block crossings, refuge islands, curb extensions, pedestrian and
    bike safety pavement markings, and signage).

              Existing Conditions
                          4. Minimal crossing treatments (e.g., marked crosswalks, bulb outs, etc.) on busy
                              streets.
                          5. A need for more features to promote walking, such as storefronts adjacent to
                              sidewalks, wayfinding signs, public art, and streetlights.
                          6. Insufficient parks and recreation areas, especially those featuring exercise
                              facilities such as walking/running tracks and sports fields.
                          7. Limited outdoor dining venues, display areas, or other shaded sitting areas for
                              social gatherings.
                          8. No existing farmer’s market in the City.
                          9. An abundance of fast food restaurants, bars, and liquor stores offering
                              predominantly unhealthy food and drink choices.
                          10. A perception of crime within the City that makes some residents and visitors
                              uncomfortable walking or biking.
                          11. A limited number of destinations (e.g., movie theatres, bowling alleys, and trails)
                              within walking or biking distance of residential areas.
               Built

 which make up a          challenges. The City has higher rates of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes than
     city’s physical      other cities in the region, in part due to higher rates of obesity and overweight

                          network, demographic characteristics of the population, and access to healthy food
                          and recreational opportunities, all contribute to existing health conditions.v

                          overall, the City is more impacted by diabetes and COPD/asthma than the rest of the
                          County. While the incidence of chronic disease also appears to be decreasing over
                          time, approximately half of the deaths in the City continue to be attributed to chronic
                          disease.

Obesity
Obesity contributes to chronic disease, particularly conditions such as heart disease
and diabetes.vi Obesity is defined based on a person’s body-mass index (BMI) units
(lb/in2), which is the relationship between their height and weight (mass). In
general, a BMI above or below the “normal” range (18.5 to 24.9) indicates that a
person may be at higher risk for certain health problems. In adults, a person who is
overweight has a BMI between 25 and 29.9. An adult with a BMI of 30 or more is
considered obese.
As shown in Figure 2, the incidence of obesity is higher in the East Region of San
Diego County than in the County overall. Data from the 2011-2012 California Health
Interview Survey shows that over 60 percent of adults in the City are overweight or
obese.

Regular exercise–activity requiring physical effort, carried out especially to sustain or
improve health and fitness–can help address problems of obesity. A 2013 survey of
City residents conducted by Kaiser Permanente found that the majority of residents
had participated in at least some type of moderate (e.g., brisk walking, bicycling,
gardening, or vacuuming) or vigorous (e.g., running, aerobics, or heavy yard work)
physical activity in the past week (Figure 3).

Existing Conditions
           Youth Physical Fitness
           Health conditions and behaviors that lead to problems with obesity and chronic
           disease in adulthood often begin at a young age. California regularly measures the
           fitness of children in public schools to help gauge existing health conditions and
           address fitness problems as early as possible. To do so, the State requires the
           California Physical Fitness Test (PFT) to be administered to all fifth- and seventh-
           grade students in public schools. The PFT uses a series of tests to measure physical
           fitness in six areas: aerobic capacity, abdominal strength and endurance, upper body
           strength and endurance, body composition, trunk extensor strength and flexibility,
           and overall flexibility. The criteria used to represent a level of fitness that protects
           against diseases associated with physical inactivity is known as the Healthy Fitness
           Zone (HFZ).
           The results of the PFT show that less than 31 percent of fifth graders and twenty-
           five percent of 7th graders in the City were in the Healthy Fitness Zone for all six of
           the standard tests in 2011 and 2012 (Figure 4). Even more concerning,
           approximately 10 percent of students meet only two or fewer of the standard tests
           during 2011-2012 (Figure 5). The number of students testing within the healthy
           zone has generally decreased within the last 11 years. Ironically, students in the City
           on average have tested higher than the San Diego County average during this same
           11-year reporting period, which shows that this degradation in physical fitness is
           occuring throughout the County.

Smoking, Alcohol, and Drug Use
Smoking
Smoking is associated with a wide range of health problems. As of 2009, within the
East region, 16.5 percent of adults currently smoke (highest of all regions in the
County).vii Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body and causes many diseases
such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart and cardiovascular
disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and many cancers.viii Smoking can reduce fertility
rates and increase risks for birth defects and miscarriages. Quitting smoking lowers
your risk for smoking-related diseases and can add years to your life.
Alcohol and Drug Use
From January 1, 2013 to May 8, 2014, there were 139 drug and alcohol violations
and 24 driving under the influence violations in the City.ix In 2007, approximately 31
percent of San Diego County residents age 18 and older participated in binge
drinking compared to the statewide rate of 30 percent.x Excessive alcohol use is
associated with numerous health problems, including chronic diseases such as liver
cirrhosis (damage to liver cells), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), various
cancers, high blood pressure, and psychological disorders.xi It can cause
unintentional injuries, such as motor-vehicle traffic crashes, falls, drowning, burns,
and firearm injuries. Alcohol is often associated with violence, such as child
maltreatment, domestic violence, homicide, and suicide. Alcohol abuse can also
harm a developing fetus if used during pregnancy and is associated with Sudden
                                                                                   City of Lemon Grove Health & Wellness Element|15
Existing Conditions
            Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Drug abuse can lead to behaviors that cause
            cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, lung disease, mood disorders, and is
            associated with infections such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases,
            and tuberculosis.xii Some of these effects occur when drugs are used at high doses
            or after prolonged use; however, some may occur after just one use.
            Prevention
            Smoking and alcohol and drug abuse can be prevented by providing substance-free
            environments and environments where substances are inaccessible by youths (e.g.,
            secure alcohol, tobacco, and prescription drugs). Residents can help by educating
            and encouraging young adults to be tobacco, alcohol, and drug free and by
            supporting treatment facilities and cessation programs.
            The City has a high concentration of alcohol and tobacco sales establishments within
            the Broadway commercial corridor, but a low concentration in the remaining areas of
            the City. The City currently prohibits hookah lounges and has distance thresholds for
            new alcohol establishments. These thresholds require retail businesses that sell
            alcoholic beverages for off-site consumption to be 500 feet away from similar
            businesses. In addition, restaurants and bars selling liquor are required to be 1,000
            feet from similar businesses and 500 feet from places of worship, schools for
            adolescents, health care facilities, and residential land uses.
            Built Environment
            The City’s built environment significantly influences the choices residents make
            during their daily lives, impacting their personal health and wellness in many ways.
            Zoning Regulations
            Land use—the amount, type, and density of development within a city—is an
            essential component of the built environment. Development patterns that encourage
            active transportation (e.g., walking and biking) and recreation increase access to
            healthy food and health services, enhance neighborhood interaction, and promote
            community connections.
            Current Conditions
            The General Plan and Zoning Ordinance govern the location and type of new uses
            within the City. The requirements of the City’s General Plan and Zoning Ordinance
            can support residents' health and wellness. For example, zoning regulations can:
                   Require new uses to provide short and long-term bicycle parking;
                   Allow corner markets and community gardens within neighborhoods;

        Include requirements for open space and playgrounds within new
         development;
        Provide specifications for street infrastructure (e.g., curb, gutter, sidewalk,
         lighting, street trees, furnishings);
        Minimize the number of driveways and street infrastructure (e.g., utility
         boxes and power poles) that block pedestrian flow; and
        Require store entrances to locate directly on pedestrian paths.
Map 1 on the following page is the City’s zoning map. The greater part of the land
in the City is zoned for single-family residential uses, with higher-density residential
and commercial uses allowed almost exclusively in the north end of the City (along
State-Route 94) and along Lemon Grove Avenue. A separation of land uses within
the City can discourage walking and biking when retailers, parks, faith-based
organizations, grocery stores, the library and other frequently-visited locations are
located too far from residences. While many residents state that they enjoy walking
in their neighborhoods, few walk or bike to complete daily errands.
Current regulations in the City’s zoning ordinance allow for residential uses to be
located above businesses in areas that are zoned for general commercial use. City
regulations also allow parks to be located in all residential zones. In addition, the
City has made special efforts to create pedestrian- and bike-friendly environments
around trolley stations, and has adopted a Bikeway Master Plan to promote biking
throughout the City. The City’s Downtown Village Specific Plan also includes policies
and standards to encourage walkable mixed-use development.
Parks
Parks provide diverse opportunities for physical activity and relaxation, as well as
space for social gatherings and informal social interactions that help strengthen
community ties. Living near a park has a direct impact on residents’ level of physical
activity. One study found that people living in low-income areas near parks exercised
38 percent more than those living further away from parks.xiii
Current Conditions
With the opening of the Main Street Promenade, the City has seven parks, including
larger parks (e.g., Berry Street Park and Lemon Grove Park) with amenities such as
playgrounds, picnic areas, and walking and biking paths. Map 2 (page 21) shows
the households in the City within one-quarter mile of a park, a typical “walking
distance” for destinations like parks. The map also shows potential future locations
of parks (e.g., joint use of school and religious facilities and the proposed Main
Street Promenade Extension).

Historically, the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) has considered the
national standard for park space amongst municipalities to be ten acres of city parks
or playgrounds per 1,000 residents.xiv Although park access is good, the City has
less park space per resident than all other cities in San Diego County.xv This is
largely because the City does not have any beaches or open space preserves for
recreational use like many of the jurisdictions in the County. The City has 0.87 acres
per 1,000 residents. When completed, the Main Street Promenade Extension may
add up to 12 acres of park space to the City, bringing the total acreage to 1.11 per
1,000 residents.
Park safety is critical to providing recreational opportunities for residents. During a
community survey at the HEAL Zone Block Party, some residents expressed concerns
about safety and drug activity at local parks, particularly Kunkel Park in the northern
part of the City. The National Recreation and Parks Association recommends park
safety be addressed through a combination of design, programming, maintenance,
and citizen involvement.xvi For example, designing parks to maximize access points,
provide adequate lighting, and incorporate clear sightlines throughout the park
improves users’ perception of safety, as can regularly maintaining parks to remove
graffiti and trash and fix any damaged park infrastructure. Incorporating a wide
variety of programming (e.g., concerts and movies in the park, yoga classes, or dog
obedience classes) aimed at different ages and interests can also increase park
safety by encouraging positive uses of parks throughout the day and evening.
Healthy Food Access
A balanced diet is an integral part of a healthy lifestyle. Healthy diets help manage
weight and may reduce the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. Healthy diets
rich in fruits and vegetables provide essential vitamins and minerals, fiber, and other
substances important for health. Adults should consume two to three cups of
vegetables per day. Over a week, it’s important to consume vegetables by subgroup
(e.g., dark green, red and orange, beans and peas, starchy, and other
vegetables).xvii
Educating children about proper nutrition and healthy eating plans can develop
healthy dietary behaviors. The recommended total daily amount of vegetables for
children aged two to eight years of age range from one to one-and-a-half cups per
day, and for nine to eighteen years of age range from two to three cups per day.
Access to healthy food can influence eating habits. Food choices are limited by the
availability of retailers that provide healthy food options such as fresh produce. An
abundance of fast food or other retailers providing unhealthy foods can make it
harder for nearby residents to have a healthy diet.

            Map 3 shows the location of different types of food retailers in the community.
            While there are some restaurants and other food retailers spread throughout the
            City, the bulk of food retail is concentrated along Broadway. Within this corridor
            there are diverse food retailers, including supermarkets, produce markets, drive-
            through, counter/take-out and other sit-down restaurants.
            According to a 2013 survey of residents conducted by Kaiser Permanente, most
            residents buy fresh fruits and vegetables from a supermarket or from a smaller local
            grocery store (Figure 6). Other sources of fresh fruits and vegetables include the
            99¢ Only Store, fruit stands, and locations outside of the City such as Costco or
            Walmart.

            Areas with a low RFEI (2.4 or less) provide consumers with better access to healthy
            food than those with a higher RFEI (2.5 or more). The RFEI in the City is between 0
            and 1.2, meaning that residents are likely to have access to a variety of retailers that
            offer healthy food choices.
            While there is a diverse amount of healthy food retailers along Broadway, there are
            fewer along Lemon Grove Avenue, and residents could benefit from additional
            healthy food retailers along other major corridors, for instance Massachusetts
            Avenue and Skyline Drive. To help increase the availability of healthy produce, the
            City recently modified its Zoning Ordinance to allow community gardens. The Zoning
            Ordinance also allows farmer’s markets, although none currently exist. As shown in
            Figure 7 below, residents eat at least some fruit and vegetables every day.

Alternatively, Figures 8 and 9 show that the majority of residents have fast food at
least once a week and drink soda at least once a day; which may contribute to
obesity rates within the City.

            Transportation Network
            Transportation networks are another essential component of the built environment
            that influence health and wellness. Existing right-of-ways provide opportunities for
            bike and walkway improvements to promote active transportation. Active
            transportation includes walking, biking, skateboarding, scooters, and other self-
            powered vehicles. The active transportation network includes a complete
            infrastructure system that supports these modes of transportation, such as
            sidewalks, crosswalks, or bike paths. Active transportation networks can provide
            opportunities for programs and activities that encourage walking and biking; which
            in turn can improve health because of increased physical activity. The design of a
            roadway (e.g., roadway and bike lane width and the location of amenities such as
            street trees and lights), the makeup of the roadway network (e.g., length,
            connectivity, and number of blocks), and the type and mix of land uses all have an
            impact on residents’ desire and ability to travel actively.
            Transit routes can further encourage active transportation by providing connections
            for longer trips. In addition, according to the SANDAG Healthy Communities Atlas,
            access to transit promotes physical activity because most transit users walk to transit
            stops, board transit, and then walk to their destination.
            Current Conditions
            Freeways and Major Roads
            The City is bordered to the north by State Route 94 (SR-94) and to the east by State
            Route 125 (SR-125). These grade-separated, high-volume highways present both a
            physical and psychological barrier between the City and the adjacent communities to
            the north and east. There are limited places to cross over or under the two state

routes, and crossings can be unwelcoming to anyone trying to travel on foot or
bicycle. Roadway emissions may also contribute to an air quality problem for
residents living adjacent to SR-94 or SR-125.
Major roads in the City include Broadway, Buena Vista Avenue, Central Avenue,
Federal Boulevard, Kempf Street, Lemon Grove Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue,
Palm Street, San Miguel Avenue, and Skyline Drive. While these roads provide access
to key community resources such as schools and grocery stores, many of them lack
the sidewalks, bike lanes, crosswalks, street trees, medians, and other amenities
that would make them comfortable for travel by foot or on a bike.
Transit
Map 4 (page 29) shows the location of bus and trolley stops in the City. The map
also shows the areas within one-quarter and one-half-mile of these stops. The City is
served by four bus routes: routes 916, 856, 876, and 936. The City is also served by
the San Diego Trolley’s Orange Line. The San Diego Trolley provides access to
adjacent cities and other major destinations throughout the region, such as San
Diego State University and downtown San Diego; however, the Trolley does not
connect with many popular places frequented by residents such as local beaches,
Balboa Park, Sweetwater Regional Park, Lake Murray, the San Diego International
Airport, and Grossmont and Cuyamaca community colleges.

Existing Conditions
            Bus routes run generally east-west along Broadway/Federal Boulevard and north-
            south along Kempf Street/Skyline Drive and Massachusetts Avenue. Route 856
            provides a direct connection to San Diego State University. The Orange Line runs
            along Lemon Grove Avenue, with stations at Broadway and Massachusetts Avenue.
            The Orange Line extends to America Plaza in downtown San Diego to the west, and
            to La Mesa, El Cajon, and Santee to the east, and provides a direct connection to
            San Diego City College in downtown San Diego. As shown on the Map, the majority
            of the City is within one-quarter mile of public transit stops and almost all of the City
            is within one-half mile.
            Data from the 2013 Kaiser Permanente survey shows that few residents regularly
            use transit service in the City (Figure 10). Only eight percent of residents use
            transit at least once a week.

            The City has made efforts to promote sidewalk connectivity by providing sidewalks
            throughout much of Lemon Grove (Map 5). In addition, parks and other recreational
            facilities are located within walking or biking distance of many City residences.
            According to some community members, the lack of pedestrian and bike path
            connectivity remains a key concern. Distance, due to the separation of housing and
            businesses and the lack of connected sidewalks and bike paths, makes it challenging
                                                                 for residents to walk and bike from

                                                                 (under study).
            Map 6 (page 30) shows existing and planned bikeways, from the Lemon Grove
            Bicycle Master Plan adopted in November 2006. The plan proposes adding a number
            of new bike routes to the existing system, including north-south routes along Lemon
            Grove Avenue, Washington Street, and Buena Vista Avenue, and east-west routes
            along San Miguel Avenue and Alton Drive. The existing bike lanes on Federal
            Boulevard and Palm Street would also be extended as part of implementation of the
            master plan. The bike paths at Lemon Grove and Berry Street Parks are added
            places for children to ride their bikes and scooters.
            The 2010 San Diego Regional Bike Plan includes the Centre City-La Mesa Corridor,
            which runs along Lemon Grove Avenue and Broadway. The plan specifies that
            “enhanced class two bike lanes” should be provided along the corridor, including
            bike lanes defined by pavement markings and signage, as well as additional
            measures such as bicycle loop detectors and other intersection treatments. The
            purpose of these improvements is to provide safer and more direct bicycle routes
            between major regional destinations.

Walking and biking are both relatively popular transportation methods in the
community according to 2013 survey data from Kaiser Permanente. According to its
survey of City residents, over one-third of residents walk or bike to a destination in a
typical week (Figure 11). In addition, three-quarters of residents surveyed agreed
that lots of people they knew walked for exercise (Figure 12).

            survey included questions regarding their child’s typical travel mode to and from
            school. Figure 13 below shows that the majority of students are dropped off and
            picked up from school, however, 20 percent of the students walk to school and 24
            percent walk from school. Less than one percent of children bike to and from
            school. As shown in Figure 14, the parents reported safety concerns related
            violence or crime, crossings, vehicle speeds, and amount of traffic respectively as
            their primary reasons for not allowing a child to walk or bike to school.

Pedestrian and cyclist safety plays a critical role in promoting active transportation.
Without safe paths, people are less likely to choose to walk or bike. According to
the California Office of Traffic Safety Rankings, 37 pedestrians and 8 bicyclists were
injured in the City between the years 2007 and 2011.

Existing Conditions
            Air Quality
            Air quality and its effect on the public’s health is much more than a City issue—it’s a
            regional concern. Federal, State, and San Diego County agencies set standards and
            implement attainment plans for all of San Diego County based on detailed research
            and monitoring. Positive strides have been made in California in recent years to
            reduce the overall amount of air pollution, and according to the San Diego County
            Air Pollution Control District, no “smog alert” has been issued in San Diego since
            1991.
            Current Conditions
            There are 10 air quality monitoring stations in San Diego County, including one in El
            Cajon, which is the closest station to the City. The El Cajon station monitors a
            variety of air pollutants, including ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide,
            nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Of these, particulate matter (microscopic
            particules that can be inhaled deep into the lungs and possibly enter the
            bloodstream) pose the greatest health risks, impacting both lung and heart health.xix
            The San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (APCD) monitors two types of
            particulate matter: particles smaller than 10 microns (PM-10) and particles smaller
            than 2.5 microns (PM-2.5). According to air quality monitoring data from the APCD,
            in 2012, annual average PM-10 levels exceeded State standards at the El Cajon
            monitoring station, and were higher than levels at most other monitoring stations in
            the County, but maximum 24-hour PM-10 levels met State standards. Annual
            average PM-2.5 levels met State standards at the El Cajon monitoring station, and
            were comparable to levels at other area monitoring stations, but maximum 24-hour
            PM-2.5 levels exceeded Federal standards.
            Particulate matter, as well as other air polluntants, are caused by both stationary
            sources such as factories or power plants, as well as mobile sources such as trucks
            or planes. The City does not have the ability to directly control pollution from
            sources outside of Lemon Grove, such as upwind industrial businesses or adjacent
            freeways. However, the community can support regional efforts to improve pollution
            standards, and can support local actions that contribute positively to air quality. For
            example, the 2005 California Air Resources Board Air Quality & Land Use Handbook:
            A Community Health Perspective, urges cities to consider air pollution causes and
            preventative land uses as part of community health planning. City policies can
            promote transportation methods that reduce motor vehicle use, adopt distance
            standards between air pollutions sources and sensitive uses, such as schools or
            residences, and support a street and park system with trees and vegetation to aid in
            removing air pollutants.

Water Quality
Safe, clean water is essential for the basic well-being of a community. Contaminated
water can lead to a variety of health problems, including neurological disorders,
cancer, and intestinal illness. Drinking water may contain several types of
contaminants, including:
        Microbial contaminants (e.g., viruses and bacteria),
        Inorganic contaminants (e.g., salts and metals),
        Pesticides and herbicides,
        Organic chemical contaminants, and
        Radioactive contaminants.
These contaminants have a wide range of sources, including stormwater runoff,
industrial or petroleum production, agricultural or livestock operations, wildlife, or
naturally-occuring sources.xx
Current Conditions
The City receives its water supply from the Helix Water District, which also serves
the neighboring communities of La Mesa, Spring Valley, El Cajon, and
unincorporated areas near El Cajon. The Helix Water District owns Lake Jennings
and Lake Cuyamaca, and has storage rights in El Capitan Reservoir. The water
source for the City is a mixture of local rain runoff into El Capitan Reservoir, water
from the Colorado River, and water from Northern California purchased from the San
Diego County Water District.
Federal and State regulations govern the amount of contaminants that may be
present in drinking water. The Helix Water District treats its water supply at the R.
M. Levy Treatment Plant in Lakeside before storing it at Lake Jennings and in
storage tanks throughout the district. The water is continuously monitored and
tested during and after the treatment process using state certified labs and the latest
in analytical instruments and testing methods. All tap water provided by the Helix
Water District met Federal and State health standards for drinking water in 2013.
The challenge for the City, as it is with all cities in Southern California, is to conserve
water so that not only is there a sufficient quantity for basic needs, but also enough
water to maintain the health benefits derived from providing water for community
parks, recreation areas, and other environmental attributes in the community that
encourage outdoor exercise. Residents can support water conservation and the
recycling and re-use of water. In addition, water run-off—particularly if pesticides,
herbicides, or other pollutants are present—should be managed appropriately.
Dumping of trash or other potential pollutants on pavement should be avoided.
When suitable, water runoff should be directed toward pervious surfaces before
entering drainage systems.

Existing Conditions
            Housing
            Poor housing conditions are associated with a wide range of health problems,
            including respiratory infections, asthma, lead poisoning, personal injuries, and poor
            mental health.xxi Cities employ multiple strategies to improve housing, such as
            developing and enforcing housing guidelines and codes, implementing programs to
            improve indoor environmental quality, assessing and requiring improvements to
            housing conditions, and providing for new affordable housing. A lack of quality
            affordable housing may force families into deficient forms of shelter. This can result
            in overcrowding, overpayment, longer work commutes, homelessness, living
            temporarily with family or friends, living in condemned or substandard housing, as
            well as other deficiencies.
            Current Conditions
            Quality Affordable Housing
            The City is projected to exceed its affordable housing objectives. Between 2010 and
            2013, 177 residential units were permitted in the City, of which 170 are affordable to
            low-income households. The City’s housing stock consists of over 8,750 housing
            units. Many older buildings have been continuously occupied but poorly maintained
            and occupants face health risks resulting from the presence of lead paint, molds and
            mildew, deteriorating carpet, hoarding, and poor air circulation. Residents can do
            their part by disposing of trash and debris promptly and by maintaining yards and
            indoor spaces.
            Substandard Housing
            Of the over 8,750 housing units in the City, 323 were built prior to 1940 and 106
            dwelling units lacked plumbing services.xxii Records show there are residential
            properties still on septic systems and even some properties without sewer or septic
            sewage disposal facilities. Residents of substandard housing are at increased risk for
            fire, electrical injuries, lead poisoning, rodent infestation, mold, childhood asthma
            and other illnesses and injuries. Residents should obtain appropriate permits for
            unpermitted or proposed construction projects and should consider a home
            inspection to determine potential safety and health hazards.
            Overpayment
            The 2007-2009 American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates show 53 percent of
            households overpay for housing costs (household paying 30 percent of more of
            income). Excessive rent or housing cost burdens contribute to mental stress, hunger,
            and overcrowding. Conversely, lower housing costs result in more disposable income
            for essential non-housing needs, allowing for a more balanced lifestyle.

Lead Exposure
Lead is in paint on houses built before 1978, especially houses built before 1960 and
is in many items we use in our homes. Lead can cause serious illness and learning
problems in school, and has been associated with levels of violent crime.xxiii Common
activities, such as auto/home repair and sweeping, can increase exposure to lead.
Lead poisoning can be prevented by covering old paint, mopping and wiping
surfaces, and keeping toys clean.xxiv
Asthma
In 2009, 12.3 percent of San Diego County residents reported ever being diagnosed
with asthma. In 2009, Asthma hospitalization rates in the City were 115.7 per
100,000 residents, compared to 76.4 in San Diego County. xxv Asthma triggers
include tobacco smoke, dust mites, pets, cockroaches, mold, allergens, and outdoor
air pollution. Asthma and respiratory infections can be prevented by not smoking
indoors, washing bedding in hot water frequently, keeping pets outside and off
furniture, storing food in airtight containers, keeping wet and damp surfaces dry,
fixing leaks quickly, and frequently ventilating indoor areas.
Homelessness
Factors contributing to homelessness include a lack of affordable housing, increases
in poverty levels, reductions in public subsidies to the poor, and the de-
institutionalization of the mentally ill. The 2012 “We All Count” survey by the
Regional Housing Task Force estimates there are 24 homeless persons in the City, all
of whom are unsheltered. Estimates show approximately 59 percent of homeless
persons in San Diego County experience mental illness and approximately 64 percent
have a history of substance abuse. Those experiencing homelessness include
families, victims of domestic violence, the developmentally disabled, and veterans.
Common health related conditions of homeless persons are mobility limitations, brain
injury, asthma, learning disabilities, Hepatitis C, severe heat and cold related
injuries, heart conditions, diabetes, and emphysema. Homeless persons often visit
the emergency room for in-patient and out-patient medical care. The homeless can
be aided by providing hygiene kits, food, clothing, wash facilities, shelter, and
service directories and homelessness can be prevented by providing transitional,
supportive, and affordable housing, jobs, and education to those persons at-risk of
becoming homeless.
Access to Medical Services
A healthy community needs quality, affordable medical practitioners and facilities
accessible to residents. Both the availability of primary care and its role in promoting
healthy lifestyles that can prevent or reduce the occurrence of chronic illness, and
                                                     City of Lemon Grove Health & Wellness Element|41

Existing Conditions
            ready access to urgent care and emergency care are vital components of a healthy
            community.
            Current Conditions
            The City is currently served by an abundance of health care professionals and
            facilities located along the commercial corridors, including private practitioners for
            routine and preventative care, dentistry, vision, chiropractic care, physical
            rehabilitation, and mental health. The Lemon Grove Family Health Center and La
            Maestra Community Health Center, both located on Broadway, offer a wide range of
            services, including healthy living education programs, prevention and early detection
            services, free or low-cost services for low-income patients, and assistance for
            obtaining insurance through Covered California and Medi-Cal. Urgent care is also
            available within the City and surrounding area. In addition to walking, biking, and
            using a private vehicle, transportation to both primary care and urgent care facilities
            along Broadway is available by public transportation with bus stops generally within
            one-half mile of any residence in the City.
            There are no hospital emergency departments within the City. However, the City
            provides paramedic emergency medical services through its fire department,

            transport to nearby hospitals, including Sharp Grossmont Hospital located four miles
            from the City and Alvarado Medical Center located five and one-half miles away.
            Public transportation to Sharp Grossmont Hospital takes approximately ten minutes
            by trolley from the Lemon Grove Depot to the Grossmont Transit Center, followed by
            a walk of one-third of a mile.

Socio-economic Environment
In addition to the physical makeup of the City, residents’ socio-economic
characteristics also play an important role in health and wellness. These
characteristics, which include factors such as age, race and ethnicity, income, and
educational attainment, make up the socio-economic environment of the City.
Depending on the socio-economic characteristics of a City’s population, certain
health issues may feature more prominently. Identifying the key features of the
socio-economic environment can help explain the City’s particular health challenges
and provide insight into how best to address them.
Population
Current Conditions
According to 2012 data from the Census Bureau, approximately 26,000 people live in
the City, making it the fourth-smallest city in San Diego County. Nonetheless, the
City continues to grow slowly but steadily, and its population is predicted to increase
by slightly less than one percent per year over the next several decades, bringing
the City’s total population to roughly 32,000 by 2050, as shown in Figure 15 below.
While the City’s population will increase in the future, its growth rate will be lower
than San Diego County as whole, which is expected to grow at over one percent per
year.

Existing Conditions
            Race and Ethnicity
            Health outcomes vary by race and ethnicity. For example, according to the Centers
            for Disease Control and Prevention 2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet,
            Hispanics/Latinos are 66 percent more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than
            non-Hispanic Whites. This can be for numerous reasons, such as differences in the
            way different ethnic groups use public space, a lack of culturally appropriate health
            services, language barriers, or many other factors. Because of this, it is important to
            understand the City’s racial and ethnic makeup, so that health and wellness policies
            and programs can be tailored to meet the specific needs of its citizens.
            Current Conditions
            As shown in Figure 16, the Hispanic population in the City makes up over 40
            percent of the population. The City has a 6 percent Asian population and a 13
            percent Black population. Approximately 35 percent of the population in the City is
            White.

            According to 2010 Census data, approximately 35 percent of the City’s population
            speaks a language other than English at home, and nearly 13 percent (over 3,000
            people) indicate that they do not speak English well. Although Spanish is the primary
            language of most non-English speakers within the City, Asian and Pacific Island
            languages are also prominent.

Age
Health needs vary by age. Programs, infrastructure changes, and other interventions
that are effective for one age group may be ineffective (or even counterproductive)
for groups of a different age. Understanding the current and projected age
distribution of residents will help decision makers and health officials create a set of
health policies that are useful to current residents, and help ensure that long-term
policies take into consideration the future age distribution in the City.
Current Conditions
According to 2010 Census data, approximately 35 percent of the population are
under age 25 and 11 percent over age 65 (Figure 17).

Over the next several decades this distribution is expected to shift. Although the
percentage of the City’s population under age 15 as of 2010 is significantly greater
than its older population (over 65), by 2020, these two groups are predicted to be
roughly equivalent, and, by 2050, residents over age 65 will outnumber youth by
almost two to one (Figure 18).

            Economic Status
            Individual and household economic status is closely linked to health outcomes.
            People with high incomes and higher levels of educational attainment typically live
            longer than their poorer counterparts, and diseases, such as diabetes, are more
            prevalent among poor adults.xxvi
            Current Conditions
            The median household income in the City is approximately $50,000, compared to a
            median household income of approximately $65,000 overall in San Diego County
            (2007-2011 American Community Survey). Nearly 30 percent of households in the
            City make less than $25,000, compared to about 20 percent of households in all of
            San Diego County. In the future, SANDAG data shows that the percentage of
            households in Lemon Grove making less than $25,000 is expected to decline, but the
            City will continue to have a higher proportion of households with low incomes than
            San Diego County overall (Figure 19).

Similarly, more people live below the poverty level in the City than in San Diego
County overall, with 18 percent of City residents living in poverty, as compared to 13
percent in San Diego County. xxvii This disparity is even more pronounced for families
with children under 18 years of age. In the City, approximately 20 percent of families
with children live below the poverty level, compared to 14 percent in San Diego
County overall (Figure 20).

Existing Conditions
            Map 9 on the following page shows poverty is concentrated within the northern
            portion of the City. This area has higher density housing and many heavy
            commercial and retail uses.
            Educational attainment for high school graduation in the City is roughly the same as
            the number of high school graduates in the County as a whole. The number of City
            residents with a bachelor’s degree or higher is much lower at 15 percent; compared
            to 34 percent in San Diego County overall (Figure 21). As with income levels,
            education is correlated with health outcomes; college graduates live at least five
            years longer than people who haven’t graduated high school.xxviii

            Crime
            Crime has a variety of impacts on community health. It can affect health directly
            through personal injury, such as injuries from violent crimes or traffic crashes. It can
            also affect health indirectly when it creates unsafe environments that deter physical
            activity. For example, drug activity in a local park may keep parents from bringing
            their children there to use the playground.
            Current Conditions
            Crime rates are similar in the City compared to regional averages.xxix In 2013, the
            FBI index crime rate per 1,000 population was 26 regionally, compared to 25.59 in
            the City. Violent Crimes regionally were 3.66 per 1,000 population compared to 5.67
            in the City; property crimes were 22.34 per 1,000 regionally compared to 19.92 in
            the City. There were 145 violent crimes and 509 property crimes reported in the City
            in 2013. The property stolen was valued at $1,249,928 and 36 percent was
            recovered, compared to an 18 percent recovery rate regionally.
            Communities can help to deter crime through programs like Neighborhood Watch,
            Crime Free Housing Programs (e.g., crime free lease addendums, tenant screenings,
            eviction policies, landlord training, and crime prevention meetings), and Safe Routes
            to School, neighborhood clean-up, and after-school programs (e.g., athletic, art, and
            tutoring programs). The City currently utilizes Crime Prevention Through
            Environmental Design practices for new projects, such as utilizing lighting,
            landscape, security, interiors, and common areas to help deter crime.

Accomplishments
Throughout San Diego County and within the City, residents, elected officials, public
health officials, and other community leaders have been working together to
improve health and wellness in our area. The City has already taken a number of
steps to help improve health in the community.
Healthy Eating Active Living (HEAL) Zone
                                         The Healthy Eating Active Living (HEAL)
                                         Zone Initiative (2013), funded by a four-year
                                         grant from the Kaiser Permanente
                                         Foundation, is designed to help improve
                                         health and decrease obesity by making
                                         healthy choices more accessible to people
                                         living in the City. This will be accomplished
                                         through policy changes, public education,
                                         and the promotion of healthy lifestyle
                                         choices within the HEAL Zone. The initiative
                                         is guided by an advisory steering committee
                                         of over 25 community stakeholders made up
                                         of representatives from nine sectors that are
                                         influential in creating healthier communities:
                                         business, community, early childhood, faith,
healthcare, local government, media, schools, and service organizations.
Committee members have identified 36 health strategies aimed to achieve three
overall project goals for the community:
         1. Reduce calorie consumption,
         2. Increase consumption of healthy foods and beverages, and
         3. Increase physical activity.
The committee has already implemented some programs to promote these goals,
such as after-school yoga classes for elementary school students in Lemon Grove’s
School District’s Extended Day Program, the creation of a Wellness Hub Walk Block
in the downtown area, and the Resident Leadership Academy. The HEAL Zone
Initiative sponsored the City’s Health & Wellness Element and the committee
provides input on its content and policies. In the coming years, the committee will
continue to provide ongoing recommendations and direction for implementation of
HEAL Zone projects.

                                                                  strategy and has evolved into a
                                                                  greater long-term effort to
            improve the health and wellness of all County residents. Live Well San Diego
            adopted four approaches for realizing its vision:
                1. Building a Better Service Delivery System: Improving the quality and
                    efficiency of County government and its partners in the delivery of services to
                    residents, contributing to better outcomes for clients and results for
                    communities.
                2. Supporting Positive Choices: Providing information and resources to
                    inspire County residents to take action and responsibility for their health,
                    safety and well-being.
                3. Pursuing Policy and Environmental Changes: Creating environments
                    and adopting policies that make it easier for everyone to live well, and
                    encouraging individuals to get involved in improving their communities.
                4. Improving the Culture Within County Government: Increasing
                    understanding among County employees and providers about what it means
                    to Live Well and the role that all employees play in helping county
                    residents Live Well
            The City of Lemon Grove joined Live Well San Diego as a recognized partner on
            December 3, 2013.
            Safe Routes to Schools
            Through a Federal Safe Routes to Schools grant, Circulate San Diego (formerly
                                                        WalkSanDiego) began working with five
                                                        elementary schools and Lemon Grove
                                                        Academy Middle School in the City. The
                                                        purpose of the program is to support and
                                                        encourage students to walk and bike to
                                                        local schools, through outreach and
                                                        education, as well as through
                                                        improvements to the pedestrian and bike
                                                        environment that surround the schools. In
                                                        partnership with school communities,
            Circulate San Diego has conducted community workshops, held assemblies regarding
            pedestrian and bicycle safety, planned activities for National Walk to School Day,

created coalitions of parents and school staff,and developed designated safe routes
to school along with possible solutions for improving these routes.
Community Gardens and Farmer’s Markets
Community gardens and farmers markets may promote healthy eating within a
community, as well as provide a source of income, education, social interaction, and
recreation for community members. In March 2012, the City Council identified the
                                                    creation of supportive policies for
                                                    community gardens and farmer’s
                                                    markets as a priority for the City,
                                                    and asked staff to evaluate
                                                    provisions in the City’s Municipal
                                                    Code that support or prevent
                                                    community gardens and farmers
                                                    markets.
                                                    The Municipal Code was amended
                                                    in April 2014 providing for
                                                    community gardens within the
                                                    City. A community garden is
already in place at San Miguel Elementary School. Created with the help of students,
teachers, and community members, the garden provides produce for student taste
tests and cooking demonstrations, as well as a place for students to learn about
gardening.
Farmer’s Markets are allowed on City-owned property through City Council approved
lease agreements. The City anticipates new farmer’s markets in the City within the
near future.
Complete Streets Policy
Complete Streets is a transportation policy and design approach that requires streets
to be planned, designed, operated, and maintained to enable safe, convenient, and
comfortable travel and access for users of all ages and abilities regardless of their
mode of transportation. As part of the HEAL Zone efforts, the City conducted an
internal staff meeting to discuss the concept of Complete Streets and a Complete
Streets policy was drafted by staff for consideration by the City Council at a future
date.
City of Lemon Grove Healthy Food Policy
In May 2013, the City adopted a Healthy Food Policy that applies to City-sponsored
meetings and events. According to the policy, if snacks or beverages are served at
City meetings or events, healthy options such as fruit, water, or 100-percent juice

            purpose of this policy is to “…increase
            awareness and consumption of
            healthy food and beverages and to
            promote healthy eating and active
            living.”
            Lemon Grove School District Wellness Policy
            In June 2013, the Lemon Grove School District (District) adopted a student wellness
            policy establishing goals and policies related to the health and wellness of students
            and staff in the Lemon Grove School District. As part of the policy, the District
                                                                  committed to establishing a

            school gardens, ensuring regular physical activity for students, and supporting the
            health and wellness of school staff.
            Broadway Corridor Walkability Report
            In response to community feedback and input from HEAL Zone leadership, the City
            worked with Circulate San Diego (formerly WalkSanDiego) to complete an evaluation
            of pedestrian conditions on
            Broadway between
            Massachusetts and
            Washington Street. The
            study identified positive
            attributes of the corridor,
            along with areas for long-
            and short-term modifications
            to help improve pedestrian
            safety and walkability along
            Broadway.

Best Walk Application
The City and Circulate San Diego (formerly WalkSanDiego) facilitated participation in
Circulate San Diego’s “Best Walk App” which rated street segments and intersections
throughout the City using various criteria, including safety, improvements, and ease
of use. The majority of the City’s major streets and commercial areas were rated.
Main Street Promenade and Extension
The Main Street Promenade redeveloped
Main Street between North Avenue and
Broadway to create a linear park and transit
plaza in the heart of the City. Featuring art
and other design elements promoting Lemon
Grove’s history and identity as an
agricultural center, the promenade includes
a playground, shaded rest areas, and space
for special events, such as a potential
farmer’s market. The dedicated pedestrian
path through the center of the City, with
connections to adjacent housing and transit,       Main Street Promenade
helps promote walking and physical activity
for residents and visitors. The project opened in August 2013.

Existing Conditions
            The City has subsequently begun planning for a two mile extension of the
            Promenade from Broadway to the south end of the City along Main Street and the
            trolley corridor. This extension can be a central meeting location for all residents
            promoting physical activity, socializing, and connecting the City’s residents. The goal
            of the project is to create a safe, comfortable, and enjoyable place for people to
            socialize, walk, bike, and run.
            Lemon Grove Avenue Realignment Project
            The planned realignment of Lemon Grove Avenue will improve access into the City,
            creating a distinctive gateway into Lemon Grove, with an emphasis on improving
            access to the City’s parks and trolley service. As part of the realignment, new
            pedestrian paths will be provided along the roadway connecting the north and south
            sides of Hwy 94 and improving walkability and pedestrian safety.
            Lemon Grove Library
            Public spaces help promote community health by providing opportunities for social
            interaction. In June 2013, the new Lemon Grove Library opened in a central part of
            the City. The library features study and computer rooms, a bookstore, a community
            room, and other amenities such as wireless internet access.
            Berry Street Park Dog Park
            In January 2014, the City completed its first
            dog park at Berry Street Park. The dog park is
            located in the southeast corner of the park.
            The dog park helps promote physical activity
            by encouraging residents to walk their dogs to
            the park.
            Expansion of the Skate Spot
            The City plans to improve the Skate Spot, a popular skate park at Firefighters Park
            near the fire station. As part of this project, the skate area will be expanded and
            additional skating amenities, such as stairs, a quarter-pipe, or rails, will be added.
            Community-Building Events
            Creating a sense of community and social connectedness is an important aspect of
            public health. The City facilitates a number of community-building events throughout
            the year, such as free public concerts, movies in the park, and an annual community
            bonfire with games and refreshments.

Community Workshop
Supervisor Diane Jacobs, the County of San Diego Health & Human Services Agency,
the East County Chamber of Commerce, and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention sponsored a Community Workshop with Mark Fenton, a nationally
recognized public health, planning, and transportation consultant. Mark Fenton
conducted the Workshop in March 2012 to discuss how to build better health in the
community. Mr. Fenton explained the economic, environmental, and public health
benefits of active community design. He also led a walking tour around portions of
the City’s downtown to explore elements that impact active lifestyles.
HEAL Zone Block Party
The Lemon Grove HEAL Zone partnered with the City to hold a Block Party in June
2013 on School Lane near the Recreation Center. The event featured a bike rodeo, a
hacky sack competition, a coloring contest, basketball and skateboarding contests,
prizes, medical and dental health screenings, and more. The new Walk Block was
introduced and is bordered by Lincoln Street, Kempf Street, Golden Avenue, and
School Lane. Participants were encouraged to visit associated booths at each corner
of the Walk Block.

             Several different means were used to obtain community input during the
             development of the Health & Wellness Element. The following describes each of the
             outreach activities.

                                                           new Lemon Grove Library. As part of
                                                           the event, the City sponsored a booth
                                                           offering a hacky sack competition and
                                                           coloring contest for children. These
                                                           activities provided the opportunity to
                                                           speak with parents and their adult
                                                           friends for an extended period of time
                                                           regarding the City’s parks and other
                                                           community health-related topics,
                                                           while the kids were entertained. The
                                                           winner of the Coloring Contest was

                                                           Workshop on July 25, 2013.
             Two flyers, prepared in both English and Spanish, were distributed to all who visited
             the booth. One flyer announced an upcoming Health & Wellness Element Community
             Workshop and the other provided the explanation of what the Health & Wellness
             Element will address and “What is a General Plan.”
             A map of the City was on display and residents were invited to place a push pin on
             the map to show where they live, and discuss the parks they or their family use
             most frequently. Residents were also asked what they like about the parks, if there
             are things they would change, and to provide additional feedback to help ensure
             their community is a healthy place.

             Lemon Grove Community Yard Sale
             The City also hosted a booth at the Lemon Grove Community Yard Sale, which took
             place on June 22, 2013. Similar to the booth at the HEAL Zone Block Party, adult
             participants were provided an opportunity to answer questions regarding the health
             environment in the City, while children worked on entries for the coloring contest.
             Input at the Yard Sale focused on healthy food access in the City. Participants were
             first asked to pinpoint the location of their residence, and then respond to a series of
             questions about grocery shopping and restaurants in the community, including:
                     Where do you usually shop for groceries?
                     Do you ever walk/bike to buy groceries?
                     If you eat out, where do you usually go?
                     Do you walk to go out to eat?
                     How easy is it to find your favorite foods in Lemon Grove? Is anything
                      missing?
             The information from the survey was used to supplement other existing conditions
             data and to tailor Goals, Objectives, and Policies in the Health & Wellness Element to
             the needs of the community.
             HEAL Zone Advisory Steering Committee
             Meeting
             The HEAL Zone Initiative includes a steering committee of stakeholders representing
             various areas in the community that influence public health. On June 26, 2013, the
             steering committee was presented with information regarding the preparation of the
             proposed Health & Wellness Element and asked to provide specific input about the
             strengths and challenges for community health in the City. In addition, each steering
             committee member drafted a statement of their personal vision for health in the
             community. The input was used to supplement other existing conditions data, as
             well as to help form the overall Vision statement for the Element.

             Workshop
             On July 25, 2013, a community workshop was held to obtain specific public input on
             health in Lemon Grove, as well as to recognize the winners of the coloring contest
             conducted at the HEAL Zone Block Party and Community Yard Sale. A large cross-
             section of approximately 50 young adults, families, and retirees attended. After

being presented with basic information regarding the General Plan, the Health &
Wellness Element preparation process, and information concerning existing health
conditions, a variety of activities were used to obtain input on health issues in the
City.
First, attendees participated in a “Healthy Tree” exercise to identify problematic
health outcomes in the community, as well as the specific behaviors of community
members that led to those outcomes and the underlying causes that led to those
behaviors. As shown in Figure 22, participants identified the root causes, behaviors,
and health outcomes affecting residents at the Workshop.

Outreach
             Next, using electronic audience polling, participants answered several multiple-choice
             questions related to physical activity, parks, and healthy food access in the City.
             Some of the key questions included:
                     What type of physical activity are you most likely to participate in on a
                      regular basis?
                     Which park do you visit most often in Lemon Grove?
                     Why do you usually walk in Lemon Grove?
                     In the last month, have you purchased food from a farmer’s market?
                     How often do you eat in fast-food restaurants?
             Audience responses were shown in real time, often leading to additional discussion
             about health opportunities and barriers in the City. Approximately 85 percent of
             participants engaged in 20 minutes or more of physical activity each day, with running
             or jogging being the most popular physical activities, followed by dancing/a dance
             class, and an organized sport. When asked which park they visited most often, over
             half of the participants said Berry Street Park, with another 17 percent visiting Lemon
             Grove Park most often. Participants said they would most like to have more walking
             or running trails in City parks, as well as a public pool, ball fields or basketball courts,
             and more picnic tables and shelters.
             When asked about walking and biking, approximately half of participants said they
             regularly (once a week or more) walked or biked in the community. Most participants
             walked or biked for exercise, though some also walked or biked to take kids to school
             or visit friends and relatives. A lack of sidewalks and bike lanes, speeding, and low
             bike ownership were key reasons that participants did not walk or bike more in the
             City.

Partcipants also identified a demand for additional healthy restaurant choices in the
City, including smoothie or juice bars, soup and salad buffets, and café/ bistros.
Although there is not currently a farmer’s market in the City, approximately half of
participants indicated that they had purchased food from a farmer’s market in the
past month representing a relative demand.
The third exercise was a prioritization exercise. Attendees were given $1 million in
“play money” to distribute among ten potential health-related improvements in the
City, including items such as wayfinding signs, a community garden, new sidewalks
and bike parking. Each suggested improvement was assigned a cost roughly
proportionate to its real-world cost (i.e., improvements such as new signs or
community gardens were less expensive than new parks or completing the City’s
bicycle network). Attendees used their money to “pay” for the improvements they
would most like to see in the City. Figure 23 shows the percentage of total dollars
each improvement received from the attendees.

Finally, workshop participants were asked to draft their own vision statement for
health in the community. Input from the community workshop was used to develop
the overall Vision for health in the City, as well as to supplement existing conditions
data and to identify key health challenges and barriers. The input also helped to
create the Goals, Objectives, and Policies in the Health & Wellness Element, and
identify and prioritize associated implementation measures.

                     strong sense of community identity, Lemon Grove has the foundation in place for a
                     physically and socially well-connected city. The City’s Health and Wellness Plan
                     describes the outcomes that Lemon Grove will achieve by accomplishing the Goals,
                     Objectives, Policies, and Programs in the Health & Wellness Element, as well as the
                     steps the City can take to help achieve its overall vision for Health and Wellness.
                     Based on the existing health conditions and input from the community, the City has
                     identified a Vision for Health and Wellness in Lemon Grove, as well as as set of
                     Goals, Policies, Objectives, and Programs to implement that vision. The Vision for the
                     Element is to provide a Healthy Community through Physical and Social Connections.

                     Land Use
                     A diverse and relatively dense mix of residential, commercial, civic, and recreational
                     land uses is critical to the economic success of a city, and can promote residents’
                     health by providing opportunities to meet daily needs on foot or by bike. The City
                     will incorporate a variety of development tools to encourage higher-density, mixed-
                     use projects that will help promote economic sustainability throughout the City. This
                     may require updates to the City’s Community Development Element and Municipal
                     Code to allow increased density along commercial corridors and promote both

                                                                        Health and Wellness Plan
vertical (office or housing uses over commercial uses) and horizontal (a variety of
uses within a single block or neighborhood) mixed-use projects. As opportunities
arise, the City can also investigate additional park opportunities through joint use
agreements and neighborhood-serving retail and service uses to allow residents to
more easily accomplish routine errands without driving.
The City can use mixed-use zoning, development incentives such as density
bonuses, and other land use tools to assist in creating an economically and socially
vibrant city that provides a variety of employment, housing, and transportation
choices to meet the needs of all residents.
Connectivity
The physical transportation network that ties residential neighborhoods with one
another and with recreational and commercial uses is a critical component of
connectivity. The City will continue to work on expanding and enhancing the
sidewalk and bicycle network to encourage residents to move around on foot, by
bike, and to use transit. Updated policies and design standards, including a revised
Mobility Element (including Complete Streets Policies), will ensure future
improvements to the City’s streets will make them “complete,” enhancing the
infrastructure that supports active transportation, such as sidewalks, crosswalks,
wayfinding signs, bicycle lanes, lighting, and landscaping. When approving new
development in the City, the provision of pedestrian and bicyclist connections to
commercial centers, parks, and public transit will be a priority. Walking paths can be
required along retail storefronts and bike parking can be abundant within all
shopping centers.

Health and Wellness Plan
             The City will explore ways for all residents to live within walking distance of a
             quarter mile of retail uses, transit stops and recreational areas, as a way to meet
             their daily shopping needs on foot, which also promotes physical activity. Secure
             bicycle parking will be required of new development to promote cycling for daily
             trips.
                                                                        The City can also focus on
                                                                        creating streetscapes,
                                                                        buildings and public spaces
                                                                        that support physical activity.
                                                                        Building design requirements
                                                                        will be updated to promote
                                                                        pedestrian and bicycle

                                                                        active transportation and
                                                                        exercise is prioritized
                                                                        throughout the community.
                                                                        New streetscape amenities,
                                                                        for example, lighting,
             wayfinding signage, trees, and outdoor dining, will make City streets pleasant and
             walkable for residents and visitors, further encouraging physical activity and
             improving citizens’ health.
             The City will continue to place importance on ensuring that this network is safe and
             convenient for all users, particularly pedestrians and bicyclists. The City will
             emphasize the safety of the transportation network using a variety of measures. This
             will include providing well-lit travelways and building and site design that
             incorporates Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) strategies to
             deter criminal activity and improve residents’ sense of personal safety. Volunteer
             community safety and Neighborhood Watch programs can be promoted to help
             provide “eyes-on-the-street” to discourage crime and nuisance activities.
             Parks
             City parks and recreational areas provide spaces for residents to enjoy many
             different types of physical activities, such as walking, group sports, skateboarding,
             biking, and unstructured play. The City will continue to investigate and program new
             amenities in existing parks that meet the needs and interests of residents.
             Opportunities to expand recreational space will be explored through such means as
             joint use agreements at existing facilities belonging to schools, churches, and other
             community organizations and private owners. Creative use of existing infrastructure
             to provide new spaces for recreation, for instance, converting existing parking

spaces to “parklets” or temporarily closing streets to vehicle traffic for open streets
events, will provide additional opportunities for physical activity.
Parks also provide multiple opportunities for social connections. Providing safe,
pleasant spaces for residents to meet and interact supports the social cohesion of
the community. The City will continue to focus on safety in parks, ensuring that all
parks are clean, well-maintained, and accessible to users of all ages, interests, and
abilities. The City will also continue to support community-building activities such as
concerts and movies in the park that promote community identity and encourage
residents to interact with their neighbors.
Healthy Eating
In combination with regular exercise, a healthy diet can reduce chronic disease and
                                                             improve overall health. The
                                                             City can promote healthy
                                                             eating by helping to ensure
                                                             residents have access to
                                                             healthy and affordable food,
                                                             such as fresh produce and
                                                             healthy meal choices in
                                                             restaurants.
                                                             The City will improve access
                                                             to fresh produce by

             edible plants in public and private landscaping and supporting community gardens.
             As a health leader, the City will support the work of schools, community
             organizations, restaurants, and grocery stores to highlight local produce through
             outdoor produce displays, a City farmer’s market, and community-supported
             agriculture programs.
             The City will lead by example, providing healthy food options such as water and fruit
             at City-sponsored events, and continuing to implement its Healthy Food Policy. The
             City will also support healthy eating by encouraging local restaurants to offer healthy
             menu options and discouraging an over-saturation of restaurants that offer primarily
             unhealthy choices, such as fast food restaurants. Healthy food choices will also be
             promoted through local educational and nutritional programs at local schools and by
             targeting vulnerable populations such as seniors and low-income residents.
             Social Connections
             Social connections and opportunities for interaction create unity within a community,
             which is also a determinate of health. An enhanced sense of community safety
             creates an environment conducive to positive, casual encounters between
             community members.
                                                                             The City will work

             comfortable walking to local destinations, facilitating positive interaction between
             neighbors and improving informal social networks. The City will also work to provide
             a variety of gathering places where residents can meet and interact informally,
             fostering social connectivity, civic identity, and community cohesion.
             The City will partner with local and regional social and civic organizations to promote
             community health through outreach, events, and policies that encourage physical
             activity and healthy eating. In particular, the City will explore opportunities to work
             with area schools to pursue funding for projects that improve youth physical fitness.

City Leadership
By adopting a Health &
Wellness Element, the
City acknowledges its
role as a community
health leader,
recognizing the
importance of
promoting healthy
eating and active living
and the relationship to
the long-term economic
vitality of the City.
The City will take
advantage of a variety of communication outlets, including the website, community
newsletter, and social media sites, to promote positive messages about healthy
living. A key component of this message is leading by example, making a
commitment to providing healthy food and drink choices at City events and facilities;
and ensuring timely maintenance of City streets and properties.
The City will also support regional efforts to promote health through improved air
quality and efforts to help decrease waste and improve the environment by such
new measures as placing recycling receptacles in public locations. The City will work
with adjacent jurisdictions and regional government to ensure its pedestrian, bicycle,
and transit networks provide effective connections to key nearby and regional
destinations.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
