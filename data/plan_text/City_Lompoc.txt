                                 2030 General Plan
CIRCULATION ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION AND AUTHORITY
The Circulation Element is required by the Government Code [Section 65302(b)], which states that the
Circulation Element must include “the general location and extent of existing and proposed major
thoroughfares, transportation route, terminals, and…facilities, all correlated with the land use element of
the plan.”
The Circulation Element of the Lompoc General Plan addresses broad issues of physical mobility - how
goods and people move about into, out of, and within the community. Meeting the City’s transportation
needs is one of the most pervasive issues of the General Plan, and is related to land use, community design,
air quality, energy consumption, public health and City infrastructure. Moreover, circulation issues are not
simply local concerns, but require coordination with regional, state, and federal agencies, as well as
adjacent communities.
The overall intent of the Circulation Element is to achieve and maintain a balanced, safe, and problem-free
transportation system that:
    Provides easy and convenient access to all areas of the community 
    Improves present traffic flows while maintaining Lompoc's rural, small town sense of place 
    Protects major environmental features 
    Reduces dependence on single occupant automobile travel by providing a high level of pedestrian,
     bicycle, and public transit travel opportunities 
 Considers the movement of people and vehicles in the design and operation of transportation
     systems
 Recognizes the special mobility needs of seniors, youth, and persons with disabilities
 Preserves a sense of comfort and well-being throughout the community by minimizing the
     intrusiveness of commercial/business park and regional traffic on neighborhood streets and quality
     of life
Performance Objectives and Planned Improvements
The City shall maintain intersection traffic levels of service (LOS) at LOS C or better throughout the City,
with the exception of intersections monitored in accordance with the Congestion Management Program
(CMP) administered by the Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG). CMP
intersections shall maintain a LOS in accordance with the most recent CMP standards (at LOS D or better),
when it can be demonstrated that all feasible mitigation measures have been applied to the project and LOS
C, with said mitigation, cannot be achieved. The standards are based on the actual function of these
roadways. The CMP intersection standard reflects the fact that these intersections are subject to regional
influences beyond Lompoc’s control.
                                                                                            CITY of LOMPOC

CITY OF LOMPOC
2030 GENERAL PLAN
CIRCULATION ELEMENT
Lompoc will continue to require new developments to mitigate their traffic impacts, either through
construction of circulation improvements, reduction in demand for vehicular travel, or payment of
mitigation fees, which are to be based on the projected costs for planned system improvements and each
new development’s proportional share of the total traffic affecting the location where the improvement in
planned. Planned improvements will be necessary to mitigate traffic impacts associated with proposed
developments so that an acceptable level of service can be maintained. The mitigation requirement will
continue to be proportional to the impact created by each new development and will recognize a fee credit
to developers who construct portions of ultimate capacity enhancement improvements.
Specific goals, policies, implementation measures, and definitions of the Circulation Element comprise the
balance of this element.
                                                                                           CITY of LOMPOC

GOALS AND POLICIES
Goal 1
Maximize the efficiency, quality, and safety of a multi-modal circulation system which provides for the
movement of people, goods, and services to serve the internal circulation needs of the City, while also
addressing through-travel needs.
Policies
Policy 1.1       The City shall use the Roadway Designations map, Bikeway Routes map, and Truck
                 Routes map in establishing the location and design of roadways, bikeways, and truck
                 routes, respectively.
Policy 1.2       The City shall maintain intersection traffic levels of service (LOS) at LOS C or better
                 throughout the City, with the exception of intersections monitored in accordance with the
                 Congestion Management Program (CMP) administered by the Santa Barbara County
                 Association of Governments (SBCAG). CMP intersections shall maintain a LOS in
                 accordance with the most recent CMP standards (at LOS D or better), when it can be
                 demonstrated that all feasible mitigation measures have been applied to the project and
                 LOS C, with said mitigation, cannot be achieved.
Policy 1.3       The City shall assure that all improvements to the multi-modal circulation system
                 necessitated by new development are proportionately financed by the project sponsor.
Policy 1.4       The City shall only allow development in areas where adequate multi-modal circulation
                 facilities and/or services, as defined in Policy 1.2, will be available at the time of
                 development.
Policy 1.5       The City shall maximize movement of through-traffic on expressways and arterials by
                 encouraging efficient utilization of existing roadway capacity, and when necessary
                 providing additional transportation capacity. For arterials, consideration shall also be
                 given to planned or future pedestrian and bicyclist facilities so that vehicular
                 improvements are not at the expense of facilities and safety of these other modes of
                 transportation.
Policy 1.6       The City shall continue to require private roadways to be constructed and maintained to
                 City standards.
Policy 1.7       The City shall vacate or reduce under-utilized rights-of-way, where appropriate, while
                 retaining access to utilities.
Policy 1.8       The City shall require an adequate supply of private and public off-street parking to meet
                 the needs of residents and visitors to the City [refer to Section 8851 of the Lompoc
                 Zoning Ordinance (Schedule of Off-Street Parking Requirements)].
Policy 1.9       The City shall ensure that developers of new commercial and mixed use areas provide
                 adequate and convenient pedestrian access ways and bike ways into adjacent residential
                 neighborhoods.
Policy 1.10      The City shall control access along expressways and arterials by limiting the number of
                 intersections and driveways entering and exiting these high traffic roadways and by
                                                                                              CITY of LOMPOC

2030 GENERAL PLAN
CIRCULATION ELEMENT
                requiring that any development of new private driveways along such roadways does not
                introduce significant traffic conflicts.
Policy 1.11     To avoid the creation of new traffic flow hazards, the City SHALL require that future
                roads and improvements to existing roads be designed to minimize conflicting traffic
                movements such as overlapping use of turn lanes, curbside parking, and frequent stops.
Policy 1.12     The City shall improve mobility and access for disabled persons.
Goal 2
Minimize the public's exposure to circulation-related noise and safety hazards.
Policies
Policy 2.1      The City’s truck routes shall be designated along corridors that minimize traffic-
                generated noise upon noise sensitive land uses (refer to Figure C-2).
Policy 2.2      The City shall encourage regulatory agencies to designate routes away from urban and
                environmentally-sensitive areas for transportation of hazardous and explosive materials.
Policy 2.3      The City shall ensure that approaches to intersection crosswalks and all adjacent street
                corners are illuminated by requiring all new commercial, entertainment, school and other
                pedestrian generating uses to provide lighting for pedestrians, for review and
                consideration by the City as part of the development review process.
Policy 2.4      The City should encourage the provision of high-visibility signage, crosswalks and curb
                ramps along major access routes to all schools. For newly proposed schools, the City
                shall work with the school district to ensure the provision of complete sidewalks, high-
                visibility signage and crosswalks, curb ramps and marked bike paths as part of
                development.
Policy 2.5      As part of the development review process, the City shall require a system of sidewalks
                and multi-modal transportation pathways for all new development to provide a safe
                environment for pedestrians and promote pedestrian and bicycle use.
Policy 2.6      The City shall consider the extent of vehicular through-traffic on local streets in new
                residential neighborhoods and should encourage the minimization of such through-traffic.
                                                                                          CITY of LOMPOC

CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION AND AUTHORITY
Lompoc possesses many resources that contribute to its unique character and beauty as a place to live,
work, and visit. Lompoc takes pride in the natural beauty of its coastal central valley, the surrounding
countryside filled with flowers and vineyards, and the year-round welcoming climate. The key to
maintaining this healthy and vibrant community as Lompoc continues to grow is through the stewardship of
its natural resources—such as air quality, water, energy, and soil—for the protection of plant and wildlife
habitats, and public health, safety and welfare, and through the preservation of land for recreational
activities. Lompoc’s cultural resources are also important, as they provide a link to the City’s past, help
shape its present-day character, celebrate its unique identity, and offer a source of pride and community
connection for its residents.
The Conservation and Open Space Element emphasizes Lompoc’s desire to conserve, preserve, and
enhance natural and cultural resources. The Element establishes a number of goals, policies and
implementation actions for the long-term protection and preservation of resources that help define the
City’s identity, contribute to its economy, and improve its quality of life. The topics addressed in this
Conservation and Open Space Element include:
      Biological Resources (refer to Figure C/OS-1)
      Cultural Resources
      Soil and Mineral Resources (refer to Figure C/OS-2)
      Water Resources
      Air Quality
      Energy Resources
      Open Space (refer to Figure C/OS-3)
As stated in the State General Plan Guidelines (Governor’s Office of Planning and Research, 2003), one
role of the Conservation Element is to establish policies that reconcile conflicting demands on these
resources. Likewise, Open Space Element guides conflicting demands for the conservation and use of open
space land. Because of its breadth, the open space element overlaps other elements and is commonly
combined with other elements. For example: the Land Use Element provides for open space for agriculture,
recreation, and scenic uses; the Conservation Element provides for open space for the preservation and
managed production of Natural Resources; and the Safety Element provides for open space for public
health and safety purposes.
                                                                                             CITY of LOMPOC

CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
As required by Government Code Section 65560, the Open Space Element takes into consideration open
space lands, defined as any parcel or area of land or water which is designated on a local, regional, or state
open space plan as any of the following:
      Open space for the preservation of natural resources including, but not limited to, areas required
         for the preservation of plant and animal life, including habitat for fish; areas required for ecologic
         and other scientific study purposes; rivers, streams, bays and estuaries; and coastal beaches, banks
         of rivers and streams, and watershed lands.
      Open space for outdoor recreation, including but not limited to, areas of outstanding scenic,
         historic and cultural value; areas particularly suited for park and recreation purposes, including
         access to lakeshores, beaches, and rivers and streams; and areas which serve as links between
         major recreation and open space reservations, including utility easements, banks of rivers and
         streams, trails, and scenic highway corridors.
      Open space for public health and safety, including, but not limited to, areas which require special
         management or regulation because of hazardous or special conditions such as unstable soil areas,
         flood plains, areas presenting high fire risks, areas required for the protection of air and water
         quality.
      Open space used for the managed production of resources, including but not limited to, forest
         lands, rangeland and areas of economic importance; areas for recharge of groundwater basins;
         bays, estuaries, rivers and streams for the management of commercial fisheries; and areas
         containing major mineral deposits.
Lompoc recognizes its role as steward of all lands within its jurisdiction, as well as its responsibility to
promote and participate in solutions to the global environmental concerns. The City will continue to take an
active role in the management of its natural resources for the benefit of present and future residents. The
general overall goals of the Conservation and Open Space Element are to:
      Preserve significant environmental features within Lompoc and provide for their wise
         management.
      Minimize the consumption of natural resources needed to support life in Lompoc and ensure the
         wise use of those resources.

  Policy 1.2       The City shall encourage protection and mitigation of impacts to sensitive and critical
                   habitats for special-status plant and animal species, as identified by the state and federal
                   fish and wildlife agencies. [Final EIR Mitigation Measure BIO-2(a)]

                   components of the City's unique urban form. Watercourses shall be retained in a natural
                   state where possible, rather than placed in concrete or placed underground.
  Policy 1.5       The City shall encourage the provision, maintenance, and protection of public access to
                   publically-owned natural habitats and other open space areas in a manner that is not

                   organizations to acquire properties that incorporate or are adjacent to the Mission Vieja
                   de la Purisima site.
  Policy 2.4       The City shall continue support of the Lompoc Museum.
  Policy 2.5       The City shall continue to encourage local organizations (e.g. Lompoc Valley Historical

The structure of the City’s economy plays an important role in the physical development of the City and in
the stability of the City’s local tax base. The Economic Development Element is based upon a desire to
maintain and enhance the economic character of the community while providing for a stable annual budget.
Towards this end, the City’s Economic Development Element establishes a consistent set of policies that
provide general direction on how the City can focus resources to retain local business, attract new
industries, support the tax base, and sustain the ability to provide public services for current and future
residents.
The Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG) 2012 Regional Growth Forecast predicts
population and employment growth patterns from 2010 to 2040. Over the course of the forecast period, the
county’s population is forecast to increase by 23% and employment is forecast to increase by 30%. While
job growth for the County as a whole is projected to outpace population growth, the forecast for Lompoc is
that population will grow by 20% but that employment will only grow by 12%. Through the
implementation of policies and measures set forth in this Economic Development Element, the City can
attract a higher percentage of job growth projected for the region.
Historically, the County has had a comparatively high share of employment in agriculture and government,
but the forecast predicts that these sectors will experience below-average job growth to 2040. At the same
time, the region has had below-average shares in professional and business services and internet-related
information services, but these sectors are expected to experience above-average job growth. In addition,
new jobs in the leisure and hospitality (tourism) sector, and in the self-employed jobs sector, are projected
to have above-average job growth prospects. The fact that Lompoc currently has the second largest
concentration of tasting rooms in Santa Barbara County is evidence that Lompoc is in a good position to
change past trends. Lompoc is strategically situated in the heart of wine country and it is also in close
proximity to the ocean, Vandenberg Air Force Base, the Lompoc Valley Medical Center, the Allan
Hancock Public Safety Training Center, La Purisima Mission and State Historical Park, and La Purisima
Golf Course, a superior 18-hole course designed by world-renowned architect Robert Muir Graves.
The Economic Development Element establishes long-term goals and policies for the growth and
development of the local economy. However, economic conditions and market forces change over time,
sometimes very quickly. Therefore, a key implementation measure is the adoption and periodic updating of
a dynamic economic development strategy. The economic development strategy provides a short-term
action plan, identifying specific projects, programs, and investments that work toward long-term goals. The
City should update the economic development strategy every three to five years.

CITY OF LOMPOC
2030 GENERAL PLAN
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
Following is a list of the City’s broad economic development goals.
Support Regional Destination Uses that would Stimulate Economic Development within the City
The City should capitalize on its geographic locale and support appropriate destination uses that would
infuse the local economy with a substantial initial capital investment, jobs and a new revenue stream.
Retain Commercial and Industrial Zoning to Accommodate Reasonable and Sensible Growth
The City of Lompoc contains a limited amount of heavy commercial and industrial land to attract uses that
will implement the City’s economic development goals. The City should therefore retain
commercial/industrial sites that meet the size and location needs of prospects and avoid actions that would
reduce the amount of existing commercial and industrial zoning within the City (unless the site is not
feasible for commercial/industrial development).
Support and Promote Farm-to-Table Businesses
Farm to Table is a national movement that encourages businesses to minimize the distance food travels
before being eaten. This trend also involves a growing awareness among consumers about where their food
is from and how it was raised and processed. All of this has helped to bring farm to table not just to homes,
but to schools, restaurants and other institutions.
Encourage Artisanal, Craft and Cottage Industries
Artisanal, craft and cottage industries combine traditional skills, art and culture with locally available raw
materials. Examples of such craft and cottage industries include agriculture and forest-based goods;
nurseries and tree farms; value-added wood products (carvings and furniture); small-scale production of
textiles and hand woven carpets; and handicrafts (wood and metal). Recreational industries, such as
outdoor guide services are also included in this category.
Support and Enhance Travel and Tourist Opportunities within Lompoc and the Surrounding Area.
Dubbed “The City of Arts and Flowers,” Lompoc is located near the Pacific Ocean, Vandenberg Air Force
Base, La Purisima Mission and State Historic Park, La Purisima Golf Course and numerous boutique
wineries. The City is also within commuter distance of several employment centers in Santa Barbara and
San Luis Obispo County, including the City Santa Barbara. The City should promote Lompoc's high
quality of life to prospective businesses, residents, shoppers, and visitors.
Maintain and Enhance a Strong and Diverse Economic Base
The City should encourage a mix of large and small industries and businesses to support a strong and
diverse economic base, thereby creating jobs, generating public revenues, and involving high levels of
private capital investment. The City should identify private contractors working at Vandenberg Air Force
Base and encourage them to hire Lompoc residents and locate their business support activities (offices,
manufacturing and training facilities, etc.) in Lompoc.
Business Retention
The City needs a business retention program as a way of establishing good relationships and
communication with Lompoc business owners, in order to facilitate their retention and expansion within the
City. The City of Lompoc is committed to its existing businesses and believes strongly that these
businesses are a major asset to the community.
                                                                                              CITY of LOMPOC

Business Recruitment
Through business-friendly policies, the City needs to recruit new businesses and retain existing businesses
that provide revenues to the City and jobs to the community. Incentives should be aimed at
recruiting/retaining specific businesses that achieve identified economic development goals of the City.
Attract Entrepreneurs
The City should encourage and attract entrepreneurs that are interested in pursuing specialty businesses that
capitalize on Lompoc’s unique demographic and geographic setting. For example, Lompoc has a large
Hispanic population and large percentage of people who are affiliated with the military. Specialized
businesses that cater to these specific groups should be encouraged.

2030 GENERAL PLAN
HOUSING ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION AND AUTHORITY
Housing is unique among the seven required elements of the City’s General Plan. Unlike
all other components, the Housing Element must be updated on a regular basis and
conform to the rigors of State law. In its final form, the Housing Element must consist
of: (i) an assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints
relevant to the meeting of those needs; (ii) a statement of the community’s goals, quan-
tified objectives, and policies relative to the maintenance, improvement, and develop-
ment of housing; and (iii) a program that sets forth a five-year schedule of actions to
implement relevant Housing Element policies and achieve stated goals.
Housing Element law is codified in Article 10.6 of the California Government Code com-
mencing with Section 65580. Under these statutes, the needs of all economic segments
must be considered as part of the Housing Element. However, these statutes place pri-

income persons and households (commonly referred to as “Target Income Groups;” see
Table H-1). In addition, issues specific to Special Needs Population must also be as-
sessed. These population segments include the elderly, disabled, homeless, farmwork-

A fundamental requirement of Housing Element law is the obligation for each communi-
ty to address its fair share of regional housing needs (commonly referred to as “RHNA”).
The RHNA process is part of a statewide mandate to address housing issues related to
future growth in California. The numbers are first generated by the State and then re-
fined by regional planning agencies in cooperation with local government. For the plan-

A detailed assessment of available and suitably zoned property shows that the City has a
sufficient current land inventory to address its RHNA goals. This means that no addi-
tional lands need to be rezoned or intensified in order to evidence Lompoc’s ability to
meet its assigned share of regional housing needs. As such, the Housing Element is
constructed to reinforce land use goals, which emphasize the continuation of existing
development patterns through infill development and build-out of areas within the
City’s urban boundary. The goals, policies, implementation measures and program
schedule which follow are largely a refinement of those adopted in the previous Housing
Element cycle and emphasize the needs possessed by special population segments.

                  varied housing types, sizes, and tenure opportunities.
Policy 1.2        The City shall encourage the dispersion of rental and owner-
                   ship housing units for target income groups throughout the City.
Policy 1.3        The City shall assure that housing units are preserved/reserved
                  for target income groups in publicly assisted developments.
Policy 1.4        The City shall encourage the development of housing for large
                   families in multi-family residential areas.
Policy 1.5        The City shall develop incentives which expand housing
                   opportunities for target income groups and special needs popu-
                  lation.
Policy 1.6        The City shall encourage the development and maintenance
                  of an adequate supply of mobile homes and manufactured
                   housing to provide opportunities for target income groups.
Policy 1.7        The City shall protect the current supply of affordable rental

                   ship.
Policy 1.8        The City shall work with the County Housing Authority and non-
                   profit housing groups to pursue affordable housing for target in-
                   come groups and special needs population, with particular em-
                   phasis on the needs of the disabled, homeless and extremely low
                   income.
Policy 1.9        The City shall periodically evaluate its development review process
                   for ways to facilitate the production of new sources of affordable

                  ten units or more, at least 10% of all the units shall be affordable
                  to target income groups. As an alternative to providing afforda-
                  ble housing on-site, the inclusionary requirement may be satis-
                  fied through other equivalent measures (e.g., production based
                  on units of like size relative to numbers of bedrooms and bath-
                  rooms) including off-site construction, acquisition of affordability
                  covenants on existing dwelling units, donation of land or pay-
                  ment of in-lieu fees. In accordance with State law, residential de-

                  of those units to be used by very low-income households.
Policy 1.12       In implementing Policy 1.11: (i) the City may waive any or all of
                  the affordable housing requirements or accept equivalent meas-
                  ures in lieu of on-site construction taking into account market
                  conditions, development proformas, land economics and other
                  substantial evidence; (ii) inclusionary fee collection may be
                  deferred until point of sale; and (iii) a 2:1 density bonus shall be
                  offered for each affordable unit that is constructed on site. With-
                  in the Old Town Redevelopment Project, Amendment No. 2 area,
                  exceptions shall only be granted when, based on substantial evi-
                  dence, on-site construction is deemed infeasible.
Policy 1.13       The City shall encourage the development of custom built homes.
Policy 1.14       The City shall monitor previous commitments for affordable
                  housing developed within the City and actively seek preservation
                  of affordable units at risk of conversion to market rate housing.

Element Adoption: The Housing Element has been updated as part of broader review of the entire General
Plan. To help guide the process, extensive public outreach was conducted during the later part of 2007 into
early 2008 consisting of 22 stakeholder interviews, a neighborhood meeting, one public forum and three edu-
cational workshops. This process allowed for a narrowing of issues specific to each Element of the General
Plan, including housing. A detailed accounting the public outreach process and resulting issue identification is
described in Appendix A. Concurrent with submittal of the Draft Housing Element to HCD, the following par-
ties were notified of the document’s availability and invited to submit comments to the State and City within
the 60-day statutory time period allowed for HCD review: (i) non-profit housing providers operating within
Santa Barbara County; (ii) California Rural Legal Assistance; (iii) Central Coast Homebuilders Association; and
(iv) parties listed in Government Code Section 65352(a). Following HCD comment and review, these same par-
ties will be notified and invited to submit comments for consideration in connection with formal public hear-
ings required by the California Government Code in connection with General Plan amendments.
Ongoing Implementation: The primary sources of revenue that are available to affirmatively further the pre-
servation, improvement and expansion of affordable housing and related initiatives under the Housing Ele-
ment include federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Home Investment Partnership Act
(HOME) funds, various programs operated through the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) and State
HCD, local Redevelopment (RDA) housing set-aside and Lompoc Housing Trust Fund (LHTF). The City receives
annual allocations of federal CDBG and HOME funds and are allocated to human service and non-profit organ-
izations on the basis of needs assessment hearings and formal application process conducted each year.
State funding is variable and obtained on an as needed/as available basis for specific housing programs and
project sponsors. RDA housing set-aside and LHTF monies are generally allocated on an on-going, project-
specific basis. These funding sources, setting of priorities and continued involvement of the public through-
out the implementation phase of the Housing Element are outlined in the Action Plan that follows.

1.0      Introduction
         1.1     Information Sources.
                 The U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, provides the
primary data source for constructing community profiles. Other contributing sources
include: (i) University of California at Santa Barbara, UCSB Economic Forecast Project; (ii)
Santa Barbara County, Consolidated Plan and County Assessor Public Information Parcel
Database; (iii) U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Income Limits and
HOME/CDBG Program Guidelines; (iv) Lompoc Redevelopment Agency, Income Limits
and Housing Affordability; (v) Santa Barbara County Association of Governments, Growth
Forecast; and (vi) State of California, Departments of Finance, Employment Development
and Housing and Community Development, Housing and Demographic Statistics. Sta-
tistics available through the U.S. Census provide the most detailed accounting of hous-
ing and demographic trends. However, this data is only updated once every ten years
and was last published for 2000. Wherever possible, census data is supplemented with
other data sources to provide an accounting of trends as of January 1, 2007, which is
the beginning date of the planning horizon for the current Housing Element.
         1.2     Geographic Orientation.
                 The purpose of the Community Profile is to provide an understanding of
characteristics that affect the current demand for housing and influence future housing
needs. The demographic information provided in this section covers the City of Lompoc.
However, demographic information for unincorporated areas of the Lompoc Valley is
provided in instances which affect conditions and circumstances within the City. For
demographic and socio-economic information, the U.S. Census County Division (CCD) is
used to define the Lompoc Valley (see Figure H-1). The Lompoc Valley CCD is cotermin-
ous with the “Lompoc Market Area” used for analysis purposes by the Santa Barbara
County Association of Governments and Santa Barbara County. A housing market area
(HMA) is defined as a geographical area which meets the social and economic require-
ments of a community and provides its residents with facilities such that commuting to
other housing market areas in order to work or shop is generally unnecessary. The ma-
jority of the population and housing of the Lompoc HMA is within the City of Lompoc.
The remaining urban areas within the Lompoc Valley HMA are Vandenberg Village, Mis-

2.0      Population Characteristics
         2.1       Summary
                   The City of Lompoc is a predominately residential community contained
within 11.65 square miles surrounded by equestrian ranches, farms, vineyards and roll-
ing hills. Residential land uses comprise 46% of the City’s total area, excluding public
rights-of-way and federal property. Since 2000, the City’s population has remained vir-
tually unchanged, growing at an annual rate of less than 0.30 percent; the lowest rate of
growth the City has experienced over the past 45 years. Comparatively speaking, Lom-
poc has a youthful and racially diverse population whose economic well-being is largely
influenced by the presence of large government institutions; most notably, Vandenberg
Air Force Base (“AFB”).

         2.2       Growth Profile
                   Historically, the population of Lompoc has experienced periods of rapid
growth as portrayed in Figure H-3. From the late 1950’s through the mid-1980’s, the
growth was primarily generated by employment at Vandenberg AFB. The most recent
episode of rapid population growth for Lompoc in conjunction with Vandenberg AFB oc-
curred from 1978 to the mid-1980’s when plans were underway for Space Shuttle
launches. However, after the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster in 1986 plans for shuttle
launches from Vandenberg AFB were discontinued. Consequently, employment at Van-
denberg AFB was not as dominant a factor in the City’s growth rate as it had been prior
to 1986. Beginning in the late 1980’s employment growth in the Santa Barbara-Goleta
area, combined with lower housing costs in Lompoc, triggered accelerated population
growth.

         2.3       Population Projections
                   Rapid population growth took place between 1960 and 1965 when the
City grew approximately 10.83 percent annually. By the end of the 1960’s the City had
an annual growth rate of 5.78 percent for the decade. In the 1970’s the annual growth
rate was approximately 0.40 percent. The City’s population again increased rapidly dur-
ing the 1980’s with an annual growth rate of 3.67 percent. From 1990 to 2000, the
City’s population increased at an annual rate of 0.90 percent. Since 2000, the City’s
population has remained virtually unchanged, growing at an annual rate of less that
0.30 percent; the lowest rate of growth the City has experienced over the past 45 years.
                   The population projections for the City of Lompoc and Lompoc Valley,
which reflect 2000 Census data, are presented in Table H-5. The City is projected to
grow by approximately 2,600 people during the time period 2005 – 2015, or approx-
imately 6.2 percent. Population growth within the overall market area is expected to be

slower than the City. The Lompoc Valley HMA is projected to grow by 3,200 people, or
5.4 percent. The County’s population is projected to increase by 27,400 persons, or 6.6
percent, during this same time period. The 2007 City of Lompoc population is esti-
mated at 41,930 persons.

        2.4      Age Distribution
                 Examining the age distribution of the population is helpful in assessing
the demand for different housing types. For example, an older population might require
smaller housing units, which are easier to maintain and which accommodate one or two
persons per household. A younger population requires a wider variety of housing unit
types. These housing types may include large units for couples with children which can
accommodate three or more persons per household or smaller units more suitable for
young childless couples and single unrelated adults which can accommodate three per-
sons or less per household.
                 The existing age distribution for the City of Lompoc is provided in Figure
H-4. The median age of Lompoc residents is approximately 32 years. Approximately 30
percent (12,310) of the City residents are 17 years or less and approximately 9 percent
(3,856) are 65 years or more. Nearly 65 percent (26,176) of the City’s population is un-
der 40 years and approximately 19.5 percent of the population is 22 to 34 years of age.
                 The overall youthfulness of the community and large proportion of the
population aged 22 to 34 indicates a need for affordable family housing units which can
accommodate three or more individuals and affordable housing units for single adults.
City residents aged 17 or under typically reside in housing units with their parents or
guardians. Residents aged 22 to 34 typically earn less than older members of the work
force and are creating new households, starting families and having children. In 1990
females between the ages of 20 and 34 accounted for approximately 78 percent of the
annual births within Santa Barbara County. This trend continued into 1995 decreasing

only slightly to approximately 74 percent of the annual births. In 1995 births by females
age 40 and older increased slightly from approximately 10 percent of the annual births
in Santa Barbara County to approximately 13 percent.

         2.5    Race and Ethnicity
                Generally, the number of minority residents decreased slightly between
1990 and 2000. The City of Lompoc population is primarily comprised of persons clas-
sified as White (65.8 percent) and not of Hispanic or Latino origin, as shown in the
Population Ethnicity chart, Figure H-5. Approximately 7.3 percent of the population is
Black or African American, 3.9 percent is Asian, 0.3 percent is Native Hawaiian/Other
Pacific Islander, 1.6 percent is American Indian and Alaska Native, and 15.7 percent is
Other. The number of Hispanic or Latino residents increased between 1990 and 2000
from 27 percent to 37 percent. The largest percentage of the Hispanic or Latino popula-
tion is from Mexico (31.6 percent).

        2.6    Employment Characteristics
               Another factor which contributes significantly to the demand for housing
in Lompoc is the amount and type of employment located within the Planning Area and
at Vandenberg AFB. As shown in Table H-6, government employment accounts for the
overwhelming majority of jobs held by Lompoc residents. This statistic is further borne
by Table H-7 that shows federal and local government as the four top employers in the
region.

                  The State of California Employment Development Department’s (EDD) av-
erage annual unemployment rate for Santa Barbara County in 2002 was estimated at 4.2
percent, compared to an average annual unemployment rate for California at 6.7 per-
cent. An average annual unemployment rate for Lompoc in 2002 was estimated at 5.8
percent. Today those figures have climbed dramatically as the nation’s economy con-
tinues to weaken. The effect of the current recession is reflected in Table H-7 which
shows large job reductions among the four largest employers. The result is a current
unemployment rate of 12.7% in Lompoc compared to 7.2% Countywide.

3.0       Household Characteristics
          3.1       Summary
                    The vast majority of Lompoc residents live in households; however, fami-
lies comprised of persons related by blood or marriage are considerably higher in Lom-
poc compared to the County at large. The youthful population is reflected in a relative-
ly high household size that has steadily increased over the past twenty years. Particu-
larly noteworthy are relatively low incomes with a median that is 20% below the County-
wide average. Despite these differences, incidences of overcrowding and overpayment
within the City are comparable to those experienced throughout the County.

          3.2       Household Tenure
                    Household tenure refers to the status of the occupant, whether he or she
owns or rents the unit. Housing tenure provides information on turnover of occupants in
a given housing unit and the affordability of the housing market. Renters tend to move
more frequently than homeowners and also tend to have less money to spend on hous-
ing. Thus, the prevalence of owner occupied households indicates stability within the
housing market (i.e. less housing unit turnover) and increased homeownership afforda-
bility. Housing tenure data collected over the last 30 years indicates that the housing
stock has been closely split between owner occupants and renters in the City (see Table
H-9).

                 Within the City there has been a small but steady increase in the number
of owner occupied households. In 1970 most households (approximately 51 percent) in
Lompoc were renter occupied. In 1980 there were slightly more owner occupied than
renter occupied households in the City. By 1990 there were almost 500 more owner oc-
cupied than renter occupied households in Lompoc. However, owner occupied units still
made up close to half of the total citywide households. According to the 1990 Census,
owner occupied units comprised 52 percent of all households and rental units com-
prised 48 percent. Owner occupancy increased by two percent from 1980 to 1990.
Likewise, according to the 2000 Census, owner occupied units continued to comprise 52
percent of all households and rental units comprised 48 percent. This trend indicates
greater stabilization with the City’s housing market and increased homeownership af-
fordability.
                 The homeownership rate within the City has historically been less than in
the County as a whole. In the County, owner occupied households have outnumbered
renter households by at least 6 percent since 1970 (see Table H-9). However, although
the proportion of homeowners is greater in the County, the City’s homeownership rate
increased at the same rate as the County’s between 1980 and 1990 (2 percent). The
City’s homeownership rate remained at 52 percent between 1990 and 2000.

                 Owner-occupants tend to occupy single-family dwellings. According to
the 2000 Census, approximately 87 percent of all owner occupied units within the City
were single-family dwellings. The opposite is true for renters. Approximately 35 percent
of renter occupied units in Lompoc were single-family dwellings in 2000.

        3.3      Household Sizes
Household size is defined as the total number of persons, related or not, living in a
housing unit. Although household size has decreased overall since 1970, it has in-
creased since 1980 (see Table H-10). The recent increase in household size is evi-
denced by the greater proportion of households with four or more occupants (see Table
H-11). Between 1980 and 1990 the proportion of all households with four or more oc-
cupants has increased by four percent. Similarly, between 1990 and 2000 the proportion
of all households with four or more occupants increased by three percent.

        3.4      Household Overcrowding
                 According to the U.S. Census an overcrowded household is one in which
there is more than one person per room, excluding the kitchen and bathrooms. With the
exception of a slight decrease in the incidence of household overcrowding between
1970 and 1980, overcrowding in Lompoc has been increasing since 1970. Incidence of
household overcrowding dropped by nearly 2 percent between 1970 and 1980 (see Ta-
ble 8). However, it rose by approximately 6 percent between 1980 and 1990 and 4 per-
cent between 1990 and 2000.

2030 GENERAL PLAN
HOUSING ELEMENT
                 The sharpest rise in household overcrowding between 1970 and 2000
came in the number of households with 1.51 or more persons per room. Between 1970
and 1980 the incidence of overcrowded households with 1.51 or more persons per room
increased by approximately 42 percent. Between 1980 and 1990 the incidence of over-
crowded households with 1.51 or more persons per room rose sharply by 291 percent
and accounted for 52 percent of all overcrowded households. Between 1990 and 2000
the incidence of overcrowding in households with 1.51 or more persons per room in-
creased by 33 percent.
                 Between 1990 and 2000 incidences of household overcrowding rose in
both the number of households with 1.01 to 1.50 persons per room as well as with 1.51
or more persons per room. Incidences of household overcrowding rose 54 percent in
households with 1.01 to 1.50 persons per room compared with 33 percent in house-
holds with 1.51 or more persons per room. However, incidences of overcrowding in
households with 1.51 or more persons per room still accounts for nearly 50 percent of
all overcrowded households.
                 The increased overcrowding among Lompoc households demonstrates a
need for additional housing space. Household overcrowding also indicates that there is
a shortage of income necessary to move to larger accommodations. Housing space ap-
pears to be priced at a premium. Households are adjusting by settling for less space ra-
ther than buying more space.

                 Overcrowding is more prevalent among renter occupied households than
owner occupied households. In 1980 approximately 74 percent of all overcrowded
households were renter occupied. By 1990, the proportion of overcrowded households
which were renter occupied rose to approximately 79 percent. Approximately 18 percent

of all renter households (1,069 of 6,020) were overcrowded in 1990. By 2000 the pro-
portion of overcrowded households which were renter occupied decreased to approx-
imately 68 percent, however, renter occupied overcrowded households remains high

                  The California Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD) defines household income groups and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) calculates income levels relative to the county median. There are
five household income group categories: extremely low, very low, low, moderate, and
above moderate. Although exact calculations vary between HCD and HUD, the house-
hold incomes are generally defined as follows: extremely low-income households are
households with incomes less than 30 percent of the area median income; very low-
income households are households with incomes between 30 and 50 percent of the area
median income; low-income households are households with incomes between 51 and
80 percent of the county median income; moderate-income households are households
with incomes between 81 and 120 percent of the county median income; and above
moderate-income households have incomes above 120 percent of the county median
income. The 2007 income limits for Santa Barbara County are listed (see Table 16).
                  Available household income is one of the most critical factors influencing
the demand for housing. The City of Lompoc 1999 household income estimates are
provided in Table H-17. Household incomes in Lompoc are lower than countywide in-
comes. According to the 2000 Census, the 1999 median household income for Lompoc
was $37,587. This represents approximately 80 percent of the median countywide
household income ($46,677). The income disparity is even greater for family house-

                  The 2000 distribution of household incomes in Lompoc is provided in
Table H-18. Lompoc household income information from the 2000 Census shows that
the proportion of very low-income households within the City has increased by approx-
imately 3 percent between 1990 and 2000 (from 26 to 29 percent). The proportion of
low-income households in Lompoc increased by 2 percent between 1990 and 2000. The
proportion of moderate-income households rose by 7 percent between 1990 and 2000.
However, the proportion of above-moderate households decreased significantly by 11
percent during the same period. Therefore, there was a shift from the higher income
category to the very low-, low-, and moderate-income households between 1990 and
2000.

                  Government agencies, lenders, and landlords generally consider a
household eligible to rent or buy if monthly payments do not exceed 30 percent of total
household income. Information released from the 2000 Census indicates that 4,361
households currently are overpaying (paying over 30% of household income on direct
housing costs) (see Tables H-19 and H-20). According to the 1990 Census information,
4,098 households were overpaying for housing within the City. Although the number of
households overpaying for housing within the City has increased since 1990, the per-
centage of households relative to the total number of households within the City has
remained the same as in 1990. This represents approximately 33 percent (2000: 4,361 /
13,059; 1990: 4,098/12,504) of all households citywide.

owner occupied households (see Table H-20). According to the 2000 Census informa-

accounts for 63 percent of households overpaying for housing (2,758/4,361 = 63%; see

the City has decreased slightly between 1990 and 2000. In 1990, 65 percent of renter
households were overpaying for housing compared to 63 percent in 2000, a decrease of
2 percent. The 2000 Census information indicates that 1,603 households overpaying for
housing were owner occupied. This accounts for 37 percent of households overpaying
for housing which is slightly higher than in 1990 (1,603/4,361 = 37%; See Table H-21).

CITY OF LOMPOC
2030 GENERAL PLAN
HOUSING ELEMENT
                Household overpayment has a direct effect upon the standard of living
for community residents. Households which overpay for housing have fewer dollars
available for other necessities such as food, clothing, and healthcare. Very low- and
low-income residents have the tightest budgets and are more adversely affected by
housing overpayment than higher income households. That is, above-moderate house-
holds can afford to spend more than 30 percent of household income on housing since
they have more discretionary dollars which are not earmarked for basic necessities.
Consequently, above moderate-income households normally overpay for housing by
choice. In addition, lower-income renter occupied households do not have the option of
selling their home (or borrowing against equity) to raise additional capital in the event of
an emergency. Owner occupied households have the option of selling or renting a por-
tion of their home to offset unexpected expenses.
4.0     Housing Characteristics
        4.1     Summary
                The distribution of housing types within the City reflects its semi-rural
character and family orientation; single-family homes comprise nearly two-thirds of all
dwellings. Comparatively speaking, the distribution reflects a slightly better balance
between housing types than is true for the County at large. While the age and availabil-
ity of housing is comparable, substandard conditions and excessive costs are far more
profound at the County level. In summary, housing in Lompoc is far more affordable
compared to other areas of the County, even with incomes that are markedly lower.

         4.2     Housing Quantity and Type
                 The supply of housing in Lompoc increased sharply between 1970 and
1990 but only minimally between 1990 and 2000 (see Table H-23). Between 1970 and
1980 the housing stock increased by approximately 24 percent. Between 1980 and
1990 the supply increased by 3,384 units or an additional 34 percent. However, recent
data from the U.S. Census Bureau indicates that the housing stock in the City of Lompoc
increased by 360 units between 1990 and 2000, from 13,261 to 13,621 units. This
change represents a 2.7 percent increase in the supply of housing in Lompoc. More re-
cent data from the California Department of Finance shows slight upward increase from
the previous 10-year period, but far below the rate of growth realized before 1990. Be-
tween 2000 and 2007, 471 new dwellings were added to the City’s housing inventory,
representing an increase of 3.5%.
                 The data summarized in Table H-23 indicates the slow growth of the
housing inventory in the City since 1990. The period from 1980 to 1990 showed a 34.3
percent increase in total housing units, with an average increase of 338 units per year,
compared to the period between 1990 and 2007 where an average increase of 49 units
per year was experienced, yielding an overall increase of 6.3 percent. The actual growth
of the housing inventory varies from year to year, however, there has been a marked de-
cline in the units since the year 1991.

                  The growth trend in housing unit production experienced in the City of
Lompoc between 1990 and 2000 is consistent with the slow increase experienced in
Santa Barbara County. Table H-24 shows that housing unit production in Santa Barbara
County increased by approximately 3.4 percent between 1990 and 2000, a decrease
from 20.2 percent between 1980 and 1990. While the percentage change in housing
units within the County between 2000 and 2007 was more than double the amount ex-
perienced for Lompoc, both lagged behind growth in the State as a whole.

 Note: Slight differences in unit tabulations for Lompoc appearing in Tables H-24 and H-25 in hears 1990
 and 2000 are attributable to the different data sources used. See note at bottom of Table H-25.
                  In 2000, according to the U.S. Census, there were approximately 13,582
housing units within the City (see Table H-25). There are three basic types of housing
units for which data is presented: single family detached units (including planned unit
developments), multiple-family units ranging from duplexes to large apartment devel-
opments, and mobilehomes located in mobilehome parks and on individual lots.
                  The predominant type of dwelling unit continues to be the conventional
single-family residence in the City. As if 2007, the majority (approximately 53 percent)
of these units were single-family detached units. Together, detached and attached sin-
gle-family units make up approximately 60 percent of the housing supply. Multi-family
units comprise approximately 33 percent of the housing stock and mobilehomes ac-
count for approximately 7 percent. The distribution between the different types of
housing (single family, multi-family and mobilehomes) remains virtually unchanged
from 1990 to the present.

4.3      Housing Age
                   According to the 2000 Census, approximately 50 percent (6,711 units) of
the City’s housing unit stock was built prior to 1970 (see Table H-26). Although regular
maintenance can prolong the life of the older homes beyond 30 years, the passage of
time will increase the cost and magnitude of needed housing repairs. Generally, housing
units over 40 years old require large financial expenditures to prolong their useful life
and prevent substantial deterioration. Older homes may need electrical rewiring, mod-
ernized plumbing systems and new foundation work. Approximately 21 percent (2,848
units) of the City’s housing unit stock was built prior to 1960 and would be in this cate-
gory. Given the age of the existing housing stock, periodic ongoing maintenance is criti-
cal to prevent significant deterioration and protect the existing housing supply.
                   In addition to the housing age, information included in Table H-26 indi-
cates that nearly all of the City’s housing units (99.4 percent) had complete plumbing
facilities in 2000.

         4.4      Housing Condition
                  The City has conducted independent housing condition surveys in 1991
and 2003Housing unit conditions were rated using four
classifications: A, B, C, or D. Generally, units rated “A” were in satisfactory condition or
better, with no visible existing repair needs; units rated “B” required minor rehabilitation
to be restored to an “A” condition; units rated “C” required major rehabilitation to be
restored to an “A” condition; and units rated “D” were dilapidated and required
replacement.
                  In a survey conducted by the City in 2003, a total of 9,177 housing units
or approximately 66 percent of the City’s housing stock was evaluated. Units built after

                The 2003 housing condition study found that 83 percent of the City’s
housing stock was well maintained and appeared in adequate or better condition. Most
of these units have been recently built and received steady maintenance. The regularity
of future maintenance will determine whether these units remain in “A” condition or slip
to “B” condition.
                Approximately 16 percent of the City’s housing (2,264 units) appeared in
need of some form of rehabilitation (“B” and “C” units). The vast majority of units requir-
ing rehabilitation were in “B” condition and appeared in need of relatively small financial
expenditures (under $10,000) to be considered in “A” condition. However, these “B”
condition units (2,089) are in the early stages of deterioration. They are units which can
be repaired and provide a long-term source of quality housing or can deteriorate further
and become beyond reasonable economic repair. Various factors determine whether
“B” condition units slip to “C” condition. These factors include: the severity and urgency
of the repair needs, the willingness of owners to make needed repairs before they
become critical, the availability of private funds to spend on housing repairs, and the
ability of the City to obtain and allocate public funds for those in need of financial or
technical assistance.
                Approximately one percent of the City’s housing stock (175 housing
units) in 2003 was severely deteriorated, requiring a large expenditure of funds (more
than $10,000) to repair. In fact, in at least 13 cases housing units appeared to have de-
teriorated beyond reasonable economic repair and needed to be replaced.

                 The presence of severely deteriorated and dilapidated housing creates
many negative side effects. These units can pose a safety hazard to their occupants and
neighbors. They may become abandoned and serve as dangerous playgrounds for child-
ren or in some cases centers for criminal activity. In addition, “C” and “D” condition units
can decrease property values of adjacent units and deter private investment within a
neighborhood. This in turn, decreases housing supply, hinders marketability of nearby
units, deters new development, and creates a disincentive for nearby property owners to
maintain their residences. Consequently, a larger number of units become susceptible to
neglect within a concentrated area. As a result, housing deterioration may spread
throughout a block or neighborhood.
        4.5      Vacancy Rate
                 Vacancy rates provide a quantifiable measurement of excess housing
supply. Vacant units are the portion of the City’s housing stock which is unoccupied.
The rule of thumb is that a 4.5% to 5.0% vacancy rate indicates a good balance of supply
and demand in the housing market. Vacancy rate information is provided by the U.S.
Census Bureau and is monitored monthly by the City via its electric meters (electric me-
ters are turned off when a unit is vacant). The total overall vacancy rate in the City was
4.1 percent according to the 2000 Census (see Table H-28). The Census data also indi-
cates that vacancy rates have customarily been higher for renter occupied units than
owner occupied units. The vacancy rate as reported in the 2000 Census is lower than
the 5.7 percent vacancy rate reported in 1990 indicating that there are less housing
units available compared to population in 2000 than in 1990. Furthermore, the 2000
vacancy rate is lower than the 4.5 percent to 5.0 percent vacancy rate range indicating
an imbalance between the supply and demand of housing in the City.

Barbara County. The cost of ownership housing in Lompoc is the least of all jurisdic-
tions and second only to Guadalupe in having the lowest rents. Throughout the County,
the cost to buy homes has increased dramatically in the past seven years compared to
the period between 1990 and 2000. However, this trend has now reversed as the nation
as at large experiences a broad contraction in the housing market accompanied with the
onset of an economic recession. Between 2006 and 2007, the pricing of ownership
housing in Lompoc declined 13.7%. Rents, on the other hand, continue to rise although

5.0      Affordability Characteristics
         5.1       Summary
                   Housing affordability is a function of household income, cost
components, affordability thresholds and market pricing. As noted in Section 4.6,
Lompoc is among the most affordable communities in Santa Barbara County. However,
affordability is not uniformly enjoyed across all income spectrums. In general, market
rate rental units are affordable to moderate income groups while exceeding the
hypothetical means of lower income households. With the exception of condominums
for moderate income purchasers, ownership housing is out of the reach of all other
target income categories.
         5.2       Operative Terms
                   Affordability is a function of household income and housing costs, with
adjustments for family size and bedroom count. The thresholds for determining affor-
dability are pegged against the areawide median and are displayed in Table H-31.
Housing costs include mortgage, rent, taxes, insurance, maintenance and utilities. The
limits placed on housing costs affordable to target income groups are prescribed by
State law and vary according to income category and housing unit type. For rental units,
the housing cost threshold is computed as 9% of the areawide median for extremely low
income (i.e., 30% x 30% = 9%), 15% for very low, 18% for lower income and 33% for
moderate income. The housing cost threshold for homebuyers is computed as 9% of the
areawide median for extremely low income, 15% for very low income, 21% for lower in-
come and 38.5% for moderate income.

           5.3      Affordability Gap
                    Affordability gap constitutes the difference between the financial capacity
of target income groups and the actual cost of market rate housing. The computation is
made by subtracting the affordability thresholds for corresponding income groups from
the direct and indirect costs of housing in the market area. For rental rates and
purchase prices, a combination of source data is used including: market data from the
University of California at Santa Barbara, UCSB Economic Forecast Project; home sales
data from DataQuick Real Estate Services; and Fair Market Rent data from the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development. For purchased housing, principal and
interest computations (along with minimum downpayment requirements) are based on
the most preferable terms available through the California Housing Finance Agency;
taxes are estimated at 1.15% of value; and insurance, maintenance and utilities are
figured at $269 per month (Table H-32). For rental housing, indirect costs are derived
from utility allowance schedules used by the Housing Authority of Santa Barbara County
in computing rent subsidies (Table H-33). The resulting analysis follows in Paragraphs
5.4 and 5.5 below.

is based on 165 sales with an average unit size of 3.1 bedrooms. Utilizing household
adjustment factors published in the California Health and Safety Code, the maximum
household size on which to determine household income and compute affordable sales
price for a three-bedroom dwelling is four persons. This translates to an adjusted 2007
household income of $67,100. The resulting analysis appears in Table H-34 and shows
that single-family ownership housing is generally beyond the financial means of all tar-
get income households. Condominiums, on the other hand, are affordable to persons
and families of moderate income but not to households below this income threshold.

         5.5       Rental Affordability
                   Lompoc’s rental market is relatively affordable, particularly in comparison
to other communities in the County. Lompoc is second only to Guadalupe in having the
lowest median rent at $687 (adjusted from 2000 Census Data to 2007 based on annual
inflationary factor of 3.5%). Utilizing Fair Market Rent data for Santa Barbara County
published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Section 8
Housing Assistance Program, rents in Lompoc are generally affordable to moderate in-
come households but not other target income groups (Table H-35). This conclusion is
highly conservative insofar as the median rent charged for Lompoc housing is consider-
ably lower than the Fair Market Rents applicable to the County at large.

NEEDS ASSESSMENT
6.0      Introduction
         Housing needs, for Housing Element purposes, are driven by five basic factors:
(i) expansion to accommodate increased population; (ii) replacement and rehabilitation
due to deterioration or removal; (iii) housing relief for overcrowded conditions and per-
sons paying more than they can afford; (iv) accommodation of persons with special
housing needs; and (v) preservation of assisted units at risk of conversion. The re-
quirement for accommodating future growth is covered in Section 8.0 while the needs of
the existing population are discussed in Section 7.0.
7.0      Existing Housing Needs
         7.1      Summary
                  As shown in Table H-36, persons paying in excess of 30% of their income
for housing represents the single biggest challenge for Lompoc residents. This need is
particularly pronounced for renters with nearly twice the number of persons overpaying
compared to owners. The same is true for overcrowding where nearly 21% of all renters
live in overcrowded conditions compared to only 9% of owners. Substandard housing is
the least pervasive of the three basic need components with renters and owners bearing
a comparable burden. Table H-37 provides a quantitative breakdown of various popu-
lation segments whose needs are most acute. In sum total, disabled, elderly, homeless
and farmworkers together represent 24% of the City’s total population while elderly,
large families and female-headed households comprise 40% of all households.

  Notes:
      1.  Definitions: (i) Overpaying -- more than 30% of income is expended on housing costs; (ii) Over-
          crowding -- more than one person occupies each room; and (iii) Substandard: dwellings built be-
          fore 1950, lacking plumbing fixtures or lacking kitchen facilities.
      2.  Due to the size of Lompoc, confidentiality laws preclude the City from obtaining detailed cross ta-
          bulations of income and household characteristics. Consequently, the numeric tabulation in
          Tables H-36 and H-37 may actually overstate needs due to double counting.

CITY OF LOMPOC
2030 GENERAL PLAN
HOUSING ELEMENT
        7.2     Components of Need.
                7.2.1   Overcrowding
                        Household overcrowding currently affects approximately 15 per-
cent of the households within the City. Nearly half (48 percent) of these households live
in units with more than 1.5 persons per room (excluding bathrooms and kitchen). In
past planning periods, a sufficient supply of vacant housing units existed to alleviate
overcrowded conditions among smaller household sizes. However, an insufficient supply
of housing units and insufficient income is available for these households to move to
larger units. In addition, household size has begun to rise after a steep decrease be-
tween 1970 and 1980 which has compounded overcrowding conditions. This is most
apparent among large households with five or more occupants. Job creation and assis-
tance with down payments and security deposits are needed to promote homeownership
and relieve overcrowding.
                7.2.2   Substandard Housing
                        More than 2000 housing units are currently in need of at least mi-
nor rehabilitation. Approximately 200 of these units require major rehabilitation with
expenditures of more than $10,000.
                7.2.3   Housing Affordability
                        Citywide average per capita household income is currently ap-
proximately 67 percent of the average countywide figure. Consequently units consi-
dered affordable to certain income groups countywide are not affordable to Lompoc
households. This is evident to many households in Lompoc who currently overpay for
housing (i.e. spend in excess of 30 percent of household income on housing). Approx-
imately 33 percent of all Lompoc households or one in every three households citywide
overpays for housing.
                        Additionally, 83 percent of the households which overpay are very
low- and low-income households which can least afford to spend more than 30 percent
of household income on housing. Mortgage refinancing (during periods of historically
low interest rates) can help improve housing affordability for homeowners. However,
new job creation, higher wage jobs, as well as a greater supply of lower cost housing are
needed to improve housing affordability for renters and homeowners.

                  7.2.4    Mortgage Foreclosure
                           A component of need related to Housing Affordability is the
recent onset of what has become referred to as the “subprime mortgage crisis,” a
condition characterized by a significant decline in housing prices and related mortgage
payment delinquencies. This condition, coupled with a general downturn in the economy
and resultant job loss, has placed a large number of residential property owners at risk
of losing their homes. At present, 404 residential properties in Lompoc are under fi-
nancial duress (i.e., 17 bank-owned 231 in foreclosure, and 156 in pre-foreclosure).2 In
response to this national crisis, the State and Federal Governments have enacted
companion legislation to address residential foreclosures stemming from subprime
mortgages and the nation’s general economic downturn. Most notably, California has
received $3.9 billion in funds from the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, passed by
Congress in July 2008, to assist local governments in purchasing abandoned and forec-
losed homes and residential property. At the State level, SB 1065 was signed into law by
the Governor on September 25, 2008, and allows local government to refinance mort-
gages on owner-occupied homes utilizing tax-exempt bond funds. Previously, cities
and counties were prohibited from re-financing mortgages with tax-exempt bonds;
however, the Housing & Economic Recovery Act of 2008 will allow this for a temporary
four-year period and includes the issuance of $11 million in tax-exempt bonds for this
purpose. Although it is unclear exactly to what extent the City might benefit from these
legislative actions, these developments dovetail with the overarching goal of protecting
existing housing and neighborhoods, principally for the benefit of low and moderate-
income households.
          7.3     Special Needs Groups
                  Certain segments of the population have traditionally experienced a more
difficult time finding decent, affordable housing due to special circumstances particular
to these groups.        Those segments possessing special needs, as defined in California
Government Code Section 65583(a)(7), consist of “the elderly, persons with disabilities,
large families, farmworkers, families with female heads of households, and families and
persons in need of emergency shelter.”

                   7.3.1    Elderly
                            The special needs of many elderly households result from low
fixed-incomes, physical disabilities, and dependence needs. Consequently, the elderly
often have increased needs for housing which incorporates enhanced accessibility fea-
tures (e.g. hand rails or no stairs), provides security, and requires minimal maintenance.
Additionally, locating housing for the elderly near neighborhood shopping, medical ser-
vices, churches, and senior recreation and service facilities will help meet the special

needs of a portion of the elderly population. For the purposes of this Housing Element,
“elderly” are defined as those persons 65 years of age and older.
                        The 2000 Census counted 3,856 elderly Lompoc residents which
accounted for approximately 9.4 percent of the City’s total 2000 population. Approx-
imately 94 percent (3,645) of the elderly population live in households and the remain-
ing 6 percent (211) live in group quarters (e.g. elderly residential care facilities). The
majority of the elderly population (67 percent or 2,435 individuals) living in households,
live within family households (e.g., with a spouse or other relatives) which can provide a
support system to assist with household chores or errands. The remaining non-family
household population (1,210 individuals) is comprised primarily of females who live
alone (812 individuals out of 1,210 or 67 percent). The majority of the elderly popula-
tion (57 percent) is aged 65 to 74. The remaining 1,659 individuals are aged 75 or
more. This older segment of the elderly population is more likely to be frail and require
mobility friendly housing design.
                        Most elderly individuals in Lompoc own their residences. In fact,
approximately 75 percent (1,858 of 2,467) of the housing units occupied by the elderly
are owner occupied and 25 percent (609) are rented. In contrast, the homeownership
rate is 52 percent for the community as a whole. However, due to fixed incomes the el-
derly sometimes have difficulty financing needed home repairs. Lompoc’s elderly popu-
lation is adversely affected by disabilities and to a lesser extent by financial hardship. A
significant portion of the elderly population experiences mobility difficulty or problems
which adversely affect their self-sufficiency. According to the 2000 Census 1,697 elderly
individuals or approximately 44 percent of the total elderly population reported one or
more types of disabilities, including a self-care type of disability. One type of disability
was reported for 847 (50 percent) elderly individuals who experienced a disability. The
types of disabilities included sensory (23 percent), physical (49 percent), mental (1 per-
cent), self-care (0.4 percent), and go-outside type of disability (12 percent). Moreover,
two or more types of disabilities were reported for 850 (50 percent) elderly individuals.
Of the elderly individuals reporting two or more disabilities, 38 percent reported self-
care disabilities. These individuals need housing designed or modified to address their
physical disabilities in order to protect their independence. In addition, the 2000 Census
documented 253 elderly individuals earning annual incomes below the poverty level
($7,990 for 1 person elderly households and $10,075 for 2 person elderly households).
This represents approximately 6 percent of the total elderly population. Although most
elderly have incomes above the poverty level, many have low fixed-incomes. Conse-
quently, housing affordability for the elderly becomes more tenuous when housing costs
rise.

housing units for the elderly which receive federal housing funds located within the City.
These units are distributed among three different complexes: Miller Plaza, Stanley Horn
Homes, and Rainbow Plaza. Although no medical services are available within the com-

                        Miller Plaza, located at 301 West Maple Avenue, contains 24 units.
These one-bedroom rental units were developed, and are owned and managed by the
Santa Barbara County Housing Authority for low- and very low-income eligible individu-
als 62+ years of age.
                        Stanley Horn Homes is located at 640 North Q Street and provides
44 units (40 one bedroom and 4 two bedroom). The County Housing Authority devel-

                        Rainbow Plaza is located at 220 West Pine Avenue and contains a
total of 31 units (27 one bedroom and 4 two bedroom units). This project was funded by
HUD and is managed by a property management company. The facility is intended to
serve low-income individuals who are handicapped, disabled, or elderly (age 62 or old-

substandard housing, who meet the other qualifying criteria, to have preference on the
waiting list.
                        Additionally, there are four privately owned facilities which serve
the housing needs of the elderly population in Lompoc: Parkside Gardens, Casa Serena,
The Lodge of Lompoc (formerly Franciscan Manor), and Lompoc Convalescent Care Cen-
ter. These facilities provide a combined 96 units and 240 beds and offer a broad range
of services for elderly residents.
                        Parkside Gardens is located at 240 West Pine Avenue. The 48-unit
(38 one bedroom and 10 two bedroom) complex contains units for independent elderly
residents. No medical services are provided.

                         Other services for the elderly in Lompoc include the Lompoc Val-
ley Senior Community Center, Family Service Agency, and Lompoc Valley Haven – Senior
Day Care. The Lompoc Valley Senior Community Center is a multi-purpose facility that
provides recreation activities and supportive services for elderly persons in Lompoc.
Meals are provided at the Center through a contract administered by the Community
Action Commission of Santa Barbara County and Lompoc Hospital. Over 197 elderly per-
sons received meals through the use of this program in 2001 to 2002. In addition, the
City of Lompoc Parks and Recreation Department provides a number of social and
recreation programs, classes, workshops, and special events for elderly persons at the
Lompoc Valley Community Center. Seniors can participate in the nutrition program, ex-

                          Housing assistance need for the disabled is a function of the na-
ture and severity of handicap, income or wealth, and family or other support services
within the community. For purposes of this element, disability includes, but is not li-
mited to, any physical or mental disability as defined in Section 12926 of the California
Fair Employment and Housing Act. Mental disability is defined in Section 12926 of the
California Fair Employment and Housing act as:
         (1) Having any mental or psychological disorder or condition, such as mental
retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, or specific learning
disabilities, that limits a major life activity. For purposes of this section:
         (A) “Limits” shall be determined without regard to mitigating measures, such as
medications, assistive devices, or reasonable accommodations, unless the mitigating
measure itself limits a major life activity.
         (B) A mental or psychological disorder or condition limits a major life activity if it
makes the achievement of the major life activity difficult.
         (C) “Major life activities” shall be broadly construed and shall include physical,
mental, and social activities and working.
         (2) Any other mental or psychological disorder or condition not described in pa-
ragraph (a) that requires special education or related services.
         (3) Having a record or history of a mental or psychological disorder or condition
described in paragraph (1) or (2), which is known to the employer or other entity
covered by this part.
         (4) Being regarded or treated by the employer or other entity covered by this part
as having, or having had, any mental condition that makes achievement of a major life
activity difficult.
         (5) Being regarded or treated by the employer or other entity covered by this part
as having, or having had, a mental or psychological disorder or condition that has no
present disabling effect, but that may become a mental disability as described in
paragraph (1) or (2).

become a physical disability as described in paragraph (1) or (2).
                           Many disabled individuals have no housing assistance need since
they are able to support themselves and utilize existing market rate housing. Other dis-
abled individuals receive continuing care from family or friends, though many of these
people would seek living situations outside the family home if any were available, while
still others have their needs met by housing assistance not specifically designed for the
disabled. Yet for some, physical handicaps can hinder access to housing units of normal
design as well as limit the ability to earn adequate income. Thus, two major housing
needs of the disabled are access and affordability.

                           The disabled population in Lompoc includes physically disabled,
blind, deaf, developmentally disabled, mentally ill, and medically disabled persons,
where the disabling condition is expected to be of “long duration.” The Social Security
Administration provides Supplemental Security Income (SSI) to very low-income individ-
uals who are aged (65 or older), blind, or disabled. According to the Social Security Ad-
ministration, there were 1,427 SSI recipients as of May 2003, who were blind or disabled
living within Lompoc (zip codes 93436 and 93438). This population is expected to in-
crease by two to three percent annually according to Social Security officials. The Social
Security Administration also provides disability benefits to aged disabled persons (dis-
abled persons over 65 years of age). The total number of aged disabled persons residing
in Lompoc receiving Social Security benefits as of May 2003 was approximately 198.
Thus, the combined total of disabled individuals receiving Social Security assistance is
approximately 1,625.
                           Comprehensive information is not available regarding the number
of persons with disabilities living independently and not requiring supportive services
within the City. The 2000 Census contained data on civilian non-institutionalized per-
sons who are 5 years of age and older who have physical disabilities see Table H-38).
The Census identified 7,247 such persons or approximately 21 percent of said 2000
population. This equates to approximately 17 percent of the City’s total 2000 popula-
tion. According to the Census, 3,337 persons have disabilities that restrict them from
working,
representing 15 percent of the City’s non-institutionalized population aged 16 to 64.
Persons whose mobility was restricted solely due to limitations and/or the ability to care
for themselves represent 10 percent of the City’s non-institutionalized population aged
five and older. Approximately 23 percent of the disabled population was elderly.

                        In 2002 there were two housing developments in Lompoc which
were developed to help disabled persons live independently: La Paloma and Rainbow
Plaza. La Paloma is a project of the Lompoc Option Vocational and Resource Center (LO-
VARC), providing six bed-spaces in a six-bedroom home as a training facility for inde-
pendent living for developmentally-disabled persons. “Graduates” of the program often
move to, the second Lompoc housing development for disabled persons, Rainbow Plaza.
Rainbow Plaza is a 31-unit apartment project, funded under Section 202 of the National
Housing Act. Rainbow Plaza is a “normalization” facility, providing independent living
apartments, with project-based rental assistance, for elderly, physically disabled, men-
tally ill, and developmentally-disabled households. In addition to La Paloma and Rain-
bow Plaza, Miller Plaza, Stanley Horn Homes, and Casa Serena (mentioned above) pro-
vide housing for income eligible disabled individuals. Finally, Homebase (a 39-unit ex-
tended stay and transitions facility for low income and disabled persons located on 513
North G Street), is slated for completion and occupancy in 2009.
                        Housing opportunities for the disabled can be maximized through
housing assistance programs, single-level units, ground floor units, and units which in-
corporate design features such as widened doorways, access ramps, and lowered coun-
tertops.
                 7.3.3  Large Households
                        For the purposes of the Housing Element, large households are
defined as households that contain five or more persons. 2000 Census data indicate
that 17 percent (2,161 of 13,059) of all Lompoc households were large households.
Within the City, 1,178 households contain five people, 513 households contain six per-
sons, and 470 households have seven or more residents. The median household size in
Lompoc is 2.83 owner occupied and 2.94 renter occupied, an average household size of
2.88 persons.
                        Table H-39 shows that there are 1,197 large households occupy-
ing rental units. This number represents 18.9 percent of all renter households. There
are 964 large households occupying owner occupied units. This number represents 14.3
percent of all owner occupied households.

                          Among the City’s 13,625 housing units identified in the 2000
Census, 710 reportedly have eight or more rooms. Bathrooms and kitchens do not
qualify as sleeping quarters yet are considered rooms, therefore the actual number of
bedrooms may be as low as five. Because of their size, a large family household may ex-
perience a greater incidence of overcrowding. Overcrowded households are usually a
reflection of the lack of affordable housing. Most apartments, mobilehomes, and single
family attached units cannot adequately house five or more people, therefore renting a
large home may be the only alternative when owning a home is not financially possible.
Table H-40 shows that there are 1,552 renter occupied units with three or more bed-
rooms compared to 5,184 owner occupied units. These numbers represent 24 percent
and 77 percent of renter occupied and owner occupied housing units, respectively, liv-
ing in units with three or more bedrooms. This means that 76 percent of renter occu-
pied households live in housing units with one or two bedrooms compared to 23 per-
cent of owner occupied households. Households who cannot afford suitably sized hous-
ing units are often compelled to live in housing that is too small for their needs.

                7.3.4   Single and Female Headed Households
                        According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a single-headed household
contains a household head and at least one dependent, which could include a child, an
elderly parent, or non-related child. The 2000 Census indicates that there are 2,650
single-headed households in the City of Lompoc. Female-headed households in Lompoc
accounted for approximately 73 percent of all single-headed households, or 1,928
households, and14.8 percent of all households in 2000. Approximately 67 percent of
the 2000 female-headed households (1,301 of 1,928) included one or more children
under the age of 18. According to the 2000 Census, the number of children under 18
years living within female-headed households totaled 2,521, representing 20 percent of
children under 18 years of age.
                        Female single parents normally do not enter the labor force when
children are small and later seek employment when children are older. According to the
1990 Census, the majority of single mothers (approximately 60 percent) in Lompoc with
children aged under 6 years were counted as not in the labor force. In contrast, 68 per-
cent of Lompoc mothers with children aged 6 to 17 years were in the labor force. This
trend reversed according to the 2000 Census which showed that only 33 percent of sin-
gle mothers in Lompoc with children aged under 6 years were counted as not in the la-
bor force. The majority of single mothers (approximately 67 percent) with children aged
under 6 years were counted as being in the labor force. Moreover, 73 percent of Lompoc
mothers with children aged 6 to 17 years were in the labor force.
                        Female-headed single-parent households tend to have low in-
comes. Mothers with small children who choose to stay at home forgo income from
working outside the home and may rely on public assistance or child support to support
their family. Mothers who do work outside the home often incur high childcare costs
while their children are young. The financial difficulty encountered by female single par-
ents is evidenced by the high incidence of poverty among children within female-headed
households in Lompoc. According to the 2000 Census, children in Lompoc living within
female-headed households accounted for 34 percent of all Lompoc children (under 18
years of age) who were living below the annual poverty threshold. This is particularly
significant given that children (under 18 years of age) living in female-headed house-
holds make up only 20 percent of all children living in Lompoc (2,521 of 12,310).
                        Obtaining suitable housing can be difficult for female single par-
ents. Expenses for childcare, low household income, and large spatial requirements limit

the range of available housing choice. Consequently, many of these households may
have to settle for smaller housing units and endure overcrowded conditions. In addition,
the location of housing for this need group should be near recreational facilities, shop-
ping, and schools, to ease the problem of transportation and after-school supervision.
                7.3.5. Farmworkers
                        Farmworkers have a difficult time finding and affording housing
due to a combination of limited English language skills, traditionally larger family size,
low household incomes, and a consequent inability to obtain housing loans. Reliable da-
ta on the size of the farmworker population and its housing needs is difficult to obtain
for the agricultural area immediately surrounding Lompoc.
                        According to the Migrant and Seasonal Farm Worker Enumeration
Profiles Final Study for California dated September, 2000, Santa Barbara County ranks
ninth in the state for persons permanently and seasonally employed in agriculture. The
study indicates that in Santa Barbara County there are an estimated 24,461 migrant and
seasonal farmworkers. Of this number, 11,326 are migrant farmworkers and 13,136 are
seasonal farmworkers. The study further estimates there are 4,162 non-farmworkers in
migrant households and 14,906 non-farmworkers in seasonal households, for a total
figure of 43,529 migrant and seasonal farmworkers and their families in Santa Barbara
County.
                        The Bureau of Census reported in 2000 that agriculture workers
represent approximately six percent (6.2%) of the total employed persons aged 16 years
and over in Santa Barbara County (180,716 workers in Santa Barbara County; 11,189
workers in agriculture). Further, the Census reported in 2000 that 776 workers in agri-
culture resided in the City of Lompoc, approximately seven percent of the total number
of agriculture workers in the County. The number of farmworkers has decreased over
the last ten years since the 1990 Census which reported 942 farmworkers. However, the
proportion of farmworkers to the total number of persons employed who reside in the
City of Lompoc has increased by one percent since 1990.
                        Migrant farmworkers often experience the most difficulty securing
affordable housing because of the absence of income when work is not available. Most
of the farmworkers who reside in Lompoc are non-migrant due to the Lompoc Valley’s
long growing seasons which produce steady annual crop production activity.

                        Special housing needs for this population include: security deposit

                        The City of Lompoc’s existing Zoning Ordinance allows for various
residential dwelling types in both residential and commercial zones that can accommo-
date migrant and seasonal farmworkers. Thus, farmworker households are typically able
to find housing within the affordable housing stock or other forms of living arrange-
ments allowed by right or conditionally through a use permit.
                        The R-A (Residential Agricultural) zone is established for use in
areas particularly suited for light agricultural activities. Permitted uses include “crops,
field, tree, bush, berry and row, including nursery stock, the growing of.” “Agricultural
workers’ living quarters for persons employed and deriving the major portion of their
income from employment on the premises” is a use permitted subject to obtaining a use
permit (of which there are a total of 22 conditionally listed uses in the R-A zone).
                        The R-3 (High Density) zone allows multiple family uses at a den-
sity range between 14.5 and 21.8 dwelling units per acre. Multiple family use means a
building designed or used for occupancy by three or more families, living independently
of each other. Other permitted uses include apartments, duplexes, triplexes, and group
dwellings.
                        The C-2 (Central Business District) zone allows hotels and motels.
A hotel, as defined in the City’s Zoning Ordinance, means “any building or portion the-
reof used, arranged, or designed so as to provide six or more rooms or suites of rooms
without kitchens, for rent or hire.” Hotel includes “motor hotel and motel.” Lompoc has a
higher number of hotels and motels located within the City compared to other cities of
similar size because of the build-up of business employment and tourism associated
with the activities at Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) from the late-1970’s to the mid-
1980’s.
                        As noted in the section on population characteristics, the 1986
Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster caused a decrease in employment at VAFB. The need
to house contract employees decreased and tourism associated with VAFB decreased
resulting in high vacancy rates in existing hotels and motels.
                        In summary, farmworker households in Lompoc can be served
through housing provided on agriculturally zoned land, the City’s affordable housing,
existing affordable housing projects, and existing motels and hotels.

                 7.3.6  Homeless
                        The size of the Lompoc homeless population is difficult to identi-
fy. This segment of the population becomes homeless for a wide variety of reasons and
remains homeless for vastly differing lengths of time. One person may be homeless for
just a few nights, while another may be homeless for years at a time. Some homeless are
ashamed of their condition and strive to remain unseen and undetected. In addition, the
homeless are an extremely transient population. Their presence is influenced by such
factors as the availability of homeless services, low-cost housing, local job opportuni-
ties, and climate.
                        In June of 1990, the County of Santa Barbara, in conjunction with
the City of Lompoc and other cities in the County completed the Comprehensive Home-
less Assistance Plan (CHAP) for Santa Barbara County.24 This CHAP has been the most
comprehensive study of the homeless within Santa Barbara County. The CHAP defines a
“homeless individual” as one who lacks a regular, legal, nighttime residence; is in a su-
pervised, temporary shelter (congregate shelter or welfare hotel); temporarily in the res-
idence of another individual; or a place not designated for or ordinarily used for housing
(e.g. a car, hallway, bus station, lobby, street, campground, or park). For the purposes
of this Housing Element, individuals without permanent shelter (as described above),
except those living temporarily in the residence of another individual, are considered
homeless.
                        Homelessness is the result of many economic and personal fac-
tors. Factors contributing to homelessness cited by the CHAP include: the scarcity of
lower-income housing, job loss, long term unemployment, underemployment, no health
insurance coverage, prolonged illness, long term disability, divorce, family violence,
substance abuse, mental illness, lack of awareness of entitlement program benefits, and
the refusal or cessation of benefits. Different economic and personal crises often
 exacerbate one another and can result in homelessness. Housing overpayment is an
 economic constraint that is compounded when housing prices escalate and wages
 decrease, resulting in evictions and removals. A serious accident or illness can drain a
 savings account and can keep an employed individual out of work, thus starting a
homelessness cycle.
                        The CHAP estimated that there were approximately 4,000 home-
less in Santa Barbara County in 1990. Yet, the CHAP did not provide an estimate for the
homeless population within the City of Lompoc. The homeless population within Santa

Barbara County, according to the CHAP, was young, predominantly Anglo, with an in-
creasing Latino representation. Families represented 30 percent of the homeless popu-
lation, 20 percent were working poor, 30 percent were mentally ill, and 30-50 percent
had a substance abuse problem.
                        More recent data on homelessness in California comes from the
1999 Statewide Housing Plan, prepared by the Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD). HCD estimates that on any given day there are 5,400 homeless in
Santa Barbara County, an increase of 35 percent (1,400 people) since 1990. According
to HCD’s data, approximately 58 percent of homeless in Santa Barbara County are single
adults, while 42 percent are families.
                        Estimates of homeless persons in the City of Lompoc are derived
from the 2000 Census. According to the 2000 Census, 178 persons in the City of Lom-
poc were described as “either not having a usual home elsewhere,” “people without con-
ventional housing,” or “other non-institutional group quarters.” Of the 178 persons, two
persons lived in homes or halfway houses for drug/alcohol abuse and 13 persons lived
in “other group homes” which include communes, foster care homes, and maternity
homes for unwed mothers. The remaining 163 persons either lived in “other nonhouse-
hold living situations” or “other non-institutional group quarters.” “Other nonhousehold
living situations” includes people with “no usual home elsewhere enumerated at loca-
tions such as YMCA’s, YWCA’s, and hostels.” According to the Census, the number of
persons living in the City of Lompoc in this situation totals 59. The remaining 104
persons identified by the Census lived in “other non-institutional group quarters.” “Oth-
er non-institutional group quarters” include the following:
                               ° Emergency and transitional shelters (with sleeping facili-
ties) includes people without conventional housing who stayed overnight on March 27,
2000, in permanent and emergency housing, missions, Salvation Army shelters, transi-
tional shelters, hotels and motels used to shelter people without conventional housing,
and similar places known to have people without conventional housing staying over-
night. Also included are shelters that operate on a first come, first-serve basis where
people must leave in the morning and have no guaranteed bed for the next night OR
where people know that they have a bed for a specified period of time (even if they leave
the building every day). Shelters also include facilities that provide temporary shelter
during extremely cold weather (such as churches). If shown, this category also includes
shelters for children who are runaways, neglected, or without conventional housing.

                              ° Shelters for abused women (shelters against domestic vi-
olence or family crisis centers) includes community-based homes or shelters that pro-
vide domiciliary care for women who have sought shelter from family violence and who
may have been physically abused.
                              ° Regularly scheduled mobile food vans includes mobile
food vans which are regularly scheduled to visit designated street locations for the pri-
mary purpose of providing food to people without conventional housing.
                              ° Soup kitchens includes soup kitchens, food lines, and
programs distributing prepared breakfasts, lunches, or dinners on March 28, 2000.
These programs may be organized as food service lines, bag or box lunches, or tables
where people are seated, then served by program personnel. These programs may or
may not have a place for clients to sit and eat the meal.
                              ° Targeted non-sheltered outdoor locations includes geo-
graphically identifiable outdoor locations open to the elements where there is evidence
that people who do not usually receive services at soup kitchens, shelters, and mobile-
food vans lived on March 29, 2000, without paying to stay there.
                        Additional estimates of the Lompoc homeless population have
been collected by members of the Homeless Coalition who indicate there are an esti-
mated annual average of 50 persons in the City of Lompoc identified as homeless.
                        In 1998, the Marks House Transitional Shelter opened its doors in
the City of Lompoc for homeless families with children. This facility provides shelter for
five to six family households for a maximum length of stay of 90 days. The City of Lom-
poc provided a deferred loan of HOME funds to cover a portion of property acquisition
costs and a low interest loan of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program
income funds for rehabilitation of the shelter. The Marks House has just completed its
fourth year of operation in 2002 during which time approximately 154 homeless were
assisted. The City continues to support the ongoing operation of the Marks House
through CDBG and City Human Service Funds.
                        Domestic Violence Solutions (formerly Shelter Services for Women,
Inc.) operates a publicly-assisted shelter which directly provides housing for twelve
homeless women and children. In 2001, the Lompoc Shelter provided emergency safe
housing for 185 unduplicated women and their children.

                         The City also supported the efforts of LHCDC to acquire a 10.9-
acre parcel on the outskirts of the City in Santa Barbara County for rehabilitation and
expansion of an existing transitional facility. The project, called the Bridgehouse Home-
less Shelter and Transitional Facility (formerly The Farmhouse), involves substantial re-
habilitation of a large commercial building, a former 16-bed transitional facility, and
several dilapidated greenhouses. The project when completed will feature a 40-bed year
round shelter for single adult males, a 20-bed long-term transitional shelter for women
and children, and a vocational training component for residents. The 20-bed facility
opened December 1, 2002 and currently houses 20 men, women, and children.
                         The Courtyard South Apartments play an important role in hous-
ing homeless. In 1999-2000, the City of Lompoc provided funding to LHCDC to acquire
and rehabilitate the Courtyard South Apartments. Families residing at the Marks House
can transition to permanent housing at Courtyard South Apartments. During 2001, one
formerly homeless household of four persons moved into the apartment complex from
the Marks House Transitional Housing Program.
                         Additionally, temporary housing in local motels is arranged to as-
sist the homeless. The Lompoc Police Department, in cooperation with the Salvation Ar-
my, operates a fund to assist families and individuals with temporary housing and
meals. Assistance is limited to two days housing or three days if the need occurs over
the weekend. In 2002, the Lompoc Police Department assisted 124 persons with nightly
lodging arrangements.
                         Catholic Charities also operates a program that provides vouchers
for lodging in local motels, food, clothing and household goods to homeless families
and individuals and to households at risk of becoming homeless.
                         Local churches occasionally open their doors to allow the home-
less to sleep in their facilities.
                         The Transitions Mental Health Drop-In Center has received City
financial support with CDGB funds toward the development and operation of a walk-in
center for the homeless in Lompoc. The program provided through the Center includes
a safe drop-in location for homeless persons to receive services. The Center provides
laundry services (machines on-site), a community clothes closet, U.S. mail center, a
message center, and health care services provided by a County of Santa Barbara Public
Health nurse twice a week. The Center also provides a referral for emergency shelter and
assistance in locating longer-term shelter..

                        Lastly, the most recent addition to the inventory of homeless re-
sources is the Good Samaritans Recovery Way Home which provides 16 transitional beds
for women and children. As previously noted, Homebase (a 39-unit extended stay and
transitions facility for low income and disabled persons located on 513 North G Street)
is slated for completion in 2009.
                        Although estimates vary considerably on the size of the Lompoc
homeless population, the provision of additional temporary housing units appears ne-
cessary to alleviate existing need.
                        The City is currently working on updating the Zoning Ordinance.
As noted in Measure 2, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow emergency
shelters in low (R-1), medium (R-2), and high (R-3) density residential zones. During the
process of updating and amending the Zoning Ordinance, the City will study allowing
emergency housing in certain commercial zones.
        7.4     Needs Accommodation.
                7.4.1   Programmatic Considerations.
                        The needs attributable to a lack of affordable housing and over-
crowding are generally addressed through increased housing production, while sub-
standard housing is best addressed though a combination of code enforcement and re-
habilitation assistance. As noted in Section 8.0, the City has considerable development
capacity by which to broaden the supply of housing, simultaneously addressing con-
struction needs possessed by both existing and future households. Such capacity, in
combination with the existing housing stock, is used to make housing affordable to tar-
get income groups through a variety of Implementing Actions. The same is true of
housing rehabilitation and a host of programs to address both rental and ownership
dwellings. These programs are not new and will be continued from the previous Hous-
ing Element. A new initiative to address those homeowners at risk of losing their homes
due to the combined effect of the subprime mortgage crisis and general economic
downturn has been added to the list of Implementing Actions.

                7.4.2 Land Use Considerations.
                        Table H-41 matches categories of housing types allowed by cur-
rent zoning to the particular needs possessed by special population groups. These
match-ups are then compared to allowed uses and permit requirements for each zone
district. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that emergency shelters are not expressly
authorized in the City’s Zoning Ordinance. This situation and resulting policy ramifica-
tions are specifically addressed in Section 12.1. It is also noted that: (i) farmworker
housing and second dwellings are only allowed by conditional use permit and are re-
stricted to one zone district; and (ii) rest homes, nursing homes and group dwellings are
only allowed within one residential zone. Although not reflected in Table H-42, it is
further noted that: (i) care homes are restricted as to type and number of occupants;
and (ii) the range of uses allowed in connection with group dwellings is not defined. In
view of these limitations, and in furtherance of housing opportunities for special popu-
lation groups, the following proposed Zoning Ordinance amendments are included
among the Implementing Actions:
                                •        Care Homes and Group Dwellings. Consolidate
care homes and group dwellings under a single term “residential care homes” and broa-
den the definition to include transitional houses, orphanages, rehabilitation centers,
self-help group homes, agricultural employee housing and congregate care facilities.
Allow residential care homes serving six (6) or fewer persons as a permitted use in all
residential zone districts; allow facilities serving seven (7) or more persons by condi-
tional use permit.
                                •        Second Dwellings and Farmworker Housing. Re-
move the conditional use requirement for second dwellings and farmworker housing (for
six or less persons).
                                •        Rest and Nursing Homes. Broaden the range of
zone districts allowing rest and nursing homes by conditional use permit to include the
medium and high-density zones (R-2 and R-3).

8.0       Future Housing Needs
          8.1      Summary
                   As evidenced in the analysis that follows, the City has an adequate land
inventory to address its projected housing needs. This means that no additional prop-
erty must be rezoned or intensified in order to meet the City’s assigned share of region-
al housing needs. It is further noted that the analysis is conservative insofar as: (i) it
does not account for potential development of second dwellings which are expressly
allowed in single family zone districts; (ii) it is based on the intensity of development
that actually exists within each respective zone district as opposed to hypothetical max-
imums; and (iii) it excludes potential development from areas identified for future an-
nexation.

HOUSING ELEMENT
         8.2       Projected Needs
                   The Regional Housing Needs Allocation (“RHNA”) process is part of a
statewide mandate to address housing issues related to future growth in the State. The
process sets numeric targets with the overriding goal of assuring an equitable geo-
graphic distribution of needs and responsibilities. The numbers are first generated by
HCD and then refined by regional planning agencies in cooperation with local govern-
ment. While the methodology takes into account land use and zoning, the numbers are
not necessarily constrained by institutional limits. Consequently, it is not inconceivable
that housing numbers assigned to a particular jurisdiction exceed its theoretical carrying
capacity. The number assigned to the City of Lompoc for 2007-2014 is 516 new units,
of which roughly 64% is assigned to target income groups (Table H-43). These numbers
are roughly 42% less than the amount assigned for the previous planning period. Tables
H-44 and H-45 reflect the current adjusted requirement, taking into account construc-
tion that has occurred between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008.

  Notes:
      1.    Although extremely low income is a target income group for purposes of the Housing Element,
           RHNA allocations do not expressly recognize this particular category.    Instead, extremely low-
           income are included within the very low-income category.

  Notes: New Construction consist of single-family homes not deemed affordable to target income groups.
  The 201 E. College Street project, developed by the Lompoc Housing Community Development Corporation,
  is 100% affordable; 34 units have affordability restrictions – 29 for very low income and 9 for low income;
  the remaining one unrestricted apartment unit is deemed affordable to moderate income by design.
          8.3      Land Inventory
                   A detailed accounting of residential development potential is contained in
Appendix B and summarized in Tables H-46, H-47 and H-48. Together, these tables
encompass all parcels within the City having a residential zone designation or which are
contained within a zone district that allows residential dwellings in combination with
commercial uses. The inventory is adjusted to discount parcels that are deemed un-
available for development by virtue of ownership or restricted use (e.g., dedicated open
space, railroad corridors, etc.). The resulting analysis reveals a build-out potential of
between 1,731 and 2,743 additional dwellings. The upper end of this range reflects the
“Maximum Potential” for all parcels based on current zoning (i.e., parcel acreage x den-
sity allowed). The lower number reflects “Forecasted Units” based on actual densities of
residentially developed parcels within each zone district, reduced by the number of ex-
isting dwellings (if any). This lower number is a more realistic estimate insofar as the
analysis shows that properties have typically not achieved their full development poten-
tial as noted in Table H-49.

           ing an improvement value of less than 50% of the mean improvement value of all developed prop-
           erties within the each respective zone; and (ii) exclude parcels that are “Entitled.” Entitled Parcels
           encompass all projects for which discretionary approvals have been granted but not yet con-
           structed. Developed Parcels are those having an improvement value of greater than 50% of the
           mean value of all improved parcels or which are owned by non-profit organizations and classified
           as developed. See Table H-50. Unavailable Parcels are those which are either owned by non-

the RHNA goals for corresponding income categories. The affordability analysis in Sec-
tion 5.0 also shows that market rate units, regardless of type, are beyond the reasona-
ble financial means of lower-income households, Policies 1.11 and 1.12 attempt to
moderate this disparity by requiring 10% of all residential projects containing 10 or
more units to provide affordable housing to target income groups. Within the Old Town
Redevelopment Project Area, the inclusionary requirement is 15% and must be satisfied
on site unless substantial evidence of infeasibility can be demonstrated, in which case
relief may be granted. Outside of the redevelopment area, the inclusionary requirement
may be satisfied by payment of fees in lieu of on-site construction. In-lieu fees, while
helpful in capitalizing housing trust funds, do not necessarily guarantee the production
of affordable units. For this reason, RHNA credits appearing in Table H-52 are limited
to inclusionary units within the Old Town Redevelopment Project Area.

                     Policies 3.2 and 3.4 of the Land Use Element expressly encourage devel-
opment of vacant and underutilized properties along the H Street Corridor under a
mixed-use overlay. These policies and associated overlay standards provide for an in-
tensification of land use that equals or exceeds the maximum 21.8 du/ac density cur-
rently allowed within all land use designations. Utilizing a maximum floor area ratio of
0.75 and dwelling size of 700 square feet, in combination with a development intensity
factor of 54% that corresponds to existing MU (Mixed Use) Zone District, the resulting
assessment of development potential of the H Street Corridor Infill overlay is displayed
in Table H-53. In summary, an additional 147 high-density units are forecast by appli-
cation of the H Street Corridor Infill Overlay. As noted, this figure is highly conservative
compared to the hypothetical maximum of 333 units that the new mixed-use designa-
tion could otherwise accommodate.

                               As noted in Appendix B-1, 44 of the 49 high-density vacant land
inventory (including H Street Infill sites) consists of parcels under one acre in size. Of-
ten times, the nature and conditions associated with small parcels render the provision
of affordable housing infeasible. However, on closer examination, Appendix B-1 also
shows that small parcels comprise the overwhelming majority of high-density residen-

identical. This evidences that small parcels can be developed to same level of intensity
as those which exceed one acre in size. In forecasting the development of vacant high-
density parcels, a lower density factor is utilized (12 du/acre vs. 17.5 du/acre). The re-
sult is a very conservative estimate of development potential as opposed to overstating
capacity for purposes of RHNA.

 Notes:
      1.   Small Parcels are defined as those under one acre in size. Large Parcels are defined as those equal
           or greater than one acre in size. Utilized consists of parcels that are either Developed or Entitled
           per Tables H-48 and H-53.

                    8.6.2     Underutilized Sites
                    As defined in Table H-46, Underutilized Parcels: (i) are those having an
improvement value of less than 50% of the mean improvement value of all developed
properties within the each respective zone; and (ii) exclude parcels that are “Entitled.”
As individually categorized in Appendix B-2 and collectively summarized in Table H-
53B, the inventory of underutilized sites with a high density land use designation en-
compasses 95 separate parcels spread among 14 land use categories totaling 28 acres.
The overwhelming major of these sites consist of vacant land, parking lots and single
family units located on property zoned for high density residential use which account
for 86% of the development forecast. While valuation may be seen as an arbitrary
benchmark, it serves as good filter for identifying properties that are ripe for intensifi-
cation. This is evidenced in Table H-53C; specifically, the properties and corresponding
photos appearing in this table have been selected as representative of the typical level

fashion to that described for small sites, the estimated development potential of unde-

                         Approximately 60% of the total inventory of high-density vacant
and underutilized parcels is less than one-half acre in size (Table H-53D and Figure H-
5B). It is generally believed that development of such parcels at high density is proble-
matic by virtue of their limited size. However, as shown in Table H-53D, entitled as well
as existing developed parcels of similar size have a development intensity of 18 and 20
units per acre, respectively. This compares favorably to the intensity of entitled and ex-
isting developed parcels over one-half acre in size; 19 and 17.5 dwellings per acre, re-
spectively. The feasibility of developing small vacant and underutilized properties is
further illustrated in Table H-53E which summarizes affordable housing projects ap-
proved during the past five years on parcels less than one acre in size. It is also noted
that: (i) the majority of both small and underutilized sites are contained with the City’s
redevelopment project area boundaries (Figure H-5A); (ii) 54% of the total inventory of

vacant and underutilized parcels are contiguous to one another (Figure H-5B); and (iii)
45% of the total combined acreage of all vacant and underutilized sites under one acre
in size form contiguous groups of parcels (Figure H-5B). These conditions lend them-
selves to lot consolidation to facilitate affordable housing development in furtherance of
City and Redevelopment Agency infill objectives. One such example is Chestnut Cross-
ing (Table H-52) which entailed the assemblage of seven separate parcels, each totally
less than 0.6 acres, in order to develop 34 total units (including six deed-restricted af-
fordable units) on a combined site area of 1.85 acres (translating to 18.38 units/acre;
Figure H-5C). Drawing upon this example, and through the powers and financial re-
sources of the Redevelopment Agency, an Implementation Measure has been included in
the current Housing Element to facilitate the consolidation and intensification of small
and underutilized sites.

                        Updating the Housing Element for the current planning horizon is
part of a broader review and revision of the City’s entire General Plan. An Environmental
Impact Report (“EIR”) has been prepared to assess the physical ramifications of contem-
plated actions. Under the EIR, four potential environmental constraints have been iden-
tified that have relevance to the infill, mixed-use and intensification policies of the
Housing Element: (i) impacts to historic buildings within the downtown core; (ii) the
presence of hazardous materials from prior development; (iii) hydrology and drainage
constraints that arise from recently adopted stormwater management policies; and (iv)
land use compatibility between infill residential and nearby commercial and industrial
uses. These factors are not evaluated on a parcel-specific basis; rather, the EIR is pro-
grammatic in nature and defers analysis to site-specific projects. These constraints are

not extraordinary and would normally be dealt with by way of conditions of approval at
time of entitlement. It is noteworthy that the capacity to accommodate the City’s as-
signed share of regional housing needs is nearly three times its RHNA goals (Table H-
54); thus, there is a comfortable cushion to compensate for one or more sites that may
be adversely effected by environmental constraints.
                8.6.4   Availability of Services
                        The availability of necessary public services such as water, sewer,
electrical, and solid waste disposal to facilitate attainment of RHNA goals is fully dis-
cussed within the Public Facilities and Services Element of the General Plan. Information
within this Element and companion EIR indicates that adequate public service capability
exists to accommodate housing projections through 2030. As noted in Figure H-5A,
the majority of sites on which RHNA capacity has been calculated are located within pre-
dominately developed areas, clustered near the downtown core of the City’s redevelop-
ment project. While the City has adopted Subdivision Standards, many of these re-
quirements will not apply to infill situations, as would be the case for most of the high
density and H Street mixed-use sites. These areas are already subdivided and fully im-
proved; thus, subdivision level requirements will not contribute significantly to the cost
or supply of housing for target income groups.
        8.6     Goal Assignment
                Housing affordability is an important component of RHNA insofar as the
evaluation of development capacity must also consider the appropriateness of the in-
ventory relative to development economics. Under Housing Element law, a community
may either conduct its own economic feasibility analysis or default to land use densities
prescribed by statute. In the case of Lompoc, the minimum density for housing to be
deemed affordable to lower income persons is 20 dwellings per acre. No minimum
density requirement is prescribed for income groups other than lower income. Included
within the lower income category are persons and families classified as extremely low,
very low or low income. While single family homes are only affordable to those at the
upper higher end of the income scale, attached ownership units and multiple family
rental dwellings are at least affordable to persons and familes with moderate incomes
(Section 5.0). For purposes of RHNA, this means that existing residential densities
should be sufficient to meet new construction goals for moderate income households so
long as it can be evidenced that there is an adequate inventory of land to produce the
numeric count. The same holds true for those with incomes above the moderate level.
The more difficult challenge is to ascertain whether there is an adequate inventory of

land with an underlying zoning density of at least 20 units per acre, sufficient to
produce a minimum of 175 units which is the combined RHNA goal for very low and low
income households (less new construction since January 1, 2007). If this cannot be
accomplished, the City will need either to conduct a more indepth economic analysis of
affordability or commit itself to a program which provides the zoning necessary to meet
the shortfall in units.
        8.7     RHNA Comparison
                As noted in Paragraph 8.2, the City has been assigned a total of 516
dwellings as its total RHNA goal. Discounting for new construction completed since the
beginning of 2007 (Tables H-44 and H-45), the adjusted target is 434 units. This tar-
get compares favorably to the hypothetical development capacity of 1,878 units above
the current baseline (1,731 units under existing residential zoning and 147 units result-
ing from the H Street Infill Overlay). Insofar as the analysis of affordability (Section 5.0)
shows that the existing housing stock (other than detached single family homes) is af-
fordable to persons with incomes at and above the moderate level, development capaci-
ty at lower densities is appropriate relative to meeting the RHNA goals assigned to this
particular population segment. In this regard, the capacity analysis indicates a potential
increase of 154 dwellings with current zoning compared to a net RHNA goal of 122
dwellings for moderate-income households. The net RHNA goal for persons and fami-
lies with incomes above moderate is 137 dwellings as compared to 1,173 dwellings that
are forecast. In regard to lower income households, the net RHNA goal is 175 dwellings
compared to a build-out potential of 553 dwellings at a density of 21.8 du/ac. In sum-
mary, the inventory of land under current zoning, coupled with the new H Street Corri-
dor Infill Overlay, evidences excess capacity to meet the City’s assigned share of future
housing needs. Figure H-6 provides a graphic depiction of land available for residential
development while Appendix B-1 contains a detailed inventory and development as-
sessment of parcels appearing in the figure.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
9.0     Introduction
        Housing development constraints take many forms. They can be institutional, fi-
nancial, or environmental and may be necessary to protect public health and safety or
enhance the quality of life within a community. However, unnecessary constraints may
discourage the development or conservation of needed housing and result in detrimen-
tal social consequences including: dilapidated housing, household overpayment, over-
crowding, and homelessness.
10.0    Governmental Constraints
        While governmental regulation is necessary to protect the quality of development
in a community, it increases the cost of development and thus the cost of housing. Ex-
isting governmental constraints include: land use controls, building codes and enforce-
ment, on/off site improvements, fees and exactions, permit processing procedures, and
State and Federal requirements. Land use controls limit the type and density of devel-
opment, thus increasing the cost per housing unit. Building Code standards may require
more expensive construction methods and materials. On-site and off-site improve-
ments, like under grounding of utilities, road widening, installation of traffic signals, or
sewer line extensions increase a project’s cost. Fees and exactions contribute directly to
the increase in costs. Processing and permit requirements delay construction, increasing
financing costs and other overhead costs associated with housing development. The fol-
lowing describes governmental constraints which may affect the cost of housing in
Lompoc.
        10.1    Land Use Controls
                The City of Lompoc currently has no growth control ordinance designed
to limit residential development. The City’s General Plan and Zoning Ordinance provide
for a range of housing types and density allowances. The General Plan has the following
six land use designations and permitted densities that allow residential uses: Very Low,
Low, Medium, and High Density residential, as well as Mixed-Use and Old Town Com-
mercial. The Mixed-Use land use designation allows for residential development as a
primary or secondary use on a proportion of the total floor area, at High Density resi-
dential range. The Old Town Commercial land use designation allows for residential de-
velopment as a secondary use at High Density residential range. The density ranges and

 Notes:
     1.   Average population density indicates the expected number of persons per net acre living within
          residential areas. It is calculated by multiplying the maximum allowable dwelling units per net acre
          by the average citywide household size (2.88 according to the 2000 Census).
     2.   Allowable building density for commercial is 1.00 FAR with a minimum of 33% of floor area for
          residential use.
     3.   Mixed Use Developments: Allowable building density is 1.00 FAR with a minimum of 33% of floor
          area for residential use; Residential Developments: Allowable building density is 2.00 FAR.
                  The City of Lompoc Zoning Ordinance contains seven zones that permit
residential uses. The Zoning Ordinance regulates such features as lot coverage, building
height, lot area, lot dimensions, setbacks, and landscaped open space requirements.
Development standards for the eight zones are provided in Table H-56 on the following
page.

                The maximum densities permitted by the General Plan for the Very Low
Density Residential (R-A) is 2.2 dwelling units per acre, Low Density Residential (R-1) is
6.2 dwelling units per acre, Medium Density Residential (R-2) ranges from a minimum of
6.2 to a maximum of 14.5 dwelling units per acre, High Density Residential (R-3) ranges
from a minimum of 14.5 to a maximum of 21.8 dwelling units per acre. The Mixed
Use/Central Business (MU/C-2) and Old Town Commercial (OTC) allow a minimum den-
sity of 14.5 dwelling units per acre to a maximum of 21.8 dwelling units per acre.
                With the exception of the R-A, T, and OTC zones, minimum lot widths
range from 60 to 75 feet. The R-A zone requires a minimum lot width of 100 feet and
the OTC zone 25 feet. There is no minimum lot width for the T zone. In addition, there
are no minimum lot depths for any of the zones allowing residential uses.
                Yard and setback requirements are not excessive and range from 5 feet
to 20 feet. Front setbacks in single-family zones allow a progressive setback from 15 to
25 feet. The MU/C-2 zone has no front yard setback and a 10 foot side and rear setback
only if the MU/C-2 parcel has a side or rear lot line adjoining residential property. The
OTC zone has no front or side yard setback, but has a 10-foot rear yard setback. Height
limits in residential zones (R-A, R-1, R-2, and R-3) allow two and three stories (maxi-
mum of 30 and 35 feet). Height limits in the MU/C-2 and OTC zones are four stories or
50 feet and three stories or 45 feet, respectively.
                With the exception of the R-A zone having no requirement, maximum lot
coverage ranges from 40 to 60 percent for residential zones (R-1, R-2, and R-3) which
is more than sufficient to accommodate the maximum densities permitted under the
General Plan. The MU/C-2 zone has no lot coverage restriction. The OTC has a 2.0 floor
area ratio (FAR) of which a maximum of 25 percent may be residential use.
                Landscaped open area requires 300 square feet for each dwelling unit in
the R-2 zone and 250 square feet for each dwelling unit in the R-3 zone. There is no
landscaped open area requirement in the R-A, R-1, MU/C-2, or OTC zones.

                 10.1.1 Planned Development
                         The Planned Development (PD) District (Lompoc City Code, Article

conformance with the Elements of the General Plan of the City but permitting a flexible
design approach to the development of a total community environment equal to or bet-
ter than that resulting from traditional lot-by-lot land use development.
                         Various land uses may be combined in a PD District including res-
idential, commercial, and light industrial parks, or any other use or combination of uses
which can be made appropriately a part of a planned development.

cable districts by allowing developers to vary from the strict application of the develop-
ment standards of the base zoning districts. The flexibility provides for, and can pro-
mote the cluster housing, zero lot lines, townhomes, and similar housing types that can
be more difficult to develop with typical setbacks, lot coverage, and parking.
                 10.1.2 Permitted Uses in Residential Zoning Districts
                        The Lompoc City Code designates permitted and non-permitted
uses for all developable use types in the City. As summarized in Table H-55: (i) single
family dwellings, detached, are permitted in the R-A, R-1, and R-2 zones, and are con-
ditionally allowed in the R-3 zone; (iii) single family dwellings, attached, are permitted in
the R-2 and R-3 zones. (iii) duplexes are not permitted in the R-A or R-1 zones, but are
permitted in the R-2 and R-3 zones; (iv) triplexes and uses with more than two de-
tached single family dwellings are conditionally allowed in the R-2 zone, and are per-
mitted in the R-3 zone; (v) apartments for three or more families are permitted in the R-
3 zone; (vi) group dwellings are permitted in the R-3 zone; (vii) second residential units
are permitted in the R-1 zone; (viii) mobilehome parks, travel trailer parks, and recrea-
tional vehicle parks are only permitted in the T zone; and (ix) residential care providers
are permitted in the R-1, R-2, and R-3 zones.
                 10.1.3 Residential Development in Mixed Use Zone Districts
                        Residential dwellings are encouraged in conjunction with com-
mercial uses within the Old Town Commercial (“OTC”) and Mixed Use (“MU”) zone dis-
trict. Applicable zoning regulations restrict residential uses to stories above e the first
floor and must be built with a 2.00 FAR with a maximum of 25% of floor area for resi-
dential. Single family and two family dwellings are prohibited uses unless they meet
specified criteria. Multiple-family dwellings (three dwelling units but no more than four
dwelling units) conditionally permitted uses unless they meet the criteria of the Mixed
Use Development. As noted in Table H-48, no residential units have been developed
within the Old Town Commercial district, yet a density of up to 21.8 dwellings/acre is
specifically allowed. This indicates a possible disconnect between underlying develop-
ment standards and the goal of promoting mixed use projects. To address this appar-
ent disparity, a focused analysis of the impediments and incentives to promote mixed
projects within the OTC zone is expressly included as Implementation Measure 24.

                  10.1.4 Conditional Use Permit Process
                            The Conditional Use Permit (CUP) process is described in the
Lompoc City Code (Article 1, Section 8880). Applications for use permits are reviewed by
the Planning Commission which then has the authority to approve, conditionally ap-
prove, or deny the application. The total process of a CUP takes approximately six
weeks to complete.
                            In granting a CUP, the Planning Commission must make all of the
following findings: (i) the site of the proposed use is adequate in size and topography to
accommodate the proposed use, and all yards, spaces, walls and fences, parking, load-
ing, and landscaping are adequate to properly adjust such use with the land and uses in
the vicinity; (ii) the site for the proposed use relates to streets and highways adequate in
width and pavement to carry the quantity and kind of traffic generated by the proposed
use; (iii) the proposed use will have no adverse effect upon abutting property from the
permitted use; and (iv) the conditions stated in the decision are deemed necessary to
protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. The conditions may include but
are not limited to: regulations of use; special yards, spaces, and buffers; surfacing of
parking areas; requiring street, service road, or alley dedications and improvements or
appropriate bonds; special fences, solid fences, and walls; regulation of points of vehi-
cular ingress and egress; regulation of signs; landscaping plan designed by landscape
architect, to be reviewed and approved by the City Planner; requiring maintenance of the
grounds; regulation of noise, vibration, odors; regulation of hours for certain activities;
time periods within which the proposed use or portions thereof shall be developed; du-
ration of use or portions thereof; posting of a bond or bonds sufficient to guarantee the
removal of any non-conforming; structures or uses of the land upon the expiration of
the period of the conditional use permit; requiring the dedication of access rights; and
such other conditions as will make possible the development of the City in an orderly
and efficient manner.
                            The Planning Commission may impose additional conditions on
the following residential uses which require a CUP, but only if the conditions serve to
ensure that the appropriate findings can be made: single family dwellings in R-3 zone,
triplexes and uses in which more than two detached single family dwellings in R-2 zone,
and agricultural workers’ living quarters for persons employed and deriving the major
portion of their income from employment on the premises in the R-A zone.
                  The CUP process does not act as a constraint to the development of af-
fordable housing because: (i) a CUP is not required for multiple family uses such as dup-

lexes, triplexes, apartments, and group dwellings in the R-3 zone; (ii) where a CUP is
required it does not add significant time or delay to the approval of a project; (iii) the
Planning Commission does not impose additional development standards through the
CUP, but rather addresses the findings that are described in Chapter 50 of the Lompoc
City Code; and (iv) the City’s CUP application packet provides clear direction on submit-
tal requirements and the process and standards for review.
                 10.1.5 Architectural Review (Design Review)
                          The Architectural Review [Design Review (DR)] process is de-
scribed in the Lompoc City Code (Chapter 50, Title 3, Chapter 2, Article 1, Sections
8825-8833). The purpose of the architectural review is to determine a project’s com-
pliance with provisions of the technical codes and development policies of the City and
consistency with the established Architectural Review Guidelines. Additionally, architec-
tural review is intended to promote an aesthetically and environmentally pleasing and
economically viable community. Typically development projects in the mixed use and
Old Town Commercial areas would be subject to the architectural review process. With
the exceptions noted below, applications for architectural review are reviewed by the
City Planner. As noted above, the Architectural Review authority is limited to a review of
the project’s consistency with architectural guidelines and includes review of the build-
ing elevations, site and landscaping plans, and signs. The Planning Commission per-
forms the architectural review on the following: (i) all major projects which are located
on parcels or lots with frontage on Ocean Avenue, Central Avenue, and “H” Street north
of Cypress Avenue; (ii) major commercial and industrial projects on “A” Street north of
Cypress Avenue; (iii) all projects involving the designated landmarks and historical
structures and places referred to in the 1988 City of Lompoc Cultural Resources Study;
and (iv) on any application for architectural review, the City Planner may refer, with or
without recommendation, the project directly to the Planning Commission for
decision.
                          In approving the architecture and design of a project, the City
Planner and Planning Commission will consider the following criteria: (i) protection of
the quality of life of the residents of Lompoc by use of designs that preserve and en-
hance privacy and minimize detrimental conditions such as noise, glare, unattractive
uses, and unsightly elements is required for all projects; (ii) development of residential
neighborhoods to preserve unity of character, unique features, and natural conditions to
advance toward the goal of neighborhoods harmonious with others and of new resi-
dences compatible with existing homes and with the neighborhood; (iii) protection and

preservation, to the extent feasible, views, open space, historically significant sites and
structures and privately owned public art on private property.
                          The City Planner and Planning Commission have the authority to
approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove a project. Other than single-family homes
in R- zones which are not part of a parcel map or subdivision map, all applications for
permits for the construction of any building, structure, or sign in all zone districts, are
required to be reviewed for consistency with the architectural guidelines.
                         The Architectural Review process does not act as a constraint to
the development of affordable housing because: (i) the Architectural Review is used to
guide the development in the City of Lompoc, the guidelines are based on recognized
principles of design, planning, and aesthetics, and they follow written policies that are
published in the City’s “Architectural Review Guidelines” booklet; (ii) the architectural
guidelines explain why the City requires architectural review and what the benefits are,
and provide clear standards which will improve and quicken the architectural review
process; (iii) the City encourages creative design and new ideas in the use of building
Materials; and (v) and innovative construction methods, provided what is proposed
falls within the City’s guidelines; (iv) a stated goal of architectural review is development
that not only is well designed, but also fits in Lompoc, with projects that strike a balance
between the developer’s preference and the public interest; (v) projects which are acted
upon by the City Planner are required by Lompoc City Code to be approved, conditional-
ly approved, or disapproved within ten (10) working days of the date of receipt of a
complete application; (vi) projects which are acted upon by the Planning Commission are
required by Lompoc City Code to be approved, conditionally approved, or disapproved
within thirty (30) working days of the date of receipt of a complete application and after
consideration by the Planning Commission during a regularly scheduled meeting; (vii)
Planning Commission meetings are held at least once a month for regularly scheduled
meetings and more often as determined necessary; (viii) the City’s DR application packet
provides clear direction on submittal requirements and on the process and standards for
review; and (ix) the Architectural Review Guidelines relating to all design and develop-
ment within the City of Lompoc are on file in the office of the City Clerk and are availa-
ble at the Community Development Department public counter.
                         In conclusion, the Architectural Review process does not add sig-
nificant time or delay to the approval of projects.

        10.2     Mobilehome Park Standards
                 A mobilehome, defined by the National Mobile Home Construction Act of
1974, 42 USC Section 5401 et seq.), is a permitted use in the R-1 zone. The mobile-
home in the R-1 zone shall be on a permanent foundation in accordance with California
Health and Safety Code Section 18551.
                 The City also has a designated zone (T) for land for use as a mobilehome
park and mobilehome subdivision. The zone is also for travel trailer parks and recrea-
tional vehicle parks. The T zone development standards for a mobilehome park include
the following: (i) each park must have an area of not less than 10 acres; (ii) seven (7)
mobilehome park spaces are allowed per acre of land within the mobilehome park or
subdivision; (iii) each mobilehome space must be located a minimum 20 feet from an
exterior property line of the mobilehome park when the exterior property line abuts a
public street, a minimum 5 feet from any other portion of exterior property line of the
mobilehome park and a minimum 5 feet from mobilehome to its side lot or space boun-
dary line; (iv) perimeter landscaping must be provided on sides of the mobilehome park
or subdivision abutting a public street; (v) a solid wall or fence six (6) feet high must be
provided on all exterior boundary lines of the mobilehome park or subdivision abutting
a public street; (vi) internal streets must be a minimum of thirty (30) foot wide, surfaced
with 2-1/2 inches of asphalt on four (4) inches of base and rolled curbs four (4) inches
in height; (vii) a minimum storage area equivalent to 100 square feet per mobilehome
space must be provided for storage of boats, campers, camping trailers, utility trailers,
and extra vehicles enclosed with a six (6) foot high chain link fence. (viii) in family parks,
a minimum of 300 square feet of open space must be provided per mobilehome space
up through 100 spaces plus 200 square feet per mobilehome space beginning with the
101 space; (ix) in adult parks, a minimum of 200 square feet of open space must be
provided per mobilehome space; (x) in travel trailer parks and recreation vehicle parks,
a minimum of100 square feet of open space must be provided per travel trailer space or
recreation vehicle space; (xi) on-site parking for the resident of the mobilehome must
be provided in accordance with the residential parking standards included in Table H-57
for multi-family dwellings; and (xii) guest parking must be provided at a ratio of one
additional off-street parking space for each seven (7) mobilehome sites in the park.
        10.3     Building Codes and Enforcement
                 The City has adopted the 2001 California Administrative Code as a stan-
dard for development within the City. The California Administrative Code includes the
California Building Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Plumbing Code, National
Housing Element                         October 19, 2010                             Page 119
CITY OF LOMPOC
2030 GENERAL PLAN
HOUSING ELEMENT
Electric Code, Uniform Housing Code, Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous
Buildings, and Uniform Fire Code. This code has been adopted in order to prevent un-
safe or hazardous building conditions. In some instances the City’s Zoning Ordinance
supersedes the California Administrative Code, however, the changes are minor in na-
ture. As such, the City’s codes are normal and enforcement does not act as a constraint
to the construction or rehabilitation of housing.
                A review of the City’s amendments to the uniform codes indicates they
have no substantial impact on the cost of residential development. Lompoc’s amend-
ments to the State Building Code standards are primarily procedural and administrative,
such as the appeals procedures, flood plain management process, and re-roofing pro-
cedures.
         10.4   On- and Off-Site Improvements
                Lompoc is currently experiencing no capacity limitations with the City’s
water, wastewater, storm drain, and electric utility systems. Development regulations
do, however, require the extension of utilities in order to tie into the City systems, such
as the construction of a sewer trunk line to serve new development; the payment of
charges for installed improvements, such as the installation of electric transformers;
contributions to aid in the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of new
facilities necessitated by new development, such as a retention basin to accommodate
run-off produced by paving.
                Currently, Lompoc Unified School District (LUSD) facilities are operating at
capacity and the fees charged for new construction are not sufficient to build additional
new facilities needed to accommodate projected enrollment increases. All other City-
required improvements are similar to those of surrounding communities, therefore, no
other inordinate constraints have been identified regarding the City’s utility infrastruc-
ture. While the City has adopted Subdivision Standards, many of these requirements do
not apply to infill situations, as would be the case for most of sites identified for high
density residential that address the needs possessed by target income groups. These
areas are already subdivided and fully improved; thus, subdivision level requirements
will not contribute significantly to the cost or supply of housing for target income
groups.

         10.5    Fees and Exactions
                 Land development within the City is subject to fees imposed by the City
to offset future capital expenditures and to accommodate future development or defray
the cost of water treatment, street maintenance, environmental review, development re-
view, permit processing, field inspections, police protection, fire protection, and recrea-
tional activities. The City departments which levy fees include: Public Works, Building,
Community Development, Police, Fire, and Parks and Recreation. Each type of capital
improvement fee that is levied by the City is imposed in relationship to an estimated
future capital expenditure and conforms to the stipulations of AB 1600 legislation. The
size of City permit processing fees collected varies. See Appendix C for detailed infor-
mation on the fees that apply to residential projects. In brief, the fees are assessed
on the basis of the following factors: (i) complexity of application review; (ii) the valua-
tion of the land proposed for development; (iii) the number of acres proposed for devel-
opment; (iv) the number of dwelling units; (v) the valuation of proposed construction
and improvements; (vi) square footage of floor area; and (vii) the number of plumbing
fixtures per unit.
                 The last authoritative study of fees charged throughout Santa Barbara was
performed by the Homebuilders Association of the Central Coast (“HBACC”) in 2000.
Table H-59 provides a comparative analysis of fees derived from the HACC study for
hypothetical single and multiple family projects. Comparatively speaking, development
fees charged by the City of Lompoc are less than the median and considerable below the
average charged for residential dwellings. The difference is more dramatic for multiple
family dwellings with Lompoc charging among the lowest fees Countywide. The same is
holds true for processing fees with Lompoc reportedly the lowest among all jurisdictions
included in the survey.

  “Land Use Entitlement Processing Fees Only,” building permit fees serve as the basis of comparison for Mul-
  tiple Family construction.
          10.6     Permit Processing Procedures
                   All processing time increases the cost of development. The residential
development review process normally begins with the filing of a preliminary map or site
plan for consideration by the Development Review Board and ends with issuance of the
Certificate of Occupancy. There are many steps which may be necessary before the
final development of a housing project can take place. These steps include: plan check,
architectural review, and other forms of approval. Each step requires some form of ad-
ministrative process and various amounts of time.
                   Processing time varies considerably from a few weeks to several months
depending on the complexity of the proposed project and its conformance with the
General Plan and Zoning Ordinance. Projects range from the development of a single
unit on an existing lot with appropriate zoning and land use designations to the an-
nexation or subdivision of land needing numerous improvements, zone changes, and an
environmental impact report (EIR).

                  Architectural Review is conducted by the City Planner or Planning Com-
mission; Conditional Use Permits and Tentative Maps are reviewed by the Planning
Commission; and Variances, Zoning Amendments or Zone Changes, General Plan
Amendments are reviewed by both the Planning Commission and City Council.
                  The City does not have a separate architectural review board or environ-
mental review committee. These reviews are a function of the Planning Commission in
the case of conditional use permits, development plans, and tentative maps and of both
the Planning Commission and City Council in the case of variances, zoning amendments
or zone changes, and General Plan amendments. In an effort to provide complete
preliminary information on a project to an applicant, the City instituted the Development
Review Board (DRB) process in the mid-1980’s. The DRB is comprised of City staff
from the various City departments that have the responsibility for reviewing develop-
ment proposals, drafting Conditions of Approval, and enforcing City requirements and
regulations. The DRB meets regularly at least once or twice a month, or more often on
an as needed basis, as a result of project applications submitted to the City or at the
request of an applicant who wants to get an early indication of a project’s requirements.
Upon submittal of a preliminary site plan or a complete application package for a dis-
cretionary permit, City staff will schedule the project within two weeks of its submittal

tential issues and conditions and can save the applicant time and money in the long

process.
         10.7   Inclusionary Zoning.
                 In 1992, the City of Lompoc adopted a policy that requires all residential
development of ten units or more to provide ten percent of the units affordable to very
low-, low-, and median-income households. In 1997, this policy was amended to re-
quire that projects located within the City’s Old Town Redevelopment Project, Amend-
ment No. 2 area provide 15 percent of new housing affordable to low- and moderate-
income households with at least 40 percent of those units to be reserved for very low-
income households. This action was followed in 2003 with the codification of a formal
Housing In-Lieu Fee Program by adoption of Ordinance 1492(03).
                 With the exception of areas within the Old Town Redevelopment Project,
Amendment No. 2 area, the inclusionary requirement may be satisfied by payment of a
Housing In-Lieu Fee. Within the Old Town Redevelopment Project, Amendment No. 2
area, the affordable obligation may only be satisfied through on-site construction. The
Housing In-Lieu Fees are calculated in their entirety at the time of issuance of the first
building permit for construction of the first dwelling unit in a residential project, appor-
tioned to all units within the project and collected at time of building permit issuance.
The fee amount represents the difference between the total estimated construction cost
of a market rate single-family residence and the price deemed affordable to a low-
income buyer. The fee, if paid, may be used to satisfy all or part of the inclusionary re-
quirement with the remaining portion satisfied through on-site construction of the af-
fordable units. Fees collected are deposited into an Affordable Housing Fund and may
only be used to affirmatively further Housing Element housing goals for target income
groups.
                 While inclusionary requirements may have the potential for constraining
housing development, the City’s policy provides for flexible application. For a project
that is not in the City’s Old Town Redevelopment Project, Amendment No. 2 area, Policy
1.11 allows inclusionary requirements to be satisfied through off-site construction or
payment of in-lieu fees; within the redevelopment area, the more stringent inclusionary
requirement flows from statute (i.e., California Health and Safety Code Section 33413).
The policy further provides that current market prices for housing may be taken into
consideration in fulfilling a portion of the affordability requirement. This is achieved
when the median market price for housing is less than the maximum cost of housing

that is deemed affordable to target income households. The Planning Commission may
find that median income housing opportunities are fulfilling a portion of the require-
ment. In such cases, not less than 5 percent of the total units in the project are to be
affordable to very low-, low-, and median-income households.
                Key indicators that the City’s inclusionary policies do not impede housing
production are comparative statistics on units constructed and vacancy rates (Tables H-
62 and H-63). In the previous Housing Element cycle from 2001 to 2008, Lompoc
ranked second among all Santa Barbara County jurisdictions in the number of new dwel-
lings completed. In regard to vacancies, Lompoc ranked third highest. It is noteworthy
that the jurisdiction which produced the most number of new residential units (Santa
Maria) had a vacancy rate much lower than Lompoc. In general, the lower a vacancy rate
is, the higher the need and demand for housing expansion. Together, these statistics
suggest that Lompoc’s inclusionary policies have had no measurable effect on supply or
demand. It is further noted that none of the sites included in the inventory of land
available to assist in the production of housing for target income households are located
within the Old Town Redevelopment Project, Amendment No. 2, where inclusionary re-
quirements are the most onerous and least flexible (Figure H-6A).

 Note: The City of Goleta was not incorporated until 2002.
                  In the most authoritative case on the question to date, the California
Court of Appeal ruled in favor of the City of Napa, affirming the validity and constitutio-
nality of inclusionary housing requirements (89 Cal. App. 4th 897; 2001 Cal. App. LEXIS
428; 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 60; 2001 Cal. Daily Op. Service 4655; 2001 Daily Journal DAR
5713). A critical factor in the Court’s ruling is the ability of a developer to appeal the
imposition of inclusionary requirements, seeking relief through a reduction, adjustment
or complete waiver. While Policy 1.11 provides various options for satisfying inclusio-
nary requirements (a further consideration in the Napa ruling), appeal provisions that
allow partial or complete relief are included as an Implementation Measure in the

current Housing Element. This is a particularly critical change in that it affords builders
regulatory relief when it can be shown that strict application of inclusionary
requirements would under the economics of a given project. As presently written, such
relief is not currently available.
Policy 1.12, together with Measure III-H. also include actions to lessen the impact of
inclusionary requirements by: (i) deferring inclusionary fee collection until point of sale;
and (ii) offering a 2:1 density bonus for each affordable unit that is constructed on site.
The first of these measures reduces front-end development costs, while the special
density bonus allows cost recovery beyond what State Density Bonus law otherwise
provides. Under California Government Code Section 65915 et.seq., the size of a
density bonus is linked to the number of dwellings and target income group for which
affordable units are earmarked. To receive a 20% density bonus, the minimum
affordable requirement ranges from a low of 5% for very low income to a high of 25% for
moderate income. As illustrated in Table H-63A, the City’s 15% inclusionary
requirement is spread 40% to very low income and the balance to low and moderate.
However, the allocation to low and moderate income does not meet minimum State
density bonus thresholds of 10% and 25%, respectively. Consequently, a housing
developer would only be granted a density increase of 20% for very low income
compared to 31% under the City’s proposed 2:1 density bonus.

         10.8   Availability of Services
                As discussed in Section 8.6.4, the availability of necessary public services
such as water, sewer, electrical, and solid waste disposal to accommodate the additional
housing units within the City are fully discussed within the Public Facilities and Services
Element of the General Plan. General Plan build-out is anticipated for the year 2030.
Information within this element and the General Plan indicates that adequate public ser-
vice capability exists to accommodate the housing units planned for within the Housing
Element.
11.0     Non-Governmental Constraints
         There are a number of financial components involved in the development of
housing. These components include the cost of developable land, construction and site
improvement costs, sales and marketing, and financing and profit. Because these costs
respond to market forces, it is not possible for a local governmental body to control
them.
         11.1   Cost of Developable Land
                As of 2007, Lompoc has approximately 159 acres of vacant developable
land which is either zoned for residential use or which are contained within a zone dis-
trict that allows residential dwellings in combination with commercial uses. Although the
cost of land and housing in Lompoc is reasonable the impending shortage of land will
become a constraint in the future. Based on a residential land sales during 2006 and
reported in the County’s Assessor Parcel Data base, the citywide average fair market
value of a typical acre of unimproved residentially zoned land within the City of Lompoc
is $487,000 per acre. Depending on the density of a project that could be developed on
a particular site, this equates to approximately $48,700 per dwelling unit on average.
         11.2    Construction and Site Improvement Costs
                Although the amount of building materials and labor can be estimated,
the market cost of these development inputs is unpredictable. Building materials are a
market-driven commodity (e.g., lumber) which operate outside the direct influence of
the local governmental body. Transportation costs associated with the materials are also
subject to market forces. Lompoc’s distance from major metropolitan areas can also af-
fect the final cost of materials. Demolition and the subsequent disposal of existing
structures must also be figured into the cost of construction and rehabilitation. Due to

Lompoc’s relative small size, the labor force required for the construction of new hous-
ing units may not be adequately supplied by the City’s population. This may require ex-
tended commutes or the temporary lodging of skilled craftsmen or construction special-
ists, once again adding to the contractor’s overhead.
         11.3    Sales and Marketing
                 The sales and marketing approach which a developer pursues can have
an effect on the selling price of a housing unit. If a developer is concerned with a
prompt return on his/her investment, it may be necessary for advertisement and mar-
keting to a broader market.
         11.4    Financing and Profit
                 Financing costs are dependent upon national economic trends and policy
decisions. Minor fluctuations in interest rates may add or save thousands of dollars to
the buying public on the cost of a home. These fluctuations can also save or add signifi-
cantly to the developer’s final costs. The same market forces that create an appealing
market for development create an appealing market for the home-buying public. Funds
for new construction and residential mortgages are available from banks, savings and
loans, and private mortgage lenders. In combination with readily available financing
sources and reasonably priced real estate, the Lompoc housing market creates no con-
straints to homeownership.
                 The City has not uncovered any local constraints to the availability or cost
of financing for home purchases or rehabilitation that differ significantly from the avail-
ability or cost of financing generally in California. Even in the City’s older neighbor-
hoods, there are no barriers to obtaining financing for home purchase, improvement, or
construction (other than customary underwriting considerations by lenders).
12.0     Special Housing Needs
         During the past and present Houing Element cycle, three laws were adopted that
specifically address the needs possessed by special needs population: (i) Senate Bill 2,
effective January 1, 2008, is directed toward accommodating emergecy shelters and
transitional housing for homeless; (ii) Senate Bill 520 passed during the 2001-02

Housing Element law regarding the accommodation of persons with disabilities; and (iii)

         12.1   Homeless Accommodation (SB 2 Analysis)
                12.1.1 Legislative Overview
                         Senate Bill 2, passed during the 2007-08 California Legislative
Session and effective January 1, 2008, clarifies and strengthens housing element law
regarding the accommodation of emergency shelters and transitional housing. The law
essentially requires an analysis of zoning regulations, development standards and
available land sufficient to: (i) accommodate the need for emergency shelters and at
least one year-round facility; (ii) allow emergency shelters “by right” within at least one
zone district; and (iii) remove regulatory barriers that prevent or otherwise impede the
development of emergency shelters. Homelessness is a Countywide concern and arises
from the lack of affordable housing, increasing numbers of persons whose incomes fall
below the poverty level, reductions in public subsidies to the poor and the deinstitutio-
nalization of the mentally ill. The estimated number of homeless in Lompoc appears in
Table H-37 (i.e., 594 total persons) and is based on a proportional assignment of the
total Countywide homeless with unmet needs. This computation is made for planning
purposes only and does not presuppose that this population segment resides in Lompoc
or requires housing services.
                12.1.2 Baseline Needs
                         As discussed in Section 7.3.6, the City and the Lompoc Valley
community have a long and supportive history in assisting the homeless population.
Facilities and programs currently in operation include: (i) Bridgehouse Homeless Shelter
and Transitional Facility with the capacity to serve 56 clients at any one time; (ii) Marks
House providing 19 transitional beds for up to six homeless families and their children
who can stay up to 90 days; (iii) Domestic Violence Solutions serving up to twelve per-
sons with emergency shelter and counseling for battered women and children; (iv) Cour-
tyard South Apartments providing permanent supportive housing for those individuals
transitioning from Marks House; (v) Catholic Charities providing vouchers for lodging in
local motels, food, clothing and household goods to homeless and “at risk” individuals;
(vi) Lompoc Police Department, in cooperation with the Salvation Army, providing tem-
porary housing and meals; (vii) Transitions Mental Health Drop-In Center providing sup-
portive domestic, health care and referral services for walk-in traffic; and (viii) Good

                  12.1.3 Zoning Provisions
                           At present, emergency shelters are not expressly listed as allowed
uses within any zone district of the City. Instead, the homeless are accommodated
within the parameters of existing use and development regulations (e.g., churches, ex-
tended stay hotels and motels and hospitals). Likewise, transitional and supportive
housing are not expressly defined as residential uses, but are accommodated within the
meaning of care homes and group dwellings that are allowed under present zoning. In
compliance with SB 2, Implementation Measure 2 expressly provides for amendments to
the City’s Zoning Ordinance to: (i) incorporate definitions of emergency shelters, transi-
tional housing and supportive housing consistent with the California Health and Safety
Code; (ii) acknowledge that transitional and supportive housing are considered a resi-
dential use of property subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential
dwellings of the same type in the same zone; (iii) allow emergency shelters by condi-
tional use permit within all zone districts (in addition to the “by right” provisions de-
scribed in Section 12.1.5); and (v) codify objective management and development stan-
dards consistent with the provisions of Government Code Section 65583(a)(4).

                 12.1.4 Capacity Analysis
                         As discussed in Section 8.0, the inventory of land under current
zoning, coupled with the new H Street Infill Overlay, evidences excess capacity to meet
the City’s assigned share of future housing needs, The numeric surplus amounts to 410
for target income groups and 1,446 units overall. This total is well in excess of the
transitional and supportive housing needs identified in Table H-64. In regard to emer-
gency shelters, there is an estimated unmet need of 82 beds. SB 2 expressly encourag-
es the development of shelter facilities in locations proximate to transit, job centers and
community services, free of hazards and inherent land use conflicts. Commercial zone
districts are best suited to meeting this criteria, excluding those which either require
discretionary land use approval (Planned Commercial Development – PDC) or are critical
to meeting the City’s future housing needs (Mixed Use and Old Town Commercial – MU
and OTC). Table H-66 provides an assessment of emergency shelter potential for the
remaining commercial zone districts, utilizing a methodology similar to that used in fo-
recasting future residential development potential (Table H-65). The resulting analysis
reveals a build-out potential of between 954 and 1,439 additional shelter beds. The
upper end of this range reflects the “Maximum Potential” for all parcels based on a de-
velopment intensity of 81 beds per acre of land, This benchmark corresponds to the
intensity of development of the most recently approved transition housing facility in the
City (i.e., Transitions Facility located at 513 North G Street; 39 extended stay units on
0.48 acres of land). The lower number reflects “Forecasted Capacity” based on the ac-
tual intensity of developed parcels within each zone district appearing in Table H-66
utilizing the following formula: Maximum Potential x Valuation Ratio. This lower num-
ber is a more realistic estimate insofar as properties typically do not achieve their full
development potential.
                 12.1.5 Shelter Production
                         SB 2 expressly requires that zoning accommodations be made
that allow for the development of at least one year-round emergency shelter as a per-
mitted use without the requirement for a conditional or discretionary approval. In com-
pliance with this requirement, Implementation Measure 3 provides for the establishment
of an Emergency Shelter Overlay Zone (“ESOZ”) that would apply to all commercially
zoned land with a C-2, C-O or C-C designation. Under the ESOZ, the number of emer-
gency shelter beds allowed “by right” would correspond to the unmet need identified
for Lompoc (“ESB Threshold”). The purpose of the ESOZ, in combination with the ESB
Threshold, is to allow for the development of multiple facilities “by right” rather than

just one large shelter. The initial ESB Threshold will be 82 beds (per Table H-64), and
thereafter, the number may be increased (but not decreased) through the review process
described in Implementation Measure 3. As new emergency shelter facilities allowed by
right are developed within the ESOZ, the resulting number of beds shall be applied
against the total unmet need. Once the unmet need is reduced to zero, the ”by right”
provisions of the ESOZ would be suspended and the following provisions would thereaf-
ter apply: (i) shelter facilities lawfully permitted under the ESOZ would be deemed to be
a conforming use under the City’s Zoning Ordinance following expiration of the ESOZ;
and (ii) shelter facilities would thereafter be allowed by conditional use permit within all
zone districts, including parcels within the ESOZ. Furthermore, if the ESB Threshold has
not been reached but a homeless shelter project is proposed that would exceed ESB
Threshold, the ESB Threshold would be automatically adjusted upward to accommodate
the project “by right.“ The ESOZ would also codify objective management and develop-
ment standards consistent with the provisions of Government Code Section 65583(a)(4).

 Notes:
      1.   In calculating “Maximum Potential,” the Transitions Facility at 513 North G Street is used as a den-
           sity benchmark. This facility was approved by the City in July 2006 and allows for 39 extended
           stay units on 0.48 acres. The resulting calculation is: Acres of Land x (39 Units/0.48 Acres).  
      2.   Forecasted Capacity is based on the actual intensity of developed parcels within each zone district
           utilizing the following formula: Maximum Potential x Valuation Ratio. Vacant Parcels: (i) are those
           with zero improvement value and not otherwise owned by a tax-exempt entity; and (ii) exclude
           parcels that are “Entitled.”  
      3.   Underutilized Parcels: (i) are those having an improvement value of less than 50% of the mean im-
           provement value of all developed properties within each respective zone (Table H-65); and (ii) ex-
           clude parcels that are “Entitled.”  
      4.   Entitled Parcels encompass all projects for which discretionary approvals have been granted but
           not yet constructed. 
      5.   Developed Parcels are those having an improvement value of greater than 50% of the mean value
           of all improved parcels or which are owned by non-profit organizations and classified as devel-
           oped. 
                    12.1.6 Ongoing Needs Assessment
                              The City has an ongoing dialogue with homeless service providers
by which to monitor changes in the depth and breadth of shelter needs: (i) participation
in monthly meetings of the Lompoc Homeless Coalition convened by staff of the County
Board of Supervisors; (ii) participation in quarterly meetings of the Regional Homeless
Advisory Committee composed of membership from local homeless advisory groups
representing Santa Barbara County (Santa Maria, Lompoc, East County (Solvang Buellton,
Santa Ynez), and Santa Barbara regions); (iii) annual reporting of homeless accomplish-
ments in conjunction with awards of Community Development Block Grant funds to
homeless service providers; (iv) annual site visits of each Lompoc emergency shelter by
the City’s Human Services Commission, touring the facilities and discussing usage and

unmet need, if any, with shelter operators; (v) annual review by the Human Services
Commission of funding requests of local emergency shelter providers, with award rec-
ommendations made to the City Council; (vi) participation in Santa Barbara County’s
Continuum of Care, including results of its Point In Time Homeless Survey; and (vii) par-
ticipation in the countywide Winter Warming Shelter Program which reports to local
communities on shelter usage in their respective communities.                 Utilizing information
derived through this ongoing outreach, it proposed that the ESOZ cap be subject to pe-
riodic review and adjustment as described in Implementation Measure 3.
         12.2     Disability Accommodations (SB 520)
                  12.2.1 Legislative Overview
                          Senate Bill 520 passed during the 2001-02 California Legislative
Session and effective January 1, 2002, clarifies and strenthens housing element law
regarding the accommodation of persons with disabilities. The special needs particular
to disabled persons include accessibility for wheelchairs, railings, ramps and adaptive
retrofit of interior living spaces. As also noted in Section 7.3, care educators and care
providers emphasize the need for community assimilation, socialization and accommo-
dations for shared, assisted and independent living arrangements. SB 502 expressly
requires localities to: (i) analyze potential constraints on the development, maintenance
and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities; and (ii) include programs that
remove constraints or provide reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities.
Chapter 671, Table H-66A presents a detailed review of the City’s current land use
regulations along with recommended actions to remove identified constraints. The pa-
ragraphs that follow address principal findings.

                12.2.1 Code Adaptations
                         As earlier noted, the City is subject to the State Uniform Building
Code (“UBC”) that establishes minimum standards for all classes of construction. A
component of the State Building Code are regulations that implement the provisions of
the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). In general, these regulations apply to all
multifamily apartment and condominium buildings that contain three or more dwellings,
along with special occupancy types such as lodging houses, congregate residences,
homeless shelters, dormitories and time share dwellings. For these covered projects, a
variety of accessibility routes and adaptable design features must be incorporated into
all new construction. Examples of adaptable design features include backing for grab
bar installation and removal of base cabinets at the kitchen sink. Such features need
not be installed until requested by an occupant. These requirements, along with all oth-
er State Building Code provisions, are aggressively enforced as part of the plan check
and inspection process.
                12.2.2 Reasonable Accommodations
                         At the request of a person with a disability, a housing provider
must make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services when
these accommodations may be necessary to afford a disabled person equal opportunity
to use and enjoy a dwelling. A housing provider must allow a person with a disability (at
the tenant’s expense) to reasonably modify existing premises if the modifications are
necessary to afford the disabled person full enjoyment of the premises. At present, the
City’s Zoning Ordinance does not distinguish between variances required by virtue of
occupant disabilities and those justified by physical circumstances particular to the
property. The Zoning Ordinance, as presently written, limits variances to the narrow
application of criteria set forth in Section 65906 of the California Government Code.
This traditional variance approach: (i) requires a noticed public hearing before the Plan-
ning Commission; and (ii) limits deviations in development standards to those which are
necessitated by virtue of circumstances particular to the property (rather than the occu-
pant). A new abbreviated procedure, expressly designed to accommodate adaptive re-
trofit requests, is included as Implementation Measure 19, while Measure 23 provides
for the establishment of a streamlined procedure to receive and process reasonable ac-
commodation requests requiring flexible application of zoning, building and subdivision
regulations.

                12.2.3 Group Homes
                        As defined in Section 7006 of the Lompoc Municipal Code, the
term “care home” is defined as the “…care of non-related persons…on a twenty-four
(24) basis…not exceeding six (6) non-related individuals or eight (8) total persons…”.
While the City’s Zoning Ordinance does not make expressed reference to shared living
arrangements for disabled persons, such arrangements are clearly embodied within the
meaning of a care home. So as to clarify intent, the following Zoning Ordinance
amendments are included as Implementation Measure 2: (i) include shared living ar-
rangements as an allowed residential use (within the revised definition of “residential
care home” as discussed in Section 7.4.2), with specific references to supported living
(including In-Home Supportive Services) and licensed community care facilities; and (ii)
acknowledge that occupants are permitted without regard to familial status, disability or
other population segment stipulated in Fair Housing statutes (e.g., individuals with Alz-
heimer’s, AIDS/HIV, and homeless).
        12.3    Extremely Low Income (AB 2634)
                12.3.1 Legislative Overview
                       Assembly Bill 2634, passed during the 2006-07 California Legis-
lative Session and effective January 1, 2007, requires quantification and analysis of
existing and projected housing needs of extremely low-income households (defined as
30 percent of area median and below). As noted in Section 5.0, the needs of extremely
low income are magnified by their limited financial capacity to secure affordable hous-
ing. And while the cost to purchase or rent housing is generally beyond the means of all
target income groups, the affordability gap is far more profound for those with ex-
tremely low incomes (Tables H-34 and H-35). This in turn translates to the need for
non-traditional living arrangements and government-assisted housing (e.g., shared liv-
ing, single room occupancy and public housing), requiring deeper subsidies in combina-
tion with supportive services.
                12.3.2 Baseline Needs
                       Based on census data used by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development in connection with its Comprehensive Housing Affordability
Strategy (“CHAS”) process, 81% of all extremely low income households currently
experience some type of housing problem: overcrowding, substandard conditions or

excessive cost (Table H-67). Most notably, owners and renters paying in excess of 30%
of income toward housing represents 98% of the total need possessed by extremely low
income households. While the number of such households is the least of all income
groups (15%), the overall needs possessed by this target group is by far the most acute
(nearly twice the need possessed by the population at large: 81% vs. 43%). And while
the needs of extremely low income renters is greater than those possessed owner-
occupants, the needs are equally profound (84% of renters are in need compared to 73%
of owners).

                12.3.3 Future Needs
                       In quantifying future needs attributable to extremely low income
households, Section 65583(a)(1) of the California Government Code expressly allows
agencies to presume that 50 percent of the locality’s share of regional housing need as-
signed to very low income households qualify as extremely low income households. As
shown in Table H-68, the statutory tabulation results in 60 extremely low income
households assigned to Lompoc for the planning period of 2007-2014. Adjusting fur-
ther for new construction occurring between 2007 and 2009 results in a net allocation
of 48 units. For the past housing cycle, it is noteworthy that the needs of very low in-
come (of which extremely low income is a subset) have been addressed to a much
greater extent than other target income groups (Table H-71; 22% for very low income

compared to 11% for low income and 16% for moderate). As further noted in Table H-

                   12.3.4 Programmatic Considerations
                            As noted in Section 8.0, the City has considerable development
capacity by which to broaden the supply of housing, simultaneously addressing con-
struction needs possessed by both existing and future households (including those with
extremely low incomes). Table H-41 matches categories of housing types allowed by
current zoning to the particular needs possessed by special population groups. Housing
types of particular relevance to extremely low income households include group dwel-
lings, multifamily dwellings and secondary dwellings. Particularly noteworthy is the fact
that single room occupancy (SRO) is not expressly authorized in the City’s Zoning Or-
dinance. In furtherance of housing opportunities for extremely low income households,
the following Implementing Actions are proposed:
                            •        Program Targeting. Acknowledge this particular popula-
tion segment among the target income households served under the City’s inclusionary
housing policies and partnerships with non-profit housing organizations.
                            •        Single Room Occupancy (SRO). Amend the Zoning Ordin-
ance to add a definition of single room occupancy and allow such use within all com-
mercial zone districts subject to issuance of a Conditional Use Permit.

13.0     Program Resources
         13.1   Federal Programs
                The Federal Government is a major source of funding for assisting in the
production, preservation and improvement of affordable housing. Although not all-
inclusive, the programs described in the paragraphs that follow represent the principal
means of addressing housing needs identified Sections 7.0 and 8.0. By virtue of its eli-
gibility as an entitlement community and its participation in a Countywide consortium of
other eligible jurisdictions, the City is expressly entitled to an annual allocation of CDBG
and HOME funds (described more fully below). The balance of programs described be-
low are discretionary in nature and funding is not assured. For the current Housing
Element cycle from 2007 to 2014, the City anticipates that total of $4.5 million in CDBG
and HOME funds will be available to assist in implementing the programs identified in
Table H-3,
                13.1.1 HUD – Homeownership Opportunities for People Everywhere
(HOPE) Program
                        The purpose of the HOPE program is to provide homeownership
opportunities to lower income families and individuals by providing grantees with Fed-
eral assistance to initially acquire and rehabilitate single-family properties (owned by
Federal, State and local governments) at affordable prices. The program provides both
planning and implementation grants. Eligible activities include identification of eligible
properties, training to develop a homeownership program, administrative costs, archi-
tectural and engineering work, property acquisition, rehabilitation costs, counseling and
training of eligible families, relocation costs of eligible families, temporary relocation
costs of homebuyers during rehabilitation, legal fees, and economic development activi-
ties that promote economic self-sufficiency.
                13.1.2 HUD – Home Investment Partnership Act (HOME)
                        The purpose of HOME is to: expand the supply of safe, sanitary
and affordable housing for low- and very low-income families with emphasis on rental
housing; build state and local capacity to carry out affordable housing programs; and
provide for coordinated assistance to participants in the development of affordable low-
income housing. Eligible activities for funding under HOME are rehabilitation, new con-

struction, acquisition, and tenant based rental assistance. There are matching fund re-
quirements of 25% for both new construction and for substantial rehabilitation. HOME
funds used in conjunction with rental units must comply with the following require-
ments: (i) 90 percent of funds must be allocated to families whose income does not ex-
ceed 60 percent of the Santa Barbara County median income; (ii) the remaining funds
must be allocated to families whose income does not exceed 80 percent of the Santa
Barbara County median income; and (iii) for properties with five or more HOME-assisted
units, at least 20 percent of the units must go to very low-income families paying no
more than 30 percent of their gross adjusted income on housing costs.
                        HOME funds used to facilitate homeownership must go entirely to:
families earning less than 80 percent of the Santa Barbara County median income; who
are first time homebuyers; and, who will utilize the unit as their principal residence.
                13.1.3 HUD – Section 8 Program
                        This program makes certificate and voucher funds available to lo-
cal housing authorities on a competitive allocation basis. Through this program, the
Housing Authority provides rental subsidy payments directly to private property owners
on behalf of eligible tenants. Section 8 assistance provides the difference between one-
third of a household income and the monthly cost of an apartment up to a certain stan-
dard price (set regionally and according to the number of bedrooms).
                13.1.4 HUD – Section 202 Program
                        The program provides funding to expand the supply of housing
with supportive services for elderly persons. The types of financing available are capital
advances and project rental assistance. The capital advances (bearing no interest) are
used to finance the development of units and are not required to be repaid as long as
the housing units remain available for occupancy by very low-income elderly persons for
a period of at least 40 years. Project rental assistance is available to cover the difference
between HUD-approved operating costs per unit and the amount the resident pays. Eli-
gible development methods are new construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition of
housing from the Resolution Trust Corporation. Occupancy of Section 202 housing is
open to very low-income elderly persons 62 years of age or older.

                13.1.5 HUD – Section 811 Program
                         The program provides funding to expand the supply of specially
designed housing with supportive services for persons with disabilities. The types of fi-
nancing available are capital advances and project rental assistance. The capital ad-
vances (bearing no interest) are used to finance the development of units and are not
required to be repaid as long as the housing units remain available for occupancy by
very low-income disabled persons for a period of at least 40 years. Project rental assis-
tance is available to cover the difference between HUD-approved operating cost per unit
and 30 per cent of the resident’s adjusted income. Eligible development methods are
new construction, rehabilitation, acquisition of housing for group homes, and acquisi-
tion of housing from the Resolution Trust Corporation for group homes and indepen-
dent living facilities. Occupancy of Section 811 housing is open to very low-income per-
sons with disabilities who are at least 18 years old. A variety of housing options may be
developed under this program including:
                         •      Group Homes – a single family residential structure for no
more than eight persons with disabilities combining multiple bedrooms (single or
double occupancy) with a kitchen, shared living areas, utility areas, and at least one
bathroom for every four persons;
                         •      Independent Living Facilities – a structure containing sepa-
rate, self-contained units (each must have a kitchen and bath) for not more than 24
persons with disabilities except for projects for persons with chronic mental illness
which may not exceed 20 such persons; and
                         •      Intermediate Care Facilities – a group home for persons
with developmental disabilities that is licensed by the State Medicaid Agency and rece-
ives Title 19 funds to cover the cost of services.

Section 202 rental housing assistance (S+C/202). However, the most applicable
component for Lompoc’s homeless needs would be S+C/202. This program component
provides assistance in connection with rental assistance under Section 202 of the Hous-
ing Act of 1959. Rental assistance is for a period of five years for housing in group
homes or independent living units.
                 13.1.7 HUD – Emergency Shelter Program
                        This program provides grants according to the formula used for
Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). Eligible activities include renovation, ma-
jor rehabilitation, or conversion of buildings for use as emergency shelters for the
homeless. With certain limitations, grantees may also spend funds on essential service
for the homeless, including homeless prevention efforts. In addition, grantees may
spend funds on operating costs such as maintenance, insurance, utilities, and furnish-
ings.
                 13.1.8 Community Development Block Grants (CDBG)
                        The program provides annual grants on a formula basis to entitled
cities and counties to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing
and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunity, principally
for low- and moderate-income persons. Entitlement communities develop their own
programs and funding priorities. However, grantees must give maximum feasible priori-
ty to activities which either benefit low- and moderate-income persons, or aid in the
prevention or elimination of slums and blight. In addition, activities may be carried out
which the community certifies are designed to meet other community development
needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and im-
mediate threat to the health or welfare of the community where other financial re-
sources are not available to meet such needs.
                        Activities that can be carried out with block grant funds include
the acquisition of real property, relocation and demolition, rehabilitation of residential
and nonresidential structures, construction of public facilities and improvements, his-
toric preservation and the conversion of schools for eligible purposes. In addition CDBG
funds may be used to pay for public services and activities relating to energy conserva-
tion.

                   The State Department of Housing and Community Development (“HCD”)
and California Housing Finance Agency (“CalHFA”) together administer more than 25
programs that award loans and grants for the construction, acquisition, rehabilitation
and preservation of affordable rental and ownership housing, homeless shelters and
transitional housing, public facilities and infrastructure, and the development of jobs for

        13.3.    Local Programs.
                  13.3.1 Density Bonus Ordinance
                          As an inducement to produce housing that is affordable to target
income groups, California state law requires cities and counties to provide density bo-
nuses to housing developments that propose qualifying percentages of affordable units.
In compliance with this mandate, Lompoc adopted a density bonus ordinance in 1997
that incorporates all of the elements stipulated by law in effect at the time of adoption.
Since that time, Senate Bill 1818 was passed and became effective on January 1, 2005,
that significantly broadens and strenthens density bonus requirements. Previously,
communities were required to grant density bonuses of at least twenty-five percent
(25%) for projects that provide prescribed percentage of housing for seniors and
persons of low and very low income. Senate Bill 1818 broadened this requirement to
include condominiums for moderate income persons and increased the density bonus
requirement to a maximum of thirty-five percent (35%). The new law also increased the
obligations of local government to provide other incentivies in the form of reduced
parking requirements and modified development standards. In order to conform the
City’s current density bonus provisions with recent changes in State law, corresponding
modifications to the Lompoc Zoning Ordinance are included as an Implementation
Measure in the current Housing Element.
                 13.3.2 Second Units
                          A second unit is an additional self-contained living unit, attached
to the primary residential unit on a single lot. It has cooking, eating, sleeping, and full
sanitation facilities. It is also known as a “granny flat”, “in-law unit”, or an “accessory
dwelling.” State law permits second units and establishes minimum standards for their
development. The City has adopted a second unit ordinance which conformed to State
law at the time of its codification into the Lompoc Zoning Ordinance. Since then,
Assembly Bill 1866 was passed and became effective on January 1, 2003, that
significantly broadens and strenthens second dwelling requirements. In particular, the
Housing Element                              October 19, 2010                                Page 147

new law requires that second units be granted “by right” as a ministerial land use action.
The City’s existing ordinance, on the other hand, requires issuance of a Conditional Use
Permit for second dwellings within the R-1 Single-Family Residential Zone District. In
order to conform the City’s current second unit provisions with recent changes in State
law, corresponding modifications to the Lompoc Zoning Ordinance are included as an
Implementation Measure in the current Housing Element.
                 13.3.3 Inclusionary Zoning.
                        As noted in Section 10.7, the City of Lompoc has adopted inclu-
sionary policies that require affordable housing as part of all new residential develop-
ment in an amount ranging between five and fifteen percent, depending on location and
market conditions. For the first ten years of the inclusionary program, most developers
satisfied their inclusionary requirements through on-site construction as part of each
project. Beginning in 2003, the City’s codified a Housing In-Lieu Fee Program that per-
mits developers to make payments to the City’s Housing Trust Fund in lieu of construc-
tion for projects located outside of the City’s Old Town Redevelopment Project, Amend-
ment No. 2 area. Payments deposited to the Housing Trust Fund are irrevocably com-
mitted to affirmatively furthering the expansion, improvement and preservation of af-
fordable housing throughout the City.
                 13.3.4 Redevelopment Program.
                        The Old Town Redevelopment Project Area was established by Or-
dinance No. 1213(84) on November 20, 1984. The Redevelopment Plan was subse-
quently amended in 1998 and again in 2002, expanding the boundaries of the original
Project Area to its present size of 1,080 acres. State law requires that redevelopment
agencies setaside no less than 20% of all tax increment revenue derived within designat-
ed project areas for activities that increase, improve or preserve the supply of housing
affordable to persons of low and moderate income. Such funds may be used to finance
home purchases, housing rehabilitation and new construction in neighborhoods inside
or outside the Project Area. The estimated amount of redevelopment setaside poten-
tially available to assist in the production, preservation and improvement of affordable
housing during the Housing Element cycle between 2007 and 2014 is estimated to
be$4.45 million . In addition, 15% of all new privately developed housing and 30% of
Agency-assisted housing within the Project Area must be made affordable to persons
and families of low and moderate income. This particular requirement is reflected in
Policies 1.11 and 1.12.

2030 GENERAL PLAN
HOUSING ELEMENT
                        Beginning in 1994, and each five years thereafter, every redeve-
lopment agency is required to adopt an Implementation Plan that: outlines the agency’s
goals and objectives for each project area; describes programs, potential projects and
estimated expenditures over the next five years; explains how these activities will aid in
the elimination of blight; and addresses needs for new affordable housing and replace-
ment of units lost due to redevelopment. During its most recent Implementation Plan
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, the Old Town Redevelopment Project affirma-
tively furthered affordable housing in the following ways:
                               •       The Agency was awarded an additional $750,000 in
Loan funds from the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) Help Program in 2003.
                               •       The Agency funded a low interest loan assisting 12
units of affordable housing located at 434-438 N. “L” Street.
                               •       Set Aside funds were awarded to Habitat for Hu-
manity in the amount of $20,000 to facilitate the creation of two low-income family
units.
                               •       The Agency funded a $105,000 predevelopment
loan to LHCDC to assist a new construction homeownership project that will consist of
five (5) units on the 500 block of “T” Street.
                               •       The Agency completed two affordable homes with
Habitat for Humanity. The original loan for $20,000 to Habitat for Humanity was split
between the new very low-income families who purchased these homes; each owner as-
sumed a $10,000 lien against their home and a 45-year covenant was recorded on each
unit. The loans remain at 0% interest and will be forgivable at the end of the covenant
term.
                               •       Lompoc Housing and Community Development
Corporation (LHCDC) completed the rehabilitation of the Casa con Tres apartment com-
plex located at 434-438 North “L” Street. This project provided 12 very low-income
housing opportunities for large families in the project area.
                               •       The Agency funded $15,000 to the Lompoc Police
Activities League (PAL) to assist in operational cost for a youth program that provides a
computer training class to youth at local area schools along with outreach to local at-
risk youth, and will continue to fund this program over the next several years.

                                 •       The Agency allocated $150,000 for a multifamily

                         Major legislation adopted in 2002 (AB 637, SB 701 and SB 711)
encourages the integration of General Plan and Housing Element policies with those of
the redevelopment Implementation Plan, Coincidentally, the term of the next Imple-
mentation Plan will cover the period of January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2013,
which corresponds to the planning horizon of the current Housing Element. In further-
ance of legislative initiatives to foster integrative housing policies and programs,
corresponding modifications to the next Implementation Plan are included as an
Implementation Measure in the current Housing Element.
14.0    Equal Housing Opportunity
        Fair Housing Act information is published on posters and in a brochure that is
made available to the City by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The brochure is published and is available in both English and Spanish. The posters and
brochures are prominently displayed in City Hall, the Lompoc Public Library, the Ander-
son Recreation Center, the Lompoc Valley Community Center, and the Legal Aid Foun-
dation Office. Additionally, whenever the Code Enforcement Officer responds to a
tenant- landlord complaint, the Code Enforcement Officer will make a field visit to the
property and during the inspection the Fair Housing Act brochure is given to the tenants
of the property.
        The City of Lompoc contracts with the Legal Aid Foundation (LAF) to provide fair
housing services in the City. Contract services with LAF include educating the public in
fair housing practices and testing the local market to verify compliance with fair housing

laws regarding instances of discrimination based on race, religion, ethnicity, gender
preference, marital status, and size and makeup of family.
        The LAF maintains an office in Lompoc at 106 South C Street, Suite A, Lompoc,
CA 93436, (805) 736-6582. LAF is open from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through
Thursday. LAF information is posted at the public counter in the Community Develop-
ment Department office at City Hall. The LAF office is located across the street to the
east of City Hall.
        Legal Aid made two community presentations in the past 13 months, one for the
general public and one for landlords and property managers. An LAF attorney presented
an educational program in September of last year on the Lompoc Police Beat TV Program
on the local cable station. A second LAF attorney presented an educational program at
the North Santa Barbara County Rental Property Owners and Managers breakfast
meeting in May 2003 in the Lompoc Police Department conference room. The attorney
discussed Fair Housing rules and regulations, provided handouts, considered
hypothetical situations, and answered questions. Twenty-six people were in attendance.
        The LAF conducted Fair Housing testing in June 2003 at five realty/apartment
management office sites in Lompoc. The testing involved trained volunteers to verify
compliance with the Federal Fair Housing law. The tests, so far, have shown that, overall,
no overt signs of discrimination were exhibited.
        During the 2002-2003 fiscal year, in the course of its everyday operations, the
Lompoc office of LAF has interviewed, either by phone or in person, 139 clients who had
landlord/tenant issues. The majority of these cases involved evictions, the remainder of
these cases were concerned with lack of or improper repairs, disagreements regarding
amounts of refunds on security deposits and habitability issues, such as infestation,
leaky roofs, unsafe gas water heaters and furnaces, mold, mildew on walls and floors,
and non-functioning plumbing. Habitability is a frequent issue in the Unlawful Detainer
(Eviction) cases that come through the Lompoc office of the LAF.
        In addition, residential projects in the Lompoc Redevelopment Agency Project
Area are required to submit a marketing plan illustrating how the developer of the
project will comply with fair housing opportunities.
        Also, application packets for single family and multi-family housing rehabilita-
tion loans contain a “Fair Lending Notice” notifying applicants of the fair housing dis-

the rehabilitation loan.
       Lastly, local newspaper advertising for the City’s rehabilitation loans and the

15.0   Energy Conservation
       The Government Code requirements (Section 65583) for housing elements re-
quire an analysis of opportunities for energy conservation in regard to residential devel-
opment.
       With respect to housing, energy is consumed both during and after the construc-
tion phase, both on-site and off-site. Examples of off-site energy consumption include:
increased demand at power generation facilities and increased petroleum consumption
associated with vehicular traffic (to and from the residence) both during and after
construction. The primary form of energy consumed during the construction phase is
petroleum energy used by earthmoving and construction equipment. The greatest
amount of energy consumed, however, is after construction in the use of natural gas
and electricity to heat, cool, light, and otherwise maintain the individual homes once
they are built.
       Many opportunities exist for energy conservation in housing design. Structural
orientation, shape, exposure, patterns, windows, wall and roof characteristics, color,
texture, and reflective and absorptive surfaces are just a few of the relevant considera-
tions. Mechanical systems may be used to supplement these design considerations
when environmental considerations are severe enough to exceed the capacity of the de-
signed envelope to handle them. In other words, air conditioning should not be used as
a substitute for proper building design and construction.
       Attached dwellings are more energy efficient per unit than are an equivalent
number of single-family detached-units, due to the decreased wall and surface area be-
ing exposed to heat loss during the winter and heat absorption during the summer. Be-
sides dwelling unit type, some energy-reducing measures are possible for Lompoc
through better design and more environmentally sound project orientation. Such meas-
ures could also include:
                •       The use of solar water heating systems.

HOUSING ELEMENT
               •        Insulation throughout a unit, including insulated glass and insu-
lated hot water lines.
               •        Design and orientation of the structures. In Lompoc, heavy sun
radiation loads will act most decisively on the roof and on the eastern and western ex-
posures during the summer. Eastern and western walls are exposed to the sun for long-
er periods and with greater intensity than a south wall, which intercepts solar rays at
less direct angles. South exposures permit more significant heat gains during the winter
(low sun) and less during the summer (high sun). Openings in the east and west walls
are subject to direct radiation loads year-round. Thus, buildings in Lompoc are general-
ly best developed with the long axis on the structure and major window openings facing
south and reduced east/west exposure.
               •        Where ideal orientation of the structure is not feasible, the use of
overhangs, movable external shading on windows (to deflect sunlight or allow it to en-
ter), and heat-reflective glass, particularly on east and west exposures, can moderate
seasonal increases in temperature. It should be noted that reflective and/or absorbing
glass is unnecessary on north to northwest-facing windows; and that clear glass is best
for south-facing windows.
               •        The use of appropriate and well-placed landscaping and reduced
paving areas to moderate temperature and decrease wind velocity; for example, deci-
duous trees located on the south and west provide shade during the summer, yet allow
light and heat to enter during the winter months.
               •        The project designs which encourage walking and bicycle riding.
For example, mid-block bicycle and pedestrian easements are a design possibility.
16.0    At Risk Units
        16.1 Assisted Housing
                Housing element law requires that localities identify and develop a pro-
gram in their housing elements for the preservation of assisted, affordable multi-family
units including units developed pursuant to inclusionary housing and density bonus
programs. In the preservation analysis, localities are required to provide an inventory of
assisted, affordable units that are eligible to convert to market-rate housing within the
five-year planning period of the housing element and the subsequent five-year period
following the planning period. As part of the analysis, an estimation of the cost of pre-

serving versus replacing the units is to be included, as well as programs designed to
preserve the affordable units.
                16.1.1 Inventory of Assisted Housing
                        The inventory of assisted units includes a review of all multi-
family rental units under federal, state and/or local programs, including HUD programs,
state and local bond programs, redevelopment programs, and local in-lieu fees (inclu-
sionary, density bonus, or direct assistance programs). The inventory also covers all
units that are eligible for change to non-low-income housing units because of termina-
tion of subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions.
                        As noted in Table H-68 and described below, there are three as-
sisted housing development within the City in which affordability controls are due to
expire during the five-year planning period of this Housing Element.
                               •       Rainbow Plaza. Rainbow Plaza is located at 220
West Pine Avenue and contains a total of 31 assisted units (27 one bedroom and 4 two
bedroom units). This project is funded by HUD and is managed by a property manage-
ment company. These units were required to be set-aside for occupancy by low-income
individuals who are handicapped, disabled, or elderly (age 62 or older). Federal Prefe-
rence Guidelines allow persons about to lose their homes or those living in substandard
housing, who meet the other qualifying criteria, to have preference on the waiting list.
Although the original Section 8 contract expired in 2001, the contract was renewed in
that same year for a one-year period. In 2002, the contract expired but was subse-
quently renewed for a five-year period and was again renewed in 2007. The contract will
expire again in 2012 but the risk of conversion is low. Each contract is subject to annual
review by Congress. Five years is the maximum renewal period allowed by Congress.
                               •       Laurel Springs Apartments. Laurel Springs Apart-
ments is an assisted housing development in which affordability controls are due to ex-
pire during the time horizon of the current Housing Element. Laurel Springs Apartments
(88 two bedroom units and 6 three bedroom units) currently contain 19 assisted units.
These units were required to be set aside for occupancy by low- and moderate-income
households. These units are affordability restricted until 2010.
                               •       Parkside Apartments. Parkside Apartments is an
assisted housing development in which affordability controls for low and very low-
income households initially applied to 18 of the 48 total dwellings. The Housing Author-

ity of Santa Barbara County (HASBC) has recently acquired the project and extended af-
fordability to all 48 units. The duration affordability is tied to the duration of HASBC
ownership.
                  16.1.2 Conservation of Assisted Housing
                           The cost of conserving the assisted units is estimated to be sig-
nificantly less than that required to replace the units through new construction. Conser-
vation of assisted units generally requires subsidizing the difference between market-
rate and assisted rents. Since land prices and land availability are generally the limiting
factors to development of low-income housing, it is estimated that subsidizing rents to
preserve assisted housing is more feasible and economical than new construction.
                            Based on the recorded value of similar multi-family properties
that were sold in the City of Lompoc during 2006, the acquisition cost per unit is ap-
proximately $98,570. At this price, the combined acquisition cost of the 64 multi-family
units at Rainbow Plaza, Laurel Springs Apartments and Parkside Apartments would be
approximately $6.3 million excluding closing costs and property repair costs that may
be necessary. By comparison, the estimated cost to develop a similar number of new
units (one, two, and three bedroom units) would be approximately $205,000 per dwel-
ling unit3. At this cost per unit, the total cost to replace 64 units would be 13.1 million.
                  16.1.2 Preservation of Assisted Housing
                           Housing element law also requires that localities identify local
public agencies, public or private non-profit corporations, and for-profit organizations
with the legal and managerial capacity to acquire and manage at-risk projects resulting
in the preservation of at-risk units.
                           Preserving at-risk units can be accomplished through purchase or
management of the project by a non-profit organization. This preservation method
would eliminate the costs associated with new construction of comparable housing and
would eliminate displacement of households while the units are constructed.
                           The City currently works with several non-profit community-
based service organizations to provide affordable housing in Lompoc. These organiza-

proformas for multifamily residential projects on the Central Coast; most notably, Houweling Nursery Expan-
sion (Ventura County, 2007); Paseo Santa Clara (Oxnard 2007) and Villa Cesar Chavez (Oxnard 2006).

tions include LHCDC , SBHAC and Habitat for Humanity of Northern Santa Barbara Coun-
ty. LHCDC is a certified Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO and is in
the process of becoming a Community Based Development Organization (CBDO). The
City has provided loan funds to these organizations to acquire, rehabilitation and devel-
op affordable housing. In addition, the City and RDA jointly facilitated the acquisition of
Jay Apartments (26 units for very low income) with a combination of Federal and local
funds to extend the duration of affordability through 2032. .
                16.1.3 Financing and Subsidy Resources for Assisted Housing
                        As noted in the preceding paragraphs, two types of resources
used in efforts to preserve affordable units at risk of conversion to market rate in the
City of Lompoc are non-profit organizations that can acquire and manage assisted units
with City funding.
                        Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding, California
Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA), Redevelopment (RDA) set-aside funds, and Federal
HOME funds are the primary sources of potential funding for preservation efforts. CDBG
funds are used to provide community facilities, services, and residential acquisition and
rehabilitation programs, as well as economic development programs in low- and
moderate-income areas. CalHFA and Redevelopment set-aside funds and Federal
HOME funds provide a variety of housing financing opportunities including residential
acquisition and rehabilitation programs.
                        Since the year 2000 to present, the City of Lompoc appropriated
$3.5 million in CDBG, CHFA, RDA housing set-aside, and HOME funds toward acquisi-
tion of affordable housing units. These funds assisted a total of 141 units that are cur-
rently or will be affordable to very low- and low-income families. These same financing
and subsidy resources are available for the preservation of at-risk units.
                        As noted in Policy 1.14, the City will monitor previous and new
commitments for very low-, low-, and moderate-income publicly assisted housing
through quarterly reports published by the City’s Community Development Department.
These reports will be generated from a database that has been established for tracking
assisted projects. In addition to the funding sources used in the past (i.e., CDBG, CHFA,
RDA housing set-aside, and HOME), the City will investigate other available funding
sources from programs such as the California Multifamily Housing Program and HUD’s
Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring program, and will work with
property owners and non-profit organizations to acquire these units.

17.0        Jobs-Housing Balance
            Achieving an ideal geographic relationship between the provision of jobs and
housing can produce a myriad of measurable and perceived benefits including reduced
congestion, improved air quality, more efficient utilization of resources and enhanced
quality of life. Achieving such a balance requires a match not only in quantity of jobs
and housing but also in quality (relative to income and cost). Available data does not
allow for an in-depth analysis but does lend insight into the subject. As shown in Table
H-69, Lompoc has the closest “steady-state” relative to the number of local jobs and
total dwelling units. By SBCAG’s own standards, a ratio within the range of 0.75 to 1.25
evidences a job-housing balance.4 Only Lompoc and Guadalupe meet this benchmark.
This finding influenced the “weighting” of variables that SBCAG used allocating RHNA
goals for the current housing cycle. The result is a more equitable apportionment of
future housing needs compared to a heavier emphasis on housing and population fore-
casts used in the past.

18.0     Past Performance
         18.1     Background. As part of the update process, communities are required to
assess the achievements realized under their current adopted Housing Element. The
analysis is both quantitative and qualitative relative to specific numeric goals and de-
fined actions set forth in the Element. Significant deviations between policy objectives
and actual results lend insight into crafting policies and programs for the future. For
Lompoc, the existing adopted Housing Element contains both qualitative and quantita-
tive measures; relevant programs are summarized in Table H-70 while housing produc-

these groups. For purposes of the Housing Element, there are four household income
group categories that are the focus of needs assessment and program delivery: ex-
tremely low, very low, low and moderate-income. Income limits that define these cate-
gories are published annually by HCD and follow (although not precisely) the following
formulas: extremely low-income households are households with incomes less than 30
percent of the area median income; very low-income households are households with
incomes between 30 and 50 percent of the area median income; low-income house-
holds are households with incomes between 51 and 80 percent of the county median
income; and moderate-income households are households with incomes between 81
and 120 percent of the county median income.

L AND USE E LEMENT
I NTRODUCTION AND AUTHORITY
The Land Use Element is a mandatory element of the General Plan. Section 65302(a) of the
Government Code states that the Land Use Element must designate “the proposed general
distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business,
industry, open space, including agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of
scenic beauty, education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities,
and other categories of public and private uses of land. The Land Use Element shall include a
statement of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended for the
various districts and other territory covered by the plan.”
The Land Use Element of the General Plan establishes Lompoc’s vision and fundamental land
use philosophy, including directing development to the most suitable locations, and maintaining
the environmental, social, physical, economic and public health and vitality of the area. The
element therefore focuses on the organization of the community's physical environment into
logical, functional, and visually pleasing patterns that are consistent with local social values. Of
primary concern are the type, intensity, location, and character of land uses that will be permitted
in the future.
Lompoc’s land use pattern is well established with major changes to the overall land use pattern
not anticipated in this planning period. Future growth will primarily consist of infill development,
some build-out of areas at the outer portion of the urban boundary, minor extension of rural
residential development, and additional recreational land uses at the edge of the urban area.
Nevertheless, as development occurs, the City will continue to face significant challenges.
Lompoc’s natural setting, green space and significant environmental features need to be
protected and preserved, and at the same time, private property rights must be recognized and
respected.
The overall intent of the Land Use Element is to:
                 Direct the amount and location of land uses in conformance with forecasted
                  growth needs, environmental carrying capacities, and the other goals of the
                  General Plan.
                 Within the constraints of these carrying capacities, provide a distribution of land
                  uses that maintains, yet also enhances the environmental, social, physical, and
                  economic well-being of Lompoc.
Specific goals, policies, implementation measures, and definitions of the Land Use Element
comprise the balance of this element.
                                                                                       CITY of LOMPOC

Policies
  Policy 1.1   The General Plan Land Use map in Figure LU-1 is hereby adopted. The General
               Plan Land Use map establishes the future distribution, extent, and geographic
               locations of the various land uses within the City of Lompoc. The standards
               applicable to each of the various use categories are set forth in Table LU-1
               below.
  Policy 1.2   The City shall maintain a compact urban form by delineating an Urban Limit Line
               which establishes the ultimate edge of urban development within the City. Refer
               to Table LU-1 for additional information on the Urban Limit Line.
  Policy 1.3   The City shall encourage development of under-developed and vacant land

  Policy 1.4   The City shall encourage Santa Barbara County and the Local Agency Formation
               Commission to plan urbanization within municipalities in order to protect prime
               agricultural land outside the Urban Limit Line and to efficiently utilize public
               infrastructure.
  Policy 1.5   The City’s Sphere of Influence is depicted on the Land Use Element Map. The
               Sphere of Influence delineates the probable ultimate physical boundaries and
               service area of the City. Refer to Table LU-1 for additional information on the
               Sphere of Influence.
  Policy 1.6   Areas identified by the City for potential annexation are depicted on Figure LU-1
               as areas where the Urban Limit Line exceeds the City Limit Line. These lands
               include:
                         •   Expansion Area A: the Bailey Area Specific Plan Area
                         •   Expansion Area B: the River Area
                         •   Expansion Area C: the Miguelito Canyon Area
                         •   Expansion Area D: the Wye Residential Area
Policy 1.7     The City shall encourage infill development to meet City residential and
               commercial growth needs. The City designates the H Street Corridor Infill area as
               particularly suitable to infill development and shall prescribe specific design,
               zoning standards and architectural standards for this corridor. Additional
               information on the intent of the H Street Corridor Infill area is provided in Table
               LU-1.

Overlay Designations
HSC                           Purpose
H Street Corridor Infill Area To encourage development of vacant or underutilized properties along the H
                              Street Corridor to improve the aesthetics of the area and create an
                              economically vibrant and socially inviting environment. The intent is to
                              provide a combination of economic incentives and policy support for the
                              revitalization of this area and for a more efficient, attractive, and pedestrian-
                              friendly built environment. Another intent is to direct additional commercial
                              and residential mixed uses into this corridor in keeping with economic
                              development and urban infill goals and policies while providing enhanced
                              opportunities for development that incorporates smart growth principals.
                              A common feature in the evolution of communities of all sizes, infill refers to
                              the incremental addition of new, renovated or adapted buildings within
                              existing developed areas. Also older shopping centers and strip commercial
                              areas that have failed provide an opportunity for land recycling. The benefits
                              of infill housing include more efficient use of land, infrastructure and services;
                              increased diversity of housing types especially smaller, more affordable units;
                              and reduced pressure to develop previously unsettled areas that offer
                              important ecological and/or recreational values.

                              The H Street corridor provides the greatest opportunity for key infill projects in
                              Lompoc. Large vacant and underutilized parcels have the potential to
                              generate retail, office, and housing in mixed-use style developments along
                              the corridor.
                              Areas which provide a harmonious intermingling of pedestrian-oriented uses

                              bicycles, and pedestrians alike. Vehicular parking is typically provided on-site
                              with single-level and multi-level parking areas while still adhering to aesthetic
                              considerations and design principles that invite pedestrians and bicyclists.
                              Appropriate uses include retail shops; restaurants, hotels, business services;
                              residential units; medical offices; and public and quasi-public uses of a

 DU = Dwelling Unit. The DU/net acre describes the number of DU’s permitted on an acre of land less the area required
for streets and public right-of-way. The densities identified for the VLDR and LDR categories represent the maximum
allowable densities in the respective areas. No minimum density is intended to apply to these categories. Densities which
are less than those designated may be appropriate in some areas due to hazards, resources, or the need to achieve land
use compatibility. In the MDR and HDR categories, the range sets forth both a minimum and a maximum allowable
density in order to ensure a sufficient land supply.
FAR = Floor Area Ratio. The FAR indicates the maximum intensity of development of a parcel. The FAR is expressed as
the ratio of building space to land area. For the purposes of this document, building space is defined as enclosed gross
leasable space.
 Average population density indicates the expected number of persons per net acre living within residential areas. It is
calculated by multiplying the maximum allowable dwelling units per net acre by the average citywide household size (2.88
according to 2000 census).

Infill Development Implementation Measures
Measure 19    The City should identify the market forces that attract the development
              community to infill areas through preparation of an economic analysis.
Measure 20    The City should revise City plans and ordinances to support infill development
              goals.
Measure 21    The City should develop an overlay district for infill properties along H Street.
              Work with Council to refine/define infill overlay boundaries.
Measure 22    The City should develop a results oriented plan to revitalize H Street. This can
              be accomplished through preparation of a specific plan, corridor plan, or strategic
              plan.
Measure 23    The City should develop strategies to improve the urban form of the H Street
              Corridor. Require new development to place buildings adjacent to H Street with
              parking areas behind.
Measure 24    The City should develop incentives to promote quality in-fill and explore other
              ways Lompoc can assist in providing compatible in-fill development. Sample
              incentives include:
                       a. Allow the residential component of a project to be developed first in
                           order to create customers for the retail component.
                       b. Relax parking requirements for infill projects in the Old Town and
                           along H Street in order to attract investment. This incentive can be
                           tied to a ‘sunset’ in order to encourage immediate investment.
                       c. Allow on-street parking to count toward the project’s parking
                           requirement.
                       d. Provide density bonuses for projects that include senior housing or
                           workforce housing.
Measure 25    The City should identify the circumstances where single use or mixed-use
              projects must be sensitive to the character and scale of surrounding
              neighborhoods.
Measure 26    The City should use landscape techniques such as buffers, building scale, and
              other features to provide a soft edge transition to existing development for both
              residential and non-residential in-fill projects.
Measure 27    The City shall solicit input from area residents, property owners, and
              organizations in the review of infill projects to ensure environmental, social,

NOISE ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION AND AUTHORITY
The purpose of the Noise Element is to limit the exposure of the community to excessive noise levels. The
Noise Element is to be used to guide decisions concerning land use and the location of common sources of
excessive noise levels. To that end, the Noise Element identifies and addresses noise sources and
establishes projected noise levels for significant noise generators.
The Noise Element also establishes goals, policies and implementation measures to alleviate issues
associated with excessive noise within the City of Lompoc, including mobile, stationary, and nuisance
noise sources. These goals, policies, and standards promote an appropriate pattern of land uses and help to
ensure that the various sources of noise pollution do not compromise the community’s goal of preserving
the city’s quiet and peaceful environment.
Sound Measurement, Metrics, and Propagation
Noise level (or volume) is generally measured in decibels (dB) using the A-weighted sound pressure level
(dBA). The A-weighting scale is an adjustment to the actual sound power levels to be consistent with that
of human hearing response, which is most sensitive to frequencies around 4,000 Hertz (about the highest
note on a piano) and less sensitive to low frequencies (below 100 Hertz). In addition to the actual
instantaneous measurement of sound levels, the duration of sound is important since sounds that occur over
a long period of time are more likely to be an annoyance and cause direct physical damage or
environmental stress.
The sound pressure level is measured on a logarithmic scale with the 0 dB level based on the lowest
detectable sound pressure level that people can perceive (an audible sound that is not zero sound pressure
level). Decibels cannot be added arithmetically, but rather are added on a logarithmic basis. Based on the
logarithmic scale, a doubling of sound energy is equivalent to an increase of 3 dB. Because of the nature of
the human ear, a sound must be about 10 dB greater than the reference sound to be judged as twice as loud.
In general, a 3 dB change in community noise levels is noticeable, while 1 to 2 dB changes generally are
not perceived. Quiet suburban areas typically have noise levels in the range of 40 to 50 dBA, while those
along arterial streets are in the 50 to 60+ dBA range. Normal conversational levels are in the 60 to 65 dBA
range and ambient noise levels greater than that can interrupt conversations.
One of the most frequently used noise metrics that considers both duration and sound power level is the
equivalent noise level (Leq). The Leq is defined as the single steady A-weighted level that is equivalent to
the same amount of energy as that contained in the actual fluctuating levels over a period of time.
Typically, Leq is summed over a one-hour period.
The actual time period in which noise occurs is also important since noise that occurs at night tends to be
more disturbing than that which occurs during the daytime. Because noise levels, and sensitivity to noise,
vary over the course of the day, noise exposure is typically quantified in terms of a weighted average
                                                                                           CITY of LOMPOC

exposure, using the metrics of Day-Night average level (Ldn). Ldn recognizes this characteristic by
weighting the hourly Leqs over a 24-hour period. The weighting used in Ldn calculations involves the
addition of 10 dBA to actual nighttime (10 PM to 7 AM) noise levels. The City has adopted its noise
exposure land use compatibility standards in terms of Ldn (refer to Table N-1 below).
Sound Propagation and Attenuation
Noise levels typically attenuate at a rate of 6 dB per doubling of distance from point sources such as
industrial machinery (Harris, 1979). For example, a person standing 25 feet from an industrial machine
may experience noise levels of 75 dBA, while a person standing 50 feet from the same noise source would
experience noise levels of 69 dBA, and a person standing 100 feet from the source would experience noise
levels of 63 dBA. Noise from lightly traveled roads typically attenuates at a rate of about 4.5 dB per
doubling of distance. Noise from linear sources such as heavily traveled roads typically attenuates at about
3 dB per doubling of distance (Harris, 1979). Because of this attenuation of sound levels with distance
from the source, building setbacks are one way to maintain acceptable sound exposure levels for noise-
sensitive uses.
The attenuation rates discussed above are based flat topography with hard ground surfaces and no natural
or manmade impediments to sound propagation (topographic barriers, vegetation, walls, and buildings). A
reduction in sound exposure is achieved when there are such natural and manmade barriers, and sound-
berms, sound-walls, noise insulation are all common ways to reduce or mitigate excessive sound exposure
levels.
Noise Sources and Receptors
Existing noise sources in or near the City of Lompoc include:
      Roadway Noise                                           Union Pacific Railroad
      Commercial and Industrial Operations                    Lompoc Airport
      Agricultural Production                                 Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB)
Roadway Noise
Roadway traffic is the primary source of noise in the City. Noise generated by roadways is dependent on
the speed and volume of vehicles that use roadways. H Street/ Highway 1 carries the most traffic through
the area, while Purisima Road (west of H Street/ Highway 1) and Ocean Avenue/Highway 246 are also
major sources of roadway noise in the City. The existing 60 dBA Ldn contour from H Street/Highway 1
ranges from 141 to 224 feet from the roadway, while the existing 60 dBA Ldn contour from Purisima Road
(west of H Street/Highway 1) is 286 feet from the roadway centerline. The existing 60 dBA Ldn contour
from Ocean Avenue/Highway 246 ranges from 108 to 147 feet from the roadway centerline. Figure N-1
depicts roadway noise exposure contours for existing (2009) traffic volumes on major roads in the General
Plan area.
Figure N-2 depicts roadway noise exposure under future (2030) full General Plan buildout conditions. This
latter figure represents a worst case scenario as it assumes full buildout of all vacant and underdeveloped
parcels and also does not reflect any reduction in roadway traffic volumes through alternative
transportation modes.

Industrial and Commercial Operations
Industrial and commercial operations can be substantial sources of noise, depending on the type and hours
of operation. Commercial/industrial operations can result in objectionable noise levels when they are
adjacent to noise sensitive land uses. Industrial uses occur in industrially zoned areas of the City such as
the business park uses north of Central Avenue near the Lompoc Airport, and along sections of Laurel
Avenue. Noise generation within an industrial or commercial facility or in close proximity to many types
of agricultural equipment is controlled indirectly by Federal and State employee health and safety
regulations (e.g., OSHA and Cal-OSHA), but exterior noise emissions from such operations have the
potential to exceed acceptable standards at nearby noise-sensitive land uses. Typical commercial and
industrial noise sources include loading dock operations, parking lot activity, on-site equipment (including
heating and air conditioning), and heavy truck idling.
Commercial uses generate operational noise, including noise generated by vehicles using commercial
facilities. Operation of commercial and retail uses often generate noise associated with mechanical
equipment (such as generators, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units), deliveries, trash
hauling activities, and customer and employee use of the facilities. The highest concentrations of
commercial uses in the City are located along the Ocean Avenue/Highway 246 and H Street/Highway 1
corridors. In some areas, residential uses are located immediately adjacent to commercial uses.
Agricultural Operations
Agricultural operations surround the City on the eastern, western, and southern borders. Agricultural
operations produce noise associated with equipment such as wind machines, diesel engines, aerial
application aircrafts (crop dusters), and tractors. In some locations, agricultural operations are located
immediately adjacent to residential uses within City Limits
Other Sources of Noise
Noise from the Lompoc Airport or the VAFB is dependent upon approach and take-off flight patterns, as
well as the distance between the sensitive uses and the airports. Figure N-3 shows noise exposure resulting
from aircraft operations at the Lompoc Airport and VAFB.
Noise generated by the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) is limited to a few trips per week that occur on this
section of track since it primarily serves as a cargo rail that delivers to and from Imerys Filtration Minerals,
Inc. Although this rail segment travels within a few feet of residential units, the limited, daytime only, use
of this rail segment, railway-generated noise does not produce incompatible levels of noise.
Sensitive Receptors
Certain types of development and land uses are most susceptible to disturbance from objectionable noise
levels and must be identified in the Noise Element. These noise sensitive uses, including: residences,
schools, hotels/motels, and open space, are considered most sensitive to noise intrusion under the Lompoc
General Plan, and therefore have more stringent noise exposure targets than most commercial or
agricultural uses that are not susceptible to impacts such as sleep disturbance. In most cases in the City,
noise sensitive uses such as residential development are located in quiet areas lacking major noise sources.
However, noise sensitive uses located in the vicinity of, or adjacent to, major roadways such as Highway 1
and Highway 246 may experience noise levels exceeding City standards.

Noise Ordinance and Other Regulatory Requirements
The City’s Noise Ordinance (Section 8.08 of the Lompoc Municipal Code) contains the standards which set
forth regulations controlling loud noises from animals, amplified music and musical instruments,
construction, and vehicle repairs or other noise generating facilities. The City’s Zoning Ordinance
establishes performance standards for control of noise from industrial operations and facilities, with a
requirement for acceptable noise levels at the property lines of such uses. If noise levels at the property
line exceed these standards, noise shielding, muffling, or other noise mitigation measures is required.
GOALS AND POLICIES
Goal 1
Minimize the amount of noise to which the community is exposed.
Policies
   Policy 1.1      The City shall require each land use to maintain noise levels at their property line in
                   compliance with City standards.
   Policy 1.2      The City shall place a priority upon control of noise at the noise source.
   Policy 1.3      The City shall periodically update the Noise Ordinance to minimize noise exposure
                   within the City. The Noise Ordinance update and acoustical studies shall use the Day-

Minimize noise generated by future development.
Policies
   Policy 2.1      The City shall use the noise standards presented in table entitled "Interior and Exterior
                   Noise Standards" in determining land use designations and maximum noise levels
                   allowable for new developments. In situations of overlapping Noise Standards, the lower
                   noise level standard shall apply unless it can be found that the circumstances of the
                                                                                             CITY of LOMPOC

                                                                                    NOISE ELEMENT
            project allow for a less conservative interpretation based on the specific type of use, the
            benefits of the project, and the ability to mitigate the noise impacts.
 Policy 2.2 The City shall require acoustical studies, prepared by a qualified acoustical engineer, for
            new development projects anticipated to either: (1) result in an ambient increase of five
            dBA Ldn; or (2) produce noise within five dBA/Ldn of the noise standard or greater than
            the noise standard for the proposed land use(s) under existing or future conditions.
            Should noise abatement be necessary, the City shall require the implementation of
            mitigation measures based on a detailed technical study prepared by a qualified acoustical
            engineer (i.e., a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California with a
            minimum of three years of experience in acoustics).
 Policy 2.3 The City shall minimize noise exposure in the vicinity of the Lompoc Airport by
            maintaining consistency with the adopted Lompoc Airport Master Plan.
 Policy 2.4 The City shall continue to enforce its Noise Ordinance to minimize noise conflicts
            between adjacent land uses. The Noise Ordinance establishes noise limits that cannot be
            exceeded at the property line.
 Policy 2.5 Common walls between horizontal (side-by-side) and vertical (stacked) mixed use
            commercial/residential development shall be noise-insulated to provide attenuation of
            indoor noise levels. [Final EIR Mitigation Measure N-3(b)]
 Policy 2.6 External noise-generating equipment associated with commercial uses (e.g., HVAC units,
            etc.) that are located in mixed use developments and/or adjacent to residential uses shall
            be shielded or enclosed with solid sound barriers. [Final EIR Mitigation Measure N-3(c)]
 Policy 2.7 Emphasize the following City preferred noise management strategies as an alternative to
            the construction of noise barriers:
                     Avoid the placement of noise-sensitive uses within areas of high ambient noise
                     Orient buildings in a manner that shields noise sensitive portions of a project
                      from noise sources
                     Use sound attenuating architectural design and building features
IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
 Measure 1  The City shall amend the Noise Ordinance to include the following provisions:
                     Establish noise limits which cannot be exceeded at the property line; [Policies
                      1.1 and 1.2]
                     Require an acoustical study to demonstrate compliance with Noise Standards
                      prior to approval of: new commercial or industrial projects near existing
                      residential areas and new residential developments within the 60 Ldn contour of
                      existing stationary noise sources; [Policy 2.1]
                                                                                      CITY of LOMPOC

NOISE ELEMENT
                    Require development projects in areas having noise levels which exceed the
                     Noise Standards for the proposed land use to add noise attenuation measures
                     during the development review process to meet the Noise Standards. These
                     attenuation measures may include: landscaped-sound buffers, berms, setbacks or
                     open space, building design or orientation, prohibiting window openings, door
                     openings, or bedrooms on the sides of residential units facing noise sources
                     which exceed the Noise Standards, enhanced wall or roof insulation, placement
                     of air conditioning units in locations which minimize noise exposure, or other
                     measures; [Policy 2.2]
                    Require noise insulation of residential units constructed within the 60 dBA Ldn
                     contour; [Policy 2.2]
                    Add provisions which restrict noise from landscape maintenance devices, auto
                     alarms and stereos, stationary sources, and the hours of operation of noise
                     sources. Expand provisions restricting radios in parks and other non-residential
                     areas; and [Policies 1.2 and 1.3]
                    Establish guidelines for conducting acoustical studies, monitoring noise sources,
                     and providing noise attenuation. [Policy 2.3]
 Measure 2  The City should investigate noise impacts from stationary sources in response to noise
            complaints and then enforce existing noise standards if City noise standards are being
            exceeded. [Policies 1.4 and 1.6]
 Measure 3  The City shall periodically review and amend as necessary, the projected noise contours
            for the Lompoc Airport. [Policy 2.3]
 Measure 4  The City shall amend the Noise Ordinance to include the following measures:
                    For construction near sensitive receptors, require that noisy construction
                     activities be scheduled for periods, such as between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. on
                     weekdays and 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday, when loud noises would have the
                     least impact on adjacent residents or other sensitive receptors [Policy 2.4];
                    Develop a construction schedule that minimizes potential cumulative
                     construction noise impacts and accommodates particularly noise-sensitive
                     periods for nearby land uses (e.g., for schools, churches, etc);
                    Where feasible, require use of caissons instead of driven piles to reduce the
                     intensity level and duration of noise impacts [Policy 2.4];
                    Where feasible, construct temporary, solid noise barriers between source and
                     sensitive receptor(s) to reduce off-site propagation of construction noise [Policy
                     2.5].
                    Require internal combustion engines used for construction purposes to be
                     equipped with a properly operating muffler of a type recommended by the
                     manufacturer. Also, require impact tools to be shielded per manufacturer's
                     specifications [Policy 2.4].
                                                                                      CITY of LOMPOC

                      when detailed site-specific acoustic reports are prepared for new developments. In the
                      absence of specific noise contour information, the following table shall serve as a general
                      planning guide to determine the potential "worst case" future noise levels and shall be

PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION AND AUTHORITY
The Parks and Recreation Element is an optional element that addresses community parks and the
recreational needs of Lompoc. Although optional, about one-third of the cities and 40 percent of the
counties in California have adopted a parks and recreation element, according to the Office of Planning &
Research (OPR) 1996 local government planning survey. This number illustrates the importance placed
upon parks and recreation facilities by local jurisdictions. Public parks, clean and safe recreation facilities
and the opportunity for passive and active recreation are important contributors to a community’s quality of
life.
The purpose of the Parks and Recreation Element is to establish goals, policies and implementing measures
that ensure the recreational needs of Lompoc are met by providing convenient, attractive, diverse and well
maintained park and recreational facilities. By defining existing needs and resources and forecasting future
needs and resources, the City can develop and implement realistic policies for the long-term provision of
park facilities. The Parks and Recreation Element fulfills the requirements of Government Code Section
65302(a) and provides a framework for the City of Lompoc to assess the effectiveness of current and future
parks, recreation facilities and recreation programs with the needs of all residents. Parks are maintained by
the Public Works Department Parks and Urban Forestry Division. Recreational facilities and programs are
operated and maintained by Economic/Community Development Department Recreation Division staff.
The Departments/Divisions work in concert to provide the recreational programs to the members of the
community.
The City currently owns and operates several public parks and recreation facilities. Although the City owns
and operates these parks, some of this parkland is located outside of but immediately adjacent to the
existing City Limits. Figure PR-1 shows the location of all City owned parks, within and outside City
Limits. The parklands outside City Limits include River Park, Riverbend Park the Riverbend Multi-
purpose Trail property. The City also provides a variety of recreation facilities and services such as
aquatics activities, sports leagues, education classes, cultural events, entertainment experiences, and other
leisure activities for the community.
Many recreational facilities and parklands are available to Lompoc residents, in the Lompoc Valley, that
are not operated by the City of Lompoc. These public parks include, but are not limited to: Jalama Beach
County Park, Ocean Beach County Park, Miguelito County Park, and La Purisima Mission State Historic
Park, and Burton Mesa Chaparral. Other recreational areas include the La Purisima Golf Course, Marshallia
Golf Course, Vandenberg Village Country Club, and multiple homeowner association-operated play areas,

PUBLIC SERVICES ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION AND AUTHORITY
The Public Services Element is an optional element that addresses municipal services in Lompoc.
Numerous cities and counties have recognized the importance of planning for capital improvements and
public facilities by adopting a separate capital improvements or public facilities element. Capital
improvements such as roads, drainage facilities, sewer and water lines, treatment plants, and technological
infrastructure are the framework that supports existing and planned development. Their availability plays
an important part in determining the pattern of land uses within the community, as well as the direction and
intensity of growth. Public facilities such as police and fire stations, city or county offices, libraries, and
parks are important to residents’ safety as well as their quality of life. The practical ability to provide these
facilities is important to the well-being of the community.
The purpose of the Public Services Element is to establish goals, policies and implementing measures that
ensure the provision of basic service and infrastructural needs in order for Lompoc to operate effectively
and efficiently as a City.
Issues covered in the Public Services Element include:
     Municipal Services
     Educational Services
     Water Service & Infrastructure
     Wastewater Service & Infrastructure
     Storm Drains
     Technological Infrastructure
Public Services
The City of Lompoc is a full service city and provides its own services including fire protection, police,
school, library and hospital services.
      Fire protection services in the City of Lompoc are provided by the Lompoc Fire Department. The
           Department operates two fire stations with a First-Unit Response Time of five (5) minutes.
                                                                                               CITY of LOMPOC

CITY OF LOMPOC
2030 GENERAL PLAN
PUBLIC SERVICES ELEMENT

Water, Wastewater, Stormwater and Solid Waste
The City of Lompoc manages and maintains all water, wastewater, stormwater and solid waste for all
residents and businesses within the City.
Water
Water from the Lompoc Plain Basin is pumped from eleven wells located throughout the City. This basin
is fed by Santa Ynez River water, irrigation return flow, and deep percolation of rainfall. The City has
approximately 9,600 domestic water service connections. Water from the wells is conveyed to the Lompoc
Water Treatment Plant (LWTP) located at 601 East North Avenue. The City serves existing residences in
the Miguelito Canyon area with water from Frick Springs (located on San Miguelito Road, approximately
4.5 miles south of Willow Avenue) and the city water system.
Wastewater
The City of Lompoc owns and operates the Lompoc Regional Wastewater Reclamation Plant (LRWRP),
located at 1801 East Central Avenue. The LRWRP utilizes advanced secondary treatment technology and
has recently updated to a tertiary treatment system. The tertiary treatment system is a process subsequent
to secondary treatment that results in an additional stage of wastewater treatment.
Stormwater
Lompoc’s stormwater infrastructure consists of channelized drainages, detention basins, standard storm
drain inlets and sub-surface storm drainage systems, and curbs and gutters. Both the City and County
maintain stormwater infrastructure within the City of Lompoc. The City of Lompoc maintains the East-
West Channel drainage and the City’s curbs and gutters. The County maintains all the V Street Channel.
Most stormwater flows are directed, to detention basins prior to entering the sub-surface drainages to avoid
sediment loading. Stormwater ultimately flows into the subsurface drainages, which then flow to either the
East–West Channel, the V Street Channel, or directly into the Santa Ynez River.
                                                                                            CITY of LOMPOC

SAFETY ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION AND AUTHORITY
The Safety Element identifies and, whenever possible, reduces the impact of natural and man-made hazards
that may threaten the health, safety, and property of Lompoc residents, business owners, and visitors. The
State of California General Plan Guidelines state that the aim of the Safety Element is to reduce the
potential risk of death, injuries, property damage, and economic and social dislocation resulting from fires,
floods, earthquakes, landslides, and other hazards. As such, the element emphasizes hazards reduction and
accident prevention from known hazards and potential disasters. In addition, the element emphasizes the
importance of reducing risk and the effects of disaster prevention and/or preparedness. Hazards are an
unavoidable aspect of life, and the Safety Element cannot eliminate risk completely. Instead, the Element
contains policies to minimize the level of risk. The City will use the goals, policies, and implementation
actions to review individual development proposals and site assessments.
Issues covered in this Safety Element include:
      Emergency Preparedness
      Flooding
      Fire Hazards
      Geology and Seismicity
      Radon Gas
      Hazardous Materials
The City of Lompoc participated in the preparation of the 2011 Santa Barbara County Multi-Jurisdictional
Hazard Mitigation Plan to increase public awareness of local hazards and risks, while at the same time
providing information about options and resources available to reduce those risks. The City adopted this
plan on November 15, 2011. The document, prepared pursuant to Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, contains
a thorough description of natural and man-made hazards in Lompoc with a focus on mitigation and
preparedness. This Hazard Mitigation Plan, and all policies and programs contained therein, is incorporated
herein by reference.
The Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management (SBC OEM) is responsible for overarching
emergency planning and coordination in support of all jurisdictions within Santa Barbara County. The
Santa Barbara County OEM updated the County’s SEMS compliant Emergency Management Plan (EMP)
in 2013. The EMP was developed as part of the California Standardized Emergency Management System
(SEMS). The SEMS EMP addresses emergency responses associated with natural disasters, technological
incidents, and national security. The SEMS EMP assigns tasks and specifies policies and procedures for
coordination of emergency staff and service elements at the County level. The SEMS EMP also identifies
                                                                                             CITY of LOMPOC

emergency response actions associated with the large-scale emergencies through standard operating
procedures.
The City of Lompoc is responsible for developing and maintaining a SEMS compliant Comprehensive
Emergency Management and Recovery Plan that is consistent with the County’s Emergency Management
Plan. The City of Lompoc’s Comprehensive Emergency Management and Recovery Plan underwent a
complete update in 2014 and is reviewed and updated as necessary annually.
The City of Lompoc Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is organized into two distinct functional areas,
EOC Management Staff and EOC General Staff. The Director of Emergency Services holds the
responsibilities detailed in Lompoc City Code Section 2.36.060. City Management is responsible for the
overall emergency policies and coordination through the joint efforts of governmental agencies and private
organizations. Under direction of the EOC Director, General Staff is responsible for the call-out and release
of emergency response personnel and providing for appropriate shift coverage during emergency
conditions.
Flood Hazard Areas for Lompoc are shown on Figure S-1. According to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), the majority of the City is located within a 500-year floodplain. Areas
located near the Santa Ynez River show a higher probability of flooding within the 100-year flood plain
and Regulatory Floodway. In addition, the Santa Barbara County Flood Control District maintains maps
that show areas of inundation in the unlikely event of dam failure. Based on those maps, much of the City
of Lompoc would be inundated if Bradbury Dam were to fail. However, the probability of occurrence of
any type of dam failure event is considered to be low in today’s regulatory and dam safety oversight
environment. In 2006, a significant seismic retrofit of Bradbury Dam was completed, reducing the chance
the dam will fail in an earthquake.
There are federal and state mandates that address fire hazard planning and mitigation, including but not
limited to: the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, which requires all local and tribal governments to prepare
Local Hazard Mitigation Plans and Senate Bill 1241 (Statutes of 2012, Kehoe), which revised the safety
element requirements for state responsibility areas and very high fire hazard severity zones (Government
Code Sections 65302 and 65302.5). Fire hazard severity zones surrounding the City of Lompoc are
illustrated in Figure S-2. The City’s aforementioned Hazard Mitigation Plan and OEM procedures satisfy
state and federal requirements provided they are updated as necessary.
Earthquake fault lines in and around the City of Lompoc are shown on Figure S-3. The City regards seismic
retrofitting as a way to mitigate the damages caused by earthquakes. All seismically vulnerable buildings,
including critical facilities and City owned properties, will continue to be identified by the City and those
buildings will be required to be reinforced to minimize the risk of personal injury during an earthquake. For
City-owned facilities, the City can apply for funding under the Earthquake Safety and Public Buildings
Rehabilitation Bond Act of 1990. All new buildings should be constructed in accordance with current
seismic safety design standards. Another earthquake mitigation action that the City promotes is public
awareness programs, designed to create awareness of seismic hazards and procedures to minimize injury
and property damage before, during, and after an earthquake. Figure S-4 shows areas subject to
liquefaction. Steep slopes are also a concern in Lompoc because development built on steep grades can be
more susceptible to being impacted by an earthquake, landslides, and liquefaction. Therefore, the City may
choose to permit development on hillsides, only where it can be demonstrated that geologic conditions are
sound for construction purposes.
                                                                                             CITY of LOMPOC

CITY OF LOMPOC
2030 GENERAL PLAN
SAFETY ELEMENT
The City of Lompoc Airport is located 1801 North H Street. The Santa Barbara County Association of
Governments (SBCAG) serves as the Airport Land Use Commission. The SBCAG Santa Barbara County
Airport Land Use Plan, adopted in 1993 and currently in the process of being updated, identifies airport
flight patterns and safety zones for the Lompoc Airport, as shown in Figure S-5. The powers and duties of
the Airport Land Use Commission as set forth in Sections 21670-21678 of the Public Utilities Code include
assisting the City in ensuring compatible land uses in the vicinity of the airport, and reviewing the plans,
regulations and other actions of airport operators.
The Safety Element also addresses radon gas and hazardous materials. The amount of radon in the air is
measured in "picocuries per liter of air," or "pCi/L." A curie is a standard measurement for radioactivity,
measuring the rate of decay for a gram of radium, and a picocurie is one trillionth of a curie. Based on
statewide testing, the Lompoc zip code, 93436, is one of four zip codes with the highest number of
structures testing at, or above, the EPA’s recommended action level of 4 picocuries-per-liter of radon gas.
At these levels, it is recommended the property owner make alterations to structures to lower ambient radon
levels, reducing lung cancer risk.
Radon gas levels cannot be predicted from one location to the next, within an area of documented high
radon, such as Lompoc. Therefore, the only way to know whether the radon gas in a structure is over the
recommended action level is to test the structure.

            and response activities. [Policies 3.1 and 3.2]
 Measure 23 The City shall inventory all critical facilities and develop a schedule and procedures for
            strengthening any City-regulated critical facilities found to be below current seismic
            safety standards. The City shall notify operators of non-City regulated critical facilities to
            verify compliance with adequate seismic safety standards. If the City determines that
            City-owned facilities need seismic reinforcement, the City shall investigate applying for
            funding under the Earthquake Safety and Public Buildings Rehabilitation Bond Act of
            1990. [Policy 1.2]
 Measure 24 The City shall amend the Zoning Ordinance to incorporate specific standards for siting,
            designing, and reviewing critical facilities. These standards shall address issues such as:
            requiring detailed studies of site locations and techniques to address identified ground
            shaking characteristics and liquefaction potential prior to the development of critical
            facilities, restricting critical facilities from being located in the area of potential
            liquefaction, and ensuring access to and functioning of critical facilities following an
            earthquake. [Policy 4.1]
 Measure 25 The City shall require the following in the slope hazard areas as delineated on the
            Geologic and Soils Hazards map:
                      As a part of the permit review process, a preliminary engineering geologic
                       report shall be prepared under City direction which includes recommendations
                       for remedial measures to ensure the stability of natural and manufactured slopes
                       within the area affected by the development. The report shall be prepared by a
                       Certified Engineering Geologist, licensed in the State of California;
                      Prior to the approval of construction permits, the applicant shall submit a final
                       engineering geologic report of the graded site addressing the stability of natural
                       and manufactured slopes based on conditions as actually encountered during
                       grading. The report shall be prepared by a Certified Engineering Geologist,
                       licensed in the State of California, and shall include an as-graded geologic map;
                       and
                      The City shall require the following for areas with 20 percent slopes or greater:
                       Stability of slopes shall be addressed by a Registered Soils Engineer as a part of
                       the routine soils investigations required by the City. [Policies 4.3 and 5.1]
 Measure 26 The City shall require the liquefaction potential to be evaluated by a Registered Soils
            Engineer for all critical facilities and major structures (reinforced concrete or steel-frame,
            two-stories or more in height) within the liquefaction hazard areas as shown on the
            Geologic & Soils Hazards map. [Policy 4.3]
 Measure 27 The City shall require that all existing critical facilities, except those regulated for safety
            purposes by Federal or state agencies, are strengthened to assure they remain operational
            during and after a disaster (e.g. earthquake, flood). [Policy 1.2]
                                                                                           CITY of LOMPOC

Measure 28 The City shall amend the Zoning Ordinance to require developers proposing structures on
           or adjacent to steep (20% or greater) slopes to: 1) Develop and implement hillside
           drainage plans to reduce the risk of further movement by existing landslides; 2) Site new
           structures away from steep hillsides and the toes of existing landslide surfaces, reducing
           the potential for damage from landslide movement or burial; and 3) Perform site-specific
           slope stability investigations and analyses by a Registered Geotechnical Engineer. [Policy
           4.3]
Measure 29 The City shall amend the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances to be consistent with the
           County Hazardous Waste Management Plan (HWMP) as amended. This may include
           establishing siting criteria, a hazardous waste facility and residuals repository overlay
           designation, conditional use permit classifications, application requirements, project
           review requirements, and standards for assessing the suitability of a particular project,
           site, and access routes. [Policies 7.1, 7.3 and 7.5]
Measure 30 The City shall work with the County of Santa Barbara in the preparation of guidelines to
           identify and implement risk management strategies for the transportation of hazardous
           materials within the County. [Policy 7.1]

           purposes, if necessary, along routes of pipelines carrying hazardous materials. [Policy
           7.5]
Measure 32 The City of Lompoc shall strive to ensure that railroad facilities within the City comply
           with current rail safety measures adopted or recommended by the Federal Railroad Safety
           Administration. [Policy 7.1]
Measure 33 At every potentially contaminated site proposed for development within the City, the
           project applicant shall have the site inspected by a qualified professional for the presence
           of hazardous materials and wastes.
           The City shall make certain that inspection reports are on file prior to project approval
           and prior to any excavation or construction. Acceptance of the site inspection report shall
           allow the proposed development to proceed to the permitting stage. All activities under
           this measure shall be performed in conformance with the policies and procedures
           presented in the Santa Barbara County Hazardous Waste Management Plan. [Policy 7.3]
Measure 34 In the event that the site inspections of Measure 33 locate chemical contamination,
           underground storage tanks, abandoned drums, or other hazardous materials or wastes at a
           parcel, the inspection report preparer shall so notify the City and other agencies, as
           applicable, potentially including the State Department of Toxic Substances Control, the
           Regional Water Quality Control Board, and/or the County Health Services Department.
           The City would also notify the proper agencies, as required by law. Under the direction
           of the appropriate agencies, a site remediation plan shall be prepared by the project
           applicant, in accordance with applicable regulations. Permitting or work in the areas of
           potential hazard shall not proceed until the site remediation plan is approved and on file
           with the City.
           In accordance with OSHA requirements, any activity performed at a contaminated site
           shall be preceded by preparation of a separate site health and safety plan (prepared by the
           project applicant and filed with the City) for the protection of workers and the public. All
                                                                                      CITY of LOMPOC

              activities under this measure shall be undertaken in conformance with policies and
              procedures presented in Santa Barbara County Hazardous Waste Management Plan.
              [Policy 7.6]
 Measure 35   Any work on a known remediation site or discovery of hazardous materials during
              excavation must be reported to the Santa Barbara County Fire Department Hazardous
              Materials Unit (HMU). In the event that hazardous waste and/or materials, including
              chemical odors or stained soils, are encountered during construction of future
              development sites, the following actions shall be taken by the applicant or authorized
              agent thereof: (1) all work in the vicinity of the suspected contaminant will be halted; (2)
              all persons shall be removed from the area; (3) the site shall be secured under the
              direction of the County Fire Department; and (4) the City of Lompoc Hazardous
              Waste/Materials Coordinator shall be notified. Work shall not recommence until such
              time as the find is evaluated and appropriate measures are implemented as necessary to
              the satisfaction of the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. [Final EIR
              Mitigation Measure HAZ-1][Policy 7.6]
 Measure 36   For each specific project that would generate hazardous waste, the City shall require as a
              condition of building permit and/or business license approval that the project sponsor
              prepare a hazardous material handling program. The handling program shall identify the
              location of the new facility or use and designate either (1) specific routes to be used for
              transport of hazardous materials and wastes to and from the facility, or (2) specific routes
              to be avoided during transport of hazardous materials and wastes to and from the facility.
              Routes would be selected to minimize proximity to sensitive receptors to the greatest
              practical degree. Passage through residential neighborhoods shall be minimized, and
              parking of waste haulers on residential streets shall be prohibited. The City shall review
              and approve the applicant's hazardous material handling program or, working with the
              applicant, modify it to the satisfaction of both parties. [Policy 7.2]
 Measure 37 The Zoning Code shall be updated to include a list of prohibited uses in mixed-use
              developments. The list shall include dry-cleaning laundry facilities, and other potentially
              incompatible uses. [Policy 7.2]
 Measure 38   Open space buffers (landscape strips, masonry walls, etc.) shall be created between
              hazardous materials routes and residential neighborhoods. Also, residents within a quarter
              mile of new hazardous materials handling facilities shall be notified immediately by the
              City emergency response organizations of any accidental occurrences such as spills,
              leaks, or eruptions that may affect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. [Policy

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION AND AUTHORITY
The Urban Design Element is an optional element that addresses the visual character of Lompoc. The
Urban Design Element provides additional direction, beyond that of the Land Use Element, regarding the
planning area’s development pattern, form, structure, and sense-of-place. The Urban Design Element also
provides the basis for aesthetic regulation of public as well as private land and structures.
The purpose of the Urban Design Element is to establish goals, policies and implementation measures to
maintain a high quality appearance in the existing and future built environment by protecting the natural
features and landmarks of the valley, enhancing and protecting the “small town” character of Old Town and
ensuring high quality design and development.
The City of Lompoc desires to preserve and protect its historic heritage and established form, as well as
seeks to offer opportunities for creative development. The topics addressed in this Urban Design Element
include:
       Natural features and landmarks of the Lompoc Valley
       Old Town
       Residential neighborhoods
       Urban streetscapes and public places
       Design and development
GOALS AND POLICIES
Goal 1
Protect and enhance the natural features and landmarks of the Lompoc Valley.
Policies
  Policy 1.1      The City shall define, protect, and link urban features, rural features, and open space
                  areas in the Lompoc Valley including those identified on the Urban Design Features Map
                  (Figure UD-1).
  Policy 1.2      The City shall seek to protect ridgelines and hillsides which lie in view corridors,

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
  Policy 1.3     The City shall seek to protect and enhance the views along the scenic roads noted on the
                 Scenic Ridgelines and Roads Map.
  Policy 1.4     The City shall create a visual edge to maintain awareness of the community's setting in
                 the Lompoc Valley by establishing and maintaining open space buffers along the western
                 and eastern portions of the Urban Limit Line.

Policies
  Policy 2.1     The City shall support, maintain, and enhance the historical character, scale, and
                 architecture of the Old Town area.
  Policy 2.2     The City shall ensure that all development in the Old Town area is designed in a manner
                 that maintains, encourages, and enhances pedestrian activity between various uses and
                 activities. This includes the design of buildings, street corridors, plazas, and pedestrian
                 spaces.
  Policy 2.3     The City shall provide for sufficient and conveniently located public parking to allow the
                 Old Town area to function as a pedestrian-oriented business district without on-site
                 parking.
  Policy 2.4     The City shall ensure that parking lots in the Old Town area are located and designed to
                 avoid breaking the continuity of building facades.
  Policy 2.5     The City shall encourage existing commercial facilities to improve their appearance and
                 condition, and ensure that all new development contributes toward an overall positive and
                 cohesive visual identity.
Goal 3
Protect and enhance the positive identity of Lompoc's residential neighborhoods.
Policies
  Policy 3.1     The City shall require infill development to respect the scale and character of existing
                 neighborhoods.
  Policy 3.2     The City shall encourage the protection of structures and neighborhoods which possess
                 locally significant architectural styles or historic values. Infill development in such areas
                 shall be architecturally compatible with surrounding structures.
  Policy 3.3     The City shall encourage and support the efforts of homeowner and neighborhood
                 associations to improve the visual appearance of residential neighborhoods.
                                                                                            CITY of LOMPOC

            funding is available. Landscaped areas shall be located and designed to maintain
            vehicular and pedestrian safety, to beautify the roadways, and to maintain traffic-flow
            efficiency. [Policy 4.1]

                                                                                    CITY OF LOMPOC
                                                                              2030 GENERAL PLAN
                                                                         URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
           preserving the attributes of the view corridor that characterize its significance (e.g. framing
           elements and presence or absence of impinging details) as seen from roadways, pedestrian
           paths or other public vantage points to avoid view obstruction. Buildings shall be sited so
           as to minimize view obstruction from sensitive vantage points. This measure shall be
           accomplished through amendment of the zoning ordinance to include standards for view
           protection as indicated in this measure. [Policy 1.1 and 1.2]
Measure 19 The City shall amend the Zoning Ordinance so the following glare reduction measures are
           applied when reviewing new development on a parcel specific basis:
                    Utilize trees or other forms of vegetation to screen and visually soften parking
                     areas. This measure would reduce the amount of heat and glare generated from
                     painted and chrome automobile surfaces and prevent expanses of stationary and
                     moving automobiles;
                    Require use of hooded lights on focused-beam lamps for nighttime illumination in
                     parking areas, shipping and receiving docks and within industrial developments.
                     These lights direct the light beam towards the ground, which if a dark pavement,
                     will not reflect light and cause spillage into neighboring areas; and
                    Require use of materials which reduce or diminish glare for windows in new
                     developments. [Policy 5.1]
Measure 20 The City shall continue to review development proposals on a project-specific basis with
           added attention to avoidance to degradation of objects of aesthetic and/or historical
           significance. New development shall be subject to design review as part of the City's
           project approval process.
Measure 21 The City staff shall coordinate planning, design, and maintenance of roadway medians,
           parkstrips, and open space areas with the Parks and Recreation Divisions through the
           Development Review Board process. [Policy 4.1, 4.6 and 4.7]
Measure 22 The City shall require that outdoor lighting around buildings, in parking lots, and along
           streets be placed and designed to prevent excessive overspill of lighting into residential
           areas. [Policy 5.1]
                                                                                       CITY of LOMPOC
