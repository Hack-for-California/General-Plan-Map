                            The General Plan expresses the community’s development goals and
                            embodies public policy relative to the distribution of future land uses,
                                  both public and private. It bridges the gap between community
                                           values, visions and objectives, and physical decisions.
                                                           -- California General Plan Guidelines
                                                                           INTRODUCTION
                       La Mirada is one of Southern California’s most distinctive communities.
                       Strategically located on the border of Los Angeles and Orange
                       Counties, the City offers unparalleled access to business,
                       entertainment, and recreation opportunities.             From a historic
                       perspective, the community’s population, housing, and business
                       patterns have been shaped largely by La Mirada’s accessibility.
                       Industrial businesses take advantage of Interstate 5 (the Santa Ana
                       Freeway) and rail lines. Commercial businesses fronting the freeway
                       and Imperial Highway help support the tax base by drawing regional
                       customers into La Mirada. The well-developed local circulation system
                       allows residents to easily access beautiful City parks, neighborhood
                       schools, and areas of employment and commerce.
                       As a built-out community, La Mirada may appear to have limited
                       opportunities for new development to accommodate the new
                       residents and businesses that continue to locate in the southland.
                       However, the City has experienced ongoing change since its
                       incorporation in 1960. An enclosed shopping mall was demolished to
                       make room for new homes and an outdoor commercial center.
                       Active residential rehabilitation programs were established for
                       maturing neighborhoods. Aging industrial plants have been replaced
                       with modern business parks. La Mirada can expect similar incremental
                       changes throughout the community. This General Plan provides policy
                       guidance for development decisions. As the City moves toward the
                       year 2020, questions to be answered include:
                           •   How can the City reinforce its unique identity relative to
                               surrounding communities and unincorporated areas?
                           •   What incentives can be used to attract and retain businesses
                               that would benefit from the spending habits of the increasing
                               number of motorists traveling daily on Interstate 5 and
                               Imperial Highway?
La Mirada General Plan                                                               March 2003 I-1

Introduction to the General Plan
                                    •     What tools are appropriate to encourage a mix of retail and
                                          service uses in commercial centers and to combat aging and
                                          deferred maintenance of stores and shopping centers?
                                    •     Does the local circulation system require any adjustments in
                                          response to land use changes to ensure that residents and the
                                          business community can travel within and through La Mirada
                                          efficiently and safely?
                                    •     What strategies can be used to preserve the character of
                                          residential neighborhoods while allowing new housing
                                          development?
                               This Plan guides the City to the year 2020 by setting forth goals and
                               policies addressing land use, economic development, circulation,
                               housing, and related issues. These issues affect the quality of life in La
                               Mirada and the economic health of the community. Implementation
                               of the General Plan will ensure that future development projects are
                               consistent with the community’s goals.
 La Mirada Planning Area       State planning law gives a city the authority to undertake long-range
                               planning not just for properties within its corporate limits but also
                               lands within its sphere of influence.1 The sphere of influence
                               encompasses lands outside the city limits which are not under any
                               other city’s jurisdiction and which may influence the decisions and
                               planning activities related to properties within the city’s own corporate
                               limits.
                               La Mirada’s sphere of influence includes two areas north of Imperial
                               Highway: the first bounded by Telegraph Road, Imperial Highway, and
                               Valley View Avenue; and the second bounded by Leffingwell Avenue,
                               La Mirada’s eastern city limit, and the western boundary of La Habra.
                               The entire planning area encompasses 4,611 acres, with approximately
                               3,841 acres within the City’s corporate limits and an additional 770
                               acres within the sphere of influence (see Figure I-1).
            History of the     La Mirada incorporated as a
              Community        general law city on March 23,
                               1960. The City was once
                               part of Rancho Los Coyotes,
                               a large ranch deeded to
                               Manuel Nieto by the Spanish
                               Governor Diego de Borcia.
                               The 2,128-acre Windermere
                               Rancho formed part of this

                                  Every county in California has a Local Agency Formation Commission, or LAFCO, which
                               establishes sphere of influence boundaries for incorporated jurisdictions. The Los Angeles
                               County LAFCO has identified a sphere of influence for La Mirada consisting of two
                               unincorporated areas located north of the current City boundary.

Introduction to the General Plan
                               land grant and was used for raising sheep. In 1895, Andrew McNally
                               of the Rand-McNally atlas firm purchased the Rancho and formed the
                               La Mirada Land Company for the purpose of developing “Country
                               Gentlemen’s” estates of 20 to 40 acres. A beautiful lake called
                               Windermere Lake was developed for use by area residents.
                               Agricultural uses, predominately production of olives and lemons,
                               were predominant until 1953, when McNally’s property was sold for
                               subdivision development.
                               With accelerated home building in the seven years between 1953 and
                               1960, La Mirada became a community of 22,000 people. The new
                               residents fought annexation by surrounding cities for three years and
                               in 1960 finally achieved home rule through incorporation as a city.
                               Since incorporation, La Mirada has experienced further growth and
                               has developed an efficient city government. Today, La Mirada is a fully
                               developed, stable, mature, suburban city of approximately 47,000
                               residents.
    Purpose and Scope of       A general plan is a document required by State law that serves as a
        the General Plan       guide to the long-term physical development of the community. It can
                               be thought of as a pattern or blueprint for reuse of property, as well
                               as for future growth and development.
                               Per State regulations, a general plan must address at least the following
                               issues: land use, circulation, housing, noise, public safety, conservation,
                               and open space (California Government Code, Section 65302).
                               However, a jurisdiction can craft its general plan to deal with any issue
                               which decision makers, city staff, residents, business owners, and other
                               stakeholders deem important to the community. The La Mirada
                               General Plan discusses these issues in a series of six chapters called
                               elements. These elements are:
                                   •    Land Use
                                   •    Economic
                                   •    Circulation
                                   •    Housing
                                   •    Safety and Community Services
                                   •    Open Space and Conservation
                               Table I-1 shows the relationship between the six elements of the La
                               Mirada General Plan and the State-mandated elements.

                             In addition to the six elements, this General Plan includes an
                             Implementation Program (see Appendix).              The Implementation
                             Program, adopted separately from the General Plan elements and
                             subject to annual review, identifies the specific actions the City will
                             undertake to implement the goals and policies contained in the
                             elements.
             General Plan    The General Plan is comprised of this Introduction, the six elements,
   Organization and Use      and a Glossary, plus the separate Implementation Program
                             (Appendix). The elements and the Implementation Plan will help the
                             City continue to achieve its vision for the future.
                             The Introduction of each element presents a discussion of its purpose
                             and defines its scope and content. To help readers understand certain
                             technical terms used in each element, the Important Terms and
                             Concepts section defines those terms. Several of the elements
                             contain a Related Plans and Programs section examining pertinent
                             programs that affect La Mirada and the way the City plans for
                             development and growth.
                             The Plan section addresses identified planning issues, goals, and policies
                             related to the element topic. The issues, goals, and policies are of
                             continuing importance to the City from previous General Plans, and
                             have been influenced by public input received from the community at
                             City Council and Planning Commission hearings conducted for the
                             General Plan.
La Mirada General Plan                                                                   March 2003 I-5

Introduction to the General Plan
                               Planning goals are overall statements of community desires and are
                               comprised of broad statements of purpose or direction. The policies
                               serve as guides to the City Council, Planning Commission, and City
                               staff in their review of development proposals and execution of
                               decisions that affect development.
                               The structure of the Housing Element differs slightly because State law
                               is very specific about issues that must be addressed in housing
                               elements. In addition to broad goals and policies, the Housing
                               Element contains numeric goals for housing rehabilitation and new
                               housing construction, as well as descriptions of programs the City will
                               pursue toward those goals.
                               The structure of the elements allows readers to easily locate issues of
                               interest and to read a summary of the City’s goals and policies relative
                               to that particular topic. However, General Plan readers should realize
                               that the General Plan is an integrated document. The policies
                               contained in the various elements are interrelated and should be
                               examined comprehensively. For example, many of the Economic
                               Element policies tie closely to policies in the Land Use Element. All
                               policy components must be considered together.
 Community Participation       Because the General Plan sets forth the goals and ideals of the
                               community, citizen input is essential to identifying issues and
                               formulating policy. Both La Mirada residents and representatives from
                               the business community contributed insight and vision into the
                               planning efforts. Prior to public hearings, City staff conducted a briefing
                               for the Chamber of Commerce to solicit input about issues of
                               importance to the business community.              Staff also conducted
                               workshops with the Planning Commission and City Council to review the
                               format and content of the Draft General Plan.
                               The Draft General Plan and supporting documents were circulated for
                               public review and comment before and during formal public hearings
                               before the Planning Commission and City Council.

                                                      The purpose of the land use element is to guide
                                              the ultimate pattern of development for the community.
                                                               -- California General Plan Guidelines
                                                                              INTRODUCTION
                         La Mirada incorporated as a City in 1960. The City’s first General
                         Plan, adopted in 1965, established La Mirada’s vision to become a city
                         known for high-quality residential development, many beautiful parks
                         and public facilities, supportive commercial development, and an
                         industrial area that supports the City financially and contributes to its
                         stable employment base. The City entered the twenty-first century
                         almost fully developed, and the vision established in that first General
                         Plan has been achieved. The Land Use Element continues to assist the
                         City in maintaining the vision by setting forth policies to guide future
                         infill development and reuse of properties.
          Purpose of the The Land Use Element guides land use planning in La Mirada by
       Land Use Element  providing a framework for the issues examined in the General Plan
                         and identifying how land will be used for business, housing, public
                         facilities, transportation, and open space.
                         The Land Use Element addresses
                         the physical development and
                         appearance of the City by
                         describing present and planned
                         land use activity and addressing
                         the        relationships     between
                         development and environmental
                         quality, potential hazards, and
                         broader economic and social
                         objectives. As a guide for future development, it also identifies the
                         general distribution, location, mix, and extent of desired land uses,
                         including residential, commercial, business, public facilities, and open
                         space uses.
                         The land use plan portion of this Element presents goals and policies
                         that address how the City will maintain and enhance land uses
                         throughout the community. The plan builds upon established land use
                         patterns to provide integration between existing community qualities
                         and the City’s vision for the future.
La Mirada General Plan                                                              March 2003 LU-1

Land Use Element
    Scope and Content of  The Land Use Element is comprised of two sections. The first
   the Land Use Element   establishes the setting and purpose of the Element, including important
                          terms and concepts, and related regional and local plans and
                          programs.
                          The second section presents
                          the Land Use Plan. This plan
                          is composed of two primary
                          components:        a Land Use
                          Policy Map which graphically
                          identifies the arrangement and
                          distribution of uses within La
                          Mirada, and supporting text
                          that discusses issues, goals, and
                          policies. Specific actions to implement land use goals and policies are
                          provided in the General Plan Implementation Program (Appendix A
                          of the General Plan).
    Relationship to Other State planning law requires the Land Use Element to be consistent
  General Plan Elements   with the goals, policies, and programs of other General Plan elements.
                          All elements of the General Plan are interrelated to a degree, while
                          each element focuses more specifically on a topic of interest. The
                          Land Use Element establishes the planned land use patterns for La
                          Mirada based on the community’s desires and needs. The other
                          General Plan elements ensure that adequate and supporting
                          infrastructure, public facilities, and services continue to be provided to
                          accommodate existing and planned land uses.

                                                                                                                    Land Use Element
                                                          IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS
                          In discussing how properties may be developed, the Land Use
                          Element uses certain planning terms and concepts.
  Land Use Designations   The Land Use Element establishes generalized categories for the types
                          of land uses allowed in the City, such as residential, commercial,
                          industrial, public, institutional, parks, and open space. For each so-
                          called land use category, the Element defines the range of uses and
                          intensity of development permitted.
    Density and Intensity Density and intensity are terms used to describe the level of
                          development existing or permitted on a lot or parcel of land. Density
                          applies to residential land use categories and refers to the number of
                          housing units per acre of land. Intensity applies to commercial and
                          industrial land use categories. Intensity means the total building square
                          footage, percent of lot coverage, or floor-area ratio (FAR) established
                          on a property. Different parts of La Mirada are distinguished by the
                          density or intensity of development. Areas with apartments have
                          higher densities than traditional subdivisions. Commercial areas near
                          Interstate 5 have been developed at higher intensities than
                          neighborhood re tail centers.
         Floor Area Ratio Floor-Area Ratio (FAR) represents the relationship between the total
                          floor area of a building and the total area of the lot. The FAR is
                          determined by dividing the total building floor area by the total size of
                          a lot. For instance, a 10,000 square foot building on a 20,000 square
                          foot lot has a FAR of 0.5. As shown in Figure LU-1, a building with the
                          same FAR can be designed in different ways – by a low rise building
                          covering most of the lot, by a mid-size structure with less lot coverage,
                          or by a taller building with substantial surrounding open space.

                                                                                 (20,000 sq. ft. divided by 40,000 sq. ft. equals 0.50).
                                                                  lot depth           NOTE: Variations may occur if upper floors are

Land Use Element
          Nonconforming  Any use, structure, or lot which does not conform to the regulations
                         established by the zone district where it is located is considered
                         “nonconforming.” Nonconforming uses can include:
                             (1) Nonconforming structures (by virtue of size, type of
                                   construction, design of building, location on site, etc)
                             (2) Nonconforming uses of a conforming or nonconforming
                                   building or structure
                             (3) Nonconforming size of parcel of land or lot (e.g., dimensions
                                   or size of lot does not meet the minimum lot dimensions)
          Redevelopment  California Redevelopment Law provides cities with the authority,
                         scope, and financing mechanisms needed to improve their community.
                         To this end, the La Mirada Redevelopment Agency has been an active
                         partner with business and industry since its establishment in 1973.
                         The Agency’s primary goals are to eliminate blighted conditions;
                         revitalize the industrial area and retail centers in the City; recycle
                         underutilized property; increase, improve, and preserve the City’s
                         supply of affordable housing; and improve the community’s image.
                         State law provides a Redevelopment Agency with planning, clearance,
                         development, and financing mechanisms to achieve these goals.
   Flexible Development  La Mirada uses a variety of tools to facilitate more imaginative and
                   Tools innovative land uses that are not otherwise possible through literal
                         application of the zoning code. The following tools allow flexibility in
                         locating buildings and combining land uses to achieve economies of
                         scale, provide for more innovative designs, preserve open space, and
                         provide greater amenities:
                          •   Planned Unit Development: A planned unit development (PUD)
                              typically covers a large, multi-lot area under single ownership. A
                              PUD development is approved as one project comprised of
                              several land uses or development projects, rather than several
                              separate developments on individual lots. Over 50 projects in La
                              Mirada have been approved through this process.
                          •   Specific Plan: A specific plan is prepared for a defined geographic
                              area which may benefit from special land use regulations and
                              development standards. A specific plan differs from a PUD in
                              that multiple properties under different ownership are often
                              included. The General Plan promotes the use of a specific plan
                              for the Imperial Highway corridor to achieve quality aesthetic
                              design and desired land use composition.

Development Agreement    A development agreement is a contractual agreement between a
                         developer and the City that clearly establishes the developer’s
                         responsibility to provide a certain type of development, streets and
                         sewer improvements, and any other mutually agreed to terms and
                         responsibilities as a precondition for securing approval of a project.
           Density Bonus Under State density bonus laws, a developer is commonly allowed
                         additional residential units within a project beyond the maximum for
                         which the parcel is otherwise permitted. Usually, a density bonus is
                         permitted in exchange for the provision or preservation of affordable
                         housing units at the same site or another location.

                           The scope and content of the Land Use Element primarily are
                           governed by the General Plan Law and Guidelines and the Planning,
                           Zoning, and Development Laws for the state (California Government
                           Code Sections 6500 et seq.). Several regional plans and programs
                           also are considered in the formulation, adoption, and implementation
                           of local land use policy.
California Environmental   The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by
   Quality Act Guidelines  the State legislature in 1970 in response to a public mandate for
                           thorough environmental analysis of projects that might affect the
                           environment. Under CEQA, most projects that require discretionary
                           approval by a public agency must first be reviewed to determine
                           related environmental effects. The environmental review procedures
                           are described in the CEQA Statutes and Guidelines. CEQA
                           implementation ensures that City officials and residents have the
                           opportunity to assess any impacts associated with development
                           projects so that appropriate measures can be implemented to
                           preserve the quality of the living environment.
       La Mirada Zoning    The La Mirada Zoning Ordinance serves as the primary tool for
               Ordinance   implementing the goals and policies of the Land Use Element. The
                           Zoning Ordinance specifies the types of allowable uses, the intensity
                           and density of such uses, development standards for various uses,
                           performance standards applicable to specific parcels of land in the City,
                           and conditional use permit processes, among others.
          Biola University Biola University represents a major land use that will continue to grow
             Master Plan   and change over the years. To guide this growth, the University has
                           prepared a master plan. The master plan identifies locations and sizes
                           of current and future buildings, athletic fields, parking, and other
                           campus uses. The master plan permits development of approximately
                           1.6 million square feet of building space to accommodate a student
                           population of approximately 5,000. A Planned Unit Development has
                           been approved to implement the master plan.
 Regional Comprehensive    The Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide was developed by the
          Plan and Guide   Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) to help
                           facilitate orderly development and growth within the six-county SCAG
                           region, while maintaining and improving the quality of the living
                           environment. The RCPG is fashioned like a local General Plan, with
                           separate chapters addressing the economy, growth management,
                           regional mobility, air quality, housing, public finance, open space and
                           conservation, water resources, energy, and waste management. The
                           policies and programs were developed with active participation from

Land Use Element
                                                                                LAND USE PLAN
                           This Land Use Plan consists of a map and text, intended to guide
                           planning decisions for the City on a day-to-day basis. This Land Use
                           Plan focuses on three overarching goals:
                                (1)            To maintain and preserve quality residential and
                                               industrial development throughout the City
                                (2)            To revitalize or redevelop commercial properties
                                (3)            To preserve and enhance civic resources, including
                                               parks, schools, La Mirada Creek, Biola University,
                                               and the Civic Center
                           To achieve these overarching goals and maintain the desired balance
                           of uses, the City will make land use decisions in a manner conforming
                           to the designations and development intensity regulations of the Land
                           Use Policy Map, and consistent with the goals and policies contained in
                           this Element.
    Land Use Policy Map    The Land Use Policy Map, presented as Figure LU-2, indicates that
                           industrial uses will be maintained south of the railroad tracks and
                           residential neighborhoods will continue to represent the dominant
                           land use. Commercial properties will be the focus of business
                           revitalization efforts, and parks and trails will continue to contribute to
                           La Mirada’s unique community identity. The land use categories
                           shown on the map are described below.
     Residential Land Uses Low Density Residential (LDR) – This category allows traditional low-
                           density, detached single-family houses. The maximum residential
                           density allowed in this category is six (6) units per acre of land. The
                           average population density is 18 persons per acre.
                           Several zoning districts allowing for subdivisions with varying minimum
                           lot sizes (6,000 to 15,000 square feet) implement the Low Density
                           Residential category.            Additional permitted uses include
                           public/institutional facilities, churches, schools, group homes,
                           community care facilities, and other uses determined to be compatible
                           with low-density, detached single-family neighborhoods.
                           The maximum density may be exceeded consistent with the density
                           bonus provisions of Section 65915 of the California Government
                           Code.

                        Medium Density Residential (MDR) – This category provides areas
                        for medium-density attached residential uses such as duplexes,
                        townhomes, condominiums, and apartments, as well as single-family
                        attached or detached homes on smaller lots. The maximum
                        residential density allowed is 15 units per acre. The average
                        population density is 40 persons per acre.
                        Additional permitted uses include public/institutional facilities, churches,
                        schools, group homes, community care facilities, and other uses
                        determined to be compatible with the needs of medium-density
                        residential neighborhoods.
                        The maximum density may be exceeded consistent with the density
                        bonus provisions of Section 65915 of the California Government
                        Code.
                        High Density Residential (HDR) – The High Density Residential
                        category provides opportunities for construction of detached and
                        attached single-family homes, condominiums, townhomes, and
                        apartments built at a maximum density of 28 units per acre. The
                        average population density is 70 persons per acre.
                        Additional permitted uses include public/institutional facilities, churches,
                        schools, group homes, community care facilities, and other uses
                        determined to be compatible with high-density residential
                        neighborhoods.

   Commercial Land Uses To allow for diversity and flexibility in commercial development, the
                        Land Use Policy Map provides a single commercial land use category.
                        Zoning districts are used to differentiate among the various
                        commercial focus areas addressed in this Element.
                        Commercial (C) – Commercial opportunities in La Mirada include a
                        broad range of neighborhood retail and service, community retail,
                        office, and freeway commercial uses intended to meet the needs of
                        residents and businesses, as well as regional shopping demand.
                        The Commercial category includes sites visible from the Interstate 5
                        freeway corridor and along the City’s major arterial streets, as well as
                        smaller sites located within or adjacent to residential neighborhoods.
                        Sites with freeway visibility and easy access from major roadways
                        should support larger-scale commercial uses oriented toward meeting
                        the needs of travelers, visitors to the City, and shoppers from
                        throughout the region, as well as office uses. Locations within or near

                            residential areas are intended to support neighborhood commercial
                            retail and service uses.
                            Types of uses allowed in this
                            category include, but are not
                            limited to:           professional and
                            administrative offices, convenience
                            and neighborhood commercial
                            developments, restaurants, theaters
                            and performing arts centers,
                            community          shopping      centers,
                            community hospitals and supporting medical centers, and other retail
                            and service uses of varying intensity. Additional permitted uses include
                            public/institutional facilities, churches, schools, and community care
                            facilities, consistent with zoning ordinance regulations.
                            The maximum permitted FAR for Commercial uses varies depending
                            upon location.           Figure LU-3 identifies FAR subareas, with
                            corresponding FAR limits defined in Table LU-1. The zoning
                            ordinance will continue to define FAR standards more specifically for
                            each commercial zoning district.

                            Imperial Highway Specific Plan boundaries. The Imperial Highway
                            Specific Plan identifies use regulations and development/design
                            standards unique to this corridor to achieve a higher design quality and
                            regionally-oriented developments along this important travel corridor.
       Industrial Land Uses All industrial activity in La Mirada is concentrated along railroad lines
                            and the freeway within the southern portion of the City. The
                            clustering of industrial uses in this manner serves the dual purpose of
                            segregating incompatible industrial activities from residential areas, as
                            well as concentrating industrial and regional transportation routes
                            away from residential neighborhoods. Moreover, the City’s design
                            criteria have resulted in industrial areas that are aesthetically pleasing.

Land Use Element
                              Industrial (I) – The Industrial land use category applies to areas
                              appropriate for most industrial uses, including manufacturing and
                              processing, warehousing and distribution, and wholesaling. Businesses
                              within the La Mirada industrial area are “clean” industrial uses –
                              characterized by a lack of noxious or polluting industries. The
                              maximum permitted FAR is 1.0.
            Public Facilities The Land Use Element provides one land use category to
                              accommodate public facility uses, which are defined as uses directly
                              related to a legitimate governmental or quasi-governmental activity or
                              function.
                              Public and Institutional (PI) – The Public and Institutional Category
                              provides areas throughout the City for a variety of public, quasi-public,
                              and institutional facilities. The primary land uses permitted include:
                                  1)       Public buildings, including but not limited to, the Civic
                                           Center, Resource Center, public libraries, Sheriff stations,
                                           and fire protection facilities
                                  2)       Quasi-public facilities such as public utility facilities, water
                                           wells, and similar uses
                                  3)       Institutional uses, including public and private schools and
                                           Biola University
                                  4)        Religious institutions and related facilities
                              For each type of development, zoning ordinance regulations control
                              the maximum permitted intensity of development. For uses with
                              habitable structures, the FAR shall not exceed 0.4. Where a use does
                              not include a habitable structure, such as a utility transformer station
                              or water well housing, no FAR regulation applies.
    Parks and Open Space      La Mirada’s desirable setting at the base of rolling hills provides a
                              natural environment for the City’s system of parks and open space.
                              Neighborhood parks are convenient to all residential neighborhoods,
                              and the La Mirada Creek greenbelt provides recreation spots and
                              open spaces that wind across the City and tie into La Mirada Regional
                              Park and golf course.
                              Parks and Open Space (OS) – All public parks and City-owned and
                              County-owned recreational facilities are included in the Open Space
                              land use category. While active recreational parks represent the
                              primary permitted use, other permitted facilities include public
                              gymnasiums, multi-purpose community buildings, cemeteries, trail
                              systems, child care centers for City-supported programs, public

                                                                                    Land Use Element
                          spaces. No intensity restriction applies to the Parks and Open Space
                          category.
  Land Use Compatibility  Land use compatibility is an important contributor to quality of life.
                          Less intensive and complementary uses such as single-family
                          residences, neighborhood parks, and elementary schools should be
                          adjacent to one another to create cohesive neighborhoods. More
                          intense development such as apartments and hospitals should be
                          located near commercial areas and major arterials. Higher density
                          housing provides market support for retail stores and can be designed
                          in a compatible manner with commercial centers. Industrial uses in
                          the southwest part of the City are well buffered from more sensitive
                          uses by the railroad and freeway. Minimizing land use conflict
                          decreases the potential for encroachment of undesirable land uses
                          into neighborhoods, enhances the marketability of the City, and
                          maintains the overall quality of life for residents.
                          Goal 1.0      Maintain a compatible mix, distribution, and intensity of
                                        complementary land uses.
                          Policy 1.1    Maintain a mix of residential, commercial, industrial, open
                                        space, and institutional uses appropriately located to
                                        optimize quality of life for residents in the City.
                          Policy 1.2    Continue to focus industrial and regional commercial
                                        uses along rail corridors and Interstate 5, away from
                                        residential neighborhoods.
                          Policy 1.3    Accommodate new residential and commercial
                                        development that is compatible with and complementary
                                        to established land uses.
                          Policy 1.4    Establish, maintain, and enforce standards that regulate
                                        property use in a manner that protects the public’s
                                        health, safety, comfort, convenience, and welfare.
         Community and    Ensuring the availability and
  Neighborhood Facilities accessibility of high-quality
                          community and neighborhood
                          facilities promotes a quality

                          dispersed     throughout       the
                          community.      Youngsters are
                          able to walk to elementary schools, people of all age levels have ready

                            or public transit. Major land uses serving residents are located near
                            the center of the City, including the Civic Center, Resource Center,
                            Activity Center, Biola University, La Mirada Regional Park, and the
                            Performing Arts Center. Each landmark is a focal point of activity and
                            lies within easy access via a major arterial or public transit.
                            Goal 2.0          Maintain the quality and distribution of community
                                              and neighborhood facilities for residents.
                            Policy 2.1        Maintain the Civic Center’s function as a community
                                              focal point, with civic and community-oriented uses
                                              adjacent to the Center.
                            Policy 2.2        Maintain a distribution of neighborhood services and
                                              facilities within reasonable walking distance of their
                                              respective service areas.
                            Policy 2.3        Build upon the multi-use character of the Civic Center
                                              and surrounding park facilities.
        Commercial and      Vitality in the business sector ensures the fiscal stability of the City and
        Industrial Vitality supports a high level of services enjoyed by residents. Businesses
                            provide the revenue needed to support parks and recreation
                            programs and facilities, fund infrastructure maintenance, and provide
                            critical life safety services. Continued viability of the business sector
                            depends, in part, upon such factors as location and convenient access,
                            status, attractive and well-maintained commercial and industrial
                            districts, and the expectation that the City will respond to the needs
                            of the business community. The vitality of the business sector is also
                            enhanced by a diversity of industrial and commercial opportunities
                            that provides a stable revenue stream as economic conditions change.
                            The following policies support the City’s business sector.
                            Goal 3.0          Promote industrial and commercial stability and
                                              vitality.
                            Policy 3.1        Facilitate the continued recycling of less viable
                                              commercial and industrial uses to higher and better
                                              uses where appropriate.
                            Policy 3.2        Encourage a diversity of business opportunities that
                                              contribute positively toward the City’s tax base.
                            Policy 3.3        Develop focused economic enhancement strategies for
                                              the Imperial Highway Corridor and Interstate 5
                                              Corridor.

                                                                                  Land Use Element
           Housing and  Housing and neighborhoods
   Neighborhood Quality reflect the quality and
                        diversity of La Mirada.
                        Although housing production
                        is a key component of
                        meeting the changing needs
                        of the community, La Mirada
                        is a mature community
                        where most available land
                        has already been committed
                        to development. The majority of the City’s housing stock has been in
                        place since the City’s incorporation in 1960. As buildings age, any hint
                        of visual deterioration affects the value of properties and the
                        attractiveness of neighborhoods. Also, the infrastructure supporting
                        neighborhoods (including streets, trees, sewers and water lines)
                        requires periodic maintenance and repair to maintain its utility and
                        value. Ensuring ongoing preventive maintenance, the improvement of
                        housing, and the maintenance of supporting infrastructure are
                        important for preserving the quality of life in neighborhoods.
                        Goal 4.0        Preserve the character and quality of La Mirada’s
                                        neighborhoods.
                        Policy 4.1      Encourage housing maintenance and rehabilitation, and
                                        promote removal and replacement activities where
                                        necessary to improve overall housing conditions.
                        Policy 4.2      Provide for a range in type, density, and price of
                                        housing to address the changing needs of community
                                        residents.
                        Policy 4.3      Ensure the provision of adequate public facilities and
                                        services that maintain quality of life and are convenient
                                        and appropriate to each neighborhood.
                        Policy 4.4      Vigorously enforce building, zoning, health, and safety
                                        codes to promote property maintenance.
                        Policy 4.5      Continue to provide below market                   housing
                                        rehabilitation loans for qualifying residents.
         Redevelopment  The La Mirada Redevelopment Agency has been an active partner
                        with business and industry since its establishment in 1973. The
                        Agency’s primary goals are to eliminate blighted conditions, revitalize
                        the industrial area and retail centers in the City, recycle underutilized
                        property, and increase, improve, and preserve the City’s supply of
                        affordable housing.

Land Use Element
                        Goal 5.0        Stimulate the revitalization of deteriorating land uses
                                        and properties.
                        Policy 5.1      Remove blighting conditions where necessary to
                                        encourage investment, establish more viable land uses,
                                        and improve the aesthetic character of districts and
                                        neighborhoods.
                        Policy 5.2      Develop redevelopment strategies for focused areas in
                                        the community that can benefit from economic
                                        enhancement.
   Community Aesthetics Maintaining pride in the community requires continued reinvestment
                        in the aesthetic quality of residential neighborhoods and business
                        districts. Community aesthetics covers a range of issues, including
                        home maintenance, the quality of landscaping along streets, property
                        conditions of commercial retail centers, among others. La Mirada has
                        several commercial centers that have experienced under-investment,
                        resulting in poor maintenance and signs of deterioration. In residential
                        areas, isolated portions of several neighborhoods would benefit from
                        targeted building and property maintenance. Landscaping and wall
                        treatments along the City’s major arterials could be enhanced to
                        create a more uniform, thematic streetscape.
                        Goal 6.0        Achieve aesthetic enhancements              citywide   to
                                        distinguish La Mirada.
                        Policy 6.1      Vigorously enforce building, zoning, and health and
                                        safety codes to promote property maintenance.
                        Policy 6.2      Continue to encourage housing and neighborhood
                                        beautification efforts.
                        Policy 6.3      Direct efforts at maintaining and upgrading commercial
                                        and industrial areas in La Mirada which have
                                        experienced disinvestment.
                        Policy 6.4      Investigate innovative and effective strategies for
                                        establishing consistent soundwall and landscaping
                                        treatments along the City’s key arterial streets.
                        Policy 6.5      Incorporate the zoning regulations provisions that
                                        enhance property appearance, including appropriate
                                        sign regulation, quality landscape treatments, and
                                        general property development standards.

                                                                                   Land Use Element
            Focus Areas: La Mirada’s well-established land use patterns appear to leave little
            An Overview  room for change. However, as discussed in the introduction to this
                         Element, shifts in retail and service commercial trends, needs for
                         professional office space, and the planned widening of Interstate 5 all
                         affect how property will be used and reused, developed and
                         redeveloped over time. The Land Use Policy Map responds to both
                         the City’s built-out character and anticipated long-term changes that
                         will further City objectives. Land use patterns generally will remain
                         unchanged, particularly with regard to the City’s residential
                         neighborhoods. However, public and private investment will be
                         applied to Focus Areas to achieve land use changes and associated
                         economic development goals. The Land Use Plan provides planning
                         guidance for the following Focus Areas:
                              •   Imperial Highway Corridor
                              •   Interstate 5 Corridor
                         Goals and policies presented for each Focus Area apply to properties
                         within these Focus Areas as identified on Figure LU-3. Additionally,
                         maximum FAR restrictions within the Commercial land use category
                         vary within these locations, as previously identified in Table LU-1.

    Interstate 5 Corridor The long-anticipated widening of Interstate 5 through southern La
                          Mirada will create new opportunities for development along this
                          important regional
                          travelway.     The
                          freeway eventually
                          will include five
                          lanes on each side
                          through the City.
                          The City is well-
                          positioned       to
                          promote
                          revitalization   of
                          industrial     and

                          Avenue and the
                          Union Pacific Railroad that have long suffered from inconvenient
                          freeway access. Working with its partners toward regionally beneficial
                          goals, La Mirada will ensure that freeway widening delivers land use
                          and economic benefits to the City and its residents.
                          Goal 8.0       Obtain positive land use and economic benefits from
                                         the widening of Interstate 5.
                          Policy 8.1     Site new regionally serving retail, office, hospitality, and
                                         entertainment uses at improved freeway interchanges
                                         along Interstate 5.
                          Policy 8.2     Remove blighted land uses along the Interstate 5 right-
                                         of-way.
                          Policy 8.3     Support efforts to redesign freeway ramps to improve
                                         access into La Mirada’s industrial center.

                        more acres of land, the project will be required to submit a notice of
                        intent (NOI) to the State Water Resources Control Board and have a
                        Waste Discharge Identification (WDID) number from the State along

         Zoning and the The City’s zoning ordinance serves as the primary tool for
      Land Use Element  implementation of land use policies contained in this Element. Under
                        California law, the zoning ordinance must be consistent with the
                        General Plan, meaning that each land use category must have one or
                        more corresponding zone district, and that the development
                        standards and land use regulations contained in the zoning ordinance
                        must reflect the policy statements contained in the Land Use Element.
                        While the General Plan by nature is somewhat general in its discussion
                        of permitted land uses and development intensities, the zoning

                             An effective economic element will establish a consistent set of policies
                                   which provide general direction on how the community can focus
                                          resources to retain local businesses, attract new industries,
                                              support the tax base, and sustain the ability to provide
                                                        public services for current and future residents.
                                                                -- California General Plan Guidelines
                                                                                INTRODUCTION
                         The business community has played an important role in establishing
                         La Mirada’s quality living environment. One of the City’s continuing
                         goals has been to maintain and enhance the appeal of business and
                         commercial areas. A productive business climate and sound fiscal base
                         have resulted from these efforts. Industry, the City, and City residents
                         all enjoy the positive effects.
    Scope and Content of Although State planning regulations do not require consideration of
   the Economic Element  economic and fiscal effects of land use policies in a separate General
                         Plan Element, the City has always realized the necessity to consider
                         the economic implications of its decisions. Therefore, this Economic
                         Element is included in the General Plan.
                         The Economic Element summarizes challenges facing the continued
                         success of the business environment. These challenges include
                         competition from neighboring jurisdictions, lack of available land for
                         new or expanded commercial development, and the aging of
                         commercial centers within the City. Also, the mix of retail, service,
                         and entertainment uses within the centers fails to meet the City’s goal
                         to balance uses and respond to local commercial needs.
                         In     response      to      these
                         challenges,      the      Element
                         establishes      priorities     for
                         future economic develop-
                         ment,       identifies      target
                         locations      for     economic
                         revitalization, and sets forth
                         goals and policies that build
                         upon the City’s strong
                         economic base and capitalize
                         on available growth opportunities. The Economic Element also
                         provides additional support for policies in the Land Use Element that
                         promote aesthetic improvement of commercial land use areas,
                         particularly those located along Imperial Highway.

Economic Element
                 The principal implementation tools of the Economic Element remain
                 redevelopment, code enforcement, and adherence to the City’s
                 zoning ordinance.      The General Plan Implementation Program
                 provides specific actions designed to address the issues discussed in
                 the Element.

                                                                               Economic Element
                                               IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS
                         Economic development can involve the use of City-sponsored
                         redevelopment activities. State redevelopment law contains specific
                         language and terms that are defined here to assist the reader.
         Redevelopment   Redevelopment refers to improvement through planning,
                         development, redesign, clearance, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of
                         all or part of a project area with the use of public funds and actions,
                         including property tax assessment.
                         Redevelopment activities in La Mirada are administered by the La
                         Mirada Redevelopment Agency. The Agency has been an active
                         partner with businesses and industry in the City since it formed in
                         1973. The primary goals of the Agency are to eliminate blight and
                         blighted conditions, revitalize the industrial area and various retail
                         centers within the City, recycle underused property, and increase and
                         preserve the City’s supply of affordable housing.
         Redevelopment   A Redevelopment Project Area refers to an area within the City
            Project Area where the Redevelopment Agency is authorized to make findings of
                         blight, complete a redevelopment plan, and utilize tax-increment
                         financing to complete redevelopment projects.
 Property Tax-Increment  Property tax-increment financing is a funding mechanism created by
               Financing State law to finance redevelopment activities. The amount of money
                         allocated to the redevelopment agency in a city is equal to the
                         difference between property taxes in a given year and property taxes
                         generated in the “base year” in which the redevelopment plan was
                         adopted, allowing for a maximum two percent annual increase, less
                         any mandated “pass-throughs” to other government entities.
         Redevelopment   Sections 33334.2 and 33334.6 of the California Health and Safety
         Set-Aside Funds Code require redevelopment agencies to set aside 20 percent of the
                         tax increments to a special Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund
                         (Low/Mod Fund). The Low/Mod fund must be used to “increase,
                         improve, and preserve the community’s supply of low and moderate
                         income housing” within territorial jurisdiction of the agency (Section
                         33334.3[c]).
        Eminent Domain   Eminent domain refers to the authority of a government agency to
                         take or to authorize the taking of private property for public use.
                         Property owners must be compensated when property is taken under
                         eminent domain.

              La Mirada  The La Mirada Business Survey is distributed in even-numbered years
         Business Survey to local businesses for the purpose of obtaining information about the
                         environment in which they conduct business. The survey is designed
                         to gather specific information about businesses and steps the City or
                         Redevelopment Agency may take to improve La Mirada as a place to
                         do business.
E-4 March 2003                                                             La Mirada General Plan
                                                                                   Economic Element
                                                                           ECONOMIC PLAN
                         La Mirada’s economic strength lies in the industrial businesses that
                         occupy about 17 percent of the land area in the City. Most of the
                         industrial uses lie within the southern one-third of the City, separated
                         from residential neighborhoods by Stage Road and a major rail right-
                         of-way. Properties designated and used for industrial purposes are
                         highly accessible to cars and trucks and are served by railroads and
                         Interstate 5. The City has been able to maximize the attractiveness of
                         this area while minimizing impact on the community. This large,
                         exclusive, and well-developed area affords economic advantages to
                         those located within it. Room is available for plant expansion and for
                         assembling land for future development. These combined factors
                         make La Mirada’s industrial area a strong candidate for continued
                         growth and economic success.
                         The City enjoys a very strong nonretail sales base. While the retail
                         sales base is weaker, it could be improved through targeted actions by
                         the City and Redevelopment Agency.
          Challenges the Specifically, the City faces several challenges in its continued economic
              City Faces development efforts:
                         Major Commercial Centers in Neighboring Communities: La Mirada
                         lacks a major commercial center. Large value-oriented retail outlets in
                         neighboring communities present severe competition for smaller retail
                         centers. Lack of land and sites for a major retail center places the City
                         at a disadvantage.
                         Land and Sites for Retail Expansion: Little vacant land is available for
                         further development of established retail centers. Furthermore, many
                         retail centers are surrounded by single-family and multi-family
                         residential neighborhoods, making center expansion difficult.
                         Aesthetic Appearance of Retail Centers: Commercial centers
                         citywide show signs of aging and deferred maintenance, making difficult
                         the recruitment of high-end retail tenants due to perceived
                         obsolescence of the centers. Many centers have multiple owners,
                         resulting in inconsistent property maintenance and challenges to
                         property assembly into larger units more attractive to potential
                         tenants. The blighted condition of many of the City’s commercial
                         centers is not a good fit with the City’s high-end industrial properties
                         and quality housing stock.
La Mirada General Plan                                                                March 2003 E-5

Economic Element
                           Local Commercial Uses Desirable to Residents: City residents have
                           a relatively high median household income. Many shop outside the
                           City in more modern commercial centers.
                           Non-Retail Uses Within Commercial Centers: Many commercial
                           centers have large concentrations of office and service tenants relative
                           to retail tenants. This reduces potential sales tax revenue for the City.
    Plans to Meet These    The City’s economic target areas, goals, and policies respond to known
       Challenges – The    challenges. Economic development efforts will focus on:
                Priorities
                               1)     Revitalizing commercial centers to improve their physical
                                      appearance and to attract uses that contribute to the City’s
                                      tax base
                               2)     Diversifying uses within high-visibility areas, particularly within
                                      the Interstate 5 corridor
                               3)     Continuing to accommodate a broad range of industrial uses,
                                      and responding quickly as technology and products change
                                      over time
                               4)     Using available land-use regulatory tools to enhance all
                                      business areas
 Economic Revitalization   The plan for economic revitalization targets the following four types of
            Target Areas   commercial development within the areas identified in Figure E-1.
                           Most areas lie within a Redevelopment Project Area. Thus, the
                           Redevelopment Agency may be able to use its authority to work

                 Neighborhood Commercial Target Areas – These target areas are
                 suitable for low-intensity retail commercial activities oriented to
                 surrounding residential neighborhoods. Uses typically include small
                 pedestrian-oriented retail and service businesses as stand-alone
                 buildings or within small shopping centers.               Neighborhood
                 Commercial areas are designed to minimize impacts on adjacent areas
                 through site design and access, parking, landscaping, and lighting
                 standards.
                 Community Commercial Target Areas – These areas, located along
                 arterial roadways, are appropriate for a wide range of retail and
                 service uses that meet the present and prospective needs of the
                 community as a whole. Community Commercial areas are designed
                 to be attractive, compatible with adjacent residential land uses, and
                 easily accessible without disrupting traffic flows through the
                 community. Most properties within the Imperial Highway Specific Plan
                 Area are Community Commercial target areas.
                 Freeway Commercial Target Areas – These areas are appropriate for
                 large and intense commercial, service, and office uses adjacent to
                 Interstate 5. Freeway Commercial uses serve the entire community,
                 as well as customers from outside the City traveling on the freeway.
                 Office Commercial Target Areas – These areas are suitable for
                 professional services offices and business activities involving relatively
                 low volumes of direct consumer contact. Office Commercial areas
                 also serve as buffers between residential areas and more intense
                 commercial or industrial development.
                 The City’s Zoning Ordinance establishes four zoning districts to
                 implement the target area approach to economic development.
                 Other target areas are within Planned Unit Developments (PUDs).

                                                                                   Economic Element
                           In addition to implementing the target area strategy, the City will make
                           economic development decisions relative to the following issues in
                           accordance with the goals and policies contained in this Element.
         A Fiscally Stable La Mirada residents enjoy high median incomes, and the City’s early
              Community    planning initiatives, community spirit, low crime rate, excellent
                           industrial growth, and favorable business climate have all contributed
                           to the fiscal success of La Mirada. These resources are projected to
                           continue as the City continues to attract and retain point-of-sale
                           industries within the industrial corridor south of Stage Road and along
                           Interstate 5. This atmosphere creates confidence for potential
                           investors seeking long-term commitments in the City.
                           Goal 1.0        Continue to achieve fiscal stability through a
                                           diversified tax base.
                           Policy 1.1      Continue to pursue and retain commercial and
                                           industrial businesses which generate sales tax from sales
                                           to local and regional consumers.
                           Policy 1.2      Develop redevelopment strategies for focused areas in
                                           the community that can benefit from economic
                                           enhancement.
                           Policy 1.3      Encourage diversification of businesses to support the
                                           local economy and provide a stable revenue stream.
                           Policy 1.4      Promote La Mirada as a business-friendly community.
   Increased Diversity of  La Mirada’s industrial sector
          Industrial Uses  has been responsible for
                           providing a significant portion
                           of revenues used to fund City
                           services and ensure the long-
                           term fiscal stability of the
                           community. Conversion of
                           the former Ford Motors
                           staging area into a business
                           park has led to increased
                           diversity of industrial uses within the City. Conversion of this area has
                           also created a substantial number of new jobs and an increase in sales
                           tax and redevelopment revenues for the City. Future redevelopment
                           and enhancement efforts south of the rail line and identification of tax-
                           producing opportunities remain priorities for the City’s economy.

Economic Element
                         Goal 2.0        Maintain a healthy industrial sector.
                         Policy 2.1      Encourage diversification of industrial business
                                         opportunities to ensure long-term stability of the City’s
                                         tax base.
                         Policy 2.2      Capitalize on economic opportunities and benefits
                                         resulting from widening Interstate 5.
                         Policy 2.3      Target key industries for location in the industrial
                                         sector to promote a balance of business opportunities.
                         Policy 2.4      Attract businesses that expand                employment
                                         opportunities at all skill and wage levels.
  Business Retention and Maintaining La Mirada’s healthy industrial and commercial base while
              Expansion  accommodating new business opportunities represents a primary
                         economic development objective. Industrial businesses provide a
                         variety of jobs and provide sales tax revenue that furthers the City’s
                         goals for fiscal stability. Commercial businesses provide goods and
                         support services for City residents and local businesses. The La Mirada
                         Theatre Center and other neighborhood centers provide services to
                         community residents. Providing an environment conducive to business
                         is an important component of the overall economic strategy.
                         Goal 3.0        Attract and retain key businesses that support the
                                         community.
                         Policy 3.1      Maintain a strong marketing program that promotes La
                                         Mirada as a desirable place to conduct business.
                         Policy 3.2      Attract local and regional commercial uses desirable for
                                         residents.
                         Policy 3.3      Institute aggressive programs to retain established,
                                         viable industrial and commercial businesses.
       Zoning and Code   Zoning and code enforcement work to articulate land use and
            Enforcement  community aesthetic goals.          The blighted condition of many
                         commercial centers is not a good fit with the City’s image. Zoning and
                         code enforcement can be used effectively to improve these
                         commercial centers and attract the types of businesses desired by
                         residents.

                       Goal 4.0   Rehabilitate and improve commercial centers.
                       Policy 4.1 Vigorously enforce City codes, including building,
                                  zoning, and health and safety codes to promote
                                  property maintenance.
                       Policy 4.2 Encourage rehabilitation and modernization of
                                  shopping centers and commercial centers to present a
                                  more coherent business image.
                       Policy 4.3 Establish architectural and design standards to ensure
                                  consistency and quality of building design, facades,
                                  signage, and landscaping.

                                                     CIRCULATION ELEMENT
                                           The circulation element is not simply a transportation plan.
                             It is an infrastructure plan addressing the circulation of people, goods,
                                       energy, water, sewage, storm drainage, and communications.
                                                               -- California General Plan Guidelines
                                                                               INTRODUCTION
                         La Mirada has a well-developed circulation system consisting of arterial
                         roadways and local streets. These connect all parts of the City and
                         provide for efficient, safe, and convenient traffic movement with
                         minimum disruption to residential neighborhoods. Other modes of
                         transportation also integrated into the City’s circulation system include
                         bikeways and pedestrian walkways that provide alternatives to the
                         automobile. The City operates a successful Dial-A-Ride service to
                         supplement local public transit resources. Additionally, railroad lines
                         and Interstate 5 serve the needs of the industrial area of the City.
                         This Circulation Element emphasizes the maintenance of a balanced
                         multi-modal transportation system for the City that responds to
                         demand of current and planned land uses, as set forth in the Land Use
                         Element.
   Scope and Content of  The State General Plan Guidelines suggest that Circulation Element
 the Circulation Element policies and plans:
                              •    Coordinate transportation and circulation systems with
                                   planned land uses
                              •    Promote the safe and efficient transport of goods and the safe
                                   and effective movement of all populations
                              •    Make efficient use of existing transportation facilities
                         The circulation system should accommodate the level of traffic
                         generated by current and future development, both in terms of
                         distribution and intensity. This Circulation Element addresses the
                         City’s anticipated future transportation and circulation needs in the
                         context of the following topics:
                              •    Local Street System
                              •    Freeway Considerations
                              •    Alternative Transportation
                              •    Rail Circulation
                              •    Telecommunications Infrastructure

Circulation Element
                    Telecommunications represent a vital component of the circulation
                    system in that people can use telecommunications facilities to “move”
                    themselves to locations without a vehicle.           By substituting
                    teleconferencing and telecommuting for work trips, people can
                    effectively reduce the number of cars on the local and regional road
                    networks.

                                                                                        Circulation Element
                                                       IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS
                                 The definitions below highlight key technical terms used in this
                                 Element to discuss traffic and transportation issues.
          Level of Service       Level of Service, or LOS, describes the efficiency and quality of traffic
                                 operations. Six categories of LOS ⎯ the letter designations A to F ⎯
                                 are used to identify traffic conditions, with LOS A representing
                                 excellent conditions and LOS F representing extreme congestion.
                                 The LOS designations correspond to volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios
                                 calculated for roadways. For example, a roadway that carries 16,000
                                 vehicles per day, with the capacity to accommodate 20,000 vehicles
                                 per day, has a V/C of 0.80.
                                 Table C-1 shows V/C ranges and the corresponding LOS, with a

           Transportation   A population’s travel behavior strongly affects roadway congestion and
  Demand Management         peak-hour traffic in particular. The typical 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. work
                            week puts millions of people onto the same roadways during the
                            same work commute hours. Transportation Demand Management,
                            or TDM, represents one approach to modifying travel behavior,
                            especially in the area of home-to-work trips. Many TDM strategies
                            focus on increasing interest in alternative modes of transportation for
                            work commutes, as well as developing other alternatives designed to
                            manage, manipulate, and maximize the use of existing transportation
                            facilities. Examples of such strategies include subsidies that encourage
                            public transit or vanpool ridership and preferential parking for
                            carpoolers.
                Intelligent Intelligent Transportation Systems, or ITS, provide alternate strategies
 Transportation Systems     to cities facing traffic congestion problems that cannot be resolved
                            with roadway capacity enhancements such as roadway widening and
                            lane restriping. The application of ITS technology allows a city to
                            control traffic by using advanced computer and communication
                            technologies, such as timed signal system technologies. These systems
                            reduce travel times, vehicle delay, and overall congestion by reducing
                            the number of delays and stops at intersections, thereby improving
                            traffic flow and enhancing system operations, monitoring, and control.
                            Additional benefits accrued from the application of ITS include safety
                            and traveler information. Monitoring systems such as cameras filming
                            high-congestion areas provide opportunities for information
                            technologies and dissemination, such as live feed into closed-circuit
                            television.
          Street/Highway    La Mirada has designated roadways according to function, illustrated in
            Classifications Figure C-1. The public street system consists of the three roadway
                            classifications.1 These classifications are:
                                 •    Major Arterials - Major Arterial roadways provide an 84-foot
                                      curb-to-curb width within a 100-foot right-of-way. These
                                      geometrics allow for a four-lane divided street with a capacity
                                      up to 40,000 to 60,000 vehicles per day. (This classification is
                                      the same as Los Angeles County’s Major Highway classification.
                                      From a function and design perspective, these two terms
                                      describe the same type of roadway since roadway
                                      infrastructure has been constructed to County standards.)
                                 •    Minor Arterials - Minor Arterial roadways provide a 64- to
                                      68-foot curb-to-curb width within an 80- to 88-foot right-of-
                                      way. These geometrics allow for either a four-lane divided
                                      street (similar to a Principal Arterial) or a four-lane undivided
                            1
                               The City’s classification system corresponds to the system adopted by the Federal Highway
                            Administration (FHWA) in the following manner, with the City’s nomenclature indicated first:
                            Major Arterial = Major Highway and Minor Arterial = Secondary Highway. The FHWA
                            hierarchy does not include local streets.

                            •    Local Street - Local streets are two-lane undivided roadways
                                 designed to serve local circulation, with traffic characterized by low
                                 volumes of vehicles traveling at slower speeds. Generally, a local
                                 street is not intended to handle through traffic. This classification
                                 provides a 36-foot curb-to-curb width within a 50-foot right-of-

                          La Mirada is part of a large metropolitan area and of necessity, must
                          integrate its local street system with existing and planned regional
                          systems. Transportation planning and management require
                          cooperation and coordination among many state, county, and regional
                          agencies. Relevant agencies include Caltrans, the Los Angeles County
                          Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the Southern
                          California Association of Governments (SCAG), and the South Coast
                          Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), which addresses air
                          quality issues associated with vehicle traffic. These agencies have
                          federal and State mandates to adopt transportation-related programs
                          that affect La Mirada (and other jurisdictions throughout the area).
 Regional Transportation  The Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) is a component of the Regional
                     Plan Comprehensive Plan and Guide prepared by SCAG to address regional
                          issues, goals, objectives, and policies for the Southern California region
                          into the early part of the 21st century. The RTP, which SCAG
                          periodically updates to address changing conditions in the Southland,
                          has been developed with active participation from local agencies
                          throughout the region, elected officials, the business community,
                          community groups, private institutions, and private citizens. The RTP
                          sets broad goals for the region and provides strategies to reduce
                          problems related to congestion and mobility. RTP goals relevant to La
                          Mirada include:
                          •   Improving the levels of service for the movement of people and
                              goods
                          •   Ensuring that transportation investment provides the greatest
                              possible mobility benefit
                          •   Serving the transportation needs of everyone
                          •   Developing regional transportation solutions that complement
                              subregional transportation systems and serve the needs of cities
                              and communities
                          In recognition of the close relationship between the traffic and air
                          quality issues, the assumptions, goals, and programs contained in the
                          Plan parallel those used to prepare the Air Quality Management Plan.

 Interstate 5 Consortium Interstate 5 bisects La Mirada’s industrial area near the southern City
                         limit. The freeway provides residents and businesses with excellent
                         access to San Diego County, Orange County, and the greater Los
                         Angeles metropolitan area. Interstate 5 represents the principal
                         north-south travelway through Southern and Northern California. As
                         metropolitan areas have grown, I-5 has been improved along key
                         stretches to accommodate additional traffic. La Mirada participates in
                         the I-5 Consortium, which is composed of area cities working with
                         Caltrans to modernize and increase the capacity of I-5 through south
                         Los Angeles County.
Air Quality Management   The federal Clean Air Act requires preparation of plans to improve air

                         The plan must outline specific programs and strategies ⎯ and
                         timelines ⎯ for bringing the area into compliance with national and/or
                         state air quality standards.
                         The Air Quality Management Plan prepared by the SCAQMD, first
                         adopted in 1994 and updated on a three-year cycle, contains policies
                         and measures designed to achieve federal and state standards for
                         healthier air quality in the South Coast Air Basin. Many of the
                         programs address circulation improvements, since fossil-fuel-powered
                         vehicles account for more than 60 percent of the NOx emissions and
                         70 percent of the carbon monoxide emissions within the basin.

                                                                                     Circulation Element
                                                                         CIRCULATION PLAN
                           La Mirada is a community with a well-defined street system. This
                           system of arterial roadways and local streets has limited opportunity
                           to expand or to accommodate increased traffic resulting from growth
                           outside of La Mirada as well as within the City. Much of the traffic
                           growth over the long term will result from regional growth, given that
                           General Plan land use policy provides for only a modest level of new
                           development in the City. Thus, the Circulation Plan sets forth goals
                           and policies to: 1) ensure the street system accommodates future
                           traffic levels; 2) address and plan for potential impacts resulting from
                           the I-5 expansion; 3) encourage increased use of alternative modes of
                           transportation; 4) plan for safe and efficient rail traffic; and 5) promote
                           traffic safety.
  Circulation Master Plan  The Circulation Master Plan, Figure C-2, identifies the arterial
                           roadways and local streets that comprise La Mirada’s circulation
                           system.
Accommodating Vehicles     As described in the Terms and Concepts section of this Element, La
       on the Local Street Mirada’s road system includes the following three roadway
                  System   classifications: Major Arterial, Minor Arterial, and Local Street. As
                           Figure C-2 shows, the Major Arterials – Alondra Boulevard, Artesia
                           Boulevard, Beach Boulevard, Firestone Boulevard North, Hillsborough
                           Drive, Imperial Highway, La Mirada Boulevard, Leffingwell Road,
                           Rosecrans Avenue, Santa Gertrudes Avenue, Telegraph Road, and
                           Valley View Avenue – provide access to virtually all areas of the
                           community.
                           The Minor Arterials supplement the major circulation system. These
                           include Adelfa Drive, Alicante Road, Biola Avenue, Firestone
                           Boulevard South, Foster Road, Knott Avenue, Marquardt Avenue,
                           Stage Road, and Trojan Way. These streets function as collector
                           streets by moving cars from residential neighborhoods to the Major
                           Arterials. The arterial street network provides an efficient flow of
                           traffic to places of importance while protecting residential
                           neighborhoods.
                           The Circulation Master Plan (Figure C-2) does not provide for any
                           new streets or significant modifications to the street system. Minor
                           improvements needed to maintain good traffic flow include the
                           following:

                                                                                Circulation Element
                            •   Increasing intersection capacity at key locations (see Figure C-
                                2) by both physical improvements, where feasible, and
                                installation of intelligent transportation system (ITS)
                                improvements
                       As regional traffic growth places more vehicles on the City’s Major
                       Arterials, over time the need may arise to increase the number of
                       travel lanes on La Mirada Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue, within the
                       designated 100-foot right-of-way. The City will monitor conditions
                       and only consider such improvements when needed.
                       Local roadways in the City must provide safe and convenient access to
                       shopping, schools, recreation, and business centers. Planning for safe
                       and convenient roadways includes consideration of the intensity of use
                       and condition of the roadways. Streets must be periodically repaired
                       and rehabilitated to maintain their performance. Aware of the
                       substantial capital investment of public roads, the City has
                       implemented a comprehensive street maintenance program designed
                       to maintain streets in optimum condition, and has completed an
                       infrastructure assessment study to determine future roadway
                       deficiencies.
                       The City has designated a number of streets as truck routes to ensure
                       the orderly movement of commercial vehicles carrying goods and
                       materials through the community. Truck routes include Artesia
                       Boulevard, Beach Boulevard, Firestone Boulevard North, Firestone
                       Boulevard South, Imperial Highway, Leffingwell Road, Telegraph Road,
                       and Valley View Avenue. The truck routes in La Mirada connect with
                       truck routes in adjacent cities to form an integrated surface street
                       network for the movement of trucks. These routes may change over
                       time in response to shifts in regional truck travel patterns.
                       Goal 1.0           Ensure that the City’s local and arterial street system
                                           operates efficiently and is well-maintained.
                       Policy 1.1         To the extent feasible, maintain traffic flows at
                                          nonresidential signalized intersections at Level of
                                          Service “E”. Maintain Level of Service “D” in residential
                                          neighborhoods.
                       Policy 1.2         Increase intersection capacity and traffic flow by using
                                          intelligent transportation signal (ITS) system
                                          improvements.

Circulation Element
                        Policy 1.3      Monitor traffic volumes on arterial roadways on a
                                        regular basis, and consider adjustments to the system
                                        as needed to achieve Level of Service goals. In
                                        particular, consider the future need to modify La
                                        Mirada Boulevard and/or Rosecrans Avenue to provide
                                        six travel lanes.
                        Policy 1.4      Continue to implement capital improvement programs
                                        to ensure maintenance and rehabilitation of local
                                        streets.
                        Policy 1.5      Cooperate with surrounding jurisdictions and other
                                        responsible agencies to provide efficient traffic
                                        management along Imperial Highway, Beach Boulevard,
                                        and other regional routes.
 Freeway Considerations The regional transportation system includes freeways and state and
                        county highway thoroughfares that provide City residents and the
                        business community with access to the greater Los Angeles area and
                        points beyond. La Mirada benefits from ready access to the Interstate
                        5, as well as State Highway 91 (Artesia-Riverside Freeway), located
                        just to the south.
                        Since the late 1980s, Caltrans has incrementally widened I-5 through
                        northern Orange County to accommodate traffic growth and improve
                        the condition of one of California’s oldest freeways. Long-range plans
                        to extend the widening/improvement project through La Mirada will
                        directly impact the City, both in terms of freeway access/capacity and
                        the effect on businesses along I-5.
                        La Mirada stands to benefit from improved access and enhanced
                        operations. Congested conditions at the Valley View interchange and
                        awkward access and flow along North and South Firestone Boulevards
                        can be alleviated. Commercial businesses along both sides of I-5 will
                        receive better visual exposure. As described in the Land Use and
                        Economic Elements, the City will work with the I-5 Consortium and
                        Caltrans to maximize the circulation and land use benefits resulting
                        from I-5 improvements.
                        Goal 2.0        Achieve a safe and efficient freeway system.
                        Policy 2.1      Work closely with Caltrans’ to ensure that Interstate 5
                                        improvements do not adversely impact mobility along
                                        the City’s connecting arterial system.
                        Policy 2.2      Support Caltrans’ efforts to improve interchanges along
                                        Interstate 5 at Valley View Avenue and Alondra
                                        Boulevard to improve access to La Mirada’s business
                                        sector.

                                                                                 Circulation Element
              Alternative Alternative transportation modes offer an option for travel without
          Transportation  the use of a private automobile. Alternative transportation modes
                          include:
                              •    Bicycles
                              •    Walking
                              •    Public Transit
                              •    Air Transportation
           Bicycle Routes La Mirada has adopted a Master Plan of Bikeways that includes over
                          14 miles of bicycle lanes along streets (Class III) and dedicated multi-
                          use trails (Class I). Figure C-3 illustrates the City’s bicycle and trails
                          master plan.
                          To a large extent, the City’s Master Plan of Bikeways is consistent with
                          the Los Angeles County MTA Regional Bikeway Master Plan.
                          However, the MTA plan designates Imperial Highway as a proposed
                          Regional Bikeway. The City prefers a Rosecrans Avenue alignment for
                          the principal east-west regional bikeway crossing through the City, due
                          to the high traffic volumes and adjacent uses associated with Imperial
                          Highway. For these reasons, Imperial Highway is not recommended
                          as a bikeway in the City’s Master Plan.
                          As discussed in the Open Space and Conservation Element, plans for
                          the Coyote Creek Bikeway - traversing La Habra, La Mirada, Fullerton,
                          and Buena Park - will provide a Class I facility over a ten-mile or more
                          length.     Bikeways, in addition to serving as viable modes of
                          transportation, provide valuable and welcome recreation
                          opportunities.
       Pedestrian Routes  To enhance pedestrian movement within the community, sidewalks
                          must be provided in new developments. The City is committed to a
                          multi-year program of installing handicapped access ramps at locations
                          throughout the community. The sidewalk system in La Mirada will
                          continue to be maintained at a high level to ensure pedestrian safety.
           Public Transit Public transit helps reduce congestion, improves the efficiency of the
                          street system, has the long-term benefit of improving air quality, and
                          can be designed to meet special needs of residents. An effective
                          public transportation system must include convenient pick-up and
                          drop-off locations, safe and well-lighted stops, a wide range of routes
                          that take people where they need to go, and schedules that fit
                          community needs. These regional and local transit service providers

                            spurs extend into industrial development, but these lines largely are
                            not used. The main lines, however, continue to move cargo and
                            commute passengers.
                            The Stage Road line carries significant freight train traffic through the
                            City every day. The primary issue associated with the freight traffic is
                            the lack of grade separations at Valley View Avenue in La Mirada and
                            Rosecrans Avenue in Santa Fe Springs. Commuter trains operate
                            primarily during the peak commute hours, stopping just west of La
                            Mirada at the Norwalk Transit Station.
                            Goal 4.0        Maintain a safe and efficient railroad system.
                            Policy 4.1      Work with railroad companies to install a grade
                                            separation at Valley View Avenue to reduce
                                            congestion and noise caused by trains.
                            Policy 4.2      Support efforts by the city of Santa Fe Springs to install
                                            a grade separation at Rosecrans Avenue to reduce
                                            congestion in La Mirada.

                                                                                            Circulation Element
                                        TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE
                       Up-to-date cable, cellular, and similar communications systems that
                       provide video, voice, and data services provide potential means of
                       reducing vehicle traffic and the associated congestion and air and noise
                       pollution. Maintaining the adequacy of communications infrastructure
                       contributes to the quality of life for La Mirada residents and businesses.
                       Goal 5.0              Ensure that La Mirada remains at the forefront in
                                             providing telecommunications infrastructure.
                       Policy 5.1            Encourage the private sector to participate in and be
                                             the primary provider of telecommunications
                                             infrastructure and services for the community.
                       Policy 5.2            Protect the public’s assets and community aesthetics
                                             against unmitigated impacts of above-ground
                                             telecommunications infrastructure development.
                       Policy 5.3            Encourage the further development, maintenance, and
                                             accessibility of the telecommunications system for La
                                             Mirada businesses and residents.

                                                                             INTRODUCTION
                         Public safety is a primary concern in any community. People
                         recognize that a low crime rate and reliable emergency response
                         services contribute to the overall livability of their community.
                         Equally important contributors to community health and safety are
                         sound utility infrastructure and service systems; safe handling,
                         transport, and disposal of hazardous materials; and abatement of
                         excessive noise. Reliable water and sewer systems, adequate storm
                         drains and flood control facilities, regulation of hazardous materials,
                         and control of transportation corridor-related noise guard against
                         threats to public health.
   Scope and Content of  The Safety and Community Services Element addresses hazards in the
          the Safety and physical and built environments, and presents goals and policies that
     Community Services  focus on reducing the potential risk of death, injuries, property
                Element  damage, and economic and social dislocation from hazards. Hazards
                         include earthquakes, excessive noise, and hazardous materials
                         associated with commercial and industrial business activity. In addition,
                         this Element also addresses the fire and law enforcement services
                         needed to safeguard the community.
                         Safety and community service issues relevant to La Mirada include:
                             •   Seismic Hazards
                             •   Flood Hazards

Safety and Community Services Element
                             IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS
                             This Element uses the following technical terms to discuss earthquakes
                             and noise.
  Earthquake Magnitude       La Mirada lies within a region where earthquakes are not an
                             uncommon occurrence. Earthquakes result from a shift or movement
                             along weak points in the earth. Scientists use the term magnitude to
                             describe the relative energy release by such movement. An
                             earthquake’s magnitude is based on the size of the earthquake’s
                             seismic waves, which are recorded on a seismograph. Magnitude
                             generally is rated and expressed using a logarithmic scale.
                             The amount of energy released from a 6.0 earthquake, for example, is
                             10 times greater than that associated with a 5.0 event. Scientists
                             consider a large earthquake as one having a magnitude of 7.0 or
                             greater. For purposes of comparison, the 1987 Whittier earthquake
                             registered a 5.9 magnitude, while the 1994 Northridge earthquake
                             registered a 6.7 magnitude.
           Noise Metrics     Noise generally is defined as unwanted or intrusive sound. Because
                             noise consists of pitch, loudness, and duration, describing noise with a
                             single unit of measure presents a challenge. The A-weighted decibel
                             scale (dBA) has been developed to describe the loudness of a sound
                             or sound environment based on the sensitivity of the human ear.
                             Table SCS-1 indicates criteria the State has established to reduce
                             adverse noise effects on human health.

                       The dBA descriptor only reports noise from a single source or
                       combination of sources at a point in time. To allow a more
                       comprehensive description of a noise environment, federal and State
                       agencies have established noise and land use compatibility guidelines
                       that use averaging approaches to noise measurement.                 Two
                       measurement scales commonly used in California are the Community
                       Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and the day-night level (Ldn). To
                       account for increased human sensitivity at night, the CNEL level
                       includes a 5-decibel penalty on noise during the 7:00 a.m. to 10:00
                       p.m. time period and a 10-decibel penalty on noise during the 10:00
                       p.m. to 7:00 a.m. time period. The Ldn level includes only the 10
                       decibel weighting for late-night noise. These values are nearly identical
                       for all but unusual noise sources.

                                                       RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
                             Plans and programs related to public safety include the State Seismic
                             Hazards Mapping Act, the California Environmental Quality Act
                             (CEQA) Law and Guidelines, California Noise Insulation Standards
                             (Title 24), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
                             Flood Insurance Program. Other plans and programs are important
                             to consider to ensure that the City has strong comprehensive and
                             compatible tools to guide development decisions. Also, pursuant to
                             State law, the City has developed a comprehensive emergency
                             response plan.
Standardized Emergency       La Mirada participates in the Standardized Emergency Management
    Management System        System (SEMS) that provides a framework for coordinating multi-
                             agency emergency responses. The City’s SEMS incorporates mutual
                             aid agreements, establishes lines of communication during
                             emergencies, and standardizes incident command structures.
  Community Awareness        La Mirada participates in Community Awareness and Emergency
          and Emergency      Response (CAER), a group consisting of local chemical companies,

                             agencies work together to recognize potential hazards that exist in the
                             community and mitigate potential problems.
   Disaster Preparedness     The Disaster Preparedness Steering Committee, a community
      Steering Committee     committee that promotes emergency preparedness, has over 60
                             agency members of local businesses, schools, hospitals, churches,
                             media, neighborhood watch groups, and governmental agencies.
          Annual Disaster    The City conducts an annual citywide emergency response drill every

         Seismic Hazards     California’s Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 requires the State
             Mapping Act     Geologist to compile maps identifying and describing seismic hazard
                             zones throughout California. Guidelines prepared by the State Mining
                             and Geology Board identify the responsibilities of State and local
                             agencies in the review of development within seismic hazard zones.
                             Development on a site that has been designated as a seismic hazard
                             zone requires a geotechnical report and local agency consideration of
                             policies and criteria established by the Mining and Geology Board.
                             Over the years, the program has expanded to include mapping of
                             seismic-related hazards such as landslide-prone areas.

California Environmental     The State legislature adopted CEQA in 1970 to ensure that
   Quality Act Guidelines    environmental protection received due consideration in the planning
                             and development process. CEQA requires a thorough analysis of
                             potential environmental consequences which could result from a
                             development project or plan that guides future development. CEQA
                             provides a means by which City officials and the public can identify the
                             potential impacts a project will have on a community, and to allow for
                             mitigation or avoidance of such impacts.
          California Noise   In 1974, the California Commission on Housing and Community
     Insulation Standards    Development adopted noise insulation standards for residential
                 (Title 24)  buildings (Title 24, Part 2, California Code of Regulations). Title 24
                             establishes standards for interior room noise (attributable to outside
                             noise sources). The regulations also specify that acoustical studies
                             must be prepared whenever a residential building or structure is
                             proposed to be located near an existing or adopted freeway route,
                             expressway, parkway, major street, thoroughfare, rail line, rapid transit
                             line, or industrial noise source, and where such noise source or
                             sources create an exterior CNEL (or Ldn) of 60 dB or greater. Such
                             acoustical analysis must demonstrate that the residence has been
                             designed to limit intruding noise to an interior CNEL (or Ldn) of at
                             least 45 dB.
National Flood Insurance     The National Flood Insurance Act includes provisions for the National
                  Program    Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Participating jurisdictions must
                             exercise land use controls and purchase flood insurance as a
                             prerequisite for receiving funds to purchase or build a structure in a
                             flood hazard area. The NFIP provides federal flood insurance subsidies
                             and federally financed loans for eligible property owners in flood-
                             prone areas.
                             Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) are within the 100-year flood
                             plain. SFHAs consist of Zones A, AE, AH, AO, AR, V, VE, and A99, as
                             identified on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). Portions of the City
                             are also within the 500-year floodplain, as identified by Zone B on the
                             FIRM.

  Faults and Earthquakes     California has always been seismically active. Few areas in Southern
                             California have not been, or will not be, affected by strong ground
                             shaking from earthquakes (Figure SCS-1). Eleven faults play a role in
                             the seismic characteristics of the Los Angeles region, of which the
                             Division of Mines and Geology classified six as “active.” An active fault,
                             as defined in the Alquist Priolo Special Studies Zone Act, is one with
                             evidence of movement within the last 10,000 years. Three of the six
                             active faults play a role in the seismic characteristics of La Mirada.
   Whittier-Elsinore Fault   Located four miles north of La Mirada, the Whittier-Elsinore Fault is a
                             northwest trending fault continuing eastward from Alhambra through
                             the Santa Ana Mountains to the Mexican border. The fault zone has
                             moderate activity, having produced numerous historic magnitude 4
                             earthquakes and a few magnitude 5 shocks. Seismicity attributable to
                             the northern section of the Whittier Fault has been relatively low;
                             however, recent studies indicate the microseismicity in the Puente
                             Hills is high.
Newport-Inglewood Fault      Located 12 miles west of La Mirada, the fault consists of an echelon
                    Zone     series of north west trending faults reaching from the southern edge
                             of the Santa Monica Mountains southeastward to the offshore area
                             near Newport Beach. High historic seismic activity is suggested by
                             numerous shocks greater than 4 and by the historic magnitude 6.3
                             Long Beach earthquake centered offshore near Newport Beach on
                             March 11, 1933. Although there has been no observed displacement
                             associated with the Newport-Inglewood Fault zone, subsurface fault
                             displacement of approximately seven inches associated with the
                             October 21, 1941 4.5 magnitude earthquake occurred. This fault is
                             capable of generating a 7.0 magnitude earthquake within the next 50
                             to 100 years.
            Verdugo Fault    Located 20 miles northwest of La Mirada, the Verdugo Fault bounds
                             the south flank of the Verdugo Mountains and appears to merge with
                             the Eagle Rock-San Rafael Fault system in the vicinity of the Verdugo
                             Wash. Low-magnitude earthquakes occasionally recorded in the
                             Burbank-Glendale area may be attributed to activity along the
                             Verdugo Fault. However, no direct evidence of ground displacement
                             has been observed is association with these low-magnitude events.
                             This fault has a high potential for future activity, but is not considered
                             active.
 Seismic-related Hazards     The City is located between the Norwalk Fault on the south and the
                             Whittier Fault on the North. The City is situated near the crest of an
                             anticlimal (upfold) structure which separates the synclinal (downfold)

                             considered likely to occur on an active fault affecting the City, will
                             generate average bedrock accelerations of approximately 0.2g with a
                             total ground shaking duration of 10 to 20 seconds. Although the
                             Norwalk Fault which traverses the City at depth is not considered an
                             active fault, historic earthquakes of minor magnitude have possibly
                             occurred with a magnitude of 4.7.
         Ground Shaking      Ground shaking is an expected occurrence of any earthquake; the
                             degree of ground shaking is dependent on the distance from the
                             epicenter. Strong shaking lasts a few seconds in a moderate
                             earthquake and as long as four minutes in a large earthquake. Shaking
                             is exaggerated on loose, water-saturated ground, and is less damaging
                             on solid rock. Ground shaking can be expected in La Mirada from any
                             one of several faults located in the region. This emphasizes the need
                             for all new development projects to incorporate appropriate design
                             features to guard against widespread property damage and loss of life
                             in the event of an earthquake.
           Ground Failure    Various types of ground failure accompany earthquakes. These
                             include landslides; fracturing, cracking, and fissuring; compaction,
                             subsidence, and uplift; and liquefaction.
                             Landslides: Most of the City has relatively flat topography. However,
                             the steep terrain in the northeast portion of the City creates
                             conditions where damage from earthquake-induced landslides is
                             possible. Figure SCS-2 shows those areas susceptible to landslides,
                             according to the State of California Department of Conservation,
                             Division of Mines and Geology Seismic Hazards Zone Map.
                             Fracturing, Cracking, and Fissuring: This type of ground failure may
                             result from a seismic event on the Norwalk Fault in the area near the
                             Norwalk Fault.
                             Liquefaction: In locations where high groundwater levels interact with
                             loose, unconsolidated soils, a condition called liquefaction can occur,
                             whereby such soils lose cohesion – and their ability to support
                             structures – when subjected to strong ground motion. According to
                             the State of California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines
                             and Geology Seismic Hazards Map, La Mirada is susceptible to
                             liquefaction in the southern portion of the City, as well as in
                             continuous bands which follow drainage areas east to west across the
                             City (Figure SCS-2).

                       La Mirada lies within the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles County Flood
                       Control District. The District is primarily responsible for the
                       abatement of flood control hazards, conservation of water resources,
                       elimination of soil erosion, and reduction of water pollution. The
                       District controls La Mirada Creek and portions of the Coyote Creek
                       Channel. However, portions of the Coyote Creek Channel within the
                       City are under the jurisdiction of the Orange County Flood Control
                       District.
                       Historically, flooding has affected large areas of the City, but efforts to
                       control flooding with the improvement of La Mirada Creek as a
                       controlled flood facility have been successful in reducing flood hazards.
                       Although portions of La Mirada Creek are still subject to overflow, the
                       associated hazards are not a threat to life or property. Therefore, the
                       only risk would be attributed to significant blockage along La Mirada
                       Creek or Coyote Creek. Figure SCS-3 shows those areas within the
                       City which are subject to 100- and 500- year flood events.
                       As described in the Open Space and Conservation Element,
                       innovative design and joint use of flood control facilities allow La
                       Mirada Creek to function as an open space resource rather than a
                       traditional flood control facility. Strategically located check dams
                       control flood runoff. The landscaped areas of La Mirada Creek Park
                       allow water to percolate into the groundwater supply. This conserves
                       water resources and the load on existing flood control facilities.
                       Because the greenbelt is a natural watershed, valuable topsoil is
                       conserved, reducing erosion and pollution of waters reaching
                       conventional flood control channels. Reduced pollution of these
                       waters makes reclamation of flood runoff waters more economical.
                       Goal 2.0          Maintain adequate flood hazard prevention.
                       Policy 2.1        Coordinate with the Los Angeles County Department
                                         of Public Works and other responsible agencies to
                                         address conditions that cause drainage channels to
                                         back up during storms.
                       Policy 2.2        Continue participation     in   federal   flood   hazard
                                         prevention programs.

                                                              Safety and Community Services Element
                                                            HUMAN ACTIVITY HAZARDS
                       The California Health and Safety Code defines a hazardous material as
                       any material that, because of its quantity, concentration, or physical or
                       chemical characteristics, poses a significant potential hazard to human
                       health and safety or to the environment. Therefore, the use, storage,
                       manufacture, or transport of hazardous materials is considered a
                       human activity hazard.
                       Commercial and industrial businesses in the City that use hazardous
                       materials include dry cleaners, film processors, auto service providers,
                       landscape contractors, and beverage manufacturers, among others.
                       Residences also generate household hazardous wastes in the form of
                       paints, thinners, pesticides, fertilizers, etc.
                       Hazardous waste generators and users in the City are required to
                       comply with regulations enforced by several federal, State, and County
                       agencies. The regulations aim toward reducing risk associated with
                       human exposure to hazardous materials and minimizing adverse
                       environmental effects. The Los Angeles County Fire Department
                       Health Hazardous Materials Division tracks hazardous material
                       handlers to ensure appropriate reporting and compliance.
                       In the event of a hazardous material accidental release, the City’s
                       participation in the Standardized Emergency Management System
                       (SEMS) allows City staff to react quickly and appropriately to any
                       hazardous materials accident. The SEMS includes a provision for the
                       Fire Department to maintain records of all hazardous materials stored
                       and used at businesses in the community, thus ensuring appropriate
                       response to any individual incident. In addition to SEMS, the City
                       participates in Community Awareness and Emergency Response, a
                       group consisting of local chemical companies, businesses, law
                       enforcement, and governmental agencies.
                       To address household hazardous wastes, the City cooperates with the
                       County to sponsor programs that heighten awareness of household
                       hazardous wastes and the importance of proper storage and disposal.
                       Goal 3.0         Manage the use and transport of hazardous materials
                                        in La Mirada.
                       Policy 3.1       Cooperate with federal, State, and County agencies to
                                        reduce risks associated with the use and transport of
                                        hazardous materials.

                                                                    EMERGENCY SERVICES
                       The best way to address an emergency is to prevent it. However, if
                       an emergency cannot be avoided, adequate emergency response is
                       essential. The City’s location in a major metropolitan area and local
                       efforts to establish a responsive emergency staff have given the City
                       access to the best emergency response teams and support personnel
                       available. Emergency services providers include the Los Angeles
                       County Sheriff, the Los Angeles County Fire Department, and La
                       Mirada Community Hospital, among others.
                       In addition to having excellent emergency service providers, the City
                       maintains the Disaster Preparedness Steering Committee. This
                       committee has over 60 agency members, including local businesses,
                       schools, hospitals, churches, median, neighborhood watch groups, and
                       governmental agencies.
                       To test the City’s Emergency Operations Plan, the City       conducts an
                       annual disaster response exercise in November.               All schools,
                       businesses, churches, hospitals, Neighborhood Watch          groups, law
                       enforcement, neighboring cities, HAM radio operators         groups, and
                       other governmental agencies participate.
                       Goal 4.0        Set an example of emergency preparedness for other
                                       communities.
                       Policy 4.1      Keep the City’s Emergency Operations Plan up-to-date
                                       and relevant to the types of disasters affecting the
                                       community.
                       Policy 4.2      Promote continued public awareness of emergency
                                       procedures for residents, the business population, City
                                       staff, and public officials.
                       Policy 4.3      Continue to contract with experienced and well-
                                       qualified service providers for hazardous material
                                       response.

                                                                                             NOISE
                             Noise is defined as an undesirable sound and is considered an
                             environmental pollutant that can be damaging to human hearing.
                             Noise in the City results primarily from street, freeway, and rail traffic.
                             The commercial-industrial section of the City is separated from the
                             residential section in an effective manner. Along major arterial
                             roadways, walls and fences provide some means of shielding residents
                             from traffic noise. Thus, land use compatibility problems due to noise
                             are minimal. Localized sources of noise include typical residential
                             neighborhood sounds such as lawnmowers, children at play, and
                             barking dogs. The City controls localized noise through the noise
                             ordinance, which is part of the Municipal Code.
                             Noise becomes a concern when it consistently interferes with a
                             person’s ability to conduct everyday work and recreation activities.
                             For example, residents exposed to constant railroad noise may not
                             enjoy using the backyard. Other noise-sensitive uses, such as hospitals,
                             convalescent homes, schools, and churches, may find roadway noise
                             disruptive to outdoor activity. The planning for future land uses
                             requires potentially problematic sources of noise be identified and
                             noise/land use conflicts avoided to the extent possible, given the built-
                             out nature of the community.
           Baseline Noise    To establish a baseline against which to measure changes in the
            Environment      community noise environment over time, a noise modeling effort was
                             performed, with 2001 serving as the baseline year. Because vehicular
                             and rail traffic noise represent the dominant noise sources in the City,
                             the model focuses on traffic noise and the 24-hour ambient noise
                             conditions resulting from these sources. Figure SCS-4 shows the
                             CNEL contours for baseline year 2001. As Figure SCS-4 illustrates,
                             the City’s major and minor arterials, as well as the Burlington
                             Northern/Santa Fe railroad and Interstate 5 represent the major
                             sources of noise. A residential neighborhood along the Burlington
                             Northern/Santa Fe Railroad lies within the 75 CNEL contour.
                             Additionally, a number of residential neighborhoods are exposed to
                             traffic noise from major and minor arterials, such as Alondra
                             Boulevard, La Mirada Boulevard, Rosecrans Avenue, Valley View,
                             Imperial Highway, and Beach Boulevard.
                             The City has little direct control over noise produced by
                             transportation sources because State noise regulations for motor
                             vehicle noise preempt local regulations. Because the City cannot
                             control noise at the source, City noise programs focus on reducing the
                             impact of transportation noise on the community.

                             growth will be a moderate increase in traffic volumes citywide. Traffic
                             volume increases represent the only anticipated measurable new noise

                             areas in the City separated from incompatible residential uses.
                             Therefore, residential – industrial land use conflicts will be avoided.
                             Potential future ambient noise levels can be estimated by modeling.
                             Figure SCS-5 displays projected year 2021 noise contours based upon
                             future traffic levels. The City will experience very little change in
                             ambient noise levels due to traffic. For planning purposes, the change
                             will be imperceptible. Along most of the roadways included in the
                             noise model, the increase of noise exposure from the General Plan in
                             comparison to the baseline year is extremely small.
          Noise/Land Use     The City’s primary goal with regard to community noise is to minimize
 Compatibility Guidelines    the exposure of residents to unhealthful or excessive noise levels to
                             the extent possible, given the City’s built-out condition. To this end,
                             this Element establishes noise/land use compatibility guidelines. These
                             guidelines are based on cumulative noise criteria for outdoor noise.
                             Figure SCS-6 outlines the criteria the City will use to review
                             development proposals. New residential development will comply
                             with Title 24 standards of the State Health and Safety Code. These
                             standards establish maximum interior noise levels for new residential
                             development, requiring that sufficient insulation be provided to reduce
                             interior ambient noise levels to 45 CNEL.
                             For existing development along arterial roadways and rail lines, the
                             City can implement programs to reduce the impact of these
                             transportation corridors. Residential development along Alondra
                             Boulevard, La Mirada Boulevard, Rosecrans Avenue, Valley View,
                             Imperial Highway, and Beach Boulevard lie within the 70 CNEL
                             contour. Noise attenuation walls exist along a number of these
                             arterials, but over time, the walls will deteriorate if not maintained.
                             The City will work to repair noise walls and install new ones where
                             appropriate. Additionally, truck routes will be established to minimize
                             arterial traffic impacts on residences.
                             Residences abutting the active rail lines lie within a 75 CNEL noise
                             contour. Maintenance of existing and installation of new noise walls
                             will shield residents from train noise. Additionally, the City will work
                             with railroad operators to minimize train noise, including pursuing
                             grade separations.

 noise environment. They represent the constant A-weighted noise level that would be measured if all the sound
 energy received over the day were averaged. In order to account for the greater sensitivity of people to noise at
 night, the CNEL weighting includes a 5-decibel penalty on noise between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. and a
 10-decibel penalty on noise between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. of the next day. The Ldn includes only the
 10-decibel weighting for late-night noise events. For practical purposes, the two measures are equivalent for
 typical urban noise environments.

                             The community depends upon a reliable and safe water supply, a well-
                             functioning sewage transmission system, and adequate electricity and
                             natural gas services. Infrastructure supporting these services includes
                             water and sewer lines, water reservoirs, flood control channels,
                             communication lines, electricity and natural gas lines, and support
                             facilities. As a contract city, La Mirada relies upon other government
                             agencies to provide many of these services, as well as private utility
                             companies, as outlined in Table SCS-2.

                             an important goal to protect the City’s financial investment and
                             maintain the quality of life for La Mirada residents and businesses. To
                             that end, the City is completing a comprehensive infrastructure study
                             to identify system deficiencies.
                             Goal 7.0         Ensure continued provision and adequacy of public
                                              facilities and infrastructure to support the needs of
                                              City residents and businesses.

                       Policy 7.3       Work with public and quasi-public service providers to
                                        ensure that the City’s investment in its infrastructure is
                                        protected.
                       Policy 7.4       Continue to plan for future infrastructure
                                        improvements using 5-year Capital Improvement Plans.
                       The goal of the Department of Public Works will be to maintain the
                       City’s infrastructure to a degree consistent with the standard Public
                       Works specifications. In doing so, the City shall complete an
                       Infrastructure Needs Assessment and Master Plan for the repair and
                       ongoing maintenance of the City’s valued infrastructure. These
                       infrastructure items are as follows: streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks,
                       storm drains, sewers, traffic signals, street trees, as well as park lands.

                                                                        COMMUNITY SERVICES
                             In addition to physical infrastructure, La Mirada residents and business
                             depend on a variety of other public safety and community services to
                             maintain a high quality of life. Such services include fire protection, law
                             enforcement, education, and library services.
                             The City contracts with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department
                             for the provision of police protection and law enforcement services.
                             The local La Mirada Community Sheriff’s station facilitates law
                             enforcement coordination in the City. The City augments its police
                             services with non-sworn public safety officers. In addition, the
                             resources of the entire Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, the
                             largest police agency in the world, are available to the City.
                             Fire protection services are provided through La Mirada’s participation
                             in the Los Angeles County Consolidated Fire District. Fire stations
                             strategically located in La Mirada and adjacent communities provide
                             adequate response times to emergency calls. The Fire District has an
                             extensive program of safety examinations that allow Fire personnel to
                             work with businesses to minimize fire hazards.
                             The City provides extensive Senior and Human Services programs
                             through both direct service and contract agencies. Residents also rely
                             on a number of community services provided by organizations other
                             than the City. A high-quality education system and County library
                             facilities support life-long learning. In addition, nonprofit organizations
                             supplement services provided by the City, enrich the community, and
                             provide outlets for volunteer service.
                             The range of public safety, education, and community services
                             provided work together to make La Mirada a more desirable place to
                             live, work, and invest in the community. The City will continue to
                             provide comprehensive public safety services and to support
                             community organizations that provide important services to La
                             Miradans.
                             Goal 8.0         Ensure the adequate provision of community services.
                             Policy 8.1       Provide residents and the business community with a
                                              high level of fire, police, and other public safety
                                              services.
                             Policy 8.2       Continue to work with community organizations and
                                              other agencies to encourage and supplement services
                                              to residents.

                              The purpose of the open space element is to guide the comprehensive
                           and long-range preservation and conservation of open space land. The
                          purpose of the conservation element is to provide direction regarding the
                                     conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources.

                                                                             INTRODUCTION
                         The open space areas of La Mirada have a unique beginning dating
                         back to the turn of the century. A significant part of the community’s
                         early development was McNally’s Windermere Ranch, near what is
                         now the intersection of Valley View Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue.
                         Initial design and development of the ranch included lush landscaping
                         with many rare and exotic species of trees and shrubs, many of which
                         still exist in Neff Park, the community’s first public park, dedicated in
                         1957.
                         La Mirada’s open space resources today include well-distributed
                         neighborhood parks, community parks, a large centrally located Los
                         Angeles County Regional Park and golf course, and a unique dual-
                         purpose flood control channel/trail.
                         Open space areas define the community, creating a special visual
                         image of a city that uses well-landscaped roadways to connect
                         neighborhoods to parks that provide a community focus.
          Purpose of the The Open Space and Conservation Element addresses existing and
        Open Space and   future opportunities for improving and maintaining the quality of our
   Conservation Element  parks, trails, and natural environment.
   Scope and Content of  State General Plan law requires every community to address the
    the Open Space and   preservation of open space and the conservation of natural resources.
   Conservation Element  Because La Mirada is a built-out urban community, the City contains
                         no natural resource areas such as forests, wildlife habitat, or
                         agricultural land. This Open Space and Conservation Element,

                         to La Mirada’s urban environment. These resources include:
                               •   Parks and Recreation Facilities
                               •   Trails

Open Space and Conservation Element
                                                   IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS
                            Key resource-related terms and concepts important to understanding
                            the context of this Element are as follows:
            Open Space      Open space is defined by Government Code Section 65560(b) as any
                            wholly unimproved area of land or water preserved and designated
                            on a local, regional, or State plan for open space use.
      Integrated Waste      Up through the 1970s, Californians disposed of their trash by the
          Management        traditional method: dumping it into landfills.          However, with
                            diminishing landfill space, people have become increasingly aware of
                            the need to pursue a more integrated approach to waste
                            management.       “Integrated waste management” involves source
                            reduction, recycling, and reuse of waste materials to minimize the
                            volume of trash actually placed into landfills.

                                                               Open Space and Conservation Element
                                                      RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
                          Several State and federal plans and programs apply to the park land
                          and air, water quality, and waste management issues addressed in this
                          Element. Such plans are administered by agencies or special districts
                          that have been delegated the power to enforce the legislation.
      Los Angeles County  In 1992, Los Angeles County voters approved Proposition A, a bond
            Proposition A measure that established funds for improving the safety of recreation
                          areas and for facilitating acquisition, restoration, and preservation of
                          open space resources county-wide. Proposition A identifies specific
                          projects to be pursued and also provides for a competitive grant
                          program whereby public agencies and non-profit organizations can
                          compete for funds for parks and recreation facilities and programs.
California Environmental  The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by
   Quality Act Guidelines the State legislature in 1970 in response to a public mandate for
                          thorough environmental analysis of projects that might affect the
                          environment.        Under CEQA, most projects that require a
                          discretionary approval of a public agency must first be reviewed to
                          determine related environmental effects. The environmental review
                          procedures are described in the CEQA Statutes and Guidelines.
                          CEQA implementation ensures that City officials and residents have
                          the opportunity to assess any impacts associated with development
                          projects so that appropriate measures can be implemented to
                          preserve the quality of the living environment.
Air Quality Management    The federal Clean Air Act requires preparation of plans to improve air
                     Plan quality in any region designated as a non-attainment area, defined as a
                          geographic area identified by the Environmental Protection Agency
                          and/or California Air Resources Board as not meeting State or federal
                          standards for a given pollutant. The Air Quality Management Plan,
                          prepared by the South Coast Air Quality Management District,
                          contains policies, strategies, and measures to achieve federal and State
                          standards for healthier air quality in the South Coast Air Basin.
       National Pollutant As part of a multi-pronged effort to improve the quality of water
   Discharge Elimination  resources nationwide, the federal government authorized the State
                  System  Regional Water Quality Control Board and the Los Angeles Regional
                          Water Quality Control Board to set up programs to implement
                          National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) goals.
                          Under the NPDES Stormwater Permit issued to the County of Los
                          Angeles and La Mirada as co-permittees, most new development
                          projects in the City are required to incorporate measures to minimize
                          pollutant levels in storm water runoff. Compliance is required at the
                          time that construction permits are issued, as well as over the long
                          term through periodic inspections.

                            An integrated network of neighborhood parks, community parks,
                            regional parks, trails, and private open space make up the La Mirada
                            recreation system. In addition, joint-use agreements between the City
                            and local school districts allow school grounds to be used for
                            recreation when schools are not in session. This open space system
                            totals almost 500 acres, affording residents diverse passive and active
                            recreation opportunities. Table OSC-1 lists community recreation
                            and other open space resources.

                            In a built-out community like La Mirada, limited opportunities exist to
                            expand open space resources. However, the well-established system
                            of the City parks, joint-use facilities, and County recreation areas will
                            meet community recreation needs into the future. The City’s focus is
                            on enhancing these resources and ensuring recreation
                            facilities/programs are adjusted over time in response to any
                            community demographic changes.

   Neighborhood Parks       Neighborhood parks provide compact recreation areas that residents
                            can access easily on foot or by bicycle. These parks accommodate
                            both active and passive recreation activities for groups and persons of
                            all ages. La Mirada’s six neighborhood parks (Figure OSC-1) serve this
                            function. Those neighborhoods without easy access to neighborhood
                            parks are served by joint-use school grounds.
      Community Parks       Community parks draw residents from a wider area. Neff Park and
                            Behringer Park total 35 acres and offer La Miradans space for
                            organized sports activities, group picnics, and special community
                            events.

                            the County of Los Angeles,
                            provide 245 acres of
                            recreational opportunities in
                            the heart of La Mirada. The
                            park includes lighted ball
                            fields, picnic areas, outdoor
                            cooking       facilities,  tennis
                            courts, a Frisbee course, community swimming pool, and athletic fields.
                            The regulation 18-hole golf course features well-kept putting greens
                            and undulating fairways developed on natural rolling terrain.
                            The City has been able to develop County park lands with community
                            recreation facilities that serve La Miradans and County residents
                            generally. Such cooperative agreements will continue to enhance
                            recreation facilities and programs for all.
            School Sites    Recreational facilities at local educational institutions account for a
                            significant portion of the City’s open space system. The City and the
                            Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District enter into annual
                            agreements to cooperate in organizing, promoting, and conducting a
                            joint program for community recreation. Biola University offers
                            recreational opportunities with an Olympic-sized swimming pool and
                            athletic fields. The City’s interest lies in maintaining these important
                            relationships to continue to offer residents the broadest range of
                            recreation resources.
   Multi-Function Open      La Mirada Creek Park exemplifies an
       Space and Trails     innovative design and joint use of flood
                            control facilities. This facility consists of a
                            flood control channel that winds through
                            the heart of the City, connecting park
                            facilities and neighborhoods to City Hall
                            and Biola University. Planted with grass

                        the channel allows water to percolate into ground. This design
                        feature not only conserves valuable water resources but reduces the
                        load on existing flood control facilities. Additionally, valuable topsoil is
                        conserved, as the park serves as a natural watershed.                   The
                        amphitheater, horse trails, and equestrian training ring provide unique
                        recreation opportunities. The natural area, where the existing ecology
                        of the area has been preserved, serves an important educational
                        function.
               Bikeways La Mirada Boulevard, Imperial Highway, and Rosecrans Avenue
                        include eight-foot-wide bicycle lanes, and boulevard improvements
                        consist of eight-foot landscaped parkways and landscaped center
                        medians. These roadways provide visual open space and linkages to
                        community focal points.
                        The Commuter Bikeways Strategic Plan, the regional bikeway plan for
                        Orange County, identifies the Coyote Creek Bikeway as a regional
                        Class I (paved off-road) bikeway along Coyote Creek. The bikeway
                        will traverse La Habra, La Mirada, Fullerton, and Buena Park. The City
                        strongly supports this multi-jurisdictional effort to create and maintain
                        this multi-use corridor that will not only benefit La Mirada residents,
                        but the entire region.

                        pleasing passive open space
                        resource. Due to the nature
                        of the use, Olive Lawn Memorial Park will continue to provide this
                        function into the future.
                        The following goals and policies demonstrate the City’s commitment
                        to preserving parks, recreational facilities, trails, and open space.

                                                            Open Space and Conservation Element
                                                                                AIR QUALITY
                       La Mirada is located within
                       the South Coast Air Basin, a
                       geographic region which
                       extends from the Pacific
                       Ocean east to the San Jacinto
                       Mountains, and from the San
                       Gabriel Mountains south
                       through Orange County.
                       The Basin, due to its physical
                       configuration               and
                       climatological influences, combined with daily pollutant emission
                       measured in the tons, experiences some of the worst air quality
                       conditions in the nation. The Basin is a “non-attainment” area for
                       ambient air quality standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, and fine
                       particulate matter.      Although continued reduction in pollutant
                       concentrations are expected, the Basin is not expected to meet air
                       quality standards, particularly for ozone, in the foreseeable future.
                       In La Mirada, air quality problems result from emissions from both
                       local and regional sources. The primary air pollution source is vehicle
                       emissions from cars and trucks using City streets and the Santa Ana
                       Freeway. Responsibility for the control and oversight of emissions lies
                       with the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD)
                       and the California Air Resources Board. The SCAQMD monitors air
                       quality throughout the Basin at various monitoring stations.
                       The City has no direct ability to manage programs for emissions
                       control. However, air quality problems affect the health of the City
                       residents. Participation with SCAQMD and neighboring jurisdictions
                       in collaborative efforts to improve air quality can help reduce the
                       generation of air pollutants in the City. Additionally, the City’s support
                       of local and regional project to improve mobility will improve air
                       quality.
                       Energy conservation is another strategy for improving air quality.
                       Pollutants are generated by the combustion of fossil fuels to produce
                       electricity, and by the combustion of natural gas. Reducing energy
                       usage decreases the amount of pollutants generated.                 Energy
                       requirements can be diminished through innovative architectural
                       design, building construction, structural orientation, and landscaping.
                       The following goals and policies demonstrate the City’s commitment
                       to assist the SCAQMD with regional efforts to improve air quality
                       over the long term.

                                                              Open Space and Conservation Element
                                                                   WASTE MANAGEMENT
                         Since the late 1970s, the increasing shortage of refuse disposal sites
                         and diminishing landfill capacity led the State Legislature to mandate
                         that jurisdictions implement policies and programs to reduce, reuse,
                         and recycle waste materials. Per the California Integrated Waste
                         Management Act, jurisdictions must divert specified percentages of
                         their solid waste streams from landfill disposal and must oversee the
                         disposal of hazardous wastes. The City’s commitment to waste
                         management and diversion is detailed in the City’s Source Reduction
                         and Recycling Element and Household Hazardous Waste Element
                         (not contained within the General Plan). The City will meet the
                         requirements of AB 939 and follow-up legislation. La Mirada’s
                         programs have been successful in improving the City’s waste diversion
                         percentages, and the City will continue proactive efforts to lead by
                         example.
      Goals and Policies Goal 4.0         Continue to reduce per capita volume of solid waste.
                         Policy 4.1       Periodically review the solid waste management
                                          program to achieve goals and divert a portion of the
                                          City’s waste stream from landfill disposal.
                         Policy 4.2       Investigate implementation of a yard waste program to
                                          increase the City’s waste diversion percentage.
                         Policy 4.3       Encourage and support the proper disposal of
                                          household hazardous waste and hazardous wastes
                                          from businesses in La Mirada.

                                                             WATER SUPPLY AND QUALITY
         Water Supply       Suburban Water Systems (SWS) provides potable water supplies in
                            the City. The source of domestic water is both well water and
                            imported water that SWS purchases from the Metropolitan Water
                            District of Southern California. With the addition of two planned
                            water tanks to the SWS system to serve properties in La Mirada,
                            water facilities will be adequate to serve future residents. The City
                            supports water conservation efforts through education, use of
                            drought-tolerant landscaping, application of new technologies, and
                            best management practices.
         Water Quality      An adequate water supply must also be a clean, safe water supply.
                            The City is committed to ensuring that urban runoff does not
                            adversely affect regional water bodies. Pollutants in urban runoff
                            include landscape pesticides and fertilizers, engine oil, detergents, and
                            household chemicals. Urban pollutants can degrade water quality and
                            impact downstream plants. The City participates as a co-permittee
                            with the County of Los Angeles in the National Pollutant System
                            Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program to help reduce
                            pollutant loads in urban runoff.
                            As required by the NPDES permit, all new development projects and
                            substantial rehabilitation projects are required to incorporate Best
                            Management Practices. Proposed development projects (public and
                            private) within La Mirada will continue to incorporate BMPs to
                            preclude significant water quality impacts from non-point source
                            pollutants.
                            Goal 5.0         Ensure that residents and businesses are provided
                                             with reliable, safe, and clean water.
                            Policy 5.1       Work with Suburban Water Systems and the
                                             Metropolitan Water District to ensure that adequate
                                             water resources are available to meet demands of
                                             current and future development.
                            Policy 5.2       Encourage water conservation through education, use
                                             of drought-tolerant landscaping, application of new
                                             technologies, and best management practices.
                            Policy 5.3       Work with local, regional, and State agencies to
                                             provide for a cost-effective and equitable means of
                                             reducing urban runoff.

                       uses in zoning districts is intended to achieve compatibility within the
                       district. Some elements affecting compatibility include: intensity of
                       occupancy as measured by dwelling units per acre; pedestrian or
                       vehicular traffic generated; volume of goods handled; and such
                       environmental effects as noise, vibration, glare, air pollution, or the
                       presence of hazardous materials. On the other hand, many aspects of
                       compatibility are based on personal preference and are much harder
                       to measure quantitatively, at least for regulatory purposes.

               are expressed in terms of density allowed under existing zoning. For
               example, one development right may equal one unit of housing or
               may equal a specific number of square feet of gross floor area in one
               or more specified zone districts.

                       non-conforming building, and (4) non-conforming use of land. Thus,
                       any use lawfully existing on any piece of property that is inconsistent
                       with a new or amended General Plan, and that in turn is a violation of
                       a zoning ordinance amendment subsequently adopted in conformance
                       with the General Plan, will be a non-conforming use.

                       unimproved and set aside, designated, dedicated, or reserved for
                       public or private use or enjoyment.

                                           IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
                         The General Plan Implementation Program provides a guide to
                         implement adopted General Plan policies and plans for City elected
                         officials, staff and the public. The purpose of the Implementation
                         Program is to ensure the overall direction provided in the General
                         Plan for City growth and development is translated from general
                         terms to specific actions.
                         Each implementation measure is a program, procedure, or technique
                         that requires additional City action. This action may either occur on a
                         City-wide basis, or at specific locations. Some of the implementation
                         measures are processes or procedures the City currently administers
                         on a day-to-day basis (such as development project review), while
                         others identify new programs or projects (such as preparation of a
                         Specific Plan for Imperial Highway). The City Council, by relating the
                         Implementation Program to the General Plan, recognizes the
                         importance of long-range planning considerations and budgeting to
                         such day-to-day activities. Implementation of the specific programs is
                         subject to funding constraints.
                         The Implementation Program is organized into 13 subsections. Each
                         of the subsections is comprised of programs relating to policies and
                         plans of one or more General Plan elements.
 Use of the General Plan The Implementation Program is intended for use as the basis for
Implementation Program   preparing the Annual Report to the City Council on the status of the
                         City’s progress in implementing the General Plan, as described in
                         Section 65400 of the California Government Code.
