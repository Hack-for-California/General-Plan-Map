1        Introduction
1.1      Executive Summary
The Housing Element Update is occurring at a time of great reflection and inflection for
Healdsburg. As a well known tourist destination that has successfully realized the vision of the
Regional/Urban Design Assistance Team (R/UDAT) study completed over 30 years ago, it is
now faced with the inevitable tension that comes with that success and recognition. To address
these challenges, many new activities and initiatives are underway, including a strategic planning
process to develop policies to guide the city toward long-term economic sustainability,
significant investment in new infrastructure and a gateway to the downtown as the first step in
realizing the vision of the Central Healdsburg Avenue Plan (CHAP), and considerable debate
regarding the Growth Management Ordinance. Through all of these initiatives, a common
theme of how to provide a diverse range of housing options for multiple lifestyles and
household incomes is paramount for maintaining Healdsburg’s genuine community feel, while
creating a multi-faceted, resilient local economy that will continue to prosper.
As tourism and lifestyle migration takes on an increasingly large role in the city’s economy, the
city continues to attract more second homeowners who have the economic means to drive up
median home prices. This has the unfortunate effect of pricing many others out of the
community – long-term residents, their children who might want to stay in the area, teachers
and first responders, young professionals attracted to the town, and new employees of
desirable employers (software company Métier, as one example). While there is growing
demand for new types of housing for aging residents, smaller families and empty nesters, and
new lifestyles (i.e., live-work), these housing typologies are not being developed in Healdsburg
as economies of scale cannot be achieved given the City’s restrictions on annual permit
allocations and a traditional home builder industry that has not experimented with new housing
forms.
Through the strategic planning process and other community outreach efforts, residents and
decision makers have expressed a desire to increase emphasis on attainable workforce housing,
in addition to affordable housing for young families and core professionals in town, finding a
balance between serving visitors and local residents, and preserving Healdsburg’s small town
community character as it grows. The Housing Element Update process provides the
community and decision makers the opportunity to make important policy decisions about how
to accomplish these goals.
The 2015-2023 Housing Element is intended to not only meet the requirements of State law
but, more importantly, serve as the City’s strategic housing plan. The plan first evaluates the
city’s housing conditions and needs and provides an inventory of vacant residential land available
to meet that need. At the heart of the Housing Element, however, are the goals, policies, and
programs, which will guide City investments and land use decisions to address future growth
and housing needs.
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                    Page 1

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                                              1. Introduction
1.2     Housing Element Overview
Purpose and Content
The housing goal for the State of California is for every Californian to have access to a decent
home and suitable living environment. Recognizing the important role that local governments
play in pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all cities and counties prepare a
Housing Element as part of their comprehensive General Plan (California Government Code
Section 65302 (c)).
This Housing Element update covers the planning period from 2015-2023. It addresses housing
opportunities for present and future residents over the next eight years, and provides the
primary policy guidance for local decision making as it relates to housing. The Housing Element
has a shorter (eight-year) planning period than the other General Plan elements and is the only
General Plan element that requires review and certification by the State of California.
The Housing Element provides a detailed analysis of the city’s demographic, economic, and
housing characteristics as required by State Law. The Element also provides a comprehensive
evaluation of the City’s progress in implementing the past policies and programs related to
housing production, preservation, and conservation. Based on the community’s housing needs,
available resources, constraints, and opportunities for housing production and preservation, the
Housing Element identifies goals, policies, and programs that address the housing needs of
present and future residents. The goals, policies, and programs are included in the Housing
Element Policy Document.
Consistency with State Law
This update has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of California Government
Code Article 10.6 (commencing with Section 65580) and contains:
       An assessment of housing needs in the city;
       The identification of constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, and development
        of housing for all income levels;
       An inventory of resources available to the City to meet the housing needs for all income
        groups;
       A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies related to the
        maintenance, improvement, and development of housing; and
       An eight-year schedule of actions the City will undertake to implement the policies and
        achieve the goals and objectives of the Housing Element.
Consistency with the General Plan
The California Government Code requires internal consistency among the various elements of
the General Plan. Section 65300.5 of the Government Code states that the General Plan’s
various elements shall provide an integrated and internally consistent and compatible statement
of policy. The updated Housing Element will be incorporated into the Healdsburg 2030 General
Page 2                                                              Adopted November 17, 2014

Plan. The General Plan’s Land Use Plan and the policies contained in the Land Use Element
were used to determine the location, amount, and type of potential housing. The City will
maintain this consistency as future General Plan amendments are processed by evaluating
proposed amendments for consistency with all elements of the General Plan.
1.3     Public Participation
Throughout the update of the 2015 Housing Element there were several opportunities for
public participation, and the community played an important role in the update. The following is
a summary of the meetings held during the Housing Element Update and the input provided by
members of the community. This input was critical in defining the housing problems in
Healdsburg and crafting solutions tailored to the community.
Community Workshop #1
On May 6, 2014, the City conducted a community workshop on the Housing Element Update.
The purpose of the workshop was to educate the community on the Housing Element Update
and solicit input on the major housing issues facing the city and potential solutions to address
the issues. The workshop was held from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at the Annex at Villa
Chanticleer. Over 30 participants attended the workshop.
To advertise the workshop, the City sent an email to several email contact lists announcing the
community workshop, including 237 people on the City’s e-notify list, 70 people on the Central
Healdsburg Avenue Special Study Area list serv, and a list of 42 local and regional housing
stakeholders compiled by the City and consultants. The City also posted flyers around the city
in both English and Spanish, and a newspaper article was published in the Healdsburg Tribune
online edition.
City staff opened the meeting with introductions and an overview of the project. The Housing
Element Consultants then made a presentation, describing State law requirements for the
Housing Element and preliminary findings from the update to the Housing Element Background
Report. Following the presentation, workshop attendees were divided into four groups of 6-7
people and asked to participate in workshop exercises that focused on identifying and
prioritizing housing issues and potential policy solutions. Each group elected a “recorder” to
write down all the comments and a “reporter” to report out the results at the end of the
exercises.
In the first exercise, participants were asked to identify the most significant housing issues in
Healdsburg and, as a group, select the top three issues. In the second exercises, participants
were asked to brainstorm potential solutions to each of the top issues. In the third exercises,
participants were given the opportunity to identify “other big ideas” related to improving
housing opportunities in Healdsburg.
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                  Page 3

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                                               1. Introduction
The issues that were most commonly identified by participants included the following:
       A need for more “workforce housing;”
       A shortage of rental units;
       The impact of second homes and vacation rentals;
       A lack of diverse housing types; and
       The unintended consequences of the Growth Management Ordinance.
Lack of Workforce Housing
One of the issues that was stated most frequently at the workshop was the lack of affordable
“workforce” housing for young families and those who work in the community and earn a
moderate income. “Workforce housing” refers to housing that is affordable to the people that
provide vital services in a community – school teachers, firefighters, police officers, restaurant
and hotel workers, and other service related workers. Many participants expressed concern
over the lack of housing options for these middle-income wage earners and their families who
are getting “squeezed” out of the housing market as prices continue to rise in Healdsburg.
Participants identified several potential solutions to address the lack of workforce housing,
including encouraging more diverse housing types that are affordable by design, such as higher
density housing, mixed use development, and live-work units. Others suggested making better
use of secondary dwelling units by increasing maximum size. Participants also suggested
exploring new funding mechanisms for affordable housing, including reserving a portion of
transient occupancy tax (TOT) revenues or development impact fees for affordable housing, or
studying creative financing mechanisms. Several participants recognized that the Growth
Management Ordinance (GMO) adopted in 2000, has had the unintended consequence of
making low- and mid-priced housing more challenging to deliver. Others stated that the GMO
was inflating housing prices. One recommendation was to use GMO allocations to direct a
higher proportion of construction toward middle priced products.
Shortage of Rental Units
Another significant issue that was discussed at the workshop was the shortage of available
rental units in Healdsburg, including deed-restricted affordable rentals. Vacancy rates in the
rental market are extremely low or non-existent. Participants suggested providing incentives
for rental units and multifamily units, allowing increased densities for multifamily units, and
exploring new tools, creative financing models, and other ways to replace funding lost with the
dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency. Those who expressed a need for more affordable
rentals suggested using deed-restrictions to preserve existing affordable rental units and City
support for Senate Bill (SB) 391, the California Homes and Jobs Act of 2013, which would
establish a permanent source of State funding for affordable housing. Some participants also
suggested the City advocate for a portion of Cap and Trade funding to be reserved for
affordable housing and other legislation that would create funding sources for affordable
housing.

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                                              1. Introduction
Impact of Second Homes and Vacation Rentals
The impact of the tourism economy on the local housing market was discussed as a significant
issue. Participants stated that buyers of second homes are driving up prices and competing with
permanent residents for a limited supply of homes, and the prevalence of short-term vacation
rentals are limiting the availability of long-term rentals for city residents. Participants also
observed that the growing emphasis on tourism in changing the character of the community.
Some participants expressed a need for the City to enforce existing regulations that prohibit
short-term vacation rentals (less than 30 days) in the city, and the need for zoning and
regulatory changes. Others felt that encouraging a greater diversity of housing through policy
and incentives would help alleviate the issue. One group suggested that the City might restrict
some housing for people who intend to live and work in the community.
Lack of Diverse Housing Types
With changing norms in housing size, household make-up, and life stage, many recognized that
more contemporary housing forms, such as mixed use, live-work, smaller micro or cottage
units, co-housing, and downsized or independent living units are not readily available in
Healdsburg. Some participants felt that increasing density to create more cost effective housing
types, and more interesting living choices could be offered. Others felt the Growth
Management Ordinance should be modified to remove economic and construction phasing
barriers for creating larger multifamily housing, which could be inherently less expensive than
single family detached products.
Growth Management Ordinance
A topic that was referenced several times throughout the workshop was the GMO. Several
participants expressed that the GMO is the most significant barrier to more affordable housing
in Healdsburg, because it limits the ability of a developer to gain cost advantages through
economies of scale; or it creates a higher price for a limited annual supply of building permits.
Many felt that the GMO should be re-examined to encourage the types of housing needed in
Healdsburg, with an emphasis placed on infill locations or higher allocations to products that
would fulfill pricing for workforce residents.
Community Workshop #2
On July 9, 2014, the City conducted the second community workshop on the Housing Element
Update. The purpose of the workshop was to present the Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
and solicit feedback from the community on the proposed policies and programs. The
workshop was held from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at the Healdsburg Community Center. Over 30
community members attended the workshop.
To advertise the workshop, the City sent an email to the email contact lists described above
and posted flyers on the City website and in public locations around the city in both English and
Spanish. A newspaper article was also published in the Press Democrat describing the Draft
Housing Element and advertising the workshop.
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                  Page 5

City staff opened the meeting with introductions and an overview of the project. The Housing
Element Consultants then made a presentation, describing the issues identified by the
community at the first community workshop and how the Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
addresses those issues.
Following the presentation, workshop participants were asked to provide feedback on the
policies and programs contained in the Draft Housing Element. The policies and programs were
presented on boards displayed around the room. Each board represented a separate goal
section of the Draft Housing Element and displayed all the policies and programs within each
goal section. There were three ways for participants to give feedback on the policies and
programs:
       Dot exercise. Participants were given three different colored dots: green, yellow, and
        red. Green dots signified support for a policy or program; yellow dots signified support

2.1     Overview of the City of Healdsburg
This section provides a historical overview of housing development and population growth
trends in the city of Healdsburg.
The area that now comprises Healdsburg and its Planning Area was originally inhabited by
Native Americans including Southern Pomo and Wappo tribes in the Dry Creek and Alexander
Valleys, respectively.1 Their populations once numbered close to 10,000 before they were
decimated by a small pox epidemic. The Mexican and later Euro-American settlements that
were established in the 1850s further contributed to the population decline of those Native
Americans. Those who survived were displaced to missions or rancherias.
Early Settlement Era
The majority of Healdsburg’s Euro-American settlers came from the southern United States
and Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma. The first structures built were residences and
outbuildings of split-log redwood. No example remains of these early, temporary structures.
The first permanent structures were made of adobe, utilizing native clay and local Indian labor.
Most of these adobe residences were destroyed or severely damaged in the 1906 earthquake.
Most of the early cabins and houses in and around Healdsburg were modest structures often
"designed" and built by amateur carpenters. Residences lined the main street and clustered in
the downtown area on the east and south sides of the Plaza.
As shown in Figure 1, the town of "Healdsburg" was mapped and recorded by Harmon Heald
on March 5, 1857. The earliest residential section (1850 to 1870) developed close to the
commercial core area along North Street (200 and 300 block), Matheson Street (formerly
South Street) (200 to 400 block), Tucker Street (200 and 300 block), Haydon Street (100 to
300 block), the south side of Mason Street, University Street (100 to 300 block), Fitch Street
(300 block), East Street (200 and 300 block), and Center Street (200 and 300 block). A string of
residences also developed very early along the west side of Healdsburg Avenue (formerly West
Street) north of Piper Street. Of these early residential sections, the southern end of Center
Street appears to be the oldest (1850 to 1860). Other early residences were scattered on
larger lots in the area now bounded by Piper Street, Powell Avenue, Healdsburg Avenue, and
Brown Street.

Settlers in the early 1850s built simple wood frame “homestead”-style structures. The earliest
homestead houses were small single-story, single-gable structures built to shelter the settlers,
most of whom were without families. The fact that sawn lumber was still at a premium and nails
had to be hand-forged were additional reasons for the relatively small scale of these early
buildings.
In the late 1850s and 1860s, houses became bigger in order to accommodate larger families and
because sawn lumber and nails were becoming more readily available; the latter being mass-
produced. Simplicity and design based on function rather than ornamentation were still the
dominant characteristics during this period, reflecting the agricultural emphasis of the survey
area and the need to devote available time, energy, and resources to agricultural pursuits.
Late Settlement Era
By what is considered to be the “late settlement” era (1870-1880), the prosperity of businesses
and farms began to be reflected in more elaborate local architecture. Several Italianate
mansions and larger homes were constructed during this time that incorporated far more
ornate features such as balconies, brackets, and grillwork.

The areas south of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad tracks were developed between 1880
and 1890. The houses that were built here are nearly identical modest, single-story Italianates
that served as middle class housing and examples of the earliest row or tract housing in the
city.
Water mains were first laid in the city in 1876. The Johnson Street area was the first residential
section of the city to install electric lights. During that period, Johnson Street was known as
“Electric Avenue.” The first sewage disposal systems were installed in 1900.
Between 1880 and 1906, construction of residential structures was slow but steady. The
residential area in the northeast portion of the city (Knaack's Addition) became more densely
populated. A small area west of Healdsburg Avenue, known as West Grant and Grove Streets,
was subdivided and new residences built, although the area remained unincorporated. It was
not uncommon during this period and later for farm families with residences in outlying
agricultural areas to build residences in town to allow their school age children to attend the
public school. It also allowed senior family members to retire to a more convenient and social
environment.
As the city’s population increased toward the end of the 19th century, a substantial middle class
developed and a large number of moderately-sized homes were built. The vast majority of these
homes were cottages in the Queen Anne style. Even though relatively small, these homes were
embellished with verandahs, circular bays, multi-gabled roofs, and other features characteristic
of this style.
Twentieth Century Development
By the turn of the 19th century, the city witnessed new residential construction of a number of
Transitional-style homes incorporating influences of both Queen Anne and the Bungalow style.
Like the earlier Homestead style, the Transitional style involved less ornamentation, but still
used such features as oversized gables and sawn shingles for their decorative effect.
Between 1900 and 1925, two styles of Bungalow, the California Bungalow style and the locally
popular Craftsman Bungalow style, became characteristic of the movement away from the
excesses of Victorian architecture. Both provided housing for the middle class population,
superseding the function of the Queen Anne cottage, and both involved an effort to integrate
indoor and outdoor living spaces with the use of sleeping porches and natural wood. The more
prevalent Craftsman homes, with their broad-based pillars, overhanging eaves, and exposed
beams, made use of somewhat more prominent design features than the simpler bungalow.
The effects of Prohibition brought about a severe depression in the local hop and vineyard
industries, and by the mid-1920s this depression severely curtailed residential construction.
Consequently, very few examples exist of architectural styles prevalent in other parts of the
country during this time, such as the Prairie style, which was very popular in the nearby San
Francisco Bay area. Some Mediterranean and Spanish- or Mission-style homes were constructed
in the area, generally between 1930 and 1945, exhibiting arches, red tile roofs, and brick walls
finished in stucco. Figure 2 illustrates residential development phases between pre 1900 years
and 2014.

Healdsburg's population remained at approximately 2,000 from 1880 to 1940. The remarkable
stability of the size and population of Healdsburg during this period accounts for the well-
preserved condition of the residential areas. The post-war years in Healdsburg, like most other
areas in California, was a period of rapid growth. As shown in Figure 3, population increased by
30 percent from 1940 to 1950, and by another 48 percent from 1950 to 1960. The population
growth trend slowed to a 12 percent increase between 1960 and 1970, and a 17 percent
increase between 1970 and 1980. The 1980s was a period of rapid growth in Healdsburg; from

growth increased at a slower rate of 13 percent, and from 2000 to 2010, the population
increased by only 5 percent.

The population growth within the city limits during the 20th century is partially attributable to
increased municipal subdivisions and annexations. Between 1947 and 1983, there were 46
separate subdivisions and expansions to the city limits. With few exceptions, these annexations
were located to the north and east of the original town. These subdivisions followed the
formation of the first city planning commission in 1946.
Figure 4 summarizes the annual number of building permits issued for new dwelling units
between 1990 and 2014. Between 1990 and 1997, the annual number of building permits for
new dwelling units ranged from as few as five units (1996) to as many as 48 (1995). However, in
the three-year period of 1998 and 2000, 476 building permits were issued for new units,
primarily in the newly-annexed 231 acres at the north end of the city.
This growth spike led to a local ballot initiative that was approved in 2000 (Measure M) limiting
residential growth to an average of 30 building permits per year and 90 building permits over a
three-year period, beginning in 2001. Affordable housing and secondary (”granny”) units are
exempt from this limit. Between 2001 and 2007, residential building permits averaged 16 units
per year for market-rate units and 27 per year for both market-rate and affordable units.
Between 2007 and the present (2014), the average is 20 permits per year.

 Population Growth Trends
 As shown in Table 1, the population in Healdsburg and Sonoma County has been steadily
 growing since 1990. Between 1990 and 2000, the county’s growth rate (18.1 percent) was
 higher than the city’s growth rate (13.2 percent), with an annual average growth of 1.8 percent
 and 1.3 percent, respectively. The growth rate slowed between 2000 and 2010 to 5 percent in
 Healdsburg and 5.5 percent in Sonoma County, while California’s growth rate was 10 percent.
 According to the State Department of Finance (DOF), the city’s total population was 11,541 as
 of January 1, 2014. This represents only a 2.6 percent increase from 2010. Healdsburg’s 11,541
 residents represented only 2.4 percent of Sonoma County’s population in 2014. Although the
 city has never represented a large proportion of the county’s population, its share has been
 declining since 1940, when the city represented 3.6 percent.

 Age Characteristics
 Evaluating the age characteristics of a community can help to identify the housing needs of its
 residents. Table 2 summarizes the age characteristics of Healdsburg residents in 2000 and 2010
 and compares this with the county as a whole. Like many communities nationwide,
 Healdsburg’s population is aging. The only age groups that grew between 2000 and 2010 were
 the 55 to 64 age group (27.4 percent) and the 65 and older aged population (11.7 percent). All
 other age groups declined in population or remained the same. In 2010 Sonoma County
 exhibited similar age characteristics as Healdsburg.
 These trends in the age structure of Healdsburg’s population have several implications for
 housing. As the children of middle age adults leave home, many of these people may begin to
 consider moving into smaller dwellings, such as apartments and townhomes, with more limited
 maintenance requirements. The need for specialized senior housing, such as active adult
 communities and assisted living facilities, will increase with the continued growth in the city’s
 senior and “frail elderly” population (age 75 and older). And if the City wants to ensure new
 young families can move into the community, additional affordable housing opportunities for
 families will be critical.

 Healdsburg has a higher median age than California. The median age of Healdsburg residents
 was 37.7 in 2000 and increased to 40.9 years by 2012. This is in contrast to the slightly lower
 countywide median age of 39.8 and statewide average of 35.2 in 2012. Factors contributing to
 this shift in the city’s age structure include an aging in place of young adults into the middle age
 bracket, an increase in the number of seniors, and a decline in the number of new young adults
 and families.
 Race and Ethnicity
 Table 3 summarizes the population by race and ethnicity in Healdsburg and Sonoma County. In
 2010 the majority of the city and county populations were White, 74 percent and 76.7 percent,
 respectively. In 2010 Healdsburg had a lower percentage of Asian residents (1.3 percent)
 compared to Sonoma County (4.1 percent) as well as Black residents (0.5 percent compared to
 1.6 percent). Healdsburg’s Hispanic/Latino population increased from 3,090 (28.8 percent) in
 2000 to 3,820 (33.9 percent) in 2010. In 2010 the city had a higher percentage of
 Hispanic/Latino residents compared to the county as a whole (33.9 percent for Healdsburg
 compared to 24.9 percent for Sonoma County). These changes have implications for housing
 needs to the extent that different racial and ethnic groups may have different household
 characteristics, income levels, and cultural backgrounds that may affect their needs and
 preferences for housing. Traditionally, some cultures (such as Asians and Hispanics) are likely to
 live with extended family members. These households, therefore, tend to be larger and require
 large homes to accommodate their needs.
 According to the 2010-2011 County of Sonoma Local Economic Report, the race/ethnicity
 distribution in the county as a whole is changing rapidly due to an aging White population and a
 younger Hispanic/Latino population. More than 70 percent of the Hispanic/Latino population in
 the county is under the age of 35, whereas more than 60 percent of the White population is
 over the age of 35. Through 2050 the White population is projected to decrease 8 percent per

3.1    Household Characteristics
This section details the various household characteristics affecting housing needs. Household
type and size, income levels, the presence of special needs populations, and other household
characteristics determine the type of housing needed by residents.
Household Type
The Census defines a “household” as any group of people occupying a housing unit, which may
include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, or unrelated
persons who share living quarters. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes,
dormitories, or other group living situations are not considered households. Household
characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing needed in a community.
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, there are 4,378 households in Healdsburg, of which 64.6
percent are families. Families, defined as persons related through marriage or blood, are
comprised of families with or without related children as well as other family types, such as
female-headed households with children. Non-families, including singles, and other households,
make up 35.9 percent of households in Healdsburg. Since 2000 the number of households has
increased from 3,968 to 4,378, a 10.3 percent increase. The percentage of families decreased
from 68.1 percent in 2000 to 64.6 percent in 2010, while the percentage of non-families
increased from 32 percent in 2000 to 35.4 percent in 2010.

Household Income
Household income is a key factor affecting housing opportunity, determining a household’s
ability to balance housing costs with other basic necessities. Income levels can vary considerably
among households based upon tenure, household type, location of residence, and
race/ethnicity, among other factors.
Income Definitions
The State and Federal government classify household income into several groupings based upon
the relationship to the county area median income (AMI), adjusted for household size. The
State of California uses the income groups shown in Table 7. However, Federal housing
programs use slightly different income groupings and definitions, with the highest income
category generally defined as 95 percent of AMI or greater. For purposes of the Housing
Element, the State income definitions are used throughout, except for the data that have been
compiled by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and is
specifically noted.

HCD establishes household income limits to define households as extremely low-, very low-,
low-, or moderate-income level. These income levels vary throughout the state. They are based
on the area median income of the region and adjusted based on the number of persons per
household. The AMI for a four-person household in Sonoma County is $82,600. The income
limits for Sonoma County are shown on Table 8. As shown in the table, a family of three with
an annual income of $58,500 or less would be considered a low-income household.

Evaluating Healdsburg’s income level by household income category from 2000 to 2010
illustrates that lower income households (less than 80 percent AMI) decreased only slightly
from 44.5 to 43.8 percent of the city’s total households. As depicted in Table 9, the city
experienced the most significant growth in extremely low-income households (4.7 percent).
Extremely low income-households – those earning less than 30 percent AMI – face the most
significant housing needs. About 40 percent of Healdsburg’s 610 extremely low-income
households are senior citizens. As seniors are typically on fixed incomes, an increase in rents
can have a considerable impact on extremely low-income senior renters. Senior homeowners
with extremely low incomes also face significant needs related to maintaining their homes.
Note: income as defined does not include other assets.

Income by Household Tenure
Figure 5 shows the income level of Healdsburg residents by household tenure. A significantly
higher percentage of renter households (66.9 percent) had lower incomes (less than 80 percent
AMI), compared to residents who owned their homes (25.6 percent). The presence of
approximately 925 extremely low- and very low-income renter households is of particular
significance as market rents in Healdsburg exceed the level of affordability for these households
(discussed in greater detail in the Housing Affordability section). A high level of housing
overpayment is verified by the 2006-2010 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy
(CHAS), which identifies 84.3 percent of extremely low- and very low-income Healdsburg
renters as spending greater than 30 percent of their income on housing.

 Income by Household Type
 While renters were more likely to have lower incomes than owners, there is also significant
 variation in income levels by household type, as shown in Table 10. About half (49.8 percent) of
 elderly households in Healdsburg are lower income, with 19.1 percent extremely low income.
 In contrast, 47.9 percent of other households, 52.6 percent of large families, and 35.8 percent
 of small families have lower incomes.

3.2     Housing Characteristics
A community’s housing stock is defined as the collection of all residential dwelling units located
within the jurisdiction. The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth, type, age and
condition, tenure, vacancy, costs, and affordability are important in determining the housing
needs for the community. This section details Healdsburg’s housing stock characteristics in an
attempt to identify how well the current housing stock meets the needs of current and future
residents of the city.
Housing Unit Types
According to the 2014 estimate prepared by the DOF, there were 4,904 housing units in the
city (Table 11). Healdsburg had a slightly higher proportion of single family homes (78.7
percent) than Sonoma County (75.5 percent), but had a similar proportion of multifamily
homes of 19.9 percent in Healdsburg and 19.0 percent in Sonoma County. Sonoma County had
a larger proportion of multifamily complexes with five or more units (12.5 percent) than the
city (9.9 percent). Mobile homes also constituted a larger portion of the county’s housing stock
(5.5 percent) than in the city (1.4 percent).

Table 12 displays the housing stock by type in 1990, 2000, and 2010. The city’s housing stock
has remained predominately single family during the past 20 years. Less than 20 percent of units
are in multifamily buildings with the largest share in three-four unit buildings. Single family
attached and detached housing increased almost 16 percent from 2000 to 2010, while
multifamily housing increased 13.3 percent. Mobile home parks decreased from 2000 to 2010
by 14.4 percent from 99 in 2000 to 70 in 2010.

Housing Tenure
According to Census data, Healdsburg is nearly equally split in tenure (57.6 percent owner-
occupied units versus 42.4 percent renter-occupied units). As shown in Table 13, between 2000
and 2010 the proportion of owner-occupied households decreased while the proportion of
renters slightly increased. The number of owner occupied units increased by 5.4 percent and
the number of renter occupied units increased by 17.8 percent.

Vacancy
Vacancy rate can be a good indicator of how effectively for-sale and rental units are meeting the
current demand for housing in a community. Vacancy rates of 6 or 7 percent for rental housing
and 1 to 2 percent for ownership housing are generally considered optimum, where there is a
balance between the demand and supply for housing.2 A higher vacancy rate may indicate an
excess supply of units and, therefore, price depreciation, while a low vacancy rate may indicate
a shortage of units and escalation of housing prices.

The occupancy and vacancy status of the city’s total housing units in 2000 and 2010 is
summarized in Table 14. Census data indicated that Healdsburg had a vacancy rate of 4.2
percent for rental housing, which is significantly below the optimum 6 or 7 percent. The
vacancy rate for ownership housing was slightly above normal (1.6 percent) with a vacancy rate
of 2.7 percent in 2010. Approximately 3.2 percent of the city’s total housing units in 2010 were
vacant and available for rent or sale. 46 percent of the vacant units were for seasonal,
recreational, or occasional use. The city’s vacancy rate (8.7 percent) was lower than the
county’s vacancy rate (9.2 percent) and higher than the state’s (8.1 percent)3.

Housing Stock Conditions
Generally, housing older than 30 years of age will require minor repairs and modernization
improvements. Housing units over 50 years of age are more likely to require major
rehabilitation such as roofing, plumbing, and electrical system repairs. Table 15 depicts the
statistics on the age of the housing units in Healdsburg. 59.0 percent of housing units in the city
are over 30 years of age and 32.3 percent are over 50 years of age.

An important indicator of the existing condition of the housing supply is the number of
structurally substandard units, or units needing rehabilitation or replacement. While the
majority of the housing units within the city are in relatively good condition, as the existing
stock ages, the number of housing units needing rehabilitation is expected to increase.
Exterior Conditions
In mid-2008, approximately 2,540 residences in Healdsburg’s older neighborhoods were
inspected by a “windshield survey.” Figure D in Appendix D depicts the survey area boundary.
The overwhelming majority of units surveyed were found to be in “sound” condition, with the
appearance of regular maintenance of the home and landscaping. Only 46 units, or 1.8 percent
were identified by the survey as “sound deficient,” and it appeared that a nominal amount of
work would correct all of the deficiencies. The homes in need of repair are scattered
throughout the survey area; no single neighborhood was identified as having a concentration of
deficient units. Figure D in Appendix D depicts the locations of the deficient units.
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                          Page 25

It should be noted that the housing conditions survey was only an exterior visual inspection,
and it is likely that many of the older homes are in need of such maintenance as new roofs and
heating systems, as well as energy-saving measures such as insulation, double-pane windows,
and weather-stripping. These conditions could only be identified by a thorough on-site
inspection.
The generally well-maintained condition of homes and presence of home improvements are
evidence of an interest in conserving the city’s existing units in the face of limited housing
development. There is also a growing recognition and appreciation for the historic qualities of
the homes in many of Healdsburg’s older neighborhoods.
Structural Integrity
While the occurrence of a large earthquake is rare, Healdsburg would be subjected to very high
levels of shaking by a strong earthquake on the Healdsburg-Rodgers Creek fault. The last major
earthquake in Sonoma County was a magnitude 5.7 event which occurred in 1969 on this fault.
Studies indicate that an earthquake of approximately 7.0 on the Rodgers Creek fault is
estimated to have a 30-year probability of 22 percent.4 The Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG) estimated in 1996 that at least 7 percent of dwelling units in Sonoma
County would be uninhabitable following a magnitude 7.1 event.5 Mobile homes are particularly
susceptible to earthquakes and may become uninhabitable; although mobile homes do not
sustain substantial damage, they must be returned to a stable foundation and reconnected to
utilities. Multi-story, wood-framed buildings are also at risk of severe damage during a seismic
event unless they are reinforced.

Housing Rehabilitation
During the previous Housing Element planning period the City, through the Redevelopment
Agency, operated a Neighborhood Improvement Program to assist lower-income senior and
disabled residents with exterior home improvements. However, the Healdsburg
Redevelopment Agency was dissolved in February of 2012 in accordance with a Supreme Court
Order, which eliminated the funding source for this program.
Sonoma County continues to offer a housing rehabilitation loan program to low-income
homeowners. From 2008 to April 2014, three units in Healdsburg were rehabilitated with loans
from the Housing Rehabilitation Program. Two repairs were earthquake bracing systems and
the other was an investor owned 4-plex rehab. The loans are available to low-income
households to repair structural, electrical and mechanical deficiencies, improve accessibility and
increase energy efficiency. Deferred payments with no monthly expenditures are available, and
the program also provides a free on-site evaluation, followed by a written report of items that
need to be addressed. Homeowners are assisted in obtaining bids and permits, selecting
qualified contractors and managing the project paperwork and budget.
3.3      Housing Costs and Affordability
Affordability is defined as paying 30 percent or less of gross monthly household income on
housing costs, based on both State and Federal standards. Housing affordability is a major
consideration in providing suitable housing, as housing costs are generally the greatest expense
for households. For owner households, housing expenses consist of mortgage and interest
payments, insurance, maintenance, and property taxes; some owners may also pay homeowners
association dues or a special assessment. The housing cost burden for recent home purchasers
is even greater than that of other homeowners, since the relative cost of homeownership
decreases over time (i.e., long-term owner costs do not adjust to the market value of housing)
and the property tax that has limited increases following the home’s purchase is adjusted
upwards when the property sells.
For renter households, housing expenses generally consist of a security deposit, rent, and
utilities. Rent levels can fluctuate over the course of occupancy unless local rent controls are
imposed.
Higher-income households may choose to spend greater portions of their income for housing
expenses. However, many low-income households must involuntarily spend a large share of
their income on housing.
Rental Housing Affordability
The 2010 Census reported that 1,857 units (42.4 percent of total occupied units) were renter-
occupied, a rate that was higher than in 2000 (39.7 percent) and 1990 (38.9 percent). The city’s
proportion of renter units was somewhat higher than the county-wide average (39.6 percent),
but lower than the state-wide average (44.1 percent). Many of the renter-occupied units were
likely single family homes, as Healdsburg had only 912 multifamily units (three or more units per
structure) in 2010 according to the DOF. The 2008-2012 ACS reported a median rent in
Healdsburg of $1,270.

Based on an online search for rental units in April and May 2014, there were 14 listed available
rentals in Healdsburg. Most available rentals were single family homes. The average rent was
$2,185 and the median rent was $1,944 (Table 16). Rentals ranged from one-bedroom to
three-bedroom units with prices ranging from $950 to $4,000.

Table 17 shows HUD-defined fair market rent levels (FMR) for Sonoma County for 2013.6 Fair
market rents are gross rent estimates primarily used by HUD to determine payment standard
amounts for their various programs. They include the shelter rent plus the cost of all tenant-
paid utilities, except telephone, television, and Internet service. HUD sets FMRs to assure that a
sufficient supply of rental housing is available to program participants. To accomplish this
objective, FMRs must be both high enough to permit a selection of units and neighborhoods
and low enough to serve as many low-income families as possible. HUD uses FMRs for a variety
of purposes: FMRs determine the eligibility of rental housing units for the Section 8 Housing
Assistance Payments program; Section 8 Rental Certificate program participants cannot rent
units whose rents exceed the FMRs; and FMRs also serve as the payment standard used to
calculate subsidies under the Rental Voucher program.

Calls to several local property management companies revealed more information on rentals in
Healdsburg. There is strong evidence of a tight rental market as there is a lack of available
rentals. A majority of renters have occupied the existing rental units for many years. Because of
their long-term tenure and strong relations with property owners, property management
companies claim that they have kept rental prices low and have not increased rents to reflect
fair market-rate rental prices. This means that many long-term renters are likely paying less
than the current market-rate rental prices.
For example, one property management company that manages 16 fully-occupied apartment
units in Healdsburg said that there is very little turnover in their rental units, which tend to be
occupied by long-time residents. Because of the long-term relationship with the tenants, rents
charged at these apartments tend to be much lower than the market value of the units. Studios
rent for about $600; one-bedroom units for $650; and two-bedroom units for $750.
Since 2008, the only multifamily developments built have been deed-restricted affordable
housing for lower-income residents (except two duplexes). The Growth Management
Ordinance (GMO) exempts affordable housing projects, but requires market rate multifamily to
compete for a limited number of allocations. All income-restricted apartments in the city have
lengthy waiting lists, with wait times between six months and three years.
Healdsburg has increasingly become an attractive tourist destination, and while vacation rentals
are prohibited within the city limits, some homeowners still choose to rent their homes to
vacationers as opposed to permanent residents. Vacation rentals have an impact on the
available rental supply as well as the character of neighborhoods. The City enforces vacation
rental regulations, but is complaint-based and therefore does not monitor these units. During
the Housing Element Community Workshop several residents who attended the Housing
Element workshop pointed to the need for more aggressive enforcement of the existing
regulations. In April 2014, the City increased the fine to $1,000 per day for illegal vacation
rentals.

Ownership Housing Affordability
Figure 7 shows the median sale prices for existing and new homes in Healdsburg between 1990
and 2014. The sale price for existing and new homes increased steadily from 1990 to late 2005
and early 2006. After 2006, the housing market slowdown affected sale prices in Healdsburg. As
shown in Table 19, between 2006 and mid-2009, the median sale price for existing homes
decreased by 32.8 percent and by over 60 percent for new homes. While this made housing
more affordable for some new homebuyers, it left other homeowners with “underwater”
mortgages – owing more for their homes than the free-market value. Prices began to rise again
in 2011 and have been increasing steadily; the median sales price of existing and new homes was
$515,000 and $613,500 respectively in 2014. It is likely that housing prices will continue this
upward trend during the Housing Element planning period.

Even as housing prices plummeted nationally and throughout the state during the recession of
the late 2000s, homes in Healdsburg, particularly those near the plaza, retained much of their
value. Homes in Healdsburg generally command higher prices than much of California, given the
city’s desirable climate; its surroundings of vineyards and world-class wineries, wooded hillsides,
and the Russian River; its proximity to the San Francisco Bay Area and a full range of services in
nearby communities; and its historic small-town character.

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                                   3. Existing Housing Needs
Brokers report that demand for housing in Healdsburg is high, and that the market has been
more resilient than other parts of Sonoma County. A major portion of demand comes from
those looking for vacation homes that can ultimately become a retirement residence. Local
realtors have noticed a recent trend of home purchases for use as second (or third) homes by
residents of the San Francisco Bay Area, Portland, Seattle, Los Angeles, the East Coast, and
foreign countries. These purchases attest to Healdsburg’s attractiveness as a weekend and
vacation destination as well as the desire for some to own a low-maintenance property for
eventual use as a retirement residence. The downtown core is most often cited as the focus
area for these potential homebuyers; walking distance to the Plaza and a house with "character"
are the top priorities. As more of these types of homeowners dominate the housing market in
Healdsburg, less housing is available for permanent residents. If demand for housing continues
to be greater than supply, home prices will increase accordingly. This can lead to a “squeezing
out” effect where long-time residents can no longer afford to stay in Healdsburg.

the past are “workforce” or “middle income” households–often with two wage earners,
earning between 121 and 180 percent of area median income (the lower end of the above
moderate-income group). These households do not typically qualify for the traditional housing
assistance programs, but may also have trouble affording market rate housing. As described
above, the 2014 median sale price for existing homes in Healdsburg was $515,000, which would
require a family of three to have an income equal to over 145 percent of the median income.
Table 20 compares home sale prices in Healdsburg to neighboring communities within Sonoma
County. Every community (except Bodega Bay and Kenwood) in Sonoma County experienced
an increase in median prices from 2012 to 2013. As shown, Healdsburg had one of the highest
median sales price ($475,000) compared to other incorporated cities in Sonoma County.
Healdsburg experienced a 10.5 percent increase in median sales price between 2012 and 2013.
The unincorporated community of Penngrove exhibited the highest median sales price in the
county of $675,000.

Foreclosures
With low interest rates, “creative” financing (e.g., zero down, interest only, adjustable loans),
and predatory lending practices (e.g., aggressive marketing, hidden fees, negative amortization),
many households nationwide purchased homes that were beyond their financial means in the

early to mid 2000s. Under the assumptions that refinancing to lower interest rates would
always be an option and home prices would continue to rise at double-digit rates, many
households were unprepared for the hikes in interest rates, expiration of short-term fixed
rates, and decline in prices set off in 2006. Suddenly faced with significantly inflated mortgage
payments, and mortgage loans that are larger than the worth of the homes, foreclosure was the
only option available to many households.
In 2008 the number of foreclosures peaked in Sonoma County with 2,820 homes in
foreclosure. In 2013 Sonoma County foreclosures dropped to their lowest level in seven years;
499 county homeowners lost properties at foreclosure auctions last year. In April 2014,
RealtyTrac reported that there were 24 properties in some stage of foreclosure in Healdsburg:
pre foreclosure (16.7 percent), auction (66.7 percent), or bank owned (16.7 percent).7 This is
equivalent to one in every 1,283 homes. Figure 8 shows historical foreclosure data for
Healdsburg from zillow.com. The number of foreclosures has been decreasing in the past few
years and is now similar to pre-2006 rates.

Housing Affordability
Table 22 shows the affordable housing cost guidelines established in Section 50052.5 and 50053
of the California Health and Safety Code. The guidelines are based on the median income
calculated by HCD income limits. As described earlier, the generally accepted definition of
housing affordability is for a household to pay no more than 30 percent of its gross annual
income on housing. It should be noted that moderate-income households and above have more

Table 23 shows the 2013 HCD-defined household income limits for very low-, low-, and
moderate-income households in Sonoma County (including Healdsburg) by the number of
persons in the household. It also shows maximum affordable monthly rents and maximum
affordable purchase prices for homes. For example, a three-person low-income household with
an income limit at 60 percent of the area median could afford to pay a monthly gross rent
(including utilities) of up to $1,039. A three-person low-income household with an income limit
at 70 percent of the area median could afford to purchase a house priced at or below
$195,702.

As shown in Table 24, many of the jobs in Healdsburg and the region have salaries within the
low-income range. These include jobs in the service sector, such as waiters, cooks, and food
preparation workers. In many cases, even the combined wages of two workers result in a
lower-income household.

moderate incomes would have trouble finding affordable for-sale housing in the city.
3.4     Fair Housing
Affordability, availability, and accessibility are key issues in providing and maintaining fair housing
choices. Since its adoption in 1968, the Fair Housing Act has made it illegal to discriminate on
the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, familial status, and disability.
There is little evidence of recent housing discrimination in Healdsburg. According to the Office
of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, only one complaint was filed in Healdsburg in 2013. The complaint was related
to disabilities. 8 The Petaluma People Services Center has not received any complaints since
they began providing fair housing services to Healdsburg during the 2011 and 2012 fiscal year.
Existing fair housing practices of the City of Healdsburg include:
       Mandating the implementation of fair housing practices in contracts with affordable
        housing developers.
       Disseminating fair housing information through posters, brochures, forms, and
        landlord/tenant handbooks from the State Department of Fair Employment and the
        Petaluma People Services Center Fair Housing of Sonoma County in public locations.
       Referring fair housing complaints to the State Department of Fair Employment and
        Housing and the Petaluma People Services Center Fair Housing of Sonoma County.
       Conducting outreach efforts for the City’s affordable housing programs in Spanish as
        well as English and publicizing the programs through such organizations as churches.
       Using the Uniform Housing Code standards for maximum occupancy of dwelling units,
        which has no limit on the number of residents in a dwelling unit, as long as minimum
        floor area requirements are met.
       Providing equitable public services throughout the city, including public transportation,
        crime prevention, police protection, street lighting, street cleaning, trash collection,
        recreational facilities and programs, and schools; and providing for the development of
        commercial centers in all neighborhoods.
       Promoting the provision of housing affordable to lower-income households, which
        affirmatively furthers fair housing because minority families and persons with disabilities
        are disproportionately represented among those that would benefit from low-cost
        housing.

3.5     Housing Problems
Overpayment for Housing
The State of California considers a lower-income household (i.e., 80 percent or less of area
median income) that pays more than 30 percent of its income for housing (rent or mortgage
payment plus utilities) to be living in unaffordable housing and “overpaying” for housing. Based
on this standard and 2006-2010 ACS data, approximately 990 Healdsburg homeowners (40.7
percent of all homeowners) and 1,160 renters (60.4 percent of all renters) overpaid for housing
in 2010 (Table 25).
However, the 30 percent standard is deceptive because, for many low-income families, spending
30 percent on housing costs leaves very little for other necessities, whereas for middle-income
families, it is an appropriate expenditure level. In 2010 there were a total of 626 lower-income
homeowners, of which 59.9 percent experienced overpayment. Nearly 78 percent of all lower-
income renters (1,285) overpaid for housing.
Households that spend 50 percent or more of their income are considered “extremely cost
burdened.” As expected, a higher percentage of lower-income households fall into this category
(approximately 45.5 percent of all lower-income homeowners and 44.0 percent of all lower-
income renters) than higher-income households (only 5.3 percent of higher-income
homeowners and 1.6 percent higher-income renters).

Overcrowding
High housing costs can force lower-income households to share living accommodations with
extended family and friends, or rent out rooms in their homes, leading to crowded living
conditions. Large household sizes, multi-generational households, high numbers of children per
household, low incomes, and the limited availability of large rental units are all related to
overcrowding. In 2010, renter households in Healdsburg had a larger household size (2.81
persons per household) than owner-occupied units (2.38 persons per household). The
percentage of renter households with five or more persons was 18.8 percent, which was three
times that of the percentage owner households (6.6 percent) (Table 26).

In 2010, only 175 (4 percent) of occupied housing units in the city had more than one person
per room (excluding kitchens and bathrooms) and were therefore considered “overcrowded”
(Table 27). The level of overcrowding in Healdsburg was significantly lower than the statewide
level of 8.2 percent.
Less than 1 percent of all units were severely-overcrowded (over 1.5 persons per room).
Overall, renter-occupied units made up the entirety of the overcrowded and severely-
overcrowded units.

3.6     Special Housing Needs
Housing Element law requires the consideration of housing needs of “special needs” persons
and households. Certain groups have greater difficulty finding decent, affordable housing due to
their special circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one’s employment and
income, age, family characteristics, or disabilities. As a result, certain segments of Healdsburg’s
population may experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, housing cost
burden, or other housing problems.
State Housing Element law identifies the following “special needs” groups: elderly households;
disabled persons, including those with developmental disabilities; large households; female-
headed households; families and persons in need of emergency shelter; and agricultural
workers.
The Elderly
Elderly households are defined as those with a householder 65 years or older. The 2010
Census reported 863 ownership units and 284 rental units with a householder 65 years or
older.9 A large share of elderly households in Healdsburg owned their homes (75.2 percent).
While only 15 percent of the total city population was aged 65 or over, 26 percent of
households were headed by persons 65 and over, which demonstrates that a large share of
residents that are 65 years and over live by themselves.
Elderly Housing Needs
Some elderly homeowners are not physically or financially able to maintain their homes. While
younger homeowners can usually perform routine home repairs themselves, elderly
homeowners are often too frail to do so and must rely on others for assistance. They may also
not be able to afford modifications that are needed to ensure their safety and improve their
mobility, such as grab bars and ramps.
Younger homeowners may be more willing to move out of a home if they no longer consider
its features adequate. Elderly people are often less willing to move, despite the physical
condition of their homes. Most often the home is paid for, so it is more cost effective to stay in
the home.
The majority of the elderly are on fixed incomes such as pensions, Social Security, and/or
personal savings, which can result in an excessive proportion of their income going towards
housing, especially lower-income elderly households that do not qualify for Section 8 rental
assistance. According to 2010 CHAS data, the percentage of elderly renters paying more than
30 percent of their income for housing costs in 2010 was greater than that of Healdsburg
renters in general (70.0 percent versus 60.4 percent). However, the percentage of elderly
homeowners paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing costs in 2010 was less
than that of Healdsburg homeowners in general (37.6 percent versus 40.6 percent), which may
be due to the fact that many elderly households no longer have mortgage payments.
Additionally, the 2010 ACS reports only 4.0 percent of elderly Healdsburg householders had
incomes below the poverty level in 2010, compared to 9.3 percent of households citywide.

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                                      3. Existing Housing Needs
For the elderly who cannot live independently, congregate or group housing provides small
individual units without kitchens or with minimal provision for cooking. Some common facilities
and services are also provided, including shared arrangements for meals and housekeeping
services. Congregate care housing is particularly attractive to older persons, as building design
and services can be tailored to their specific needs.
Life care facilities can also provide all levels of care on the same site to meet the progressively
greater needs of the elderly. These facilities often have apartments, congregate housing, an
infirmary, and nursing home in the same complex. Elderly persons buy into a life care project
with an initial fee, and then pay a monthly fee thereafter. The fee usually guarantees occupancy
in a particular size of apartment and one meal a day. Tenants may also move into a “personal
care” unit or nursing facility if health support needs change.
House sharing can provide older homeowners with revenue, as well as added security and
companionship, and provide renters with affordable housing. Secondary units, which are
separate units within a home or on the same site as a single family home, offer the same
advantages plus privacy.
Existing Housing and Assistance for the Elderly
More than 350 units concentrated in the southeast portion of the city are restricted to
occupants 55 years and older. Fitch Mountain Terrace I and II have 59 rental units that are
restricted to very low- and low-income householders aged 62 years and over. In 2016 Fitch
Mountain Terrace 1 will be losing Rental Housing Construction Program Rural Rental
Assistance (RHCP-RRA); all 30 very low-income units will convert to low-income. However,
each of these projects, Fitch Mountain Terrace I and II, has about 15 to 20 people on their
waiting list, with a wait time of one to three years. Another 23 units restricted to very low-
income senior households are located at Park Land Senior Apartments, at the north end of the
city.
Healdsburg Senior Living Community is licensed for 110 clients and provides skilled nursing,
assisted living, and dementia care. The community’s current population is an even mix of people
who formerly lived elsewhere in Healdsburg and parents of current Healdsburg residents.
Occupancy of the assisted living units is currently at 92 percent, and the City of Healdsburg has
approved a master plan that would allow expansion of the facility. In addition to this facility, a
senior care home located at 121 Fitch Street is licensed for 19 residents.
The Senior Center provides information on local subsidized senior housing and fair housing
assistance, as well as copies of the screened list of senior housing providers compiled by the
Sonoma County Area Agency on Aging. Other housing-related inquiries at the Senior Center
are from widows who are living with family members and wish to find independent local
housing, but do not qualify for Section 8 housing assistance because of their income.10
The Disabled
Persons with physical, visual, hearing, and mental disabilities have special housing needs. These
needs can include ramps instead of stairs, elevators for units with two or more stories,
modified bathrooms, wider doorways, lower shelves, and other modifications. State law
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                    Page 43

requires all new multifamily construction to be accessible to persons with disabilities, but
existing housing units are often not accessible or designed for the disabled. Many persons with
disabilities also have fixed incomes, which can limit housing options.
The 2008-2012 ACS reported a total of 1,351 Healdsburg residents in all of the disability
categories described above, representing 12 percent of the city’s civilian non-institutionalized
population. However, the ACS does not quantify the number of persons whose disability
affected their ability to live in conventional housing or to afford housing. Nearly 31 percent of
disabled residents were aged 65 years or older, which is double the percentage that they
represent in the city’s population as a whole. Most elderly residents with a disability had a
hearing disability.
As shown in Table 28, youth under the age of five did not experience any disabilities. Cognitive
disabilities were more common in youth 5-17 years of age, affecting 72.3 percent of those who
reported a disability. For adult residents (18-64 years of age), cognitive, ambulatory, and
independent living disabilities were the most prevalent. Seniors were more frequently affected
by ambulatory disabilities.

SB 812, which took effect in January 2011, amended State housing element law to require an
evaluation of the special housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities. A
"developmental disability" is defined as a disability that originates before an individual becomes
18 years old, continues or can be expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial
disability for that individual. This includes Mental Retardation, Cerebral Palsy, Epilepsy, and
Autism.
The North Bay Regional Center, which serves the developmentally disabled under contract
with the California Department of Developmental Services, reported that 77 of their clients
lived in Healdsburg as of January 2014. Of the total, 51.9 percent of disabled persons are 18 or
older. Most developmentally-disabled residents in Healdsburg have an intellectual disability (55.8
percent) and many are autistic (15.6 percent)
Few developmentally-disabled Healdsburg residents receiving services from the North Bay
Regional Center lived in a group home facility (fewer than 10). Most developmentally-disabled

individuals lived at home (83.1 percent). Many developmentally-disabled persons are able to live
and work independently. However, more severely disabled individuals require a group living
environment with supervision, or an institutional environment with medical attention and
physical therapy. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first housing
issue for the developmentally disabled is the transition from living with a parent/guardian as a
child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
According to Becoming Independent, a Sonoma County organization that works with persons
who have developmental disabilities, Healdsburg is an ideal setting for some clients because of
the small-town atmosphere and open-minded attitudes of residents. Many clients do not drive,
so the fact that parts of Healdsburg are walkable is very beneficial.
Disabled Housing Needs
According to the 2010 Sonoma County Consolidated Plan, the housing needs of persons with
disabilities are similar to those of seniors. As reported in the Plan, a survey of many nonprofits
and social service agencies indicated that the disabled need low-cost, accessible housing close to
public transportation, shopping, and medical facilities. The provision of accessibility
modifications in the existing housing stock, as well as new accessible housing units for disabled
households, is a growing need as more disabled persons are striving to lead independent and
productive lives.
Developmentally disabled and mentally disabled individuals require a variety of supportive living
arrangements. Becoming Independent staff identified a need for small, affordable studio
apartments, apartments that accept Section 8 vouchers, apartments located on the first floor,
housing located near public transportation, and housing located in mixed used developments.
The Community Support Network, a private non-profit organization located in Santa Rosa,
operates several housing facilities in the region designed to serve the needs of people with
emotional, mental, or developmental disabilities. Demand for their facilities is great, turnover is
rare, and the vacancy rates are zero. There are no Community Support Network facilities
located in Healdsburg. Facilities are needed in Healdsburg to allow people with disabilities to
remain in their own community where their social networks are strongest and most familiar.
Foss Creek Court Apartments operates five supportive housing units for the mentally disabled.
Besides the construction of new accessible housing, the needs of individuals with limitations can
sometimes be met by retrofitting existing housing to transform conventional units into suitable
housing. This is perhaps the least costly way to provide housing specifically for individuals with
special limitations.

State and Federal Requirements
In response to the serious lack of accessible housing in the United States, the Fair Housing Act
of 1988 and the Americans with Disabilities Act require that all ground floor dwelling units in
buildings of four or more units without elevators and all dwelling units in elevator buildings of
four or more units include the following basic features of accessible and adaptive design:
        Public and common areas must be accessible to persons with disabilities.
      Doors and hallways must be wide enough for wheelchairs.
      All units must have:
          An accessible route into and through the unit;
          Accessible light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other environmental
              controls;
          Reinforced bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and
          Kitchens and bathrooms that can be used by people in wheelchairs.
In the case of persons with a physical or mental disability (including hearing, mobility, and visual
impairments, chronic alcoholism, chronic mental illness, AIDS, AIDS Related Complex, and
mental retardation) that substantially limits one or more major life activities, landlords may not:
        Refuse to let tenants make reasonable modifications to their dwelling or common use
         areas, at their expense, if necessary for the disabled person to use the housing; or
      Refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services if
         necessary for the disabled person to use the housing.
Furthermore, State and Federal laws prohibit housing discrimination against the disabled in land
use practices and decisions, such as applying special requirements that limit the ability of
disabled individuals to live in the residence of their choice. Local governments must also make
reasonable accommodations when necessary to afford persons with disabilities the opportunity
to use and enjoy a dwelling.
State law prohibits the City from treating facilities that provide permanent or transitional group
living environments for persons with a physical and/or mental disability differently from other
housing types without a compelling reason. State law requires local jurisdictions to make
reasonable accommodations for these facilities in its land use policies and decisions.
Furthermore, licensed group homes and residential care facilities with six or fewer residents
must be considered a residential use and the occupants must be considered a family. Group
homes must be allowed in any area zoned for residential use, and the City may not place
requirements or standards on these homes in addition to or different from those placed on
other family dwellings of the same type in the same zone. Larger facilities are also entitled to
reasonable accommodations and may not be denied or be subject to conditions of approval
based solely on the fact that the home will be occupied by persons with mental or physical
disabilities.
The Healdsburg Zoning Ordinance defines family as “An individual or two or more persons
living together in a dwelling unit as a single housekeeping unit and in compliance with the
provisions of the California Uniform Housing Code.” This definition is not restrictive.

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                                   3. Existing Housing Needs
The City’s building codes incorporate the latest State and Federal requirements for disabled-
accessible housing. There have been no code amendments that would diminish the City’s ability
to accommodate persons with disabilities.
Reasonable Accommodation
Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act direct
local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e., modifications or exceptions) in
their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such accommodations may be necessary
to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For example, it
may be reasonable to accommodate requests from persons with disabilities to waive a setback
requirement or other standard of the Zoning Ordinance to ensure that homes are accessible
for the mobility impaired. Whether a particular modification is reasonable depends on the
circumstances.
In 2010 the City amended its Zoning Ordinance to include a reasonable accommodation review
process that provides flexibility when necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities.
The Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance contains a formal procedure for an individual with
a disability seeking equal access to housing to request reasonable accommodation.
City Support for the Disabled
Disabled-accessible units were provided in multifamily projects constructed in Healdsburg
during the 1999-2006 period, including Canyon Run Apartments and Oak Grove Apartments.
All but four of the Park Land Senior Apartments are accessible or can be adapted for disabled.
According to the California Department of Social Services, there are no licensed group homes
or adult residential facilities in Healdsburg that provide 24-hour, non-medical care and
supervision in a supportive living environment for the physically handicapped, developmentally
disabled, or mentally disabled. However, the Salvation Army operates a “transitional living
program” in a Healdsburg home for six single males recovering from alcoholism or addiction.
The Healdsburg Zoning Ordinance was recently amended to add transitional housing and
supportive housing as a permitted or conditionally-permitted use in all zones allowing
residential uses.
Large Households
Large households are defined by State Housing Element Law as households with five or more
members. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, there were 516 such households, or 11.8
percent of all households in Healdsburg. Of these, 167 (32.4 percent) lived in owner-occupied
units and 349 (67.6 percent) occupied rental units.
Large Family Housing Needs
Large households require housing units with more bedrooms than typical housing units. In
general, housing for these households should provide safe outdoor play areas for children and
should be located to provide convenient access to schools and childcare facilities. These types
of needs can pose problems particularly for large families that cannot afford to buy or rent
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                 Page 47

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                                     3. Existing Housing Needs
single family houses, as apartment and condominium units are often developed with childless or
smaller households in mind.
Lower-income, large households generally have difficulty locating appropriately-sized housing.
Very few market-rate rental projects offer three- or four-bedroom units. Whereas 77.4
percent of owner-occupied units in Healdsburg contained three or more bedrooms in 2012,
only 37.4 percent of renter-occupied units were as large.
Existing Housing for Large Families
The City worked with its affordable housing partners, including the developers of the Harvest
Grove and Riverfield Homes projects, to ensure the inclusion of larger units. Four-bedroom
units were also included in the following affordable housing projects developed between 1999
and 2014: Canyon Run Apartments (6 units), Quarry Ridge (5 units), and Oak Grove
Apartments (16 units).
Female-Headed Households
The 2010 Census documented 465 Healdsburg families (258 with own children under 18 years)
that were headed by a female with no husband present (21.1 percent of all families with
children). In 2012 147 female-headed households, or 24.7 percent, lived below the poverty
level, all of which had children under 18 years. Female-headed households represent
approximately 55 percent of all Healdsburg families living in poverty. Due to lower incomes,
female-headed households often have more difficulty finding adequate, affordable housing than
families with two adults. Also, female-headed households with young children may need to pay
for childcare, which further reduces disposable income. This special needs group would benefit
generally from expanded affordable housing opportunities.
Farmworkers
Although there is a limited amount of land within the city limits devoted to agricultural uses, an
important part of the city’s economy is related to the viticulture that surrounds the community.
Visitors drawn to the region’s vineyards and wineries patronize the city’s tasting rooms, wine
bars, and wine shops, as well as its restaurants, retail establishments, and overnight
accommodations. The 2008-2012 ACS reported that 346 city residents were employed in
farming, fishing, and forestry occupations in 2012.
Farmworker Housing Needs
Farmworkers have a difficult time locating affordable housing in Sonoma County. Due to a
combination of limited English language skills and very low household incomes, the ability to
obtain housing loans for home purchase is extremely limited. For the same reasons, rentals are
also difficult to obtain.
Housing needs include permanent family housing as well as accommodations for migrant single
men, such as dormitory-style housing, especially during peak labor activity in September and
October. If this housing is not available, then individuals and families are forced to crowd into
rental units and unconventional forms of housing such as converted motels.

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                                      3. Existing Housing Needs
The lack of adequate migrant farmworker housing results in homelessness among farmworkers
who come to the Healdsburg area during the summer and harvest months. North County
Community Services (NCCS), a non-profit organization based in Healdsburg, reports that the
number of calls from farmworkers surges during the summer months.
Existing Housing for Farmworkers
Housing in Healdsburg specifically for farmworkers includes the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA)-subsidized Harvest Grove Apartments, which provides 44 units to very low-income
farmworker households. This project was constructed in 1996 on property zoned Multifamily
Residential. As of May 2014, there are 20 families on the waiting list for the complex. Its
manager, the non-profit Burbank Housing Development Corporation, reports that it is difficult
to find qualified tenants because of occupancy restrictions tied to the USDA funding: the
primary household wage earner must be working legally in the United States and must be
employed in qualified farm labor (i.e., working directly with raw agricultural products). It is
particularly difficult to find tenants for the four-bedroom units, because larger households tend
to have income levels that exceed the maximum allowed by occupancy restrictions.
Additional agricultural worker housing in Healdsburg includes the 20 units at Quarry Ridge, an
ownership project financed partially by the USDA and constructed on a 8.66-acre site in the
Parkland Farms area. The site was rezoned to Planned Development to allow a modification to
Zoning Ordinance development standards, including minimum lot size (the lots range in size
from 2,420 to 4,120 square feet), side and rear yard setbacks, and minimum lot width. The
initial purchasers contributed their own “sweat equity” to the construction of their home. The
project’s program also includes a reduced mortgage loan, favorable loan terms, and reduced
cash down payment requirements.
North County Community Services (NCCS), a local non-profit group, refers many calls from
farmworkers for housing assistance to Santa Rosa-based California Human Development, which
has Spanish-speaking staff and runs a rental assistance program.
The Homeless
A person or family is considered homeless if they lack a fixed and regular nighttime residence,
or have a primary nighttime residence that is a supervised, publicly-operated shelter designated
for providing temporary living accommodations. A person or family is also considered homeless
if they are residing in a public or private place not designated for, or ordinarily used as a regular
sleeping accommodation for human beings (e.g., the street, abandoned buildings, vehicles,
encampments).
Reasons for homelessness include:
        Insufficient income
        Personal emergencies
        Inadequate support systems
        Chronic substance abuse
        Spousal/partner abuse or abandonment
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                    Page 49

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                                     3. Existing Housing Needs
        Physical or mental illness
      A lack of life skills
      Loss of employment
Populations at risk of becoming homeless also include those living in subsidized housing units if
their subsidies are discontinued, and those who have fixed or low incomes facing rent increases.
It is very difficult to reliably estimate the numbers of homeless. The Sonoma County Task Force
on the Homeless conducted a “point in time” count of the county’s homeless between January
26 and 31, 201311, to which the City of Healdsburg contributed funding. The count identified 59
homeless persons in Healdsburg during this time (1.7 percent of the countywide number); 24
were considered unsheltered and 35 were sheltered. This is less than the 2011 count of 112
homeless persons in Healdsburg.12
In July 2008 the Healdsburg Police Department reported three homeless camps within the city
limits that had 10 to 12 residents each, 90 percent of whom were male. There were also six
transient individuals, two of whom had a mental disability. In 2014 the Department has
observed more encampments than reported in 2008; however, each encampment has fewer
homeless persons living in them. Since March 2013 the Department has tracked 15 different
encampment locations, however, some of the same persons have been visited in multiple
locations as they move their encampments. The North County Community Services (NCCS)
reported in May 2014 that the majority of the homeless population in Healdsburg were male
(30), and five were female. They also estimated that there are approximately three homeless
families, and that this number is increasing.
The number of homeless persons in Healdsburg could actually be higher than those identified
by the 2013 count or the Police Department or NCCS. Based on information from service
providers, many of Healdsburg’s homeless are itinerant farmworkers, whose population peaks
in September through October.
Homeless Housing Needs
Housing needs of the homeless are wide-ranging; this group includes persons who are homeless
for many different reasons, as described above. Some need assistance with covering first and
last rent payments and security deposits. The mentally and physically disabled need support
services such as counseling, along with housing. Historically many social service organizations
and resources have been provided in Santa Rosa, approximately 15 miles south of Healdsburg.
Service providers emphasize the need for services within the city of Healdsburg.
Sonoma County’s 10-Year Homeless Action Plan (2007)13 identified local investment in
assistance for the homeless and capacity building in Healdsburg as critical to enable local service
providers to own and operate housing at the scale needed. The Plan calls for Healdsburg to add
at least six emergency shelter beds.
Local Assistance for the Homeless
In 2002 the City of Healdsburg purchased and rehabilitated a deteriorated four-unit apartment
building, Victory Apartments, at 308 East Street in downtown Healdsburg to be used as a
Page 50                                                              Adopted November 17, 2014

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                                   3. Existing Housing Needs
transitional housing facility for up to 16 very low-income persons, including children.
Transitional housing bridges the gap between homelessness and permanent housing. It is
typically a temporary shared living environment with the provision of supportive services that
are designed to help persons transitioning from homelessness to maintain stability and to
prevent repeated homelessness. The City leases the Victory Apartments building to NCCS to
operate and maintain this facility.
NCCS also operates the Spare Room, an emergency shelter located in St. Paul’s Episcopal
Church. The facility has two sets of bunk beds to accommodate one to four people for one to
three nights. In emergencies, two additional people can be accommodated. Staff reports that it
is always full and that many guests stay at the shelter multiple times during a single month.
Guests are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis, with women and children receiving first
preference. NCCS provides sheets and toiletries. St. Paul’s Church also makes a shower
available to the general homeless population, providing approximately 100 showers per month.
In 2008, 2009, and 2013 St. Paul’s received grant funding totaling $8,925 related to shelter
services.
Additionally, NCCS provides: Holbrook Apartment, a transitional housing unit for families and
Victory Studios, a seven-plex for single occupancy transitional housing.
According to a NCCS representative, the city of Healdsburg needs a permanent shelter for the
homeless population with support services, including counselors and case workers.
Homeless Housing Opportunities
Few buildings in Healdsburg could be readily and economically converted into a conventional
emergency shelter. Given high apartment occupancy rates and the fact that local motels are
thriving, there may not be an opportunity to develop emergency housing in this manner. There
are also no residential hotels, rooming houses, or similar buildings that lend themselves to
conversion to a traditional emergency shelter.
If a conventional emergency shelter were established in Healdsburg, it would probably be in a
newly-constructed building. The shelter should be located close to public services and facilities,
including transportation, and easily accessible from areas where homeless persons congregate.
Homeless shelters are defined by the Healdsburg Zoning Ordinance as “a facility for the shelter
and feeding of persons who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence for up to 30
consecutive days, where such shelter is operated by a public or non-profit agency.” They are
permitted in Service Commercial (CS) and Public Districts. Shelters located in residential
districts, when not developed in an individual dwelling unit format, are not subject to the
underlying zoning district’s maximum unit density standard, but the number of beds is limited to
three times the maximum number of dwelling units that would otherwise be permitted.
The City Council recently (July 2014) approved a new definition of transitional housing that
more fully complies with State law. The new definition reads as such: “transitional housing is
rental housing operated under program requirements that call for the termination of assistance
and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at a predetermined
future point in time that shall be no less than six months from the beginning of the assistance.
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                 Page 51

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                                    3. Existing Housing Needs
Transitional housing units are residential units subject only to those requirements and
restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.” Transitional
housing is permitted the same as other residential uses of the same type in all zones allowing
residential uses; the amendment also allows transitional housing in PR and I zones, where it
previously had not been permitted.

Long-Term Affordable Housing
In addition to market-rate housing that is affordable to lower- and moderate-income
households by virtue of characteristics such as amenities, location, condition, and age, there are
currently 387 units (8 percent of total units) within the city whose long-term affordability to
these households is assured through deed restrictions and other agreements (see Table 29 and
Figure 9). Beginning in 1986, the City of Healdsburg has worked with for-profit and non-profit
developers to provide a range of housing types targeted to meet the needs of families, seniors,
farmworkers, and the homeless. Appendix B provides details on each of these affordable
projects.

At-Risk Housing
An affordable rental housing development is a development where all or a portion of the
housing units must be rented at affordable levels to extremely low-, very low-, and low-income
households. The units are made affordable for an extended period of time by subsidy contracts,
deed restrictions, and/or development agreements. When the contracts, deed restrictions, and
development agreements expire, the units can be rented at market rates to any household.
State housing element law requires an analysis of the affordable housing developments to
determine if there are any affordable units that are at risk of being converted to market rate
units. The “at-risk” analysis must cover a period of 10 years.
None of the affordable units shown in Table 29 are at risk of converting to market rate within
the 10-year period of 2015 to 2025.
California Government Code Section 65863.10 requires that owners of Federally-assisted
properties provide notices of intent to convert their properties to market rate 12 months prior
and again at 6 months prior to the expiration of their contract, opt-outs, or prepayment.
Owners must provide notices of intent to public agencies, including HCD and the local public
housing authority, as well as to all impacted tenant households. The six-month notice must
include specific information on the owner’s plans, timetables, and reasons for termination.
Under Government Code Section 65863.11, owners of Federally-assisted projects must
provide a Notice of Opportunity to Submit an Offer to Purchase to Qualified Entities, non-
profit or for-profit organizations that agree to preserve the long-term affordability if they
should acquire at-risk projects, at least one year before the sale or expiration of use
restrictions. Qualified entities have first right of refusal for acquiring at-risk units. HCD keeps a
current list of all of the qualified entities across the state. The qualified entities that HCD lists
for Sonoma County are found in Table 30.

4.1     ABAG Projections 2013
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is the official comprehensive planning
agency for nine Northern California counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San
Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma. Among other responsibilities, ABAG
prepares bi-annual, long-term forecasts of population, households, and employment. The most
recent edition of ABAG’s long-term forecast was prepared in 2013. The forecast recognizes
emerging trends in markets, demographics, and local policies that promote infill development
and transit-oriented development, but is also designed to realistically assess growth in the
region. ABAG expects the Bay Area’s population to grow by about 2 million people between
2010 and 2040, which makes population growth and how it will shape the region in 2040
central to the forecast.
According to the 2013 ABAG projections, Healdsburg’s population is estimated to grow by 333
residents between 2010 and 2020 and 733 residents between 2010 and 2030.
Table 31 compares the population projections for the city of Healdsburg to other cities within
Sonoma County for the years 2010 to 2030. Healdsburg is expected to experience the smallest
percent change in population (6.5 percent), while Cloverdale is expected to experience the
highest population growth of 21.8 percent. Sonoma County as a whole is expected to grow by
14.8 percent. According to the 2008-2012 ACS, the average household size in Healdsburg is
2.54. If the average household size remains constant between 2010 and 2030, the projected
population increase would require 217 new housing units.

According to ABAG, there were 6,440 jobs in the city of Healdsburg and 192,010 jobs in
Sonoma County in 2010. Healdsburg has 3.4 percent of the jobs in the county. ABAG projects
that the city of Healdsburg will add 1,770 new jobs between 2010 and 2040, increasing from
6,440 to 8,210 jobs. This represents a 27.5 percent increase in local jobs, or an annual average
increase of 0.9 percent. Between 2010 and 2030, jobs in Healdsburg are projected to increase
18.3 percent; however, population is only projected to grow by 6.5 percent. This projected
growth scenario might indicate a growing commuter workforce, especially if the types and
amount of housing built do not meet the needs of the growing workforce.
4.2     Regional Housing Need Determination
The State of California requires each jurisdiction to plan for its share of the state’s housing
need for all income levels. HCD and ABAG, the regional planning agency, determine the
Regional Housing Need Allocation (RNHA), assigning each community a share of the region’s
housing need for an approximately eight-year period. The regional housing needs process
addresses one of the most significant problems facing the state, region, and community: a lack
of affordable housing for people of all income levels. The RHNA aims to increase the supply,
diversity, and affordability of housing; promote infill development and more efficient land use
patterns; promote an improved intraregional relationship between jobs and housing; protect
environmental resources; and promote socioeconomic equity.14
For the 2014 to 2022 projection period, HCD has identified a need for 187,990 housing units in
the entire ABAG region. This determination is based on population projections produced by
the California Department of Finance (DOF) and ABAG. HCD adjusted the final count to
account for abnormally high vacancies and unique market conditions due to residual
recessionary effects, high unemployment, and unprecedented foreclosures.

The assigned need is broken down by income categories: very low, low, moderate, and above
moderate. It is this RHNA that communities must use when making adequate provision for
their housing needs in their housing elements.
Table 32 shows the RHNA for new construction in Healdsburg during the planning period,
adjusted to include its need for extremely low-income housing. State law requires that the City
determine the subset of the very low-income regional need that constitutes the community’s
need for extremely low-income housing. Local governments can either identify their own
methodology for calculating the need or presume that the need is 50 percent of the total very
low-income need. (The City of Healdsburg has chosen the latter method to estimate its
extremely low-income need.)

5       Housing Development Constraints
Constraints to the provision of adequate and affordable housing are created by market,
governmental, infrastructure, and environmental factors, among others. These factors may
constrain the development of housing, particularly housing affordable to lower-income
households. Constraints can generally be divided into “governmental constraints” – those that
are controlled by Federal, State, and local governments – and “nongovernmental constraints” –
factors that are not generally created or cannot be affected by government controls. An
analysis of these factors can help in the development of programs that lessen their effect on the
supply and cost of housing.
5.1     Governmental Constraints
Governmental regulations and exactions are designed to achieve desirable land use patterns,
coordinate development with infrastructure expansion, finance capital improvements, equitably
distribute the cost of public services, maintain the ambiance of existing neighborhoods, improve
the urban environment, and preserve open space and unique ecosystems.
However, they should be evaluated to determine whether they are excessive and represent an
unnecessary constraint on the availability or affordability of housing being built, or contribute to
the loss of existing affordable housing.
Healdsburg 2030 General Plan
In addition to the Housing Element, the Land Use Element of the General Plan directly affects
the location and type of housing that may be developed. The Land Use Element’s land use
designations provide for a variety of housing types with the density parameters shown in Table
33. Minimum densities are required for most of the designations in order to maximize
residential development on a limited supply of land and achieve a balance and variety of housing
types.

According to State law, the density that is deemed appropriate for affordable housing to be
feasible in Healdsburg is 20 dwellings per acre. The City amended its General Plan in 2010 to
increase the allowed maximum density in the HDR land use designation from 16 to 20 units per
gross acre for projects targeted to lower-income households. In combination with the density
bonuses required by state law, the density achieved by affordable housing projects could exceed
27 units per acre, which is considered to be fairly dense in Sonoma County. In past or recently-

constraint to such housing development. The actual development densities of all affordable
housing projects constructed in Healdsburg since 1986 are shown in Table 34. The average

There is a recent trend towards higher-density affordable housing projects in the city. The 64-
unit Foss Creek Court apartment project, has a density of 20 units per acre, which included a
25 percent density bonus. The project was approved with no reduction in density or number of
units from those initially requested by the non-profit developer. In fact, the City encouraged the
developer to include as many units in the project as feasible. The City Council also approved an
effective density of 44 units per acre for the Victory Apartment and Studios project in 2006.
The Healdsburg Zoning Ordinance also allows the approval of a greater density bonus than
mandated by state law. In 2006, the City approved a 48 percent density bonus for the Chiquita

Grove project with 66 units of affordable housing (with a density of almost 24 units per acre)
but the developers dropped the project. Now Chiquita Grove will consist of 28 units, including
four inclusionary units. The City also approved a 54 percent density bonus for the Habitat for
Humanity project in 2008 for two homes on University Street for four adults and 10 children.
This “track record” demonstrates that the maximum density provided by the Healdsburg
General Plan for the six land use designations that allow high density residential – up to 20 units
per acre for High Density Residential and up to 16 for others – can readily accommodate and
facilitate the construction of lower-income housing. On the other hand, allowing density higher
than 20 units per acre as a matter of right has not been demonstrated to be necessary and
could result in increased neighborhood or community opposition to new housing projects
based on traffic, infrastructure limitations, or environmental concerns.
A limited number of market rate multi-family units have been built in Healdsburg. While funding
assistance in terms of both provision of land and subsidies have facilitated affordable housing
projects for lower-income housing, there have been no similar economic incentives to build
market rate housing on higher-density residentially-zoned land. Despite adequate acreage for
higher-density residential development, both the absence of funding assistance or subsidies as
well as historical market conditions favoring single family housing development over multi-family
housing development has resulted in a lack of any market rate multi-family housing development
being built in recent years in any zones that allow higher densities. The allocation limitations
imposed by the Growth Management Ordinance, discussed in the Non-Governmental
Constraints section, are also thought to be a hindrance to multifamily housing development.
 The Land Use Element includes the following provisions to promote affordable housing:
        Residential uses are promoted in mixed-use projects by exempting the residential floor
         area from the calculation of a project’s maximum floor area ratio.
      In the mixed-use and commercial land use designations, single room occupancy units and
         efficiency apartments of 500 square feet or less are counted as one-half unit for
         purposes of calculating density.
      Small lot subdivisions for affordable housing are allowed on property designated Medium
         Density, Medium High Density, or Downtown Residential. The enacting provisions in
         the Healdsburg Zoning Ordinance allow lots as small as 2,000 square feet as well as
         alternative lot configurations, such as zero lot lines, angled Z lots, zipper lots,
         alternative-width lots, quad lots, and motor court lots.
The Land Use Element requires the preparation of specific plans prior to development of areas
outside of the city limits and within the Healdsburg Sphere of Influence. While this requirement
lengthens the review and approval process for development, it is necessary to ensure that it
occurs in a manner that is consistent with land use and design criteria, environmentally sensitive
areas are conserved and adequate infrastructure is provided. Development Sub-Areas B is
remaining outside of the city limits and within the Healdsburg Sphere of Influence. The Sub-
Area has environmental characteristics that severely constrain development, including
earthquake faults, steep slopes, landslides, oak woodlands, high wildland fire hazard zones,
scenic ridgelines, and riparian corridors. The maximum potential residential development for

Sub-Area B is only 41 units (see Appendix C), which are not needed to help fulfill the City’s
projected housing needs (see Section 4.2).
Healdsburg Zoning Ordinance
The Healdsburg Zoning Ordinance specifies the zoning districts in which residential
development may occur and under what circumstances.
Zoning Districts
Residential uses are allowed in all zoning districts with the exception of the Public, Open Space
and Medical Office Districts (Table 35). In some cases, approval of a conditional use permit is
required to ensure compatibility between residential and non-residential uses. The Zoning
Ordinance does not differentiate between farmworker housing and other types of housing in
terms of permitted or conditionally-permitted uses.

The Zoning Ordinance seeks to preserve the city’s existing housing stock by prohibiting short-
term (less than 30 days) rentals of a complete residential unit as vacation homes for transient
lodging purposes and with no on-site management. Vacation rental homes are conditionally
permitted in the Downtown Commercial (CD) districts. The City enforces rental regulations
by responding to complaints, and does not actively monitor advertisements. The City recently

prohibiting rentals in residential areas they are subject to a $1,000 per day fine.

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                         5. Housing Development Constraints
Residential Development Standards
The Zoning Ordinance prescribes minimum standards for residential lot sizes, yards, and open
space per unit, and maximum standards for lot coverage and building height (Table 36). These
standards are typical of many California communities and contribute to the protection of the
public health, safety and welfare, and the maintenance of the city’s quality of life.
Height limits have not been a constraint to the development of housing for any income groups,
including affordable housing projects. The Oak Grove Apartments affordable housing project
has three stories and the recent Foss Creek Court affordable apartment project has three
stories. Note that the Healdsburg Zoning Ordinance measures building height to half the
distance between the ridge and eave on a gable roof, rather than to the highest point of the
roof, thereby allowing additional height for sloped roofs.
The Zoning Ordinance also provides for Planned Development and Residential Master Plan
overlay zoning districts in which the development standards may be specifically tailored to the
project that is proposed. Healdsburg Commons and Sonata projects have substantially reduced
setbacks and private open space, as well as significantly higher lot coverage than is typically
allowed for residential development. Consistent with the General Plan, the Zoning Ordinance
allows small lot subdivisions for affordable housing in the R-1 and DRD districts on lots as small
as 2,000 square feet and no required setbacks. These provisions were recently used in
approving a low-income Habitat for Humanity project that created two 3,500-square foot lots
from a 7,000-square foot lot.

Parking Standards
The Zoning Ordinance prescribes minimum parking requirements for residential uses. For
single family houses and condominium (ownership) townhouses, two spaces are required per
unit, one of which must be covered. For multifamily rental housing units, 1.5 parking spaces are
required per unit, including one covered space. The guest parking requirement is one
uncovered space per three units. Homeless shelters require one space per residential family,
0.35 spaces per bed, plus one space per maximum number of staff on site. Trailer and mobile
home parks require one space per unit plus one guest space per three units. In July 2014, the
City established a parking in-lieu fee for the downtown area to provide more flexibility in the
provision of parking. Applicants for new developments or businesses can now either provide
required parking on-site or pay an in-lieu fee ($29,800) for each required space that cannot be
provided onsite. Shared use of parking facilities is allowed for mixed-use projects, which can
reduce the number of overall required parking spaces.
The Planning Commission may waive the requirement for covered parking for senior and
affordable housing developments if this will reduce development costs or improve the design of
a project, and may reduce the overall amount of required parking for senior housing. These
requirements have often been modified in the past. The Commission has waived the covered
parking requirement for the Park Land Senior Apartments, Oak Grove Apartments, Canyon

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                        5. Housing Development Constraints
Run Apartments, Eden Family Housing Apartments (20 West Grant Street) and Chiquita Grove
affordable housing projects.
The Commission also reduced the required amount of parking for the Park Land and Chiquita
Grove projects. In the case of the Eden Family Housing Apartments project, the developer
voluntarily provided 1.78 parking spaces per unit, 18 more spaces than required by the Zoning
Ordinance, while still offering rents affordable to extremely low- and very low-income
households.
Modifications to the Zoning Ordinance parking location standards have also been approved for
affordable projects. For example, tandem parking arrangements were approved for the Quarry
Ridge and Grant Street Village projects, and the Habitat for Humanity project was allowed to
locate required parking within the front yard setback.
Design Standards
The review of project site plans, elevation drawings, and landscaping plans is guided by the
Healdsburg Design Review Manual, which promotes both variation in design and compatibility
with the desirable qualities of existing development. There are also specific design standards for
multi-family housing intended to encourage designs that maximize common space, blend with
the surrounding community, limit views of parking facilities from public streets, provide
architectural compatibility of accessory buildings, and direct on-site lighting on driveways and
walkways and away from adjacent properties. All of these standards are compatible with the
typical design of recently constructed affordable housing projects. The Design Review Manual
also provides guidelines for residential development that occurs in the eight Urban Design
Districts in order to promote compatible design.
The Zoning Ordinance includes design standards for manufactured homes to ensure that they
are compatible with conventionally built residential structures in the surrounding area. These
standards do not exceed the limitations prescribed by State law and design review is not
required for manufactured homes.
Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
Manufactured Homes/Mobile Homes
Mobile homes are considered single family detached dwelling when they are on a permanent
foundation. This means they are allowed in the same zones as single family housing. They may
also be used as secondary dwelling units so long as they conform to all provisions relating to
secondary dwelling units and to all provisions of Section 20.20.020.
Second units
A “second unit” is an additional residential unit on the same lot as a primary single family
dwelling that provides complete, independent living facilities for one or more persons. Second
units are usually considered to be housing that is affordable to lower-income households
because there are no land costs associated with their development and they frequently rent for
less than comparably-sized apartments. They may also occupy unused space in large homes, and
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                 Page 69

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                        5. Housing Development Constraints
by supplementing the income of the homeowner, allow the elderly to remain in their homes or
make it possible for lower-income families to afford homes.
The State of California has determined that second units are a valuable form of housing in the
state for extended family members, students, the elderly, in-home health care providers, the
disabled, and others. State law provides that any regulations adopted by the City to regulate
second units cannot be so arbitrary, excessive, or burdensome so as to unreasonably restrict
the ability of homeowners to create second units.
One second dwelling unit is allowed by the Healdsburg Zoning Ordinance in all zoning districts
that allow single family residences. Lots that are 4,500 to 6,000 square feet may have a 640-
square foot unit; those greater than 6,000 square feet may have units of up to 850 square feet.
The City also facilitates the development of second units by waiving the covered parking
requirement, by not requiring that the property owner live on-site, and by allowing the units to
be located in the required rear yard setback. Second units are also exempt from the City’s
growth management program. Between 1999 and 2013, about 40 second units were
constructed in Healdsburg an indication that the City’s regulations encourage, rather than
constrain, their development.
A survey of second units in Healdsburg during July 2008 showed that approximately half were
being rented out (the other half were occupied by relatives or guests). Of these, approximately
three-quarters were rented at rates affordable to lower-income households (adjusted for
household size) and one-quarter were affordable to moderate-income households.
Farmworker Housing
The Healdsburg Zoning Code makes available zoning to accommodate various housing types to
address the needs of farmworkers. As previously discussed, manufactured homes are
considered single family homes or second units and as such are permitted in residential
districts, and multi-family units are permitted in many districts. Employee housing for six or
fewer employees is permitted in R-1, DR, and GMU districts. Harvest Grove Apartments and
Quarry Ridge are examples of affordable housing mainly for farmworker families.
Homeless Shelters
State Housing Law requires that cities allow homeless shelters by-right in at least one zone and
describe the capacity within the zone(s) to accommodate the City’s homeless needs. The
Healdsburg Zoning Ordinance allows homeless shelters in the CS and P districts as permitted
uses. Homeless shelters are defined as, “a facility for the shelter and feeding of persons who
lack a fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence for up to 30 consecutive days, where
such shelter is operated by a public or non-profit agency.” As described in Section 2.6, the City
supports the operation of a homeless shelter at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church.

Transitional Housing/Supportive Housing
State law provides that the City must treat proposals for supportive housing for target
populations (such as those with mental disabilities, substance abuse, and chronic health
conditions) and transitional housing for the homeless in the same manner as other residential
uses allowed in the same zone. In July 2014, the City approved new definitions of both
transitional and supportive housing; the City is now in compliance with State law. The new
definitions read as such:
          Transitional housing is “rental housing operated under program requirements that call
           for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible
           program recipient at a predetermined future point in time that shall be no less than six
           months from the beginning of the assistance. Transitional housing units are residential
           uses subject only to those requirements and restrictions that apply to other residential
           uses of the same type in the same zone.
      Supportive housing is “housing with no limits on length of stay that is occupied by the
           target population (as defined in California Government Code Section 65582) and that is
           linked to on- or off-site services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining
           the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live
           and, when possible, work in the community. Supportive housing units are residential
           uses subject only to those requirements and restrictions that apply to other residential
           uses of the same type in the same zone.”
The Healdsburg Zoning Ordinance was recently amended to add transitional and supportive
housing as a permitted use in all zones where residential uses are allowed including, R-1, RM,
DR, MU, GMU, CD, CS, PR, and I, as shown in Table 35.
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                                  Page 71

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                         5. Housing Development Constraints
SRO
Single Room Occupancy (SRO) residences are small, one-room units occupied by a single
individual, and may either have a shared or private kitchen and bathroom facilities. SROs are
rented on a monthly basis typically without a rental deposit, and can provide an entry point into
the housing market for extremely low-income individuals, formerly homeless, and disabled
persons.
Single-room occupancy units are allowed in the CD and CS districts by right; however, the
units must be located on the same site as a commercial use. Single-room occupancy units are
conditionally permitted in the PR district if located on the same site as a commercial use and
above the ground floor.
Article 34 Authority
Article 34 of the California Constitution requires that when the City develops, constructs, or
acquires a rental housing project targeted towards lower-income households, its qualified
electors must approve the project by a majority. This requirement can pose a constraint to the
production of affordable housing, since the process to seek ballot approval for affordable
housing projects can be costly and time consuming, with no guarantee of success.
The provisions of Article 34 allow local jurisdictions to seek voter approval for “general
authority” to develop low-income housing without identifying specific projects or sites. If the
electorate approves general parameters for certain types of affordable housing development,
the local jurisdiction will be able to move more quickly in response to housing opportunities
that fall within those parameters.
There has been no vote taken for such action to date in the City of Healdsburg. However, by
partnering with non-profit and for-profit developers that have used federal and state funding to
construct hundreds of affordable housing units, the lack of Article 34 authority has not proved
to be a hindrance to the City.
Density bonuses and other affordable housing incentives
State law requires the City to adopt an ordinance that specifies the method of providing density
bonuses and other incentives for the development of affordable and senior housing units. The
City complies with the provisions of State density bonus law. In fact, the City exceeds the
requirements of State law for projects that provide 100 percent affordable units. Zoning
Ordinance Section 20.20.035 provides the procedures and standards for granting a density
bonus. In addition to those concessions and incentives required by State law, Section 18125.2
also allows the City to approve the following incentives:
        The City may grant an additional density bonus when an applicant proposes a project in
         which 100 percent of the remaining units not restricted to lower-income households
         will be affordable to moderate-income households.
        The City Council may grant financial incentives or concessions that result in identifiable
         cost reductions needed to make a qualifying project economically feasible, such as City
         subsidies for off-site improvements or land, City subsidies for development fees, and/or
         City sponsorship of mortgage bond financing.

Development Review and Approval Procedures
Developers must negotiate several steps to secure all necessary approvals to build housing on a
given parcel of land. From the standpoint of the City, this process is necessary to ensure that
new development adequately complies with local regulations that are meant to ensure the
health, safety, and welfare of the entire community. From the developer’s standpoint, this
process can complicate and lengthen the development process, increasing the difficulty and cost
to develop new housing. The following is a brief description of the process to obtain
entitlements to construct housing on vacant land in Healdsburg.
Subdivision Approval
The subdivision approval process in Healdsburg includes the filing of an application, payment of
a deposit for application processing, staff review for completeness, and public hearings before
the Planning Commission and City Council. The Planning Commission action is advisory to the
City Council, which has final authority over subdivisions. Depending on the size of the
subdivision and specific site development issues, varying levels of environmental review are also
required. Small subdivisions are generally exempt from the CEQA process under an infill
development exemption; larger subdivisions typically require an initial study and negative
declaration or environmental impact report. For projects processed with a mitigated negative
declaration, a typical small lot subdivision takes about four months’ processing time from
complete application to approval.
Design Review for Residential Units and Projects
Chapter 20.28 Article IV of the Zoning Ordinance includes requirements and procedures for
the design review of new development. Design review is not required for residential projects
involving only one unit, with the exception of single family dwellings in certain specific plan
areas as noted below. The Planning and Building Department Director is empowered to grant
minor design review approval for the following types of residential development applications:
       All signs that are not part of a larger project subject to design review by the Planning
        Commission.
     Construction of or an expansion greater than 500 square feet to a one-family dwelling
        on a site uphill and visible from a scenic highway or road, or located within a scenic
        ridgeline corridor designated by the General Plan as determined by the Planning and
        Building Director.
     Construction of one single family dwelling within the Grove Street Neighborhood Plan.
The Planning Commission conducts major design review for the following types of residential
development applications:
       Commercial, industrial, office, and residential projects (two or more residential units
        per site) which involve the development of vacant land with site and building
        improvements or involving major changes or additions to a previously developed site.
       Applications involving a change of use that requires substantial changes to the site and
        proposals for exterior building modifications.
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                Page 73

Potential applicants are encouraged to submit their preliminary plans for review by City
department representatives and/or the Planning Commission. For a fee of $896 and $640, the
applicants obtain feedback from the Planning Commission and the Project Review Committee,
respectively, that can be readily incorporated into the final project design. The City also offers a
“one-stop” where potential applicants can receive feedback/comments on proposed projects
from each department (e.g., PW, fire, building, planning, electric). One-stop is offered Tuesday
and Thursday afternoons and is a free service.
The design review process often results in an improved design that benefits both future project
residents as well as neighbors.
The Commission must make several general findings in approving a design review application:
       The proposed development or use is consistent with all applicable policies and
        requirements of the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance.
     The proposed design of the development or use, and all appurtenant structures, is
        consistent with the policies set forth in the City of Healdsburg Design Review Manual.
     The proposed development or use is consistent with the purposes of the zoning district
        in which it is located.
     The proposed development or use is consistent with all other conditions imposed by
        the Planning Commission or City Council with respect to any matter related to the
        purpose of design review.
The design review approval process is typically completed within four to six weeks, which is
considered very short when compared with other Sonoma County jurisdictions. For example,
the Planning Commission reviewed the preliminary plans and approved the final design for a 64-
unit, very low-income rental project (Foss Creek Court) within the space of eight weeks.
Conditional Use Permits
Many uses require a conditional use permit, including multifamily housing projects in the DR
District. They are subject to the approval of a conditional use permit by the Planning
Commission. Chapter 20.28, Article V in the Zoning Ordinance prescribes the procedures for
obtaining a conditional use permit. Briefly, these procedures include submittal of a complete
application (planning permit application form, application fees ranging from $889 to $2,201, site
photographs, a written statement, a site plan, an area plan, and a floor plan) followed by a public
hearing before the Planning Commission. Upon receipt of a complete application, action is
generally taken on major use permits in four to six weeks.
The Commission must make a few broad findings in approving a conditional use permit
application:

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                           5. Housing Development Constraints
       The proposed location and operation of the conditional use is in accord with the
        Healdsburg General Plan, objectives of the Zoning Ordinance, and the purposes of the
        district in which the site is located.
     The proposed location of the conditional use and the conditions under which it would
        be operated or maintained will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or
        welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity.
     The proposed conditional use will comply with each of the applicable provisions of the
        Zoning Ordinance.
Building Permits
A permit is required before construction of, alteration to, addition to, or demolition of any
structure within the jurisdiction of the City of Healdsburg. It is probable that alterations
changing the exterior appearance of commercial buildings, multi-family dwellings, and certain
other structures, will need Design Review approval by the Planning Department or the Planning
Commission before commencement of any such alterations.
Upon submittal of a complete set of plans, a typical single family plan check is conducted and a
building permit is issued within approximately two to four weeks, and about four to six weeks
for a typical multifamily plan check. The City contracts with a consultant for more complex plan
checks in order to expedite their review; however, such plan checks are done on a time and
materials basis to minimize the cost. As an example, the building plan check fee for the Foss
Creek Court Apartments project equaled only $609 per unit. Projects within Zone Two or
Three on the General Plan Slope Stability Map require a geotechnical report that is subject to
geotechnical peer review by the City Geology per City of Healdsburg Resolution No 147-86
(with an associated review fee of $1,800).
In summary, Healdsburg’s processing and permit procedures are reasonable and more
expeditious compared to those in many other California communities. The permit process only
increases in complexity and duration when the circumstances of individual projects warrant
extra consideration on the part of staff and officials. This is especially true of the environmental
review component of the process, yet the City of Healdsburg has little flexibility to change this,
since the California Environmental Quality Act specifies procedures that local jurisdictions must
observe in reviewing the impacts of development projects.
Adopted Codes
The City has adopted the 2013 editions of the California Building Code, California Residential
Code, California Green Building Standards Code, California Fire Code, California Electrical
Code, California Plumbing Code, and the California Mechanical Code.
The City has amended these codes in a few instances when necessary to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of its residents. For example, the Healdsburg Building Code includes
additional requirements for concrete slab floors to mitigate local expansive soil conditions.
Lighted address numbers are required to improve identification of homes by emergency
personnel. Smoke detectors are required in single family homes and automatic fire alarm
systems must be provided in multi-family complexes, apartment complexes, and condominium
complexes. Automatic fire suppression systems must be installed in new residential structures

and substantially-remodeled dwelling units. While these measures result in higher initial housing
costs, they are offset over the long run by savings on homeowners insurance and property
damage.
California Green Building Standards (CALGreen)
The City of Healdsburg was an early adopter of in sustainability. In November 2008, the City
adopted a framework for implementation of the Healdsburg Green City Program to promote
environmentally sound practices, develop green and sustainable alternatives, and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. The City had to demonstrate in the 2002 Housing Element that this
program did not constrain development, because it was a local standard.
In 2010, the State of California Building Standards Commission published and mandated
CALGreen, which the City has adopted, with local amendments, in place of the city’s prior
Green Building Ordinance. The 2013 California Green Building Standards Code (“CALGreen”)
became effective throughout the state on January 1, 2014. CALGreen creates uniform
regulations for new residential and non-residential California buildings that are intended to
reduce construction waste, make buildings more efficient in the use of materials and energy,
and reduce environmental impacts during and after construction.
Residential buildings subject to CALGreen include multi-family residences and one-and two-
family dwellings that have three or fewer stories. The City of Healdsburg has expanded the
scope of CALGreen to also apply to:
        Additions of 500 square feet or more of conditioned space to dwellings.
        Construction of and additions of 500 square feet or more of conditioned space to
         residential accessory structures.
     Conversion of 500 square feet or more of unconditioned space in an existing dwelling
         to conditioned space.
     Additions of 5,000 square feet or more of conditioned space to non-residential
         buildings.
     Conversion of 5,000 square feet or more of unconditioned non-residential space to
         conditioned space.
     Reconstruction of residential buildings of any size.
     Reconstruction of non-residential buildings containing 5,000 square feet or more.
The City of Healdsburg City Council also adopted CALGreen Appendix Chapters A-4 and A-5
Tier 1 requirements for new residential buildings over 3,000 square feet and for non-residential
buildings over 10,000 square feet. Applicants for CALGreen Tier 1 projects are required to
hire an approved third party CALGreen specialist for plan review, inspections, and
documentation.
While green building requirements add to construction costs, the City’s standards are an
important measure to achieve the City’s overall goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
conserving energy.

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                            5. Housing Development Constraints
Code Enforcement
Code enforcement is generally undertaken in response to a complaint filed with the City. This
effort serves to maintain the conditions of the city’s housing stock and does not constrain the
production or improvement of housing in the city. The Healdsburg Municipal Code also
establishes standards for the maintenance of properties regarding the accumulation of trash and
debris, overgrown vegetation, and abandoned vehicles and equipment in order to protect
property values.
On- and Off-Site Improvements
For minor residential streets, the Circulation Plan of the Healdsburg General Plan calls for a 50-
foot wide section that provides two travel lanes with parking lanes, curbs and gutters, sidewalks
and utility easements on either side. This design is intended to adequately accommodate traffic,
parking, pedestrians, and drainage. These standards may be modified if warranted by individual
circumstances, and therefore are not a constraint on development.
Additional requirements in the City’s development standards include the planting of street trees
and, in some cases, the installation of utility lines underground. These amenities greatly enhance
the appearance of residential neighborhoods, thereby adding to the value of homes.
The City also routinely reimburses residential developers who construct off-site improvements,
using development impact fees that have been collected from other development (see
discussion in following section), or by establishing a reimbursement fund that subsequent
developers in the area pay into.
Development Fees
The City assesses capacity charges and impact fees on residential development projects to pay
for the system capacities and services required to serve the development. While these fees may
affect housing prices, the only alternatives would be their payment by existing Healdsburg
taxpayers or no further residential development, either of which is infeasible.
In accordance with California Government Code Section 66001(a) the City does all of the
following for any fee that is established, imposed or increased:
       Identify the purpose of the fee;
       Identify the use to which the fee is to be put;
       Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the fee's use and the type of
        development project on which the fee is imposed;
       Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the public
        facility and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed; and
       Determine that there is a “reasonable relationship” between the specific amount of the
        fee imposed as a condition of approval on a particular development project, and the
        cost of the public facility attributable to that project.

As shown in Table 38, a standard single family dwelling unit (four bedrooms, two baths, 2,000
square feet) would cost an estimated $30,343 in development impact fees. Development impact
fees for a multifamily development with twenty 800-square-foot units would be an estimated
$22,202 per unit, for a total estimated cost of about $444,000 for the development. In addition
to the fees shown in the table, developers of small-scale (i.e., six or fewer) market-rate housing
that is subject to the City’s inclusionary requirement have an option to pay the in-lieu
affordable housing fee. Fees are based on square footage and can range from $2,455 for a 1,300
square foot unit to $15,000 for any unit more than 2,300 square feet. Units less than 1,300
square feet in a project with six or fewer units are exempt from the inclusionary requirement.
The 2,000-square foot home described above would be required to pay an inclusionary in lieu
fee of $10,940, which would make the total fees $41,283, or about 10 percent of total
development costs.

A comparison of the development impact fees charged by Healdsburg with other Sonoma
County jurisdictions is shown in Table 39. Healdsburg’s impact fees (not including electrical)
total $34,506 for a single family dwelling (four bedrooms, two baths, 2,000 square feet), a total
that is lower than the average of jurisdictions in Sonoma County.
The estimated development impact fees for the 2008 Foss Creek Court apartment project,
(which was not subject to the in-lieu affordable housing fee), were $34,375 per unit,
representing approximately 8.7 percent of a project unit’s total development cost. These fees
are representative of what would be paid for both affordable and market-rate multi-family
projects.

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                         5. Housing Development Constraints
Utility Charges
In addition to a mortgage or rent payment, housing costs usually include payment for utilities.
The City discounts its monthly electric and sewer utility charges to 137 lower-income
households and tenants of affordable residential projects by 20 percent. Water bills can be
discounted by 15 percent, and monthly storm drainage maintenance fee are also discounted by
20 percent for these households.
City Housing Programs
The City’s inclusionary housing requirement is a critical component of the City’s housing
program and an active means of providing affordable units to households typically shut out of
the housing market. Developers of residential projects with seven or more units are required
to rent or sell 15 percent of the units at prices or rents affordable to lower- and moderate-
income households. The units must be reserved for occupancy by the targeted household for at
least 20 years for ownership units and 55 years for rental units. If the project is six or fewer
units, the developer can decide to fulfill the inclusionary requirement through in-lieu fees, the
dedication of land, or another equivalent method. As previously stated, units less than 1,300
square feet in a six or fewer unit development are exempt from the fee.
The inclusionary requirement is intended to offset the negative effects of new market-rate
housing on the provision of non-market rate housing. The inclusionary program is also intended
to promote the economic integration of lower- and moderate-income households in
neighborhoods and the dispersion of such units throughout the city. The construction of above-
moderate income housing depletes the amount of available residential land, while contributing
to rising land prices because of a greater scarcity of developable sites. Market-rate housing
development also exacerbates the affordable housing problem by creating greater needs for
goods and services typically provided by low-income employees.
As an alternative to providing the inclusionary units on the project site, the developer may
construct them elsewhere at the discretion of the City Council. Additionally, if the Planning
Commission or City Council finds that the construction of the units is not feasible or
appropriate, the developer may be allowed to pay in-lieu fees, dedicate land, or other
equivalent methods.
Sales prices and rents for inclusionary units are limited to 30 percent of the gross annual
household income of the target group. For example, a four-person low-income family with a
gross annual income of $46,150 should pay no more than $1,154 per month for housing. For
rental units, total housing costs include the monthly rent payment and utilities. Total housing
costs for ownership units include the mortgage payment (principal and interest), homeowner’s
association dues, taxes, mortgage insurance, and any other related assessments.

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                          5. Housing Development Constraints
There has been extensive debate over the question of who bears the cost of an inclusionary
requirement. Depending on the relative strength of the housing market, the costs may be
incurred by:
        Land owners, who may receive a lower price for their land if developers are expecting a
         lower profit margin from the inclusionary requirement
      Developers, who may have to accept lower profits, if housing prices cannot be raised.
      The purchasers of market-rate units, who may have to pay higher housing prices if the
         local and regional housing supply is limited and prices are at least as high in areas outside
         the city.
In a strong housing market, it is possible that all three groups will share the costs of the
inclusionary housing requirement.
This requirement does not act to divert residential development to other Sonoma County
jurisdictions, since inclusionary requirements have been adopted by all of its cities as well as the
County of Sonoma.
By limiting the inclusionary requirement to 15 percent of a project’s units and providing
alternative means of compliance, such as land dedication, in-lieu fees, and other equivalent
means, the program is not seen as an undue or onerous constraint on the provision of market-
rate housing. Additionally, the City has adjusted the program over time to facilitate its use,
maximize its effectiveness, and respond to changing market conditions. For example, the period
of price restriction for an affordable ownership unit was reduced recently (in 2008) from 45
years to 20 years. An exception to the requirement that purchasers of inclusionary units be
first-time homebuyers was recently added for homeowners who owned a home during the
previous three years but have been displaced and have or are expecting one or more minor
children. The City has also helped the potential purchasers of inclusionary units secure
affordable financing, such as through the CalHFA program.
Furthermore, fulfillment of the inclusionary housing requirements usually qualified a project for
a density bonus, which helps to offset the subsidy needed for the affordable prices or rents.
5.2      Nongovernmental Constraints
Nongovernmental constraints are those that are not created by local governments, but may be
lessened through their actions.
Urban Growth Boundary
The Healdsburg Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) was adopted by city voters in 1996 and is
coterminous with the City’s Sphere of Influence and Urban Service Area boundaries. It
represents the allowed extent of urban uses in the Healdsburg Planning Area by the year 2030.
The UGB promotes a compact urban form that ensures the efficient provision of services while
preserving agricultural and open space outside of the boundary. The boundary can only be
enlarged by a majority vote of city voters, although it can be reduced by the City Council.

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                         5. Housing Development Constraints
Although the UGB contains properties outside of the current city limits that could be used for
future housing development, neither annexation of these areas, nor expansion of the UGB, is
needed to provide adequate sites for accommodating the City’s regional housing needs during
this Housing Element planning period (see Section 4.2). Furthermore, the provisions of the
UGB allow the City to provide services and utilities outside the UGB in order to permit the
construction of affordable housing.
Growth Management Program
Measure M, a residential growth management program, sponsored by a private citizen and
approved by city voters in 2000, limits the number of building permits for new residences to an
average of 30 per year and no more than 90 in any three-year period. The adopted “Policies
and Procedures” for this growth management program exempts housing units restricted for
occupancy by very low-, low-, and moderate-income households (up to 120 percent of median
income), secondary dwelling units, homeless shelters, elderly care facilities, nursing homes,
sanitariums, and community care and health care facilities, including housing for the disabled.
The Policies and Procedures are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted to maximize the
efficiency of the program’s administration. This program can only be repealed or amended by a
majority vote of city voters.
Beginning in 2001, the City of Healdsburg has administered this program by awarding 30
allocations per year to approved residential projects on a first-come, first-served basis.
Applicants for allocations are charged a processing fee.
Ten units are set aside each year for projects with four or fewer units (“Category A”); to date,
five is the most allocations that have been issued in a single year to Category A units. Unused
Category A allocations are assigned to projects that involve five or more dwelling units
(“Category B”). Recipients of Category B allocations can request that their allocations be
phased over more than one year for a maximum of two additional years, limited to no more
than a total of 10 per year. Unused or lapsed allocations may be carried over an additional two
years within any three-year period.
While the GMO limits growth in Healdsburg to about 30 market rate dwelling units per year,
allocations for dwelling units have not been reaching the imposed limits. Since 2001, the City
has issued 331 allocations, 44 of which were reassigned and 69 expired. On average, 24 building
permits were issued per year. Most allocations were for small-scale, single family development.
While the GMO allocation limits have not been reached, there continues to be a perception
that the GMO had a dampening effect on development in Healdsburg, wherein fewer projects
are being proposed simply because the GMO is in place. Although it is not possible to precisely
say what the actual impact of the GMO is, it is clear that few larger housing developments,
including market-rate multi-family projects, are being proposed in Healdsburg. This may be
because the limits established under the GMO, have turned away developers of multifamily
projects because they would need to be phased over several years, eroding construction cost
efficiencies. Additionally, extending a larger project’s timeline increases risk for the developer
and makes it more challenging to obtain financing. In addition, one larger project will impact
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                  Page 83

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                        5. Housing Development Constraints
what happens elsewhere in the City, limiting what other development can happen for the
duration of the project’s development period.
Several participants in the Housing Element community workshop expressed concern that the
growth management program has had several unintended consequences, including limiting
housing opportunities for workforce housing for Healdsburg’s middle-income residents.
While the GMO is, by its nature, a constraint on housing production, it will not necessarily limit
the City’s ability to meet the RHNA for this Housing Element planning period. The growth
management program may in fact encourage affordable housing construction by constraining
market rate housing that would otherwise occupy or compete for the same site. Since the
ordinance exempts affordable housing development from its provisions, it could allow a given
site to be developed earlier than for a project required to obtain a growth management
allocation. And while the program could affect the rate at which above moderate-income,
market-rate housing units are developed, more than 240 growth management allocations would
be available during this Housing Element planning period to accommodate the City’s regional
housing need of 76 above moderate-income housing units (see Section 5.4). The biggest
potential impact of the GMO on the City’s ability to meet its RHNA will be on the moderate
income category.
There has been substantial debate in the city in recent years about whether or not to revise the
growth management ordinance to more deliberately focus on infill, workforce, or market-rate
development. The discourse around the growth management ordinance is partially the result of
the Central Healdsburg Avenue Special Study, which established a vision for redeveloping the
Central Healdsburg gateway into a vibrant high-density, mixed-used district. The high-density
housing envisioned in the Central Healdsburg Avenue Plan will be difficult to achieve under the
current growth management program, as it inherently requires higher site densities to support
land costs and housing typologies envisioned by the plan.
Construction Costs
Housing prices are influenced partly by the types of construction materials used. Homes in
Healdsburg are generally of wood frame construction and finished with stucco or wood siding.
This type of construction is the least expensive conventional method (brick, stone and concrete
block are more costly). Composition shingle and built-up roofs, which are found on a large
share of the community’s homes, are also the least expensive, followed by wood shingle, wood
shake, concrete tile, metal tile, and clay tile.
The cost of lumber and wood products accounts for one-third of the costs of materials used to
build a home. A typical 2,000-square foot home uses nearly 16,000 board feet of lumber and
6,000 square feet of structural panels, such as plywood15, and every $1 increase in the average
wholesale price of 1,000 board feet of lumber increases the cost of a typical home about $20.16
The composite price for lumber has increased with the increase in housing prices from under
$300 per 1,000 board feet for much of 2007 and 2008 to $394 per 1,000 board feet in 2013
and $400 per 1,000 board feet in 2014. In 2014 RS Means (a reliable published source for
construction industry costs) estimated that the hard construction costs in the Santa Rosa area
were $186 per square foot for a typical one- to three-story multi-family residential

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                        5. Housing Development Constraints
construction with wood framing. Based on the International Code Council Building Valuation
Data, a one- and two-family residential construction would cost approximately $118 per square
foot. This equals a rough estimate of $186,000 in construction costs for a 1,000 square foot
apartment and $236,000 for a 2,000 square foot single family home.
Over the long term, direct construction costs (including materials and labor) have decreased as
a proportion of total costs due to a dramatic drop in the number of person-hours required to
construct a unit, and the use of less-skilled (and therefore, lower-paid) workers because of a
greater use of pre-fabricated materials.
However, labor costs are still the single biggest expense after land. Community members have
stated that there is a labor shortage in Healdsburg, which leads to increased labor costs.
Construction worker laborer salaries in Healdsburg are 8 percent higher than nationwide.17
The City can minimize construction costs by not requiring more costly kinds of building
materials on residences, such as clay tile roofs. However, there is little within the City’s power
to affect the availability and cost of skilled labor.
Design and Location Preferences
Housing costs are affected in part by a residence’s design, including the number and type of
amenities, location, and size.
There has been a dramatic change over the last 20 to 30 years in the United States in the size
of housing units and the amenities provided to them, which has resulted in higher prices for
housing. According to the U.S. Census Bureau,18 in 2013:
       The average single family house completed had 2,598 square feet, 878 more square feet
        than in 1977.
      41 percent of new single family homes completed had four or more bedrooms, almost
        double the rate of 20 years ago, despite the drop in average household size. The larger
        number of rooms was partly due to the rise of specialty rooms such as home offices,
        sunrooms, media rooms, and exercise rooms.
      In single family homes with four or more bedrooms, over half (60 percent) had three
        bathrooms or more.
      33 percent of new single family homes sold had three or more bathrooms, triple the
        rate from 1987.
      89 percent of all single family homes completed had air conditioning, compared to 36%
        in 1971.
      21 percent of new single family homes sold had at least a three or more car garage.
      Across the country, less than half of all single family homes sold had at least one
        fireplace, compared to 61 percent in 1978.
In a 2013 nationwide survey,19 67 percent of potential buyers report wanting an environment-
friendly home or being concerned about the environment in general. Most home buyers want
all the energy-saving features listed in the survey: 94 percent want energy-star rated windows
(36 percent of them think they are essential) and 91 percent want an energy-star rating for the
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                   Page 85

whole home (28 percent think this is essential). But at the same time would not pay more for
such a home.
In previous surveys, proximity to work and shopping was rated as a major factor by survey
respondents in choosing a neighborhood. While potential buyers were willing to cut personal
spending and sacrifice comfort to purchase a home, few respondents were willing to take on a
longer travel time or give up proximity to public transportation.
Land Costs
Approximately 25 percent of housing costs are attributable to land costs in most real estate
markets. A major component of this cost is land speculation. Land costs are also affected by
such factors as zoning density, the availability of infrastructure, the existence or absence of
environmental constraints, and the relative amount of similar land available for development.
The cost of land is a major factor in the cost of housing. The City has facilitated the
development of affordable housing in the past through the donation or sale of project sites to
non-profit developers, and it is likely that similar assistance in the future could prove useful to
the development of such housing. In 2003, the City of Healdsburg purchased 3.2 acres of
property at a cost of $1.554 million for the 64-unit Foss Creek Court project, which equates to
more than $24,000 per unit in land costs for high-density rental housing.
Based on information gathered from local realtors, five vacant lots were sold in Healdsburg
from January 2009 to May 2014. Prices ranged from $314,900 for a 0.21 acre lot ($1,499,523
per acre) to $949,000 for a 3.31 acre lot ($286,706 per acre). The average price per acre was
$598,348. There were 29 lots zoned for residential available for sale on in May 2014. Lot price
ranged from $61,904 to $725,000. Lot size ranged from 0.13 acres to 5.01 acres. Price per acre
ranged from $24,861 to $12,225,412 with an average cost per acre of $522,72720.
Land costs are a major factor in the cost of new housing. The land cost per developed unit can
be lowered through the development of high-density housing.
Financing Costs
Home Financing
Interest rates are historically low. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is around 4.2
percent in 2014, much lower than 6.41 in 2006 or 8.05 in 2000. Besides lowering monthly
interest payments for new buyers, low interest rates allow existing homeowners to refinance
their homes, thereby lowering monthly housing costs and perhaps preserving their ownership
status.
However, mortgages for homes above the half-million-dollar mark can be more difficult to
obtain, even for well-qualified buyers, although as of 2014 lenders seem more willing to provide
“jumbo mortgages.” The use of so-called “jumbo mortgages,” defined as loans that exceed
$520,950, which is the conforming limit in Sonoma County, is one way to measure this. Only 16
percent of the borrowers who applied for a jumbo mortgage in 2012 were denied a loan,
according to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act database. The denial rate on jumbo mortgage
Page 86                                                               Adopted November 17, 2014

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                          5. Housing Development Constraints
applications has fallen consistently since 2008, when about 3 in 10 jumbo loan applications were
denied. The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed jumbo mortgage is now comparable to the
rate on a conventional loan.
Mortgage credit is the most difficult to obtain for first-time buyers and tighter lending standards
also hinders the ability of households at the low and middle tiers to move up.
Many major financial institutions and mortgage lenders that finance housing have offices in
Healdsburg. Additional financial institutions and mortgage lenders that lend in Healdsburg have
offices located in nearby Santa Rosa or Petaluma. The large number of active real estate lenders
in Healdsburg indicates a strong real estate market. The Bank of America has listed the
Healdsburg area as one of the most attractive places in the world in which to live, and tabbed
the area as a prime real estate investment opportunity. Consequently, a relatively large number
of financial institutions invest in local real estate. Homes sales are occurring in all parts of the
community, and there is no evidence of mortgage-deficient areas in the community for new
construction or rehabilitation loans.
During the 1999-2006 planning period, the City of Healdsburg assisted first-time homebuyers in
the Palomino Court project as well as school, hospital, and City employees by providing low-
interest second mortgages. The interest charge is due upon resale, or is completely forgiven if
the purchasers remain in the homes longer than 10 years.
The ability to accumulate a down payment remains a formidable barrier to many potential
homebuyers. Low-income households find it difficult to make the transition from rental to
ownership units because they cannot accumulate a down payment while renting. While the
recent trend of requiring minimal or no down payments aided these households in purchasing a
home, this practice has changed in response to the recent foreclosure crisis.
Construction Financing
Overall, construction financing usually represents a small contribution to total housing costs
(for example they represented only 4.5 percent of the total unit cost for the Foss Creek Court
Apartments project). Financing costs for construction are affected partly by how early in the
development process loans must be taken out and how long the loans must be carried. Project
delays can increase total interest payments, as well as create greater financial risk for a project.
Construction financing for higher-density infill projects is generally harder to obtain than for
conventional single family construction. According to the National Association of Home
Builders-Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, Western builder confidence in the rental
apartment market dipped in the second quarter of 2008 amid concerns of a slowing overall
economy and continuing trouble in other sectors of the housing market. However, the
economy has been improving and builder confidence has risen back to 2006 levels 21

6       Housing Opportunities and Resources
While the City of Healdsburg is beginning the 2015-2023 Housing Element planning period with
limited financial resources, the City is fortunate to have strong leadership and community
support to accomplish its housing goals, including:
       A City Council that strongly supports affordable housing and community development
        activities to assist persons of low and moderate incomes.
     Limited number of residents who represent a “Not in My Backyard!”attitude
     A spirit of collaboration and cooperation among the governmental jurisdictions and non-
        profit agencies.
The City’s housing accomplishments have been possible because of the Council’s far-sighted
decision to develop collaborative partnerships with professional, experienced, highly-skilled
non-profit housing developers and service providers. Through partnerships with Healdsburg
Shared Ministries, Burbank Housing Development Corporation, Habitat for Humanity, St. Paul’s
Episcopal Church, Riverfield Homes, Eden Housing, and private developers, 433 affordable and
special needs housing units have been constructed or are under construction.
6.1     Revenue Sources
The City’s Housing Program uses the following primary sources of revenue to fund its projects
and programs. Affordable and special needs projects and programs are almost always made
feasible by using funding in a combination of ways.
Local funding
Healdsburg In-Lieu Housing Deposit Account
The Healdsburg In-Lieu Housing Deposit Account is generated by payments from the
developers of small residential projects in-lieu of providing inclusionary affordable units and is
used to subsidize affordable housing. About $360,000 is held in Inclusionary Deposit Account
101-0000-227.19-00 in the General Fund, $90,000 of which has been designated to serve as a
Transition Reserve for Fitch Mountain Terrace.
Healdsburg Housing Successor Agency Fund
The City assumed the responsibilities as the Housing Successor Agency on January 27, 2012.
The Housing Successor Agency currently has $160,000 available for projects.
State and Federal Funding
Funding available from the State of California and the Federal government is in a constant state
of flux. The three programs described below are long-standing sources. Appendix E includes
details of State funding programs that are currently (2014) available and may be used in the
development of affordable and special needs in Healdsburg.

Community Development Block Grant Program
The Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) is the largest Federal housing-
related program for affordable housing. It is a “pass-through” program that allows local
governments to use Federal funds to alleviate poverty and blight.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development allocates CDBG funding based on a
formula that takes population, poverty, and housing distress into account.
CDBG funds are used for a variety of housing efforts, including activities aimed at reducing
costs for private development, housing acquisition and rehabilitation through short- and long-
term loans, and fair housing activities. Historically, Healdsburg has received between $75,000
and $100,000 annually in CDBG funding.
The City has used CDBG funds in the past in combination with other subsidy sources for such
projects as Riverfield Homes, Harvest Grove Apartments, and Park Land Senior Apartments.
Since 2010 the Community Development Block Grant and CDBG-R funds have been used to
replace curb ramps at 22 intersections in the downtown residential area during 2010. The City
has applied for $100,000 of CDBG funding for FY 2014-2015 for the installation of ADA ramps.
However, the amount of CDBG funding available during the remainder of the planning period is
unknown, as the City must compete with other small jurisdictions in Sonoma County.

The California HOME Investment Partnership Act is a formula-based block grant program
similar to CDBG. HOME funds are intended to provide incentives for the acquisition,
construction, and rehabilitation of affordable rental and ownership units. The City is required to
provide matching funds. HOME funds were used in Healdsburg for the Riverfield Homes, Park
Land Senior Apartments, and Canyon Run Apartments projects.
Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program
The Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program is a Federal and State housing subsidy
program that provides tax credits to the private sector for the construction or acquisition and
rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. To be eligible for a tax credit, 20 percent of the units
in a housing development must rent to very low-income households earning less than 50
percent of area median income, or 40 percent of the units must rent to households with
incomes of less than 60 percent. Federal law requires that developments maintain the
restrictions for 30 years or longer; however State law in California requires that developments
retain these levels of affordability for at least 55 years. To be successful, tax credit projects
require an additional subsidy that can include no- or low-cost land, local government
contributions, or density bonuses and other concessions. There have been 87 projects built in
Sonoma County from 1987 to 2013, with a total of 5,817 low income units built using LIHTC
funds since its inception. Affordable housing projects in Healdsburg to which tax credits were
awarded include Fitch Mountain Terrace II, Riverfield Homes, Park Land Senior Apartments,
Oak Grove Apartments, and Canyon Run Apartments. The State awarded $15 million in tax
credits to the Foss Creek Court apartment project, one of only two projects in the eastern and
northern portions of the San Francisco Bay Area to receive such funding for 2009.
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                    Page 89

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                      6. Housing Opportunities and Resources
Prior to 2008, approximately 130,000 affordable rental housing units were produced each year
nationally under two programs: the “9 percent” Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program
which produced roughly 70,000 units in each of 2006 and 2007 and Tax-Exempt Bonds
combined with the “4 percent” LIHTC produced roughly 60,000 units in each of 2006 and
2007. Unfortunately, the availability of tax credit funding was significantly reduced in 2008
because of the mortgage crisis. Tax credit pricing fell from $1.00–$1.20 to $0.70–$0.80 or less.
New multifamily rental starts fell more than 50 percent to approximately 90,000 in 2009 and
approximately 100,000 in 201022. However, the economy is improving and over the past three
years, investor demand has sharply rebounded. With demand now at historically high levels,
average tax credit pricing routinely exceeds $0.90 per dollar of credit, with housing credits
trading well in excess of $1 per dollar of credit for projects located in hot Community
Reinvestment Act (CRA) markets.23
Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers
The Federal Section 8 program provides rental assistance to very low-income households in
need of affordable housing by paying the difference between 30 percent of the gross household
income and the cost of rent. Section 8 assistance is structured as vouchers; this allows the
voucher recipients to choose housing that may cost above the fair market rent as long as the
recipients pay for the additional cost.
The Sonoma County Community Development Commission (SCCDC) acts as the Sonoma
County Housing Authority, which operates the Section 8 program. The Sonoma County
Housing Authority assists 120 households in Healdsburg through the Section 8 Housing Choice
Voucher (HCV) program. Of these households, 62 include a disabled family member, 38 include
minor children, and 52 include a senior age 65 or older. The head of household in 114 HCV
households is identified as white, 2 as Black/African American, 3 as American Indian/Alaskan
Native, and 1 as Asian; 24 HCV heads of household identify as Hispanic.
6.2     Residential Development Opportunities
This section summarizes residential units under construction since the beginning of the planning
period (i.e., January 1, 2014), approved residential development projects, vacant and
underdeveloped sites that are available for residential development during the planning period,
and potential development sites that could be available for long-term housing development.
Appendix C identifies all residentially-designated properties within the Healdsburg Sphere of
Influence that are available for residential development. Only sites that are within the current
(2014) city limits are counted towards the RHNA for this planning period.
Under Construction
The City of Healdsburg has several new housing units for which building permits have been
issued and construction is underway. Table 40 summarizes the units that have building permits
as of March 2014. For a detailed list of all units under construction, see Appendix C, Table C-2.
There are 27 single family homes, which are inventoried as above moderate units, and two
second units, which are inventoried as lower-income.

  Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                                   6. Housing Opportunities and Resources
  According to a 2008 survey conducted of existing secondary units, slightly more than half are
  rented out and relatives or guests occupy the remainder. Of those that are rented,
  approximately one-third are rented at prices affordable to moderate-income households and
  two-thirds are rented at levels affordable to low-income households (including one that was
  rented at a very low-income level). Therefore, the two second units under construction are
  inventoried as low-income units.

Chiquita Grove
Chiquita Grove is a 2.78-acre project located at the southwest corner of Chiquita Road and
Grove Street. The site is currently a single family home, various outbuildings, and grazing fields
surrounded by fencing. The Chiquita Grove Residential Master Plan, approved in 2012,
describes the amount and types of homes that will be built on the project site. The approved
project includes a total of 28 single family units. The affordable housing agreement for the
project stipulates that three units will be affordable to lower-income households and one unit
will be affordable to moderate-income households.
Midtowne Healdsburg
Midtown Healdsburg, located at 1136 Healdsburg Avenue, fronts Healdsburg Avenue, the city’s
primary thoroughfare. This 3.2-acre project includes 34 two-story single family homes, including
6 inclusionary units, and a park that would be used only by residents. The project was approved
by the City Council on July 7, 2014. The project includes a zoning change from Multifamily
Residential to Residential Master Plan, allowing for the development of single family residences.
Of the 34 total units, 28 are inventoried as above moderate income units and the 6 inclusionary
units are evenly split between very low, low, and moderate income units.
Powell Place
Powell Place is an approved subdivision with 12 total units. The applicant has elected to build
the inclusionary requirement of two deed-restricted affordable units on-site. One unit is
inventoried as a low-income unit, one as a moderate-income unit, and 10 as above moderate
income units.
Sub-Area A Subdivision
Sub-Area A Subdivision, a part of the Area A Specific Plan (last revised in 1995), is generally
located about two miles north of Healdsburg Plaza. The Specific Plan area originally covered the
area immediately north of the city limits, but was annexed by the City in 1994 and approved for
residential development. Out of the 44 subdivisions, 8 are under construction (counted in Table
40), and 36 have not yet obtained building permits. All 36 of these units will be single family
homes and are inventoried as above moderate income units.
Saggio Hillis
The Saggio Hills project area is a 259-acre property located east of Healdsburg Avenue just
north of Parkland Farms that was annexed to the city in 2009. The Plan Area is the last large
undeveloped property with significant development potential remaining within the city limits
and comprises the majority of what is known in the Healdsburg 2030 General Plan as
Development Subarea C. The Saggio Hills Area Plan was prepared to ensure that future
development in the Plan Area is consistent with the Healdsburg 2030 General Plan goals and
policies. The Saggio Hills Area Plan was revised in October 2010 and approved by the
Healdsburg City Council in January 2011.
The project is approved for a full-service resort hotel, resort residences and villas, affordable
housing, open space, and a community park. The proposed 130-room resort facility and 70
single family residences would be located on approximately 91 acres of the Plan Area. As part

    of the project, 14.16 acres in the southeast portion of the Plan Area is dedicated to the City of
    Healdsburg for future development of up to 150 units of affordable housing. The actual number
    of affordable units that will be developed will be determined by a separate entitlement process
    through the City of Healdsburg. Other developer requirements include a $1 million
    contribution to the City’s in-lieu housing fund to assist in the development of housing on the
    site and preparation of the site for construction, including grading, the installation of a 12-inch
    water main and an 8-inch water main, and the provision of joint trench improvements for gas,
    electricity, communications and cable television services. The developer is also required to
    reimburse the City for costs (up to $50,000) associated with the preparation of a site
    development analysis to determine the appropriate type, density, and related characteristics of
    the housing to be developed. The Development Agreement approves 70 single family
    residences that are inventoried as above moderate income units.

ranges allowed by the applicable General Plan land use designations, approximately 340 to 656
units could be developed on these sites.
The actual timing of development will depend on several factors, including the market demand
for housing and preparation and approval of specific plans. The potential units identified in Table
C-1 do not include the secondary units that could be developed on many existing city lots,
particularly in the older neighborhoods where properties tend to be larger in area.
Affordable Housing Sites
The need for lower-income housing can be accommodated on the five properties identified in
Table 43 (and included in Table 42), all of which are located within the city limits. Three of the
sites are designated High Density Residential by the Healdsburg General Plan and are zoned
Multifamily Residential (RM). The HR designation allows up to 20 units per acre, which is the
“default density standard” deemed appropriate for lower-income housing in Healdsburg. One of
the sites is designated Transit Residential by the Healdsburg General Plan and zoned Multifamily
Residential (RM). The Transit Residential designation allows up to 30 units per acre, which
meets the default density standard for lower-income housing as well. The fifth site is part of the
Saggio Hills approved project and is a site that will be dedicated to the City for the purpose of
building affordable housing. The potential total of 181–397 units that could be developed on
these properties is based on the low and high end of the allowable density ranges, but could be
increased significantly through the granting of density bonuses. An overview of each site
follows. In addition to the development of these sites, lower-income units will also be provided
during the planning period through the City’s inclusionary housing requirement and the
construction of secondary residential units.

1034 Healdsburg Avenue
This 1.52-acre property is located directly south of the 1136 Healdsburg Avenue site. The site
fronts Healdsburg Avenue, the city’s primary thoroughfare, and is located less than one-half
mile from a large neighborhood commercial center and is within easy walking distance of the
Healdsburg Elementary, Junior High, and High School campuses. The property’s frontages are
fully improved and utilities are readily available. The site is vacant and supports no significant
vegetation.
88 and 90 Front Street
These two properties front on the Russian River and are located between a mobilehome park
and an apartment complex. They are owned by the same property owner, with a single family
home on the southern lot. Development of the lots would be subject to a 100-foot setback
from the top of the river bank; however, it is possible that a reduced setback would be
approved, given the lack of riparian vegetation within most of the setback and the shorter
setbacks approved for the adjoining properties. These properties are located less than one-
quarter mile from the Healdsburg Intermodal Transit Center and one-half mile from the
downtown.
3 Healdsburg Avenue
This 1.25-acre site at the southwest corner of Healdsburg Avenue and Kennedy Lane is
currently developed with five single family homes. However, the property could be redeveloped
with up to 15 additional affordable units.
Opperman Property
The Opperman Property site includes two parcels within the Central Healdsburg Avenue Plan
(CHAP), which was approved by the City Council on July 7, 2014. These parcels, totaling 5.63
acres, are designated Transit Residential in the General Plan and zoned RM. The CHAP
describes the Transit Residential designation as providing for attached residential units at a
density of 10 to 30 units per acre. Existing uses on the site are largely industrial, but the CHAP
anticipates redevelopment of much of the Plan Area. Using the low end of the density range,
the two Opperman Property parcels provide capacity for 56 affordable units.
Saggio Hills Affordable Housing Site
The approved Saggio Hills project includes a 14.16-acre affordable housing site that is
designated Medium High Density Residential and zoned R-1-3,500. While the Development
Agreement states that the site can accommodate 150 units of affordable housing, it does not
guarantee that all 150 will be built. The Development Agreement also requires mass grading,
funding of an affordable housing site feasibility analysis, and contribution of $1,000,000 toward
design and development of the project from the developer. The minimum allowable density for
the Medium High Density general plan designation is six units per acre. Using this conservative
minimum density, the affordable housing site will yield a minimum 86 units. For the purposes of
the RHNA, the Saggio Hills affordable housing site is inventoried as a range with a minimum of
86 lower-income units and a maximum of 150 lower-income units.
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                    Page 95

Potential Long-Term Redevelopment
The City’s regional share of housing for the planning period is provided within the current city
limits. There is additional capacity for redevelopment beyond what is included in the inventory.
Central Healdsburg Avenue Plan
The Central Healdsburg Avenue Plan (CHAP) establishes a set of guiding principles and design
frameworks for the development of public infrastructure and private investment in the Central
Healdsburg Avenue and depot area. The Plan Area is generally located south of Mill Street
between Highway 101 and the Russian River (See Figure C). The CHAP envisions
redevelopment of the largely industrial area centered on Healdsburg Avenue.
The CHAP includes a build-out estimate that assumes 100 percent redevelopment within the
Plan Area. If the proposed land use designations and zoning are put in place, redevelopment
could result in 331 new residential units; 105 of these units would be located within the mixed
use designation at a density of 16 units per acre and 226 would be located within the Transit
Residential and Medium Density Residential designations at a density of 30 and 6 units per acre,
respectively. There are currently 14 units within the Plan Area, so build-out would result in 317
net new residential units.
The Opperman Property, which includes two parcels totaling 5.63 acres, is the only parcel
within the CHAP area included in the vacant land inventory above. This site is the only area
within the Plan designated Transit Residential. Capacity in the rest of the Plan Area is not
included in the inventory, but the City anticipates that the CHAP will be a key housing growth
area in the future.
Potential Redevelopment
The City has seen the continuous re-use of properties over the past 150 years and an increase
in its housing stock through the redevelopment of lots originally used for non-residential
purposes and/or lower-density residential. A recent example is the development of the 16-unit
Healdsburg Commons project on a site that was created by combining three lots that were
developed with a gas station and seven units. Also, the Eden Family Housing affordable
apartments is the former site of a propane storage operation. Since residential uses are allowed
in most of the City’s commercial/industrial zoning districts, there are also a number of sites
within the city that could be redeveloped with residential uses in combination with commercial
or industrial uses. However, this potential is too hypothetical to quantify.

6.3      Summary of Capacity to Meet the Regional Housing Need
Table 44 summarizes the City of Healdsburg’s capacity to meet the RHNA for the 2014-2022
RHNA planning period. After accounting for capacity from units under construction, approved
projects, and vacant and underutilized sites, the City of Healdsburg has a surplus of 136 lower-
income units and 278 above moderate-income units. While none of the vacant sites are
inventoried as having capacity for moderate-income housing, the surplus of lower-income units
can be used to meet the remaining obligation of 22 moderate-income units.

6.4      Adequacy of Public Facilities
According the Environmental Impact Report for the Healdsburg 2030 General Plan,24 buildout
under the General Plan, including the potential residential development described in the
previous section, will be adequately served by all utilities. This includes a sufficient supply of
water, electricity and natural gas, and adequate wastewater treatment and solid waste disposal
capacity.
Water Supply
The City’s water system is supplied from three well fields: one on Dry Creek with five
operational wells (three generally in operation) and two on the Russian River (Fitch and
Gauntlett well fields) with a total of eight operational wells. Distribution system facilities include
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                                                       Page 97

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                       6. Housing Opportunities and Resources
eight storage tanks serving six separate pressure zones within the distribution system, five
pump stations (only four are generally used), and the necessary water mains and appurtenances
for purveying water within the service area. Storage capacity totals 7.9 million gallons. Daily use
ranged from 1.1–1.3 million gallons daily (MGD). Total water use in Healdsburg’s urban service
area during 2013 was approximately 680 million gallons.
The Gauntlett/Fitch Water Treatment Facility provides micro-filtration for water produced
from the Gauntlett wells, allowing the wells to be used year-round. In the next five years
(before 2020), there is a plan to construct a package plant for the Fitch well field so it can
operate year round. Currently the use (3 cubic feet per second) is restricted to dry periods.
The City presently holds three water right permits: two on the Russian River and one on Dry
Creek for up to 3,665 acre feet per year (AFY). The City also has petitions pending with the
State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) for its two Russian River Water Right
Permits to extend the deadline for putting the water to full beneficial use. The Board has
determined that the water for these rights falls under a 10,000 acre-foot per year reservation
of “project water” made available from Lake Mendocino. Satisfying upstream demands that fall
under this reservation is a condition of the Sonoma County Water Agency’s (SCWA) water
rights permits. Approval of the petitions is likely in less than a year (before April 2015) and the
City’s environmental analysis and planning forecast assume full beneficial use under the permits.
In addition to these rights, the City has a contractual agreement with the SCWA that allows the
City to divert up to 4,440 AFY under the Agency’s water rights permits if appropriated water is
not available under the City’s own water rights. The contract will be extended for another year,
until April 2015 when the petition referenced above is approved as a backup plan for
emergency water situations. However, the City has no plans to rely on the agreement in the
near future because its own water rights are adequate.
Supply availability to the City’s water customers is not expected to decrease in single- or
multiple-year drought scenarios, primarily because the SCWA is required to meet minimum
flows at three points on the Russian River, all downstream of the Dry Creek and Russian River
confluence; therefore, downstream of all City well fields. The water rights permits held by the
City presently do not require diversion reductions during droughts. Notwithstanding that fact,
in past dry years, the City has achieved significant water use reductions through mandatory
conservation efforts. Only recycled water is authorized for construction, agricultural, and urban
uses. The City has shown a 20 percent reduction in water consumption from the previous
three years.
Buildout of the Healdsburg SOI under the General Plan could increase the SOI population to
14,468, which is less than the 14,900 population projected for 2025 by the 2003 Water System
Master Plan and the 2005 UWMP. The projected population includes the increase that could
occur in association with the development of housing affordable to lower-income households.
Assuming that the same proportion of water demand among residential, commercial, industrial,
and landscape uses occurring in 2004 occurs in the future, the UWMP concluded that with a
total projected 2025 water supply of 4,179 acre-feet/year, the total 2025 projected water
demand (3,372 acre feet per year) would leave a surplus of 807 acre feet per year (19 percent).

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                       6. Housing Opportunities and Resources
Even if no additional water rights were approved, the City’s existing water rights total 3,665
AFY, which is more than adequate to meet the projected water demands described above.
Therefore, there is adequate water supply to accommodate the increased demand associated
with additional residential development during the Housing Element planning period (i.e., 2015 -
2023). Further, it is not anticipated that the City would have grounds to deny water service to
a proposed development that includes affordable housing because of an insufficient water
supply, a water shortage, insufficient water treatment or distribution capacity, or a compliance
order issued by the State Department of Health Services prohibiting new water connections.
A number of pumps boost water from the well fields to eight reservoirs and tanks, located in
six different locations. Besides providing a combined storage capacity of 7.9 million gallons, the
tanks and reservoirs, due to their elevations, create water pressure for users, including
pressure for fire hydrant flows. The older and smaller Sunset and Cadoul tanks can supply fire
flows of up to 1,000 gallons per minute by a combination of pumping and use of storage. This
capacity does not currently meet Insurance Service Office guidelines. The long term plan (next
five years) is to work with Russian River Utility to potentially join forces to build a much larger
tank in order to meet Insurance Service Guidelines and to reduce outdated reservoirs.
Although the tanks are inadequate, they would not serve potential development areas.
Portions of Sub-Areas B and C are above the highest elevation that can be served by the City’s
Gauntlett reservoirs. The construction of a pump station to serve certain portions of the Saggio
Hills project site (Sub-Area C) was required as part of the Saggio Hills Area Plan. Any future
development in Sub-Area B will be assessed at a project level at the time of application for such
development and/or annexation to identify pumping and storage requirements that are
adequate to provide the pressure and flow capacity needed to meet health and safety
requirements.
Existing water distribution mains are adequately sized to accommodate all anticipated growth in
the city’s north area and along Grove Street. The Grove Street corridor includes an existing
16-inch water main. The Parkland Farms area is also connected directly to the Gauntlett
Reservoirs by a 12-inch main, which feeds water to the subdivision. In addition, the recent
Rosewood Drive extension provided another water line connection to the Parkland Farms
area, completing a looped main. These two water mains are expected to be adequate for the
development of Sub-Areas B and C.25 The Healdsburg 2030 General Plan Background Report
recommends a number of distribution system improvements, consisting mostly of water main
replacements that will improve the system’s ability to deliver water during peak demand and
fire flow conditions. Several are designed to improve the delivery of water from the
Gauntlett/Fitch Water Treatment Facility. These replacements will occur over time and do not
affect the City’s ability to supply water to existing or potential development.
Wastewater Service
The sewage collection, treatment, and disposal facilities that serve the city are owned and
operated by the City of Healdsburg. The City’s wastewater treatment plant was recently
upgraded to the Advanced Treatment Nutrient Removal Disinfectant Tertiary Wastewater
Treatment level and is designed for an average daily flow of 1.6 MGD. The equalization basins
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                  Page 99

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                        6. Housing Opportunities and Resources
and wet-weather treatment capacity together are sized to accommodate a storm event
producing wet weather flows of up to 9.3 MGD.
The wastewater treatment plant has a permitted dry-weather capacity of 1.4 MGD, and the
City has not requested an increase in this permitted capacity. Taking the highest dry weather
flow (ADWF) between 2000 and 2008 (0.98 MGD) as the base year, the unused capacity
available to accommodate development and growth under General Plan buildout is a minimum
of 0.42 MGD.
The wastewater collection system encompasses a network 42 miles of sewer mains and
collector lines of various sizes, nine small lift stations in various locations throughout the city,
and a major lift station on Magnolia Drive that conveys the entire city’s wastewater
approximately 3,500 feet through parallel 14” force mains to the treatment facility on Foreman
Lane. Local lift stations have been upgraded one by one as part of the City’s Capital
Improvement Program. All of these lift stations are located in areas that are nearly built-out,
and therefore can be expected to have adequate capacity for any in-fill projects.26 A large
portion of the city is sewered by the relatively new North Trunk Sewer, which was constructed
in 1995. This trunk sewer was constructed to serve the areas of the City where nearly all
significant new (non-infill) growth was expected to occur.
The City of Healdsburg recently completed a major upgrade of its wastewater treatment plant,
which began operation in April 2008. The new $32 million upgraded treatment plant produces
highly treated wastewater using a state-of-the-art membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment
process. The effluent meets “unrestricted disinfected tertiary effluent” requirements, as defined
by Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations.
The Magnolia Lift Station was upgraded in 2000 to replace aging and outdated electrical
equipment and to improve its overall reliability. Daily wet weather flows, which include inflow
and infiltration, peaked at approximately 7.18 MGD in 2013. The lift station has a capacity of
approximately 8.6 MGD and experiences maximum daily flows of about 0.9 MGD. Therefore,
the system has the hydraulic capacity to accommodate the peak wet weather flows as well as
additional flows.
Recent major upgrades to the sewer collection system included replacement of a critical
section of trunk sewer main on the south end of Healdsburg Avenue in 2003. The replacement
sewer was adequately sized to allow for an eventual tie-in for the industrial development in
Sub-Area J east of the Russian River. Development of Sub-Area J, which is currently unsewered,
will also require construction of collection facilities and a new sewer lift station to pump
wastewater from the east side of the River. There is also a plan to add a pipeline to the
Memorial Bridge in the next five years. One existing sewer line along Grove Street between
Dry Creek Road and Chiquita Road is operating at near capacity, and may need to be replaced
to accommodate future development in the area. This replacement is likely in the next five

Buildout under the General Plan is anticipated to generate an estimated wastewater flow of
0.428 MGD within the city. The projected demand includes the increase that could occur in
association with the development of housing affordable to lower-income households. When

added to the highest historic ADWF (0.98 MGD) as the base year, the total sewage average
flow would increase to approximately 1.41 MGD, which is less than one percent above the
treatment plant’s permitted capacity.
However, there are several mitigating factors regarding the treatment plant’s actual capacity.
For the purpose of measuring permitted dry weather capacity, average dry-weather flow is
defined as the average flow when inflows to the treatment plant have reached their annual
minimum, which typically occurs in late fall. The ADWF is intended to be a measure of the true
load connected to the sewer system, after the influence of any infiltration has diminished. The
City of Healdsburg ADWF is defined in its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
permit as the minimum running 30-day average. While a treatment plant may be nominally
designed for a certain ADWF, the actual capacity is typically much greater because it must be
able to accommodate peaking events, including higher wet-weather flows in the winter, and
higher solids loadings that can occur at any time of the year.
The estimated additional wastewater generation associated with potential future development
is derived from unit flow factors that are intended to estimate flows for an individual customer
during the summer peaking period (July through October). Peak uses for individual users
throughout the system never occur simultaneously, and flows during the period when ADWF is
determined are typically far lower, typically at least 15 percent below the summer peaking
period. For this reason, the aggregated peak demand could not be expected to cause a
corresponding increase in ADWF. The expected ADWF generation would reasonably be
expected to be at least 15 percent lower (i.e., 0.364 MGD). The total resulting flow of 1.34
MGD at buildout would leave an unused capacity of 0.06 MGD.
Therefore, there is adequate wastewater treatment capacity to accommodate the increased
demand associated with additional residential development during the planning period. Further,
it is not anticipated that the City would have grounds to deny sewer service to a proposed
development that includes affordable housing because of insufficient treatment or collection
capacity, or an order issued by the regional water quality control board that prohibits new
sewer connections.
Electric Service
The City owns and operates its own electric distribution system. The City’s Electric
Department is responsible for the operation and maintenance associated with the reliable
distribution of electricity to residential and commercial customers within the Planning Area
except for the Grove Street neighborhood and the Fitch Mountain area, which are served by
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). The Healdsburg 2030 General Plan states that in the summer of
2007, the system’s peak demand was 20.6 megawatts.
The City acquires wholesale-priced power through the Northern California Power Agency
(NCPA). The City’s electrical system is linked to its power sources through an interconnection
with the PG&E 60,000-volt transmission line at the City’s Badger Electric Substation. The
substation is currently operating at about one-half of its capacity. The Electric Department is
confident that the substation does not require any improvements to be able to adequately meet
the needs of the city.

Healdsburg Housing Element 2015-2023                      6. Housing Opportunities and Resources
Two main feeders extend from the substation south along First Street and south to the
industrial area along Healdsburg Avenue. Two additional feeders extend northerly to the main
part of the city through Tayman Park Golf Course. The main feeders are adequately sized for all
potential infill in the city’s developed areas. Rebalancing of the feeders has been sufficient to
account for the small percentage change in load from year to year.
Energy demand in Healdsburg could grow by 15 to 20 percent in the next few years, primarily
because of growth in the northern area of the city. After buildout of this area, however, growth
will be more limited. Sufficient electric power is available to serve future development through
purchase power contracts with the NCPA, possible future additional NCPA generation
projects, conservation and load management programs, small self-generation projects, and
purchase power contracts through private qualifying facilities.
The City’s electric utility provides a 20 percent rate subsidy to lower-income households and
all affordable residential projects.

7.1      State Energy Conservation Requirements
The City has implemented the provisions of Title 24, Part 6 of the State Building Code that
require new residential buildings to meet a comprehensive set of standards for energy
conservation. Builders of these units may achieve compliance either by calculating energy
performance in a prescribed manner or by selecting from alternative component packages that
prescribe a fixed method of compliance. All proposed residential units are checked by the
Building Department to ensure that their design and construction complies with Title 24 energy
standards. Additions and alterations must also meet these standards if they increase the heated
or cooled floor space of a building. The City has not adopted any restrictions on the design or
placement of photovoltaic energy systems on residential property.
Opportunities for improving energy conservation in the design of residential development
include ensuring the consistency of tentative tract maps with Section 66473.1 of the Subdivision
Map Act, which requires the designs of subdivisions to provide for future passive or natural
heating or cooling opportunities. The City also requires the planting of trees along streets and
in parking lots to reduce heat island effects. Funding for tree planting is available from the City’s
Tree Planting and Maintenance Fund, which collects in-lieu fees for the planting of heritage tree
replacements and is designated for the purpose of planting and maintaining trees throughout
the city.
7.2      Transit-Oriented Development and Smart Growth
Voters in Marin and Sonoma Counties approved funding for a passenger train that will run
along a 70-mile corridor between Cloverdale, in northern Sonoma County, and Larkspur,
where the Golden Gate Ferry connects Marin County to San Francisco. It will serve 14 stations
along the corridor, including the historic train depot in Healdsburg. It was initially planned to be
completed in 2014, but was delayed due to the economic downturn, increased costs, and the
difficulty of obtaining permits. An initial segment will be completed by late 2016 as part of Phase
1, serving 10 stations along a 43-mile stretch between the Sonoma County Airport and San
Raphael is anticipated to be completed by late 2016. Phase 2, which will expand service to the
north, through Healdsburg to Cloverdale, and to the south to the Larkspur Ferry, will begin
once funding has been secured. As of 2013, 16.8 miles of mainline track has been rebuilt from
Santa Rosa to Petaluma; 25 grade crossings rebuilt; four bridge repairs complete; two bridge
replacements complete; and five stations platform footings/walls completed.
When fully complete, sixteen north- and south-bound trains would stop in Healdsburg on
weekdays, and eight on weekends. Approximately 413 Healdsburg residents are expected to
patronize the train each weekday for commuting (approximately 43 percent of total riders) and
other purposes; of these, approximately 72 percent are expected to walk to the depot from
surrounding neighborhoods.27 County and local bus transit will stop at the depot as well. In
2011, County supervisors committed $195,450 in local Transit Development Act funds toward

construction of a 47-space commuter “Park and Ride” lot at the historic Healdsburg depot site.
A second lot with 26 parking spaces may be added in the future.
There may be an opportunity to encourage transit-oriented development (TOD) in the vicinity
of the Healdsburg depot. TOD refers to the creation of a compact, walkable community
centered on a high quality passenger train system that reduces the need for driving. Most of
these types of developments have high residential densities and include commercial uses that
serve the residents. There may be an opportunity to redevelop some of the industrial
properties within one-half mile of the depot with these types of uses. There are a number of
factors to consider in planning TOD in Healdsburg, including the large number of older, single
family developments in the vicinity and the Growth Management Program, which limits building
permits for market-rate housing to an average of 30 per year.
The City has recently seen a number of “smart growth” projects that reduce reliance on
personal vehicle travel by being located near transit and services. For example the Healdsburg
Commons and Foss Creek Court projects are located on infill sites near the downtown and are
within easy walking distance to local and regional bus lines, shopping, personal services and
schools. The Central Healdsburg Avenue Plan, adopted in 2013, establishes principles and
design frameworks for the development of public infrastructure and private investment in the
Central Healdsburg Avenue and depot area. It is intended to promote a broad mix of land uses,
foster a diversity of housing options, and improve access to the transit center for all modes of
travel, including pedestrians, bicyclists, shuttles, transit vehicles, and automobiles.

policies can accomplish.
The tables below estimate the number of units likely to be constructed, rehabilitated, and
conserved/preserved during the planning period (January 31, 2015 through January 31, 2023).
The quantified objectives do not represent a ceiling, but rather set a goal for the City to
achieve, based on needs, resources and constraints.
Construction Objectives
The quantified objectives for housing construction are the number of new units that potentially
may be constructed in the City of Healdsburg Planning area by the City with its non-profit
partners and by private developers. They are based on the regional housing needs allocated to
the City for the planning period by the Association of Bay Area Governments.

Rehabilitated Housing Objectives
The rehabilitated housing objectives are the number of units that potentially may be
rehabilitated during the planning period. They are based on the programs described in the
Background Report.

                  Commission Rehabilitation Program
Conserved Affordable Housing Objectives
The conserved affordable housing objectives are the number of units whose affordability will be
preserved during the planning period. There are no affordable units in Healdsburg at risk of
converting to market rate within the 10-year period of 2015 to 2025. The Housing Element
includes programs that will help to conserve the 900 multifamily rental units (Program H-23
Strengthen the Condominium Conversion Ordinance) and the 70 mobile homes (Program H-22
Mobile Home Park Space Rent Stabilization Ordinance), which are important sources of non-
deed-restricted affordable housing in the community. While important for conserving housing,
the actual number of units that might be conserved through these programs is difficult to
quantify.

On May 6, 2014, the City conducted a community workshop on the Housing Element Update.
The purpose of the workshop was to educate the community on the Housing Element Update
and solicit input on the major housing issues facing the city and potential solutions to address
the issues. The workshop was held from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at the Annex at Villa
Chanticleer. Over 30 participants attended the workshop.
To advertise the workshop, the City sent an email to several email contact lists announcing the
community workshop, including 237 people on the City’s e-notify list, 70 people on the Central
Healdsburg Avenue Special Study Area list serv, and a list of 42 local and regional housing
stakeholders compiled by the City and consultants. The City also posted flyers around the city
in both English and Spanish, and a newspaper article was published in the Healdsburg Tribune
online edition.
City staff opened the meeting with introductions and an overview of the project. The Housing
Element Consultants then made a presentation, describing State law requirements for the
Housing Element and preliminary findings from the update to the Housing Element Background
Report. Following the presentation, workshop attendees were divided into four groups of 6-7
people and asked to participate in workshop exercises that focused on identifying and
prioritizing housing issues and potential policy solutions. Each group elected a “recorder” to
write down all the comments and a “reporter” to report out the results at the end of the
exercises.
Adopted November 17, 2014                                                                   G-1

In the first exercise, participants were asked to identify the most significant housing issues in
Healdsburg and, as a group, select the top three issues. In the second exercises, participants
were asked to brainstorm potential solutions to each of the top issues. In the third exercises,
participants were given the opportunity to identify “other big ideas” related to improving
housing opportunities in Healdsburg.
The issues that were most commonly identified by participants included the following:
       A need for more “workforce housing;”
       A shortage of rental units;
       The impact of second homes and vacation rentals;
       A lack of diverse housing types; and
       The unintended consequences of the Growth Management Ordinance.
Lack of Workforce Housing
One of the issues that was stated most frequently at the workshop was the lack of affordable
“workforce” housing for young families and those who work in the community and earn a
moderate income. “Workforce housing” refers to housing that is affordable to the people that
provide vital services in a community – school teachers, firefighters, police officers, restaurant
and hotel workers, and other service related workers. Many participants expressed concern
over the lack of housing options for these middle-income wage earners and their families who
are getting “squeezed” out of the housing market as prices continue to rise in Healdsburg.
Participants identified several potential solutions to address the lack of workforce housing,
including encouraging more diverse housing types that are affordable by design, such as higher
density housing, mixed use development, and live/work units. Others suggested making better
use of secondary dwelling units by increasing maximum size. Participants also suggested
exploring new funding mechanisms for affordable housing, including reserving a portion of
transient occupancy tax (TOT) revenues or development impact fees for affordable housing, or
studying creative financing mechanisms. Several participants recognized that the Growth
Management Ordinance (GMO) adopted in 2000, has had the unintended consequence of
making low- and mid-priced housing more challenging to deliver. Others stated that the GMO
was inflating housing prices. One recommendation was to use GMO allocations to direct a
higher proportion of construction toward middle priced products.
Shortage of Rental Units
Another significant issue that was discussed at the workshop was the shortage of available
rental units in Healdsburg, including deed-restricted affordable rentals. Vacancy rates in the
rental market are extremely low or non-existent. Participants suggested providing incentives
for rental units and multi-family units, allowing increased densities for multi-family units, and
exploring new tools, creative financing models, and other ways to replace funding lost with the
dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency. Those who expressed a need for more affordable
rentals, suggested using deed-restrictions to preserve existing affordable rental units and City
support for Senate Bill (SB) 391, the California Homes and Jobs Act of 2013, which would
establish a permanent source of State funding for affordable housing. Some participants also

suggested the City advocate for a portion of Cap and Trade funding to be reserved for
affordable housing and other legislation that would create funding sources for affordable
housing.
Impact of Second Homes and Vacation Rentals
The impact of the tourism economy on the local housing market was discussed as a significant
issue. Participants stated that buyers of second homes are driving up prices and competing with
permanent residents for a limited supply of homes, and the prevalence of short-term vacation
rentals are limiting the availability of long-term rentals for city residents. Participants also
observed that the growing emphasis on tourism in changing the character of the community.
Some participants expressed a need for the City to enforce existing regulations that prohibit
short-term vacation rentals in the city, and the need for zoning and regulatory changes. Others
felt that encouraging a greater diversity of housing would alleviate the issue. One group
suggested that the City might restrict some housing for people who intend to live and work in
the community.
Lack of Diverse Housing Types
With changing norms in housing size, household make-up, and life stage, many recognized that
more contemporary housing forms, such as mixed use, live/work, smaller micro or cottage
units, co-housing, and downsized or independent living units are not readily available in
Healdsburg. Some participants felt that increasing density to create more cost effective housing
types, and more interesting living choices could be offered. Others felt the Growth
Management Ordinance should be modified to remove barriers for multi-family housing.
Growth Management Ordinance
A topic that was referenced several times throughout the workshop in relation to the other
issues discussed above was the Growth Management Ordinance. Several participants expressed
that the GMO is the most significant barrier to more affordable housing in Healdsburg, because
it limits the ability to construct housing types that benefit from economies of scale; or it creates
a higher price for a limited annual supply of building permits. Many felt that the Growth
Management Ordinance should be reexamined to encourage the types of housing needed in
Healdsburg, with an emphasis placed on infill locations or higher allocations to more workforce
priced housing products.

                                     Workshop Overview
On July 9, 2014, the City conducted the second community workshop on the Housing Element
Update. The purpose of the workshop was to present the Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
and solicit feedback from the community on the proposed policies and programs. The
workshop was held from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at the Healdsburg Community Center. Over 30
community members attended the workshop.
To advertise the workshop, the City sent an email to several email contact lists announcing the
community workshop, including 237 people on the City’s e-notify list, 70 people on the Central
Healdsburg Avenue Special Study Area list serv, and a list of 42 local and regional housing
stakeholders compiled by the City and consultants. The City also posted flyers on the City
website and in public locations around the city in both English and Spanish, and a newspaper
article was published in the Press Democrat describing the Draft Housing Element and
advertising the workshop.
City staff opened the meeting with introductions and an overview of the project. The Housing
Element Consultants then made a presentation, describing the issues identified by the
community at the first community workshop and how the Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
addresses those issues.
Following the presentation, workshop participants were asked to provide feedback on the
policies and programs contained in the Draft Housing Element. The policies and programs were
presented on boards displayed around the room. Each board represented a separate goal
section of the Draft Housing Element and displayed all the policies and programs within each
goal section. There were three ways for participants to give feedback on the policies and
programs:
1.      Dot exercise. Participants were
given three different colored dots: green,
yellow, and red. Green dots signified
support for a policy or program; yellow
dots signified support with modifications;
and red dots signified that participants did not support the policy or program. Participants
placed the dots on the display boards next to the policies and programs that they supported or
did not support.
2.      White comment cards. Participants were provided with white comment cards on which
they could provide more detailed feedback on specific policies and programs. The cards asked
participants to identify the policy or program number and describe: why they would support

the policy/program, what they would change about the policy/program, or why they didn’t
support it.
3.     Blue comment cards. Participants were provided with blue comment cards on which
they could describe ideas for new policies or programs.
Summary of Feedback
The following is an annotated version of the Draft Housing Plan (Section 8 of the Housing
Element). The comments received on individual policies and programs are described in light
blue boxes below, and the number of green, yellow, or red dots placed next to each policy or
program are tallied below the policies and programs. The participants’ ideas for new policies
and programs are described at the end of the summary.
Note this is not the final Housing Plan, which can be found in Section 8.

              Comment 1: Support, but does not go far enough.
               Linking second dwelling units (SDU) to a 20, 30, or 40 year deed restriction is
              not realistic. Look at housing costs 40 years ago. Fees for SDU should be at least
              half of a single family dwelling unit. Any fees charged simply get added on to any
              15, 20, or 30 year mortgage.
              Comment 2: Support, but goes too far.
              A developer may be required to make small percent of units as affordable then a
              homeowner is asked to make 100 percent of their additional units affordable for
              40 years. If 40 years is negotiable lets discuss it. Seems unfair. Bring fees down
              to encourage infill – this is mining what we already have rather than requiring new
              land.
              Comment 3: Support, but does not go far enough.
              Incentivize infill with fee reduction on 2nd units in residential neighborhoods.
              Expand incentives without linking necessarily to affordability deed restrictions.
              Comment 4: Support, but does not go far enough.
              Bring the fees down on granny units to facilitate more housing within families free

              Comment 5: Support, but does not go far enough.
              I’d incentivize existing 2nd units as well to stay or become affordable.

New Policy/Program Suggestions (Blue Cards)
     Use percent of TOT and TOX income from Saggio Hills (I.5 million over number of
      years) to offset some fees/costs of building fair market multi-family housing of 5 or more
      units. Some recoupment of source of money for loss of redevelopment funds.
     Follow the housing plan with a market based strategic plan for delivery on the housing
      objectives.
          o Resources available to meet
          o Additional funding required
          o Market cost of building houses for different income levels.
     Provide expanded definition of live-work for industrial zoned property – model on
      European “estate” manufacturing prevalent in England/Switzerland.
     Promote conversion of non developable industrial zoned land by giving credits on city
      fees to include multi-family “worker” housing.
     Healdsburg should set its goal for affordable housing at 15 percent of the total number
      of units by 2023.
     The City ordinance implementing the GMO needs to be revised to encourage the
      allocation of permits to multi-family market rate, moderate income projects, particularly
      in Central Healdsburg.
     Facilitate existing homeowners to participate in creating 2nd dwelling units (educate,
      provide guidelines). Inspire. Housing element language is biased to developers.
     Please include information on existing standing stock of housing; regarding disabled
      housing (ADA) compliant), low, extremely low, very low income, vs. moderate and
      market rate housing. Please also include studies for your housing demand relative to
      these households. Please also indication your current and projected homeless
      population.

   The level at which FMRs are set is expressed as a percentile point within the rent distribution
  of standard quality rental housing units in the FMR area. The basic standard for the FMR figures
  is the 40th percentile. However, in some areas HUD sets the level at the 50th percentile to
  give lower-income families who participate in the voucher program access to a broader range
  of housing opportunities. The FMR figures that apply to Sonoma County are set at the 40th
  percentile of rents in the area. In other words, 60 percent of the rents in Sonoma County are
  above the figures shown and 40 percent are below.

which they had a legal right, and included “at risk” and “precariously housed” people staying temporarily
in a motel or with friends or relatives. The count also included those individuals in jails, hospitals, and

Healdsburg 2030 General Plan
INTRODUCTION
A general plan is required for all cities and counties in California by state law. It serves as
a community’s “blueprint” for future development and use of its land and provides a
foundation on which local land use decisions are based. A general plan must be
comprehensive, long-term in scope and describe the desired physical development of the
city and any land outside its boundaries, which in the city’s judgment bears relation to its
planning. A general plan is legally required to include the following seven elements: Land
Use, Circulation, Housing, Conservation, Open Space, Noise and Safety. The format of a
general plan may vary by jurisdiction provided it covers these elements in some fashion.
There is no state requirement to update the required elements of a general plan, other
than the housing element, which the State typically requires to be updated every five
years. However, there must be internal consistency between the required elements.
The Healdsburg General Plan serves as a fundamental policy document of the City of
Healdsburg to guide decision-making by residents, property owners, business interests,
and elected and appointed City officials about public and private land use and
development that shape Healdsburg’s physical environment.
Adopting and maintaining the General Plan serves several important purposes:
      •  Provides citizens with information about Healdsburg and with opportunities to
         participate in setting goals and determining policies and standards for the
         Healdsburg’s development.
      •  Provides decision-makers and the community with a forum for resolving conflicts
         among competing interests and values.
      •  Expands the capacity of local government to analyze local and regional conditions
         and needs in order to respond effectively to the problems and opportunities
         facing the community.
      •  Defines the community’s environmental, social and economic goals.
      •  Records the City’s policies and standards for the maintenance and improvement
         of existing development and the location and characteristics of future
         development.
      •  Fosters coordination of community development and environmental protection
         activities among local, regional, state and federal agencies.

Introduction                                                                 Policy Document
      •   Guides and coordinates the many actions and day-to-day decisions of the City
          that are necessary to developing and protecting the community.
Healdsburg General Plan Context
Healdsburg is located in northern Sonoma County within the nine-county San Francisco
Bay Region. Situated 12 miles north of Santa Rosa, the county seat, Healdsburg lies just
beyond the northern edge of the intense urban development that has occurred along the
Highway 101 corridor in Sonoma County. The Town of Windsor, with a 2007 population
of nearly 26,000, lies approximately four miles to the south. The small unincorporated
community of Geyserville is located approximately eight miles to the north, and the City
of Cloverdale is located approximately 18 miles to the north.
Geographically, Healdsburg is situated in an inland valley defined principally by Highway
101, Russian River, surrounding agricultural lands, and mountains to the east and west.
Highway 101 is the principal coastal route between San Francisco and the Oregon border.
The Russian River flows through Healdsburg on its way to the Pacific Ocean,
approximately 20 miles to the west. The city lies at the intersection of three rich
agricultural valleys - Russian River Valley, Dry Creek Valley and Alexander Valley - and is
elevated between 100 to 430 feet above sea level. East and west beyond the agricultural
lands rise subsystems of the Coastal Mountain Range. As of 2007, the Healdsburg city
limits contained 3.68 square miles.
Wet winters and dry summers characterize the Healdsburg region’s inland
Mediterranean-type climate. Climate is temperate, with an average annual high of 75°F and
an average minimum of 47°F. Rainfall totals can vary widely over a short distance;
windward mountain areas west of Healdsburg can receive more than 60 inches of rain,
while shadow areas, such as the city proper, receive about 40 inches annually.
Historically, Healdsburg served as an agricultural service center and a milling and
distribution center for north coast lumber. More recently, however, the development of
tourist-related businesses such as overnight accommodations, specialty retail, restaurants
and wine tasting has diversified the local economy.
The area that now comprises Healdsburg and its Urban Service Area was originally
inhabited by Native Americans. This included Southern Pomo and Wappo tribes in the
Dry Creek and Alexander Valleys, respectively. Their population once numbered close to
10,000 before it was decimated by small pox epidemics and hostility from the Mexican and
later by secondary Euro-American settlement in the 1850s. Those who survived were
displaced to missions or rancherias.
By the early 1840s, the Mexican government began to divide lands in the area into vast
ranchos. The largest of these in the Sonoma County region was the Rancho Sotoyome,
ii                                                               Healdsburg 2030 General Plan

Policy Document                                                                    Introduction
granted to Henry Delano Fitch in 1841. The 48,800-acre Rancho Sotoyome grant included
what is now the City of Healdsburg.
After disaffected western Gold Rush miners realized that a more stable and usually more
profitable life could be had through farming and ranching, they began to settle illegally on
Fitch’s lands. One of those squatters was an Ohio entrepreneur, Harmon Heald. Heald
eventually gained legal title to portions of the Rancho Sotoyome and constructed a store
and post office in what is now downtown Healdsburg. Heald then laid out a town grid and
sold lots for $15 each, a considerable amount for the period. He plotted the town site
complete with a central Spanish-style plaza, which remains one of the few examples of
early California town planning still in existence. Such foresight led to formal incorporation
of the city in 1867 and paved the way for Healdsburg to become the commercial and
residential hub it is today.
Reflecting its earlier history, Healdsburg contains many historic buildings representing a
broad range of architectural styles, including Queen Anne, Italianate, Homestead, Greek
Revival and Neo-classical. In 1983, a Cultural Resource Survey documented 450 historic
properties in the city.
The city’s population swelled from 300 in 1857 to almost 2,000 in 1887, then stabilized
until the 1940s. After World War II, there was rapid growth in both Sonoma County and
Healdsburg, with new suburbs being built extending mostly to the north and east from the
city’s original core. Healdsburg’s population at the beginning of 2009 was 11,782 residents,
with another 1,200 persons living within the immediate area. Average household size in
2007 was 2.6 persons.
Healdsburg’s housing inventory totaled 4,615 units at the beginning of 2008, 77 percent of
which were single-family detached and attached homes. The vacancy rate was slightly
more than 4 percent.
More information regarding the City of Healdsburg can be found in the Background
Report of the General Plan.
Earlier Healdsburg General Plans
Healdsburg’s first General Plan was adopted in 1963, when the city had nearly 5,000
residents. This first General Plan provided for an ultimate population of 15,000 with
12,000 residents expected by 1985. The Plan acknowledged that the recent extension of
U.S. Highway 101 from Santa Rosa to Healdsburg could result in greater commuting of
city residents and provided a “Thoroughfare Commercial” land use category to serve
freeway traffic. It also noted the recent replacement of city hall on Healdsburg Plaza with
a new structure and anticipated the construction by 1970 of Warm Springs Dam to
control flooding and stream bank erosion.
Healdsburg 2030 General Plan                                                                  iii

Introduction                                                                  Policy Document
Prunes were Healdsburg’s most important agricultural product at the time, but the
General Plan foresaw a shift toward the production of premium wine grapes. Primary
industrial uses included four fruit processors, four wineries, four lumber and wood
products firms, two manufacturers of concrete products, and one manufacturer of
electric wire and cable.
The deterioration of housing was identified in the city’s first General Plan as a serious
problem. Nearly two-thirds of the homes in Healdsburg at the time were found to be
badly in need of maintenance or had serious code violations. Of these, 153 homes were
recommended for demolition.
The 1963 General Plan consisted of just 54 pages, providing a brief overview of current
conditions and future trends, and only five policies:
       •  Preserve Agricultural Land: High quality land should be retained in agricultural
          use wherever possible.
       •  Eliminate Industrial-Residential Conflicts: The present mixture of residences and
          industry between the freeway and the railroad should be eliminated.
       •  Revitalize Downtown: Downtown Healdsburg should remain the dominant
          commercial center of northern Sonoma County
       •  Preserve Character of Fitch Mountain Area: Green-sheathed Fitch Mountain
          should be preserved as Healdsburg’s most important landmark, and the rustic,
          rural character of its summer homes and resort area should be maintained.
       •  Create a Regional Park: A major project of Healdsburg and Sonoma County
          should be acquisition of a regional park on the Russian River adjoining
          Healdsburg.
Most of these policies were incorporated into subsequent versions of Healdsburg’s
General Plans in some form.
By the time that Healdsburg’s first General Plan Update was prepared in 1973, the city’s
population had increased to 5,700 and the Plan extended the timeframe for 12,000
residents to 1990. The recently-adopted “urban expansion area boundaries” extended
west to Dry Creek and south to the confluence of Russian River and Dry Creek. As
foreseen in the 1963 General Plan, prune orchards were being rapidly converted to
vineyards, but the completion of Warm Springs Dam was not expected until 1978.
The 1973 General Plan Update included five elements, added goals and implementation
programs and expanded the number of policies. Significant provisions included the
establishment of setbacks from waterways, visual impact analysis for development on
hillsides and ridges, the development of a recreational trail system, the provision of a
regional park on Russian River opposite Digger Bend, and the public acquisition of Fitch
Mountain.

Policy Document                                                                 Introduction
The 1978 General Plan Update included the following policies of note:
      •   Develop a precise plan for the downtown, including a study of circulation and
          parking.
      •   Vigorously encourage the removal of vacant and obsolete buildings that lack
          historic character in order to clear the landscape of hindrances to healthy
          development.
      •   Prohibit the extension of urban services to prime agricultural soils west of U.S.
          Highway 101.
      •   Direct urban expansion primarily to the north.
      •   Establish a bicycle and pedestrian path system.
      •   Identify structures and areas of historical and cultural value and taking all
          necessary steps to conserve them.
By 1987, the City’s population had grown to 8,495, growing by nearly 50 percent since
1973. The 1987 General Plan Update was much more comprehensive than the earlier Plan
versions, adding goals and policies related to public facilities and services, cultural
resources and urban design. The Update also reflected a contracted sphere of influence
and established the requirement for specific plans prior to the annexation of property.
The 1987 Plan noted the increased potential for destination tourist demand if a hotel was
constructed on the west side of the plaza and the city was more aggressively marketed. It
also foresaw the closure of the Boise Cascade lumber mill in Healdsburg and growth in
the geothermal industry.
2009 Healdsburg General Plan Update
In 2001, the City initiated a comprehensive revision of its General Plan. While much of
the General Plan continued to be relevant, the City undertook the revision because the
plan needed to be updated to reflect current conditions and new challenges and
opportunities in directing future development. The Background Report inventoried and
analyzed conditions and trends in Healdsburg and provided a contextual framework for
the preparation, review and adoption of the General Plan Update. The Background
Report provided information on the following 19 subjects:
        land use                       air quality
        housing                        agricultural resources
        population                     mineral resources
        economy                        biological resources
        transportation                 geologic hazards
        public utilities               flooding and drainage
        hazardous materials            noise
        public services                scenic resources
        parks and recreation           urban design
        cultural resources

Introduction                                                                 Policy Document
The Background Report also provided setting information for the General Plan Update
Environmental Impact Report (EIR), which was prepared in compliance with the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and identifies the potential environmental impacts
resulting from future implementation of the General Plan and appropriate mitigation
measures. The General Plan Update EIR was certified by the City Council on (fill in date).
The second part of the Healdsburg General Plan Update, this Policy Document, is divided
into the following ten elements:
        Land Use                       Natural Resources
        Housing                       Safety
        Economic Development           Community Design
        Transportation                Historic and Cultural Resources
        Public Services               Administration and Implementation
Several of these elements include maps and standards that supplement or interpret goals,
policies and implementation measures.
The following table shows the elements in the General Plan Policy Document that are the
equivalent of the state-required elements noted above:
        Required Element     Equivalent Element
        Land Use             Land Use
        Circulation          Transportation
        Housing              Housing
        Conservation         Land Use, Natural Resources, Historic & Cultural Resources
        Open Space           Land Use, Natural Resources, Safety, Public Services,
                             Historic & Cultural Resources
        Noise                Safety
        Safety               Safety
Four additional non-mandatory elements are also included in this Policy Document: Public
Services, Economic Development, Community Design and Administration and
Implementation.
Key Terms and Concepts
The Policy Document includes the goals, policies and implementation measures that
constitute the formal intentions of the City of Healdsburg for land use, development, and
environmental quality. They have the following meanings in this document.
Goal - A general direction that the City intends to take in making planning or
development decisions. A goal is a general expression of community values and is abstract
in nature rather than quantifiable or time-dependent.
vi                                                               Healdsburg 2030 General Plan
Policy Document                                                                     Introduction
Policy - A specific statement that guides decision-making and indicates a commitment of
the City to a particular course of action based on and for the purpose of implementing
one or more General Plan goals.
Implementation Measure - An action, procedure, program or technique that carries out
General Plan policy.
The following terms are also used throughout the General Plan and are depicted in
General Plan Figure 1.
Planning Area - The Planning Area of the General Plan includes the incorporated city
limits of Healdsburg, the unincorporated area within the city’s Sphere of Influence, and
discontinuous City-owned land, such as the airport, well fields and the wastewater plant.
Sonoma County routinely refers matters affecting unincorporated properties within the
Planning Area to the City of Healdsburg for review and recommendations.
Sphere of Influence - The Sonoma County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO)
has adopted a Sphere of Influence for each city within the county that represents its
probable ultimate physical boundaries and service area. These are intended to promote
efficient urban development patterns while preserving open space. Each Sphere of
Influence includes both incorporated and unincorporated land. LAFCO is empowered by
the state to act on annexations of property to the city and requires that annexed
territory be located within a city’s Sphere of Influence. The spheres of influence are
reviewed periodically by LAFCO and the City may ask for amendments or revisions to its
Sphere of Influence. The Healdsburg Sphere of Influence encompasses approximately
3,518 acres; of this total, 2,356.43 acres were located within the city limits in 2007.
Urban Growth Boundary/Urban Service Area - The Healdsburg General Plan was
amended in 1994 and 1995 to establish an Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) for the city, in
which all development is to occur. A voter initiative in 1996 required that for a 20-year
period to 2016, expansion of the UGB, with certain exceptions, would be subject to
popular vote (see Land Use policies LU-A-1 and LU-A-2). The purposes of the UGB are
to:
      •   Encourage efficient growth patterns and protect the City of Healdsburg’s quality
          of life by concentrating future development largely within existing developed
          areas, or, in some cases, directly adjacent to them, consistent with the availability
          of infrastructure and services.
      •   Promote on lands outside the boundary ongoing agricultural and other natural
          resource and open space uses as defined in Government Code section 65560(b),
          such as preservation of natural resources, public and private outdoor recreation,
          uses that foster public health and safety, and productive investment for farming
          enterprises.

      •   Manage the City’s growth in a manner that fosters and protects the rural
          character of Healdsburg while encouraging appropriate economic development in
          accordance with the City’s unique local conditions.
      •   Allow the City to continue to meet its reasonable housing needs for all economic
          segments of the population, especially low- and moderate-income households, by
          directing the development of housing into areas where services and
          infrastructure are more efficiently available.
      •   Promote stability in long term planning for the City by establishing a cornerstone
          policy within the General Plan designating the geographic limits of long term
          urban development and allowing sufficient flexibility within those limits to
          respond to the City’s changing needs over time.
City water and sewer service may not be extended to development outside of the UGB,
except under certain circumstances (see Land Use Policy LU-A-2). The Healdsburg UGB
is congruent with its Sphere of Influence. It is also known as the City’s Urban Service Area
and these terms have the same meaning in the General Plan.
Specific Plans – Four specific, area and neighborhood plans have been adopted to date for
the areas depicted in Figure 2. Land Use Policy LU-A-4 requires that prior to the
consideration of any annexation request for the areas shown in Figure 2, a specific plan
must be adopted by the City Council prior to, or simultaneous with prezoning
consideration, except that a specific plan is not required for the unincorporated pockets
on the north and south sides of South Fitch Mountain Road and/or for land to be annexed
for school or public utility purposes. Specific plans are to comprehensively address the
relevant planning issues of the area to be annexed as well as adjacent properties to ensure
coordination of development plans with existing infrastructure, land use patterns and
environmental concerns.
Wherever the term “specific plan” is used, it may encompass any one of the following
planning activities: specific plans provided for under Government Code Section 65450,
area plans, neighborhood plans, residential master plans and planned developments. The
City Council will determine the type of specific plan study method that is appropriate to a
proposed annexation area and whether the plan should be prepared prior to or
simultaneous with the prezoning request.
Refer to the Glossary at the end of the Policy Document for the definitions of other
terms.

Administration of the General Plan
Implementing the General Plan occurs through actions taken by the Healdsburg City
Council, its appointed officials, and city staff in the exercise of the City’s corporate and
police powers, and through regulation of property by the Zoning and Subdivision
Ordinances, building codes and similar regulations, specific plans, and the City’s capital
improvements program. The General Plan provides the formal and legal framework for
the exercise of these actions for the purpose of promoting the health, safety and general
welfare of the public.
To ensure that the General Plan is implemented, state law requires that the City’s actions
be consistent with the goals, policies and implementation measures of the adopted
General Plan. This applies to decisions on private projects as well as public projects
under the jurisdiction of the City. The Planning Commission is required to report
annually to the City Council, the state Office of Planning and Research and the state
Department of Housing and Community Development on the progress made in
implementing the General Plan. In recognition that the General Plan is not a static
document, but rather changes over time, state law allows for up to four amendments per
year to its mandatory elements, although there is no limit to the number of changes that
can be made during each amendment. Amendments to the Policy Document, Land Use
Map and Circulation Plan may be proposed by residents, property owners, business
interests, developers or the City itself.
General Plan amendment applications not initiated by the City are preliminarily reviewed
by the City Council to determine whether the application will be considered. The
Council will generally consider a General Plan amendment application if it:
      •   Allows for consideration of an element not initially considered at the time of
          General Plan approval,
      •   Reflects changes in goals, policies, or physical, social or economic conditions, and
      •   Revises the Land Use Plan to reflect land uses that are no longer feasible due to
          physical constraints or changes.
If the City Council authorizes consideration of a General Plan amendment application, it is
referred to the Planning Commission for environmental review, where applicable, and a
recommendation to the City Council following one or more public hearings.
Any decision on a General Plan amendment should be supported by findings of fact. At a
minimum the Planning Commission and City Council should make the following findings:
      •   The proposed amendment is deemed to be in the public interest; and
      •   The proposed amendment is consistent and compatible with the other policies
          and programs in the General Plan.

While there is no specific requirement under state law, the period for when a General
Plan is intended to be applicable varies by jurisdiction, but is typically 10 to 20 years. The
time horizon for the Healdsburg General Plan is 18 years, to 2025. Although there is no
requirement to update the General Plan on any specific timetable or cycle, the Housing
Element is required to be updated on a regular basis, typically every five years.

I       GUIDING PRINCIPLES
At the heart of the General Plan are “Guiding Principles” that express the key values and
aspirations for Healdsburg’s future and act as guideposts for the goals, policies and
implementation measures contained within the General Plan.
The Guiding Principles are intended to promote future land uses and development that
are properly planned to preserve, protect and enhance Healdsburg’s small-town character
and unique quality of life, while providing for economic development and for community
services and facilities that capitalize on Healdsburg’s location and natural resource assets.
The General Plan’s Guiding Principles are summarized on the following pages.
Healdsburg 2030 General Plan                                                               1-1

Policy Document                                                                          1 Guiding Principles
Guiding Principles
1         Identity
A         Maintain Healdsburg’s role within the region.
Healdsburg, one of the oldest cities in Sonoma County, has long been the residential and commercial center
of a productive agricultural area. The City will continue to fulfill this role by providing housing, jobs and
commercial services to its residents and the surrounding region as well as supporting diverse local
agriculture.
B         Promote city-centered growth.
Long before the citizens of Healdsburg voted for a 20-year Urban Growth Boundary in 1996, Healdsburg
was defined by physical boundaries. The City will continue to focus inward - beyond 2016 - with infill
development and redevelopment of underutilized sites. New development will be compact and efficient to
make the best use of remaining lands. The City will identify areas that need special attention and develop
strategies for them. The City will continue to work with Sonoma County to ensure that designated
community separators surrounding the City remain in agricultural use and open space.
C         Protect the city’s scenic hillsides and ridgelines.
Densely-wooded Fitch Mountain and the hillsides and ridgelines surrounding Healdsburg are visible from
nearly everywhere in the community, making the natural environment omnipresent. The ridgelines were
important living and tactical areas of local Native American tribes. The visual qualities of these scenic
resources will be preserved.
D         Respect the City’s past and its roots.
The area that now comprises Healdsburg and its Urban Service Area was originally inhabited by Native
Americans. Healdsburg is one of the oldest cities in Sonoma County with buildings of many different ages
and styles mixed in an unusually fine-grained pattern across all but the newest areas of our community.
Healdsburg’s cultural and historic heritage provides an important aspect of its identity. New development
will protect this diverse heritage by respecting Native American archaeological and cultural resources,
historic neighborhoods and districts, and historically-significant structures and features. The City will
promote public awareness of and support for historic preservation.
E         Protect neighborhood character.
Healdsburg is a community of established neighborhoods with individual patterns of land use, landscape,
circulation and built form that have evolved over time. New development shall respect neighborhood
character, patterns, and forms.
F         Protect and enhance the downtown and its plaza.
Downtown, including Healdsburg’s plaza at the heart of the community, is the City’s primary activity node
and center of commerce, serving residents and visitors as well as the surrounding region. Efforts to enhance
the downtown’s pedestrian orientation, collection of unique, locally-owned businesses and its historic
character and charm will continue. Residential uses will continue to be allowed in the downtown to
promote its vitality.
G         Enhance gateways and strengthen primary corridors.
Major entryways to, and corridors within the community will be enhanced to improve the visual character
of Healdsburg’s gateways and thoroughfares.
H         Embrace the city’s waterways.
Healdsburg’s identity, origins, history and ecology are directly linked to the Russian River watershed. The
City will promote a healthy watershed along with an accessible interface between the community, Foss
Creek and the river.
Healdsburg 2030 General Plan                                                                              1-3

1 Guiding Principles                                                                            Policy Document
2         Balance
A         Balance resident and visitor needs.
One of Healdsburg’s most unique qualities is that it is a vibrant community that is also attractive to non-
residents. The City will continue to provide for local residents while taking strategic advantage of the
benefits visitors bring to the City.
B         Manage residential growth to ensure a measured pace of development.
In 2000, Healdsburg citizens approved by referendum a growth management program that limits the number
of residential building permits each year. Although it is possible that the voters may modify the ordinance
to remedy unintended impacts on housing affordability, the General Plan assumes that the underlying
premise of limits on the pace of growth will be preserved.
C         Promote a mix of housing types and affordable housing distributed throughout the
community.
Healdsburg is located within one of the most expensive housing markets in the country. The City will strive
to provide opportunities to meet existing and future housing needs while dispersing affordable housing
throughout the community.
D         Ensure that infrastructure and services keep pace with development.
The City will implement strategies to develop and upgrade community facilities where needed, address
service deficiencies in existing areas where infill development is anticipated and require new development to
provide its fair share of required services and infrastructure.
E         Maintain a jobs/housing balance.
An erosion of Healdsburg’s job base could damage the City’s vitality and identity. The City will continue
efforts to maintain a balance between housing inventory and jobs.
3         Mobility
A         Promote safe and convenient transportation alternatives.
Transportation alternatives to motor vehicles benefit the environment and public health, while meeting the
needs of those unable to drive. Healdsburg’s circulation system will accommodate and encourage all modes
of transportation, including pedestrian, bicycle and bus and rail transit. Streets shall be designed to
accommodate all modes of transportation where feasible.
B         Promote connectivity among neighborhoods and throughout the City.
Healdsburg’s historic street system is a traditional interconnected grid of narrow streets, on-street parking,
street trees, and sidewalks that promotes pedestrian use. The City will maintain this pattern in existing
neighborhoods and encourage connectivity and inclusiveness in new areas of development, including
pedestrian and bicycle linkages.
C         Maintain and improve operation of the Healdsburg Municipal Airport.
The Airport benefits area residents, tourists and industry through normal operations and in times of
emergency.
4         Sustainability
A         Protect agricultural resources.
Healdsburg’s setting provides its citizens with an exceptional diversity of agricultural products. The City will
support the protection of local agriculture to continue this diversity as well as preserve the open space that
surrounds the community.
1-4                                                                               Healdsburg 2030 General Plan

Policy Document                                                                            1 Guiding Principles
B         Protect the environment.
The City will promote the protection of the environment through conservation of resources within the
community and lead by example in its municipal processes and projects.
C         Foster principles of sustainability and conservation.
Land use patterns and programs should conserve resources to ensure that today’s needs do not
compromise the ability of the community to meet its future needs. The City will adopt policies that
promote sustainable development and lifestyles, educate the public regarding sustainable building practices,
and lead by example in its municipal projects.
D         Protect and enhance the natural habitat of Healdsburg’s waterways.
Russian River, Foss Creek and other waterways supply water to Healdsburg and provide important habitat
for wildlife. New development will maintain riparian habitat or restore it to its natural condition, provide
public and visual access to waterways and avoid back-on treatment adjacent to waterways. Sensitive site
design will be utilized to protect unique biotic features.
E         Preserve and enhance Healdsburg’s urban forest.
Healdsburg benefits from a healthy and diverse urban forest. It is an important part of the City’s heritage
and identity, creates a shade canopy which enhances the pedestrian environment, and has significant
environmental benefits such as water retention, cooling effects, and oxygen generation. The City will
preserve existing trees within the community and promote the extension and intensification of the
traditional street tree pattern along city streets.
5         Vitality
A         Provide an open and inviting business climate, a balanced economic environment, and
a diverse tax base.
A healthy economy sustains the City’s ability to provide important services to its residents. Healdsburg has
traditionally supported a balanced, diverse, locally-centered economy, and benefits from significant direct
and indirect advantages related to viticulture, wine production and associated visitor services. In recognition
of these benefits, the City will continue to promote a balanced economy to guard against a downturn in any
single sector.
B         Support local businesses and industries.
While recognizing that there are limits on how the General Plan can impact a free market economic system,
the City will support locally-owned businesses and industries that keep wages and profits in the community
and contribute to the local identity.
C         Protect and enhance qualities that attract visitors to the City.
The valleys surrounding Healdsburg have evolved into one of the prime wine-producing regions in the
world. Combined with the historic character of the central plaza and conscious efforts to enhance the
pedestrian character of the downtown, Healdsburg had developed a worldwide reputation as a tourist
destination. The City will protect and enhance these qualities to continue to attract visitors to the
community.
6         Livability
A         Foster high quality design.
As land available for development within Healdsburg’s Urban Growth Boundary is limited, the City will
promote development that is of high quality, enhances the livability of the community, and furthers the
vision of Healdsburg as outlined in these Guiding Principles.
B         Maximize opportunities for active and passive recreation.
The City will work to provide parks, trails and recreation programs to meet the needs of its residents.
Development on the northeast side of the City will provide connections to the Healdsburg Ridge Trail,
Healdsburg 2030 General Plan                                                                                1-5

Healdsburg’s bicycle and pedestrian master plan, and access to vantage points and to the Russian River.
Development along Foss Creek will provide connections to and extensions of the Foss Creek Pathway
where feasible.
C        Promote educational opportunities.
The City will support Healdsburg Unified School District and Santa Rosa Junior College in its efforts to
provide quality education to the community.
D        Meet health care needs.
The City will support local hospital services, clinics and medical emergency services.
7        Safety
A        Minimize hazards to life and property.
The City will seek to minimize risks to life and property associated with wildland fires, flooding, seismic
events and geologic hazards through the development review process and infrastructure improvements.
B        Protect and improve Healdsburg’s acoustic environment.
The City will ensure that development minimizes noise impacts and residents will be protected from
unreasonable noise, provided such measures do not undermine the economic vitality of the community.

2       LAND USE
The Land Use Element is the central element of the General Plan Policy Document in that
it addresses the relationship between all land uses within the City and its planning area. It
prescribes the pattern and intensity of land use and sets forth goals, policies and
implementation measures for future development and redevelopment of land. The Land
Use Element also contains standards, such as for density and floor area ratios.
Policy direction provided in the Land Use Element is guided by information contained in
the General Plan Background Report, including the inventory of land contained within the
Urban Growth Boundary and the capacity to develop vacant and underutilized land in the
future, consistent with the policies of the General Plan.
Land Use Plan
The Land Use Plan, General Plan Figure 3, depicts the General Plan land use designations
for all properties within the Planning Area. The boundary lines between land use
designations are delineated as specifically as possible, in most cases following parcel lines.
Where a creek, river, street or railroad bisects a property or land use designation, the
centerline of the above feature is the boundary line for that designation. For the larger
undeveloped areas, the boundary lines between land use designations are indicated more
generally. These lines may be made more specific by subsequent General Plan
amendments as more detailed planning is undertaken for these areas or by subsequent
Zoning Map district designations.
Land Use Designations
The following sections describe the land use designations appearing in the Land Use Plan,
standards of residential density and building intensity, and the application of the land use
designations to the territory covered by the Plan. The approximate range of residential
population for a development site can be estimated by multiplying the low and high ends
of the applicable residential land use designation density range by the current or projected
average household size.

impacts on residents from noise and other elements typically associated with a thriving
commercial area. Residential density bonuses may be granted consistent with state law
and the City’s housing incentives program. Single room occupancy units and efficiency
units of 500 square feet or less shall be counted as one-half unit for purposes of
calculating density under this land use designation. The maximum allowable floor area
ratio (FAR) is 2.0 for non-residential uses, except for properties fronting the Plaza, where
the maximum allowable FAR is 3.0 to reflect historic heights and floor levels of buildings.
Residential floor area shall not be counted when calculating the maximum FAR.
Medical Office (MO)
This designation provides for medical offices, such as doctors’ offices, medical clinics and
laboratories, public and quasi-public uses when compatible with the overall purpose and
character of the designation, and similar and compatible uses. Residential uses are
prohibited. The maximum allowable floor area ratio (FAR) is .50.
•    Industrial Designation
Industrial (I)
This designation provides for industrial parks, manufacturing, warehouses, wineries,
lumber mills and storage yards, research/office parks, health clubs, offices, retail sales and
rentals incidental to products manufactured, warehoused or stored on-site public and
quasi-public uses when compatible with the overall purpose and character of the
designation, and similar and compatible uses. The maximum allowable floor area ratio
(FAR) for non-residential uses is .50; residential floor area shall not be counted when
calculating the maximum FAR.
Multi-family residences for owners and/or employees of on-site industrial uses, including
live/work facilities, single room occupancy units and efficiency units are allowed at a
density of up to 16 dwelling units per gross acre if they are clearly subordinate to the
industrial uses and designed to minimize impacts on residents from noise and other
elements typically associated with a thriving industrial area. Residential density bonuses
may be granted consistent with state law and the City’s housing incentives program. Single
room occupancy units and efficiency apartments of 500 square feet or less shall be
counted as one-half unit for purposes of calculating density under this land use
designation.

•    Other Categories
Public and Quasi-Public (PQP)
This designation provides for government-owned facilities, public and private schools,
parks and quasi-public uses. New residential uses are prohibited, with the exception of
transitional and emergency housing facilities and dwellings for watch or caretaking
personnel associated with commercial or industrial uses. The maximum allowable floor
area ratio is 1.0.
Open Space (OS)
This designation provides for agricultural and other open space uses, residential uses at a
density of up to .20 dwelling units per gross acre and industrial uses directly related to
on-site agricultural uses. Residential units within this designation are encouraged to be
clustered to protect natural and scenic resources and to preserve open space. Residential
density bonuses may be granted consistent with state density bonus law and the City’s
housing incentives program.
Riparian Setback (RS)
This designation provides for a 100-foot setback from the Russian River, a 35-foot setback
from Foss Creek, and a 25-foot setback from other streams with riparian vegetation
and/or aquatic life, as measured from the top of the existing or proposed bank, whichever
is greater. The riparian setback requirements will apply to the east side of the Russian
River north of Healdsburg Avenue only upon cessation of current sand and gravel
extraction operations.
Special Study Areas
Five areas of the city, depicted in General Plan Figure 4, have been identified as warranting
further study beyond the elements contained in the General Plan, including the possible
development of an area plan or similar planning document. These special study areas
were selected because of their unique locations or functions in the city. The
characteristics and challenges for each of these areas, as they existed in 2009, are
described below.
North Entry Study Area
This area extends from Healdsburg’s northernmost point within the Sphere of Influence,
at the south end of Alexander Valley, along Healdsburg Avenue to the south. Much of this
section of Healdsburg Avenue has the character of a rural road, with no curbs or defined
pavement edges, drainage swales on both sides and wide unpaved roadway shoulders.
There are no pedestrian or bicycle facilities, even though this is a popular corridor for
cyclists.
Healdsburg 2030 General Plan                                                              2-9

Policy Document                                                                  2 Land Use
The Northwestern Pacific Railroad parallels the west side of the roadway. In addition to
being an important entrance to the city, it is a transitional area between the agricultural
lands of the Alexander Valley to the north and the traditional, small-town character to the
south. This area is also highly visible from the freeway and Healdsburg Avenue, both of
which are designated scenic roads.
A substantial amount of property in the northernmost portion of the North Entry Study
Area on both sides of the road is vacant (approximately 30 acres on the west side and
256 acres on the east side).
The North Entry Plan should:
     •  Identify appropriate uses for adjoining vacant properties that complement, but do
        not undermine the role of the downtown as the commercial center of Healdsburg.
        Retail uses shall be limited to smaller, ancillary and specialty shops, designed to
        serve the primary uses on the site. The following uses shall not be allowed:
        - Regional or community shopping center;
        - Grocery- or drugstore-anchored neighborhood shopping center;
        - Home improvement or hardware store; and
        - Automobile dealership or service station.
     •  Provide that prior to development of the 30-acre property on the west side of
        Healdsburg Avenue, the Planning Commission shall approve a conditional use
        permit or similar land use entitlement, in addition to a design review permit, that
        defines the development’s physical and operational characteristics and insures that
        the mix of uses is compatible and consistent with the intent of the North Entry
        Plan.
     •  Identify street improvements needed for this section of Healdsburg Avenue to
        safely accommodate pedestrians and cyclists and provide an attractive gateway to
        the community, including lighting and utility undergrounding.
     •  Develop building and landscape design guidelines that preserve and reinforce the
        area’s predominantly rural character and recognize its proximity to two important
        scenic roads.
     •  Include the construction of a section of the Foss Creek Pathway along a portion of
        the west side of Healdsburg Avenue, if feasible.
     •  Consider the placement of city identification and directional signs.
Dry Creek Entry Study Area
Dry Creek Road between U.S. Highway 101 and Healdsburg Avenue is a major entryway
to the city for visitors from Dry Creek Valley and Highway 101. Land uses along the
corridor include motels, restaurants, service stations, a truck storage lot and a liquor
store. Pedestrian and bicycle facilities are limited. Foss Creek bisects this area, but is
Healdsburg 2030 General Plan                                                           2-11

2 Land Use                                                                       Policy Document
barely visible and has no public access in this location. The reclassification of properties in
this corridor from Highway Commercial to Mixed Use will encourage the development
and redevelopment of vacant and underutilized properties.
The Dry Creek Entry Plan should:
    •    Develop streetscape design guidelines that will provide an attractive gateway to
         the community, including landscaping, lighting and utility undergrounding
    •    Identify street improvements needed to safely accommodate pedestrians and
         cyclists, including a mid-block crossing of the Foss Creek Pathway
    •    Develop building design guidelines that promote a small-scale urban character
         along this corridor and de-emphasize automobiles
    •    Identify opportunities for visual and physical access to Foss Creek
    •    Consider the placement of city identification and directional signs.
Central Healdsburg Entry Study Area
This study area focuses on the section of Healdsburg Avenue extending north from the
U.S. 101 Central Healdsburg freeway exit approximately one-third mile to the five-way
intersection of Healdsburg Avenue, Mill Street and Vine Street. This entryway is the
corridor most frequently used by visitors to the city. Many people gain their first
impression of Healdsburg from this corridor.
Land uses along this portion of Healdsburg Avenue include fast food restaurants, a gas
station, a strip commercial center, a lumber mill, several dilapidated vacant buildings and a
vacant site. Unattractive overhead utilities and cobra-head lighting line the corridor. There
are some gaps in the sidewalk in this area, most noticeably on either side of the bus stop
in front of Nu Forest Products. Foss Creek runs along the west side of Healdsburg
Avenue in this area, but is partly covered by an abandoned gas station or hidden by
building lining the street.
A significant portion of the traffic through this corridor is destined for the Dry Creek
Valley and makes a left-hand turn onto Mill Street. Construction of the two planned
freeway off-ramps at Mill Street would alleviate this traffic volume, although a reduction in
traffic could necessitate the implementation of traffic calming measures, as vehicles exiting
the freeway onto Healdsburg Avenue tend to be traveling at relatively high speeds. As
currently configured, the five-way intersection of Healdsburg Avenue, Mill Street and Vine
Street is confusing to drivers, pedestrians and cyclists because of its configuration and is
subjected to long traffic queues. The large paved area of the intersection is unattractive.
2-12                                                                 Healdsburg 2030 General Plan

The Central Healdsburg Entry Plan should:
     •   Develop streetscape design guidelines that will provide an attractive gateway to
         the community, including landscaping, street trees, lighting and utility
         undergrounding
     •   Identify street improvements needed to safely accommodate pedestrians and
         cyclists
     •   Develop building design guidelines that promote an urban character along this
         corridor and de-emphasize automobiles
     •   Identify opportunities for visual and physical access to Foss Creek and its
         enhancement
     •   Consider the placement of city identification and directional signs
     •   Consider the construction of a roundabout at the five-way intersection to improve
         traffic flow and safety, and enhance its appearance with landscaping
     •   Consider the reclassification of area industrial properties that are likely to
         redevelop to an appropriate land use designation.
Depot Study Area
The historic Healdsburg train depot located at Fitch and Harmon Streets was selected in
1999 as the site of an intermodal transportation center to provide a common transfer
point among public transportation systems and with automobiles. Improvements at the
depot will include a park-and-ride lot, local and regional bus stops and renovation of the
historic depot and freight buildings. The North Coast Rail Authority plans to restart
freight service in 2008, which will pass through the depot area. If the Sonoma-Marin Area
Rail Transit, a regional transit district, is successful in re-establishing intercity passenger
rail system in Sonoma and Marin County, the depot would be a stop in Healdsburg.
Properties surrounding the depot area are a mixture of low-density residential, service
commercial and industrial uses.
The Healdsburg Depot Plan should address:
     •   Potential changes in land use designations to maximize the number of residents in
         the vicinity and train usage, including the Nu Forest site and other nearby
         industrial and underutilized properties
     •   Circulation improvements needed to facilitate pedestrian, bus and vehicular access
         to the depot
     •   Rehabilitation of the depot and freight building for passenger service or other
         appropriate uses.

Old Redwood Highway Study Area
This area is bound by the South Healdsburg Avenue freeway interchange on the south,
Memorial Bridge and the Syar Industries property on the north, the city limits on the east
and Russian River on the west. This area was annexed by the City of Healdsburg in 1979
primarily for the purpose of extending city services and utilities. Current development on
the east side of Healdsburg Avenue includes a lumber yard, a lumber mill, warehousing,
light manufacturing, a gravel processing plant, a restaurant and a park and ride lot near the
freeway off-ramp. Memorial Beach, a county-owned recreational facility, gravel processing
and earthmoving equipment storage is located on the west side of the street.
Approximately 49 acres within this area are vacant. The area is designated Industrial, with
the exception of several properties that adjoin the freeway on the west side of
Healdsburg Avenue, which are designated Mixed Use, and Memorial Beach, which is
designated Public/Quasi-Public.
This section of Healdsburg Avenue has the character of a rural road with few curbs, no
defined edge, swales on both sides for drainage and wide roadway shoulders. A Class II
(striped) bicycle lane runs along both sides of the street, connecting at the south end to a
regional bicycle network. Unsightly overhead utilities dominate views of this area. The
Old Redwood Highway Design Guidelines apply to development along Healdsburg Avenue
and regulate minimum street setbacks, landscaping design, property access, location and
screening of parking and outdoor storage, fencing, signing, lighting, sidewalks and public
transportation. However, only two projects have been developed in accordance with
these guidelines since it was developed. Development in the area has been hindered
primarily by the lack of public water and sewer service, which cannot be extended to the
area until Memorial Bridge is renovated or replaced.
The Old Redwood Highway Plan should:
    •   Consider the appropriateness of industrial uses along the river
    •   Identify opportunities for maximizing public access to the river
    •   Identify appropriate land uses for the eventual redevelopment of the Syar
        Industries sites
    •   Identify the means of funding and constructing public water and sewer services and
        underground overhead utilities
    •   Determine the need to update the Old Redwood Highway Design Guidelines
    •   Consider the placement of city identification and directional signs.

            General Plan Figure 2, a specific plan shall be adopted by the City Council prior
            to, or simultaneous with prezoning consideration of the area to be annexed,
            except that no specific plan shall be required for the unincorporated pockets
            on the north and south sides of South Fitch Mountain Road and no specific
            plan shall be required for land to be annexed for school or public utility
            purposes.
LU-A-5      The City will discourage annexations that would result in the creation of
            unincorporated islands, peninsulas, or other irregular boundaries, provided
            that such restrictions are not detrimental to planned growth and development.
LU-A-6      The City will not consider the annexation of any properties in the
            unincorporated Fitch Mountain area except under the following circumstances:
            a. A comprehensive study is completed examining the feasibility of annexation
                of the area examining Fitch Mountain resident views, geotechnical and
                public service constraints and fiscal impacts.
            b. The existing Fitch Mountain Water Company system is upgraded to City
                standards.

               collection system to City standards with localized treatment facilities or
               financing of necessary capacity expansion in the City’s wastewater
               treatment system.
           d. County Service Area No. 24 or another public entity initiates and provides
               financing for the acquisition of Pacific Gas and Electric’s electrical
               distribution facilities in the area and agrees to dedicate such facilities to the
               City as a condition of annexation.
           e. An assessment district is formed to design and construct necessary street,
               drainage and other improvements to city standards.
           f.  One or more geologic hazard abatement districts are formed and a plan to
               control and mitigate geologic and soil erosion hazards is implemented.
LU-A-7       The City will continue to manage residential growth within the Urban Growth
             Boundary in a manner that reflects the capacity of its public facilities.
GOAL LU-B          The continuation of non-urban land uses outside the Urban
                   Service Area/Urban Growth Boundary that protect
                   agricultural, natural and scenic resources.
Policies
LU-B-1     The City will work with Sonoma County to achieve common land use
           objectives for the unincorporated lands within the Healdsburg Planning Area
           and outside the Urban Service Area/Urban Growth Boundary in proximity to
           Healdsburg.
LU-B-2     The City will consider the de-annexation of the 16-acre property at 2250
           Magnolia Drive in order to promote its continued use for agricultural
           purposes.
GOAL LU-C          A pattern and intensity of land use that respects residential
                   neighborhoods as well as natural constraints and conditions.
Policies
LU-C-1     Only low-intensity urban development and open space land uses shall be
           allowed in areas characterized by steep slopes, environmental hazards, scenic
           ridgelines and hillsides. Clustering of development in these areas shall be
           encouraged to preserve open space, meet the policies of the General Plan
           concerning natural hazards and scenic resources and minimize the costs of
           infrastructure improvements.

LU-C-2      Intensive urban development shall be allowed only in areas that are relatively
            free of topographic, geologic and environmental limitations.
LU-C-3      The integrity of distinct and identifiable neighborhoods, entries and districts
            shall be preserved and strengthened.
LU-C-4      Development at the interface of different land use designations shall be
            designed to ensure compatibility between the uses.
LU-C-5      Residential neighborhoods shall be protected from encroachments by
            undesirable non-residential uses.
GOAL LU-D           A thriving, pedestrian-oriented downtown                  that   is   the
                    commercial and cultural center of Healdsburg.
Policies
LU-D-1      The downtown shall be defined by identifiable boundaries. Land use
            designations shall reinforce the distinction between the downtown and
            surrounding areas. Landscaping, street furniture, special paving, lighting and
            street trees shall be used to reinforce the distinction between the downtown
            and adjacent districts.
LU-D-2      The City shall seek to provide a diversity of uses within the downtown that
            serve both residents and visitors and shall avoid an over-concentration of a
            single type of use.
LU-D-3      Development outside of the downtown shall not undermine its role as the
            commercial center of the city.
LU-D-4      The ground floor of buildings fronting on the historic Plaza should be occupied
            by activities of visual interest to pedestrians.
LU-D-5      Formula businesses are prohibited on properties around the historic Plaza in
            order to preserve its character of small, unique businesses that are attractive
            to residents and visitors.
LU-D-6      Large single-tenant commercial buildings around the Plaza shall be regulated to
            minimize aesthetic, economic and traffic impacts.
GOAL LU-E           Provision of goods and services to residents and visitors in a
                    manner that preserves and enhances Healdsburg’s small-town
                    charm and unique character.
Policy
LU-E-1      Big box retail and outlet malls are prohibited within the City of Healdsburg.

GOAL LU-F          Appropriate and complementary land uses adjacent to
                   designated transit facility sites.
Policies
LU-F-1     Land uses adjacent to designated transit facilities should derive maximum
           benefit from transit facilities and may include retail, office, employment and
           higher-density residential uses.
LU-F-2     The City shall encourage mixed use development, including new housing and
           employment opportunities, as well as reuse of underutilized or vacant
           industrial land, around the historic railroad depot to support transit use at the
           depot.
GOAL LU-G          Maximized public use of the city’s river frontage.
Policies
LU-G-1     Re-evaluate the suitability of industrial uses in the area between the Russian
           River bridge and the southernmost entrance to the City of Healdsburg when
           water and sewer services become available.
LU-G-2     Plan for the ultimate redevelopment of the Syar Industries properties.
IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
LU-1       Amend the Municipal Code to reflect the “extraordinary circumstances” under
           which extensions of City water and/or sewer service outside of the Urban
           Service Area/Urban Growth Boundary may occur and establish a requirement
           that findings be made for such extensions, including the following:
           a. The land use to which the water and/or sewer service would be extended
               is consistent with all applicable policies of the General Plan;
           b. The land use to which the water and/or sewer service would be extended
               is compatible with open space uses as defined in state law, does not
               interfere with accepted agricultural practices, and does not adversely affect
               the stability of land use patterns in the area;
           c. The property to which the water and/or sewer service would be extended
               is immediately adjacent to land already served by the service(s) to be
               extended; and,
           d. Specific circumstances, unique to the property to which the water and/or
               sewer service would be extended, would otherwise deprive the property
               of privileges enjoyed by other comparable property outside the Urban
               Service Area/Urban Growth Boundary and in the vicinity of the property
               to be served.

Policy Document                                                                    2 Land Use
LU-2        Until December 31, 2016, amend Policies LU-A-1 and LU-A-2 and the Land
            Use Plan only by a vote of the people or pursuant to the procedures set forth
            below:
            a. The City Council may amend the Urban Growth Boundary designated on
                the Land Use Plan if it deems it to be in the public interest, provided that
                the amended boundary is within or coextensive with the limits of the
                Urban Growth Boundary as designated on the Land Use Plan as of March
                1, 1996.
            b. The City Council may amend the Urban Growth Boundary to comply with
                state law regarding the provision of housing for all economic segments of
                the community, in order to accommodate lands to be designated for
                residential uses, provided that no more than 10 acres of land may be
                brought within the Urban Growth Boundary for this purpose in any
                calendar year. Such amendment may be adopted only if the City Council
                makes each of the following findings:
                i.   That the land is immediately adjacent to existing comparably developed
                     areas and the applicant for the redesignation has provided evidence that
                     the Fire Department, Police Department, Department of Public Works,
                     the Community Services Department and the School District have
                     adequate capacity to accommodate the proposed development and
                     provide it with adequate public services; and,
                ii. That the proposed development will consist of primarily low and very
                     low income housing pursuant to the Housing Element of this General
                     Plan; and,
                iii. That there is no existing residentially designated land available within
                     the Urban Growth Boundary to accommodate the proposed
                     development; and,
                iv. That it is not reasonably feasible to accommodate the proposed
                     development by redesignating lands within the Urban Growth Boundary
                     for low and very low income housing; and,
                v. The proposed development is necessary to comply with state law
                     requirements for provision of low- and very low-income housing.
            c. The City Council may amend the Urban Growth Boundary if it finds that:
                i.   The application of Goal A, Policies LU-A-1 and LU-A-2 and the Land
                     Use Plan would constitute an unconstitutional taking of a landowner’s
                     property; and
Healdsburg 2030 General Plan                                                             2-19

2 Land Use                                                                    Policy Document
                ii. The amendment and associated land use designation will allow
                    additional land uses only to the minimum extent necessary to avoid said
                    unconstitutional taking to the landowner’s property.
           d. The provisions enumerated in Policies LU-A-1 and LU-A-2 shall continue
                to be included in the General Plan until December 31, 2016, unless earlier
                repealed or amended pursuant to the procedures set forth above or by the
                voters of the City.
LU-3       Prepare and consider the findings of a study to evaluate removing Fitch
           Mountain and its surrounding area from the Urban Service Area/Urban
           Growth Boundary due to significant and pervasive environmental constraints,
           limited development potential and the financial infeasibility of providing city
           services to the area.
LU-4       Continue to meet with the Sonoma County Local Agency Formation
           Commission on an annual basis to reaffirm the City’s position on its Sphere of
           Influence and Urban Service Area/Urban Growth Boundary.
LU-5       Prepare and adopt specific plans in cooperation with the affected property
           owners for areas shown in General Plan Figure 2 when deemed appropriate by
           the City Council. The costs of preparing, reviewing and adopting specific plans
           and related environmental documents shall be paid by the property owners
           benefiting from the specific plan.
           Specific plans will comprehensively address the relevant planning issues on the
           property to be annexed as well as adjacent properties as necessary to ensure
           proper coordination of future development with existing infrastructure, land
           use patterns and environmental concerns.
           The term “specific plan” includes specific plans provided for by Government
           Code Section 65450, area plans, neighborhood plans, residential master plans
           and planned developments. The City Council may determine the type of plan
           study method that is appropriate to a proposed annexation area and whether
           the plan should be prepared prior to or simultaneous with the prezoning
           request.
LU-6       Rescind the Ridgeline North Area Plan to reflect the property’s purchase by
           the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District for a
           natural open space preserve.
LU-7       Review on an annual basis and implement the adopted policies and procedures
           for administering the residential growth management initiative (Measure M)
           passed by the voters of the City of Healdsburg on November 7, 2000.

LU-8        Continue to collaborate with Sonoma County, Sonoma County LAFCO, the
            Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District and other
            agencies to ensure that unincorporated areas within the Healdsburg Planning
            Area and in proximity to it are primarily non-urban uses such as rural
            residential, agricultural and open space.
LU-9        Review and respond to land use referrals from Sonoma County regarding
            potential development proposals located outside of Healdsburg that may affect
            the City.
LU-10       Continue to implement the land use and development regulations that protect
            hillsides and ridgelines as contained in the Zoning Ordinance, the Design
            Review Manual, and in adopted specific, area and neighborhood plans.
LU-11       Continue to implement the standards and guidelines contained in the Design
            Review Manual as they relate to the development of hillsides and land with
            physical constraints.
LU-12       Adopt plans for the special study areas shown on General Plan Figure 4. Unless
            otherwise determined by the City Council, the special study area plans shall be
            prepared by the City in close cooperation with the affected property owners.
            The costs of preparing, reviewing and adopting the special study area plans and
            related environmental documents shall be paid in advance by the property
            owners initiating the special study area plan. If the City initiates preparation of
            a special study area plan, then the City shall pay for the cost and be
            compensated by property owners upon future development. The geographic
            area to be covered by the plan may be revised as deemed appropriate during
            the planning process.
LU-13       Continue to implement the improvements contained in the Downtown
            Streetscape Plan.
LU-14       Study the implications of the proliferation of a single type of use in the
            downtown (e.g., wine tasting rooms) on the area’s diversity and economic
            vitality.
LU-15       Maintain in the Zoning Ordinance a prohibition on office uses on the ground
            floor of buildings fronting the Plaza.
LU-16       Amend the Zoning Ordinance to:
            a. Regulate formula businesses for properties around the Plaza.
            b. Prohibit big box retail businesses and outlet malls throughout the city.
            c. Regulate large single-tenant commercial buildings around the Plaza.

2 Land Use                                                                      Policy Document
           d. Ensure that development outside of the downtown complements, but does
               not compete with, its role as the city’s commercial core.
           e. Replace the Highway Commercial zoning district with a Mixed Use
               Commercial zoning district to be more responsive to market demand and
               to promote mixed commercial and residential uses at higher densities.
           f.  Combine the industrial zoning districts and revise the list of allowed and
               conditionally-permitted uses to reflect changes to the local economy and
               regulate uses that generate significant off-site impacts.
           g. Set standards for what qualifies as a subordinate use when associated with
               mixed-use and other types of development.
LU-17      Evaluate the floor area ratio (FAR) standards of the General Plan land use
           designations and the Zoning Ordinance zoning districts and determine whether
           revisions are needed to reflect the appropriate intensity of development.
LU-18      Prior to the development of the ±30-acre property on the west side of
           Healdsburg Avenue at the northern city limits (commonly referred to as the
           Quaker Hill property), the Planning Commission shall approve a conditional
           use permit or similar land use entitlement, in addition to a design review
           permit, that defines the development’s physical and operational characteristics
           and insures that the mix of uses is compatible and consistent with the intent of
           the North Entry Plan. Retail uses on the property shall be limited to smaller,
           ancillary and specialty shops, designed to serve the primary uses on the site.
           The following uses shall not be allowed:
           •   Regional or community shopping center;
           •   Grocery- or drugstore-anchored neighborhood shopping center;
           •   Home improvement or hardware store; and
           •   Automobile dealership or service station.

3       HOUSING
Goals, Policies, and Programs
The following goals, policies, and programs are intended to address existing and future housing
needs as well as minimize constraints on housing development during the January 31, 2015 –
January 31, 2023, planning period. The status of each program will be evaluated on an annual
basis to determine its effectiveness in meeting these needs.
GOAL H-A ACCOMMODATION OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT
Maximize opportunities for the development of a variety of housing types to accommodate
anticipated growth, facilitate mobility within both the ownership and rental markets, and
encourage a diverse community.
Policies
H-A-1     Maintain a supply of residentially-designated land that is adequate to accommodate
          Healdsburg’s share of the regional housing need and facilitate residential turnover with
          relative ease.
H-A-2     Encourage residential projects to develop at the higher end of the allowable density
          range.
H-A-3     Consistent with “no-net-loss” density provisions contained in Government Code
          Section 65863, consider the potential impact on the City’s ability to meet its share of
          the regional housing need when reviewing proposals to downzone residential
          properties, reclassify residentially-designated property to other uses, or develop a
          residential site with fewer units than what is assumed for the site in the Housing
          Element sites inventory.
H-A-4     Provide a wide range of housing opportunities for all economic segments of the
          community, while maintaining a mix of housing types in Healdsburg.
H-A-5     Ensure that specific plans allow the development of a range of housing types, to the
          extent feasible.
H-A-6     Encourage the retention and development of rental units.
H-A-7     Avoid concentrations of lower-income households to promote social and economic
          integration.
H-A-8     Encourage residential development in the Central Healdsburg Avenue Special Study
          Area consistent with the vision in the Central Healdsburg Avenue Area Plan.
2-24                                                              Healdsburg 2030 General Plan

GOAL H-B MINIMIZATION OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Minimize governmental constraints on the development of housing for households of all income
levels.
Policies
H-B-1    Minimize the length of the review process for residential development applications to
         the extent feasible in order to minimize development costs.
H-B-2    Lessen the City’s Growth Management Program as a constraint on the development of

H-B-3    Continually strive to minimize the time needed for the City to review and act on
         applications for small subdivisions of residentially-zoned land.
H-B-4    Endeavor to provide consistent and predictable policy direction for residential project
         applicants through development and design standards and decision making.
H-B-5    Continue to reduce the required number of parking spaces and waive the requirement
         for covered parking for senior and affordable housing developments, as feasible, if this
         will reduce development costs or improve the design of a project.
Programs
H-5      Maintain Adequate Staffing. Maintain City staffing and/or contracted services at
         levels adequate to ensure the prompt consideration of residential development
         applications.

          proposes a project in which 100 percent of the remaining units not restricted to
          lower-income households will be affordable to moderate-income households.
H-C-8     Strive to provide housing opportunities that are affordable to the local workforce.
H-C-9     Consider establishing a Workforce Housing Linkage Fee to generate funding for new

 Quantified Objectives
The following quantified objectives are based on the Housing Element’s identification of existing
and projected housing needs, potential housing development sites and financial resources, and
the Element’s analysis of constraints to the development and maintenance of housing. This
information has been used to establish reasonable estimates of what these programs and
policies can accomplish.
The tables below estimate the number of units likely to be constructed, rehabilitated, and
conserved/preserved during the planning period (January 31, 2015 through January 31, 2023).
The quantified objectives do not represent a ceiling, but rather set a goal for the City to
achieve, based on needs, resources and constraints.
Construction Objectives
The quantified objectives for housing construction are the number of new units that potentially
may be constructed in the City of Healdsburg Planning area by the City with its non-profit
partners and by private developers. They are based on the regional housing needs allocated to
the City for the planning period by the Association of Bay Area Governments.

Rehabilitated Housing Objectives
The rehabilitated housing objectives are the number of units that potentially may be
rehabilitated during the planning period. They are based on the programs described in the
Background Report.

                    Commission Rehabilitation Program
Conserved Affordable Housing Objectives
The conserved affordable housing objectives are the number of units whose affordability will be
preserved during the planning period. There are no affordable units in Healdsburg at risk of
converting to market rate within the 10-year period of 2015 to 2025. The Housing Element
includes programs that will help to conserve the 900 multifamily rental units (Program H-23
Strengthen the Condominium Conversion Ordinance) and the 70 mobile homes (Program H-22
Mobile Home Park Space Rent Stabilization Ordinance), which are important sources of non-
deed-restricted affordable housing in the community. While important for conserving housing,
the actual number of units that might be conserved through these programs is difficult to
quantify. (Amended by Ord. 1143, Effective 12/31/14)

            community.
ED-9        Continue to provide off-street public parking supporting downtown businesses
            within the Downtown in order to make the most effective and attractive use

           strategies and opportunistic land development to supplement and make up for
           City funding resources that might be lost with the relocation of public
           revenue-generating businesses.
ED-18      Explore long-term funding sources to attain a balanced budget, focusing on the
           identification of funding sources for all City operations and needs.

5        TRANSPORTATION
The Transportation Element contains goals and policies related to the transportation
system in Healdsburg, including streets, public transit, bicycle routes, pedestrian
connections and rail service. They address each of the transportation modes with the
objective of creating a safe, efficient, and convenient transportation system. Each of the
specific plans and the Grove Street Neighborhood Plan has or will have its own
circulation plan and street types.
Circulation Plan
General Plan Figure 5, Circulation Plan, depicts the official classification of streets within
the Urban Service Area. The following define the various types of streets in the
classification system.
•   Local streets provide immediate access to properties and carry very low traffic
    volumes.
•   Collector streets are fed by local streets, provide local circulation options and
    connections to arterials, and carry light to moderate traffic volumes.
•   Arterial streets are fed by local and collector streets, provide intra-city circulation and
    connections to the freeway and regional roads and carry relatively heavy traffic
    volumes. Arterials within the city include Healdsburg Avenue, Dry Creek Road and
    Mill Street west of Healdsburg Avenue.
•   Freeways are fed by arterial streets, provide intra-city travel and connections to other
    regional highways, and are capable of carrying heavy traffic volumes. Highway 101
    serves this function in the Planning Area.
Street Standards
General Plan Figure 6, Street Standard Cross-Sections, illustrates standard designs for
each of the three street types depicted in Figure 5. However, because development of the
city’s street network began more than 150 years ago and has developed incrementally,
many street segments do not conform to these designs and will not be redesigned and
reconstructed. Such components as parking, sidewalks, landscaping and bicycle lanes will
be determined for specific street segments based on factors such as surrounding land
uses, topography, mature trees and the available right-of-way. Future specific plans will
develop street standards that are appropriate to plan goals and environmental
considerations.

Transportation Goals, Policies and Implementation Measures
GOAL T-A             A circulation system that is correlated with existing and
                     proposed land use and provides for the efficient movement of
                     people, goods, and services within and through Healdsburg.
Policies
T-A-1       The City shall strive to maintain at least a Level of Service (LOS) D operation
            during periods of peak traffic flow at critical intersections, and Level of Service
            C operation at all other times. These standards shall apply only to
            intersections of an arterial street with either another arterial or a collector
            street and intersections of two collector streets. LOS F operation shall be
            acceptable for a stop-controlled approach to a through street provided the
            higher levels of delay affect 25 or fewer vehicles per hour. Attainment of these
            levels of service shall be consistent with the financial resources available and
            the limits of technical feasibility.
            The following table indicates the standards described above based on the
            methodologies detailed in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000.
                              Minimum Level of Service Standards
                                For intersections of two arterial streets and
                               intersections of arterial and collector streets

                Unsignalized – worst approach               E                    D
T-A-2       Streets shall be dedicated, modified, extended, and constructed according to
            the street cross-sections as shown in General Plan Figure 6, Street Standard
            Cross-Sections with the following exceptions:
            a. In areas included in a specific plan adopted by the City, streets shall be
                 dedicated and constructed according to street standards shown in such
                 plans(s).
            b. Deviations from these cross-sections may be allowed where such
                 improvements are infeasible or are needed to preserve neighborhood

1
  Specified land use is satisfactory based on the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal conventional construction,
  without any special noise insulation requirements.
2
  New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements is
  made and after needed noise insulation features are included in the design. Conventional construction, but with closed windows
  and fresh-air supply systems or air conditioning, will normally suffice.
3
  New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new construction or development does proceed, a detailed
  analysis of the noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features included in the design. Outdoor
  areas must be shielded.
4
  New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.

Noise
S-16        Require a noise study, including field noise measurements, for any proposed
            project that would place a potentially-intrusive noise source near an existing
            noise-sensitive use or place a noise-sensitive land use near an existing or
            potentially-intrusive noise source such as a freeway, arterial street or railroad,
            using the projected future noise contours in Figure 11 as a guide.
S-17        Purchase new equipment and vehicles that have the best available noise
            reduction technology.
S-18        Work with state and federal agencies to actively enforce regulations dealing
            with noise, such as the California Vehicle Code governing motor vehicle noise
            emissions and federal construction vehicle standards.
S-19        Work with entities providing passenger or freight rail service to utilize
            equipment and operate in a manner that minimizes noise impacts to the
            community to the maximum feasible extent. Seek the installation of
            supplementary safety measures at highway-rail grade crossings in order to
            apply for Quiet Zones in the city.
S-20        Where necessary, require the provision of sound-proofing and other similar
            noise-attenuating measures in residential development when proximate to
            noise sources.
S-21        Require that prospective purchasers and tenants of residential units proximate
            to non-residential uses are advised of potential noise and other elements
            typically associated with such uses.
S-22        Review the City’s noise ordinance and revise as necessary to ensure
            consistency with the noise standards contained in Figure 10.
S-23        Use the Federal Transit Administration vibration impact criteria to evaluate the
            land use compatibility of sensitive uses proposed along the railroad using the
            best available information (without active railroad operations) or site-specific
            analyses (with active railroad operations). Developers of sensitive uses shall
            demonstrate that potential impacts of existing or potential vibration have been
            minimized to the maximum feasible extent.
S-24        Enforce provisions in the agreement with the City’s waste collection franchisee
            regarding collection hours and noise generated by collection vehicles.

S-25        Where construction occurs that would result in a potentially-significant impact
            on noise-sensitive uses, require use of noise-reducing measures that may
            include the following:
            a. Equip internal combustion engine-driven equipment with intake and
                exhaust mufflers that are in good condition and are appropriate for the
                equipment.
            b. Locate stationary noise-generating equipment as far as possible from
                sensitive receptors in the vicinity.
            c. Utilize "quiet" air compressors and other stationary noise sources where
                technology exists.
            d. Erect temporary noise control blanket barriers in a manner to shield noise-
                sensitive uses.
            e. Control noise levels from workers’ amplified music so that sounds are not
                audible sensitive receptors in the vicinity.
            f.  Designate a “disturbance coordinator” responsible for responding to
                complaints about project construction noise and taking reasonable
                measures to correct the problem. Conspicuously post a telephone number
                for the disturbance coordinator at the construction site and include it in
                any notice sent to neighbors regarding the construction schedule.
Hazardous Materials
S-26        City approvals of all new development shall consider the potential for the
            production, use, storage, and transport of hazardous materials and provide for
            reasonable controls on such hazardous materials.
S-27        Require the City’s waste collection franchisee to provide curb-side collection
            of used motor oil and filters and provide disposal containers for this purpose.
