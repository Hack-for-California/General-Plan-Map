This General Plan seeks to establish a long-term framework for employment
growth and fiscal stability for Pacifica. Together with other General Plan
initiatives, this will help ensure the City’s economic success. The Economic
Sustainability chapter contains policies and actions that provide direction for
improving the City’s business and tourist attraction strategies; improving the
ratio of jobs to households; and supporting business activities that can meet
the needs of the community and of visitors to the City.

The Community Design Element focuses on enhancing the image and everyday
livability of Pacifica. It presents a vision for the City’s overall form and image,
and provides guidance for preserving and enhancing the qualities that support
that urban structure. Specifically, the Community Design Element discusses
compatible infill development; pedestrian-oriented, mixed use districts; views
to hillsides, coastal bluffs and the ocean; and sustainable design. This chapter
identifies certain areas where additional standards and guidelines may be
needed, and provides policies at a citywide scale, as well as key goals defining
distinct areas within the City.

Development Character in the
Highway 1 Corridor
Future development along Highway 1 will also influ-
ence the scenic qualities of the corridor. Develop-
ment can create a strong presence along the High-
way and harmonious transitions to adjacent neigh-
borhoods. All new commercial development requires
site development review, assisted by the Design
Guidelines. The Guidelines will provide direction on
how buildings should relate to Highway 1 at different
segments of the Highway.
Gateways
Pacifica is introduced to southbound travelers with
the experience of coming over the hill and seeing the
expansive coastal vista. Northbound travelers come
through the Devils Slide Tunnel, wind around the
forested Pedro Point Headlands, and arrive at the
active intersection with Linda Mar Boulevard. Sky-
line Boulevard acts as a coherent eastern bound-
ary for the City, as it travels along the crest of the
ridge with mature trees along its edges. From Sky-
line, Pacifica is entered via Sharp Park Road, Manor
Drive, and Hickey Boulevard. While the “gateways”
into Pacifica are strong, entry points from the east
can be made stronger, and all entries treated with
a consistent signage theme. Gateway locations are
shown on Figure 3-3.

  4          L A ND USE
The purpose of this chapter is to describe existing and planned land use in the
Planning Area and present the policy framework that will guide the City on
development decisions. The chapter forms the core of the General Plan and
its policies articulate the community’s land use and growth priorities through
2035. It includes the Land Use Diagram, land use classifications, standards
for density and intensity, and limitations on development expressed by the
policies. The land use framework for each sub-area is then provided in greater
detail.
Guiding and implementing policies aim to define the Planning Area’s physical
development and reinforce its commitment to balancing needs for open space
and habitat conservation; housing opportunities; economic development;
neighborhood character; and other issues.

Classification below.
Land Use Classifications
Land use classifications establish allowed uses, maxi-
mum density and intensity, and the type and char-
acter of development that is expected. Details on
development standards are established in the zoning
ordinance, and more than one zoning district may
be consistent with a General Plan land use classifica-
tion.
According to State law, the General Plan must estab-
lish standards of population density and building
intensity for each land use classification. The Plan
stipulates residential densities in housing units per
gross acre; population density can be obtained by
applying average persons per housing unit3 to the
housing unit densities. For nonresidential uses, the
Plan specifies a maximum permitted ratio of gross
floor area to site area (Floor Area Ratio or FAR). Rec-
ommended density and intensity standards do not
imply that development projects must be approved
at the intensity specified for each use. Zoning reg-
ulations consistent with General Plan policies and/

Below Market Rate Program
In Pacifica, residential developments or subdivisions
of eight or more units must set aside at least 15 per-
cent of units as Below Market Rate housing, with
affordability provisions in place for at least 45 or 55
years for for-sale units and rental units, respectively.
With approval from the Planning Commission,
developers may meet the program goals by building
units off-site, dedicating land to the City, or paying
into the city’s housing trust fund.
Second Residential Units
Second units may be built in single-family residen-
tial zones, provided that the property continues to
meet lot coverage, setback, and height requirements.
One unit must be owner-occupied, and the second
unit must have no more than one bedroom and be
no larger than 750 square feet or 50 percent the floor
area of the main unit (850 square feet is permitted as
needed for accessibility).
Sub-Areas and Specific Sites
Figure 4-5 shows 15 sub-areas. Sub-areas may be
referred to as neighborhoods at times. The “sub-area”
designation is not intended to correspond with any
jurisdictional boundaries, but to help readers under-
stand the way the General Plan affects Pacifica’s dis-
tinct geographic areas. Figure 4-5 also identifies spe-
cific sites that are the subject of General Plan policies.
This chapter contains land use policies for specific
sites. Policies on open space, parks and coastal access
are in Chapter 6. Policies on environmental resources
are in Chapter 7, with visual resources covered in
Chapter 3. Policies on hazards are in Chapter 8.
Figure 4-5 also serves as a key map for the four maps

  5        CIRCUL AT ION
The Circulation Element provides a framework to guide management and
improvements to Pacifica’s transportation-related infrastructure over the
next 20 years. A safe and efficient transportation network is an important
contributor to a community’s quality of life and economic vitality. The
circulation system enables access to the City’s neighborhoods, employment
and educational opportunities, public services, commercial and recreational
areas, and regional destinations. It provides for travel by automobile, transit,
walking, and cycling.

    5.1	 CIRCULATION FRAMEWORK

    transportation and land use and requires that poli-     tion planning in Pacifica is one part of a larger effort.
    cies for the two topics are related and mutually ben-

    Pacifica’s Circulation Element also responds directly
    to the State requirement of planning for “Complete
    Streets.” In response to the California Complete
    Streets Act, all cities and counties are required to
    plan for the development of multimodal transpor-
    tation networks in their general plans. According to
    the Act, jurisdictions must “plan for a balanced, mul-
    timodal transportation network that meets the needs
    of all users of streets, roads, and highways for safe
    and convenient travel in a manner that is suitable to
    the rural, suburban, or urban context of the general
    plan.”1 The “users of streets, roads, and highways”
    refers to bicyclists, pedestrians, children, motorists,
    persons with disabilities, the elderly, users of public
    transportation, and commercial goods movers.
    Sustainable Communities
    The transportation planning and policy set forth in
    the Circulation Element is also an important compo-
    nent of Pacifica’s responsibility toward meeting the
    requirements of the Sustainable Communities and
    Climate Protection Act of 2008. This Act requires
    that metropolitan planning organizations in Cali-
    fornia prepare a Sustainable Communities Strat-
    egy (SCS) for meeting their greenhouse gas reduc-

     PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS
Three major routes connect Pacifica to the rest of the
region. State Route (SR) 1 (Coast Highway) traverses
the City from north to south, connecting Pacifica to
Daly City and San Francisco to the north, and to
Half Moon Bay and the San Mateo County coast-
line to the south, and providing continuous access to
the Pacifica coast. SR 35 (Skyline Boulevard) gener-
ally runs along the eastern edge of Pacifica, and is a
major north-south route connecting to Santa Clara
County and San Francisco. Sharp Park Road fol-
lows a southwest-northeast route through the center
of Pacifica, connecting SR 1 with SR 35. It continues
east of SR 35 in South San Francisco as Westborough
Boulevard. Each of these major roadways intersects
with I-280, an eight-lane major regional freeway on
the Peninsula located between one-half and two
miles from the Planning Area.
Roadway Classification
Pacifica’s roadway network is comprised of freeways,
highways, arterials, collector streets and local streets.
Each classification reflects the character of the road-
way as well as its function within the context of the
circulation system. Figure 5-1 illustrates the roadway
network with street classifications.
Freeways and Multi-Lane Highways
Freeways typically have speed limits of 55 and 65
miles per hour (mph) and four to eight lanes, with
physical medians and uninterrupted flow. Multilane
highways generally have posted speed limits between
40 and 55 mph.2 Unlike freeways, multilane high-
ways are interrupted by intersections or driveways.         SamTrans provides a Park & Ride lot on Linda Mar Boulevard.
                                                            Only about 1.5 percent of trips beginning or ending in Pacifica

Devil’s Slide Bypass
The Devil’s Slide bypass project approximately one
mile south of Pacifica, circumvents a historically
dangerous stretch of SR 1 via a 0.85-mile dual tunnel
beneath San Pedro Mountain. With the completion
of the tunnel, SR1 now provides a reliable and safer
route between south Pacifica and Montara.
Additional Improvements to Accommodate
Buildout
Additional improvements are justified based on the
analysis of existing and projected future traffic con-
ditions with projected growth during the planning
period, compared to the City’s level of service stan-
dards.
•	 SR 35: By 2035, SR 35 would operate at LOS F
   during PM peak hour between Hickey Boulevard
   and Timberhill Court in the absence of improve-
   ments. While most of this traffic is not related to
   the expected employment and residential growth
   in Pacifica, an additional lane of travel in the
   southbound direction will improve the roadway
   segment LOS to acceptable level E or better.
•	 Hickey Boulevard Intersection Improvements:
   The intersection of SR 35 and Hickey Boulevard
   would operate at LOS F for the AM and PM
   peak hours by 2035. If the SR 35 signal is opti-
   mized, a westbound right-turn lane added, a
   westbound left-turn lane added, and all left-turn
   movements are “protected-permitted” the inter-
   section will operate at LOS E during peak hours.
   At Hickey Boulevard and Gateway Drive, signal-
   izing the intersection will result in LOS C for
   the AM peak hour and LOS D for the PM peak
   hour.                                                 Proposed improvements would upgrade SR 1 between Reina del

      1	 MOE = Measures of Effectiveness. For arterials, MOE is measured in v/c ratios (volume to capacity ratios). For two-lane highways and four-
         lane highways, MOE is measured in density (passenger cars per mile per lane).
      2	 LOS = Level of Service is based on 2007 C/CAG of San Mateo County Final Congestion Management Plan criteria
      3	 Roadway segment volumes were adopted from SR 1/Calera Parkway Project Final Traffic Operations Report, July 2008
      4	 Based on actual field observation and as implied in the SR1/Calera Parkway Project Final Traffic Operations Report, July 2008
      5	 (xx) Indicates delay/LOS if the Calera Parkway Expansion Project is implemented

The City of Pacifica has initiated a free weekend
shuttle known as the Devils Slide Ride. The service
provides transportation along the coast between the
Jean Brink Pool at Oceana High School and the
turnaround at the Devils Slide tunnels, giving resi-
dents and visitors access to coastal attractions in
Pacifica including the Devils Slide hiking and view-
ing area. Funding is provided through a grant from
the San Mateo County Transportation Authority
and the City/County Association of Governments of
San Mateo County.
BART and Caltrain
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) provides rail rapid
transit to Alameda, Contra Costa, San Francisco,
and San Mateo Counties. The Colma, Daly City,
San Bruno, and South San Francisco BART stations
are accessible to Pacifica residents via bus connec-
tions or by car.
Caltrain provides commuter service over a 77-mile
route between downtown San Francisco and Gilroy,
through San Jose and along the San Francisco Pen-
insula. The San Bruno station is approximately eight
miles east of Pacifica, while the Hillsdale station in
San Mateo is approximately 20 miles away, a 30-min-
ute drive.

Open space is a defining feature of the Pacifica Planning Area, an extraordinary
resource, and a priority for the community. Parks, schools, and public utility
services are a vital part of a livable and sustainable Pacifica. The purpose of this
chapter is to document existing public open space and community facilities and
infrastructure, identify priority improvements, and ensure that they meet the
needs of community members. The close relationship between open space, parks,
recreation, and schools is highlighted.

SAN PEDRO VALLEY COUNTY PARK
The Middle and South Forks of San Pedro Creek
flow year-round through the 1,150-acre San Pedro
Valley County Park, providing spawning habitat for
migratory Steelhead salmon. The park entrance is
reached from the south end of Oddstad Boulevard in
Pacifica; near the entrance the park offers two group
picnic areas and a small visitors’ center. During rainy
winter months, visitors can see Brooks Falls, which
has a three-tiered, 175-foot drop. Ten miles of trails
offer both easy walks and challenging climbs to the
ridges, with views to the ocean. Approximately half
of the park is within the Planning Area.
MCNEE RANCH STATE PARK
McNee Ranch State Park adjoins San Pedro Valley
County Park to the west. Trail connections between
the parks allow hikers beginning in Pacifica to reach
the summit of 1,900-foot North Peak and the ocean
at Montara State Beach or Gray Whale Cove. Just 22
acres of this park are within the Planning Area.
Beaches
PACIFICA STATE BEACH
Pacifica State Beach, stretching more than a half mile
between Pedro Point and the Rockaway Headlands,
is one of the most popular surfing spots in the San
Francisco area. By a 2005 estimate, more than one
million visitors use Pacifica State Beach every year.
Most of the beach and dunes are owned by the State
and are part of the state parks system, but are man-
aged by the City of Pacifica. Improvements com-
pleted in 2004 included rehabilitation of the Linda
Mar Sewage Pumping Station, wetlands restoration,
shoreline protection, dune restoration, improvements
to the Coastal Trail, and new public restrooms.

     Pedro Point Headlands
     Trails at San Pedro Point bring hikers from a trail-
     head on Highway 1 to an overlook point and to
     Pedro Summit. They are minimally improved, and
     the trailhead does not currently provide formal park-
     ing. The Devil’s Slide Tunnel will allow the bypassed
     highway segment to be converted to a trail, and park-
     ing areas and trailheads are planned for both ends of
     this segment. A trail connection also is planned to
     fill the gap in the Coastal Trail between Pedro Point
     Shopping Center and Devil’s Slide.
     Trailheads and Parking Areas
     Existing trailheads exist at the Sharp Park Beach
     Promenade; Mori’s Point Road; Shelldance Nurs-
     ery; Rockaway Beach; Crespi Drive at Highway
     1; Pacifica State Beach; San Pedro Valley County
     Park; Milagra Ridge. Planning Area trails also can
     be reached from trailheads east of the ridge at Sky-
     line College and at Sneath Lane. Trailheads, without
     parking, exist at the top of Fassler Avenue and on
     Highway 1 approaching Devil’s Slide.

Guiding Policies
OC-G-8	        Coastal Access and Recreational
           Opportunities. Provide maximum
           coastal access and recreational oppor-
           tunities for all people consistent with
           public safety and the need to protect
           public rights, rights of property owners,
           and natural resource areas from overuse,
           including access at each point identified
           on Figure 6-3.
OC-G-9	        Management of Public Access. Pro-
           vide public access in a manner that takes
           into account the need to regulate the
           time, place, and manner that access is
           provided, based on such factors as topo-
           graphic and site constraints; the fragility
           of natural resources; and the privacy of
           adjacent residential uses.
OC-G-10	        Distribution of Public Coastal
           Facilities. Continue to distribute public
           facilities, including parking areas or facil-
           ities, so as to mitigate against the impacts
           of overcrowding or overuse by the public
           of any single area.

This chapter provides policy guidance to conserve Pacifica’s natural and
cultural resources. Topics covered in this element include water resources;
biological resources; forest, agricultural, and soil resources; air quality; energy
and greenhouse gases; and cultural and historic resources.

Calera Creek Water Recycling Plant                        master planning.
The Calera Creek Water Recycling Plant (CCWRP),
located on the south flank of Mori Point, is a ter-
tiary treatment plant, brought online in 2000 to
replace the old Wastewater Treatment Plant in West
Sharp Park. The new plant uses ultraviolet disinfec-
tion, which allows effluent to be released to wetlands
without residual chlorine. The plant has facilitated
the creation and restoration of wetlands along Cal-
era Creek, bringing year-round flow to a naturalized
stream channel. When NCCWD’s water recycling
project is completed, the CCWRP will also be the
source for a portion of Pacifica’s landscape irrigation
water.
Testing at the Calera Creek Water Recycling Plant
indicates that discharges generally meet applicable
water quality standards, although there have been
some isolated instances of non-compliance.

     cern. A comprehensive list and description of species
     that are either known or presumed to be in the Plan-
     ning Area based on suitable habitat is in the EIR.
     Special-Status Wildlife Species
     In addition to these species, additional migratory
     birds, raptors, and common bat species are subject
     to general protections provided by state and federal
     regulations.
     Special-Status Plant Species
     The large number of special-status plants and the
     severity of their population declines are reflective of
     the degree of habitat loss that has occurred through-
     out the San Francisco Peninsula. Outside of San
     Bruno Mountain, Pacifica encompasses the north-
     ernmost natural habitat on the peninsula. Due to
     extensive coastal development throughout neigh-
     boring counties, beach and bluff species have also
     become rare.
     Of the special-status plant species listed in the EIR,
     38 special-status plants have the potential to occur
     within the Planning Area. These species have been
     recorded in the vicinity and/or may be present in
     suitable habitat on site.
     Protected Trees
     Certain trees within the city limits are also protected,
     including heritage trees and street trees. Heritage
     trees are any trees in the city that have a trunk with
     a circumference of 50 inches or more, at 24 inches
     above grade, excluding eucalyptus. The City Council
     may also designate any tree or grove of trees with his-
     torical, environmental, or aesthetic value as Heritage
     Trees. These require special permits for removal, sub-
     stantial trimming, or construction within its drip-
     line; in some cases, a Tree Protection Plan prepared
     by a qualified arborist, landscape architect, or horti-
     culturalist may be required prior to project approval.

     The BAAQMD maintains an Emissions Inventory,
     which estimates the total volume of air pollutants
     generated each day by approximately 100 “areawide”
     sources, point sources such as factories, gas stations
     and power plants, and mobile sources (primarily
     vehicles). In general, the proportion of air pollu-
     tion generated by different sources varies by pollut-
     ant. Cars, trucks, airplanes and boats are responsible
     for most of the smog-producing pollutants (nitro-
     gen oxides and reactive organic gases) in the air and
     nearly all of the carbon monoxide. Areawide sources,
     especially dust from roads, produce most of the par-
     ticulate air pollutants. Ships account for virtually all
     of the sulfur dioxide emitted in San Mateo County.

Ensuring the safety of community members, through protection from hazards,
is an essential service of public agencies and a critical priority for maintaining
community health and welfare. The purpose of the Safety Element is to
establish goals and policies to mitigate the potential impacts from natural
and man-made hazards that pose a threat to public health and safety.
Specifically, this chapter addresses seismic and geologic hazards, flooding, fire,
and other hazards, as well as related aspects of law enforcement, emergency
preparedness, and coordinated response measures.

Slope Failure and Erosion
Slope Failure
Slope failures, commonly referred to as landslides,
include many phenomena that involve the downslope
displacement and movement of material, either trig-
gered by static (i.e., gravity) or dynamic (i.e., earth-
quake) forces. The geology, structure, and amount of
groundwater in the slope affect slope failure poten-
tial, as do external processes (i.e., climate, topogra-
phy, slope geometry, and human activity). Slope fail-

Similarly, a site stability survey is required for any

ations for protection either now or in the future

permitted only where necessary to protect existing

Increased Coastal Erosion from Potential Sea
Level Rise
The potential for sea level rise and increased coastal
erosion has very serious implications for Pacifica.
Areas of the Sharp Park Golf Course, the Rockaway
Beach district, and the West Linda Mar and West
Sharp Park neighborhoods could be inundated.
Meanwhile, coastal erosion processes that have
caused damage along the high bluffs of Pacifica’s
northern neighborhoods would very likely increase
in magnitude.
Sea level rise resulting from global climate change is
projected to cause more extensive erosion of beaches,
dunes, bluffs and cliffs. The 2009 Pacific Institute
study of the impacts of sea level rise on the California
Coast developed erosion models for dune and cliff/
bluff backshore environments. Mean lateral erosion

Local Hazard Mitigation Plan
The regional Local Hazard Mitigation identifies two
mitigation strategies for wildland fires: review devel-
opment proposals to ensure that they incorporate
appropriate fire-mitigation measures, including ade-
quate provisions for evacuation and access by emer-
gency responders, and develop a clear legislative and
regulatory framework to manage the wildland-urban
interface consistent with best practices.
State Requirements
In 2005, the California Building Code was amended
to require that all new buildings located in any Fire
Hazard Severity Zone in SRAs, or any Very High
Fire Hazard Severity Zone in LRAs, must use build-
ing materials approved for use in wildland/urban
interface areas. The code now specifies certain roof
coverings, fire resistive wall and ceiling-floor assem-
blies, wall finish materials, hardware, insulation,
and other building materials for use in high fire
hazard areas. Also in 2005, Public Resources Code
was amended to expand the defensible space clear-
ance requirement around buildings from 30 feet to
100 feet in any SRA. Building owners must mini-
mize potential fuel around structures, to minimize
the risk of loss, and to improve firefighter safety.
The City will work with the North County Fire Authority toward
development of a third fire station in the central part of Pacifica.

The purpose of the Noise Element is to identify the noise sources that exist in
the Planning Area, and to establish policies and programs which the City can
enact to mitigate potential impacts through both preventative and responsive
measures. Noise from motor vehicles and aircraft operations are regulated
by state and federal agencies. Noise considerations also inform the location
of industrial land uses and transportation facilities, since they are common
sources of excessive noise levels, and the location of noise–sensitive uses such as
residences, schools, churches, and hospitals, so that they may be less affected by
noise.

    9.1	 NOISE CHARACTERISTICS AND MEASUREMENT
    Noise is commonly defined as undesirable or            noise levels are generally lower than in the daytime

Vehicle noise is a combination of the noises produced
by the engine, exhaust, tires, and wind generated by
taller vehicles. Other factors that affect the percep-
tion of traffic noise include: distance from the road-
way, terrain, vegetation, and natural and structural
obstacles. While tire noise from autos is generally
located at ground level, truck noise sources can be
located as high as ten to fifteen feet above the road-
bed due to tall exhaust stacks and higher engines.
Noise exposure contours for Pacifica’s major road-
ways were modeled by applying the Federal Highway
Administration’s noise modeling procedure. Traffic
data representing annual average traffic volumes and
truck mix, for existing conditions, were obtained
from the engineers working on the General Plan
Update and Caltrans. Existing noise measurements
were made in March 2009 at four locations, three
along SR 1 and one along Sharp Park Road. Using
these data and the FHWA methodology, traffic noise
levels were calculated for existing traffic volumes.

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
                                I. COMMUNITY PROFILE
1. The Housing Element
Pacifica's General Plan, comprised of 12 elements, guides all City activities. The Housing Element is
an integral part of the General Plan, focusing on analysis of future housing needs and methods to
provide adequate housing for Pacificans from all walks of life. It contains goals and policies for
housing and action programs which detail the steps the City can take to respond to the community’s
evolving housing needs. One of the most important aspects of the Housing Element is its
identification of sites for housing development that are sufficient to accommodate the City’s share of
the regional housing need for the planning period (in this case, 2015-20231).
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) develops a regional housing needs allocation
(RHNA) for all counties in the Bay Area2. Based upon that allocation, the City/County Association
of Governments of San Mateo (C/CAG) assigns specific allocations to incorporated and
unincorporated areas within the County. The Bay Area overall received a housing unit allocation of
187,990 units for the period between 2014-2022. ABAG apportioned to San Mateo County 16,418
of those units. Pacifica’s share of the County total was 413 units, constituting 2.5 percent of the
County’s allocation and .22 percent of the Bay Area’s allocation. Pacifica will play a small, yet
critically important part in meeting regional housing needs.
Out of the total of 413 units allocated to Pacifica as part of the RHNA process for 2014 to 2022, the
City has already approved eight units through April 30, 2015. The City can accommodate the
balance of its RHNA through the identification of sites properly zoned for residential development
that can occur during the planning period. The RHNA segments housing need by income level in
the categories very low, low, moderate, and above moderate. The result is that the City must plan
for a variety of housing types affordable to persons with varying incomes.
Past housing elements have helped the City of Pacifica work towards meeting its housing needs. The
following is a summary of housing elements adopted along with and subsequent to Pacifica’s 1980
General Plan:
         1980 Housing Element
      - Identified the number of housing units needed over the 20-year period between 1980-2000. The
         Element called for an average of 79 affordable units per year between 1980-2000. From 1980-
         1985, the projected need was 89 units per year; between 1985-2000, the figure was revised to
         73-77 units per year;
      - Identified seven vacant sites having the potential for meeting the housing needs indicated for
         low- and moderate-income groups over the 20-year period;
      - Summarized each housing program available;
1
  ABAG’s coordinated Housing Element Planning Period is January 31, 2015 through January 31, 2023.
2
  ABAG’s 5th RHNA Projection Period runs from January 1, 2014 through October 31, 2022 (8.8 years).
                                                       1

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
     - Identified short- and long-term housing goals and programs; and
     - Discussed administration of housing programs.
        1983 Housing Element Supplement
     - Updated information in the 1980 Element. By 1983, the housing situation in the city had
        changed, due to infrastructure and land constraints, as well as approval of the Growth Control
        Ordinance in 1982;
     - Estimated the amount of vacant land available for housing development;
     - Identified Pacifica's fair share housing need, based on Association of Bay Area Governments
        (ABAG) figures. The 1983 ABAG Housing Needs Determinations called for 81 units per year
        to meet growth needs. The number of low- and moderate-income units had been reduced to 45
        units per year from the 73-77 units per year called for in the 1980 General Plan; and,
     - Identified current housing programs available.
        1986 Housing Element
     - Analyzed 1980 Census data, and included a more complete, city-wide vacant land survey;
     - Included 1983 ABAG Regional Fair Share Housing needs; and,
     - Described the most current housing programs available to maintain, improve, and develop
        housing.
        1990 Housing Element
     - Analyzed 1990 Census data; and,
     - Added new Action Programs.
        2007 Housing Element
     - Analyzed 2000 Census data; and,
     - Addressed SB 2 requirements related to site identification and zoning for emergency shelters as
        well as transitional and supportive housing.
The 2014 Housing Element seeks to continue the periodic refinement of the document to address
projected housing needs. Notable changes include updated demographics based on the 2010 Census;
realignment of the planning period to eight years (SB 375); identification of “beneficial impacts” from
                                                     2

action programs (SB 375); assessment of needs of those with developmental disabilities (SB 812); and,
adaptation of housing-related activities to the 2012 dissolution of the City’s Redevelopment Agency
(ABx1 26 and AB 1484).
        A. Public Participation Process
The City of Pacifica developed the 2015-2023 Housing Element with participation from members of
the Pacifica community, as well as housing advocates and other interested parties. As part of the
process to seek public input, staff sent notices to 50 nonprofit housing organizations and service
providers servicing special needs populations, including Bay Area Legal Aid, Center for the
Independence of the Disabled, Center on Homelessness, Community Legal Services, Golden Gate
Regional Center, HIP Housing, InnVision/Shelter Network, Mental Health Association of San Mateo
County, and the San Mateo County Commissions on Aging/Disabilities.
The City convened a study session with the Planning Commission to solicit input from the public on
the City’s housings needs, and to provide the public with an opportunity to shape the City’s housing
goals, policies, and objectives. The study session was publicized in the local print media, the
“Coastal Connection” community event list, the City’s web site, and Nextdoor, Twitter, and
Facebook social media platforms. In conducting outreach for the study session, care was taken to
recruit potential participants that reflect the City’s full ethnic and economic diversity.
A study session is a public meeting for which the City provides public notice, but at which no action
is taken by the Planning Commission. The informal format of a study session encourages planning
commissioners, project proponents, and community members to engage in a vigorous dialogue with
question-and-answer exchanges among all participants. A dozen community members attended the
housing element study session, with nearly all attendees expressing ideas and communicating with
the Commission and fellow community members. The public input focused on the need for more
affordable housing in Pacifica; integrating affordable housing with improved access to public
transportation; focusing future housing development into mixed use sites rather than the few
remaining vacant parcels in the city; and, concerns with specific sites identified in the draft housing
element’s “Potential Housing Development Sites” (Table III-1 in Section III.2).
In response to the public input received, staff revised the draft housing element to address
community concerns where possible. Staff revised Table III-1 containing “Potential Housing
Development Sites” to represent the community’s desire for higher density, mixed use housing near
transit access. The result was the identification of numerous sites clustered primarily around the
Pacific Manor Shopping Center in the northern portion of Pacifica. Existing transit routes within
this neighborhood provide bus service to the area, including connections to the Bay Area Rapid
Transit (BART) system in Colma and Daly City. Furthermore, the underlying commercial land use
designation in the neighborhood allows high-density mixed use housing development. An additional
result of incorporating the newly-identified sites was the ability to remove from Table III-1 the two
sites discussed the most at the Study Session - the “Calson Property” and “Hacienda Court.”
The public participation process continued after the study session phase with a public hearing before
the Planning Commission on April 20, 2015. At the meeting, 13 members of the public provided
comments on various aspects of the draft Housing Element, draft Negative Declaration, and other
                                                      3

matters. A result of the public input was another revision of the housing site land inventories
contained in Tables III-1 and Tables III-2 to remove all sites that were also listed within the City’s
Open Space Task Force Report. Public input also resulted in continuation as ongoing policies two
action programs that staff had proposed for discontinuance.
The final opportunity for public participation was during a public hearing before the City Council on
May 11, 2015. Thirty-six members of the public spoke during the public hearing and several
individuals submitted written comments prior to the meeting. In response to public comments, the
City Council revised the draft Housing Element to add a note to Table IV-1 stating that the 93 units
at Pacific Skies Estates mobile home park are subject to Article 2 of Chapter 1 of Title 9 of the
Pacifica Municipal Code, also known as the Rent Stabilization Regulations, and to add a note in
appropriate locations within the Housing Element Update that the operator of Pacific Skies Estates
mobile home park will continue to replace older mobile homes.
The City provided public notice of all hearings and further encouraged community members and
advocates to attend. After these public discussions and additional revisions based on the public input
received, the City Council adopted the housing element with Resolution No. 13-2015 on May 11,
2015.
         B. Housing Accomplishments: 2007 to 2014
Pacifica’s housing allocation for the 2007-2014 period was 275 units, of which 63 were needed for
Very Low Income households, 45 for Low Income households, 53 for Moderate Income households,
and 114 for Above Moderate Income households. Pacifica met 95 percent of its overall housing need
during the period, approving, building, or constructing 262 housing units. Accomplishment by income
category, however, reflects differing levels of success. The City met all of the need for Above
Moderate Income units; 91 percent of the Moderate Income need; but less than 4 percent of combined
Low and Very Low Income need.
Development of affordable housing was highly challenging during the 2007 to 2014 planning period.
Among other factors, the economic recession during the planning period slowed all types of
development. This in turn limited opportunities to apply inclusionary zoning and housing in-lieu
policies to larger developments in order to create new affordable units. The dissolution of
redevelopment agencies during the planning period also presented new challenges to the financing of
affordable housing projects in the City.
2. The City
Pacifica is located on the Pacific coast side of the San Francisco Peninsula, 13 miles south of downtown
San Francisco, in San Mateo County. Two prominent features frame the city, with the ridges of the
Coast Range to the east and the shoreline of the Pacific Ocean to the west. Pacifica possesses an
attractive combination of secluded valleys and open hillsides set against a coastline of long beaches and
rugged headlands.

Regional access is via State Highways 1 and 35 that, in turn, connect to Interstate Highway 280 and 80,
and US-101. Through the northern half of the City, Highway 1 is a four-lane freeway. South of Sharp
Park Road, the highway becomes a four-lane arterial with uncontrolled access, climbing south of the
City and through the Lantos Tunnels (bypassing the infamous Devil's Slide) to the unincorporated
villages of Montara and Moss Beach.
Originally visited by the Portola expedition in 1769, the area around what is now Pacifica remained
primarily agricultural until after the San Francisco earthquake in 1906. Land speculators, stimulated by
the construction of the Ocean Shore Railroad, subdivided and developed a series of small coast-side
communities. Several of these communities incorporated in 1957 as the City of Pacifica. Despite
incorporating nearly 60 years ago, neighborhood integrity retains special significance in the city.
Although recognizing their interdependence, each of the original communities desires to protect those
characteristics which make them unique. The Neighborhood Map (Figure I-1) shows the various
neighborhoods in the City.

3. Population Characteristics
         A. Population
Rapid residential development occurred in Pacifica during the 1960s, with the 1960 population of
20,995 residents nearly doubling to 36,020 residents by 1970. From the 1970s onward, residential
development tapered off and population increase became more moderate. Despite slowing
residential development, Pacifica’s population peaked more three decades later in 2000 at 38,390
residents. Pacifica’s population, average household size, and median age from the last six decennial
censuses are shown in Table I-1, below:
                                                  TABLE I-1

       Source: US Census Bureau.
       *The U.S. Census from 1960 and 1970 calculated household size using a different
       methodology, making it incomparable to figures from 1980 onward.
Changes in average household size and the age of Pacifica’s residents in recent decades have
contributed to a shift in housing needs. The table above demonstrates how average household size has
steadily decreased since 1980, while median age has increased dramatically during the same period.
The characteristics of Pacifica’s housing stock have also changed in recent decades. In 1970, 87
percent of the City's housing stock was single-family residential; by 2010, this had declined to 77
percent. The majority of apartments and other multi-family housing units have been constructed in the
West Sharp Park, West Edgemar, and Fairmont neighborhoods, although several senior housing
developments have been constructed in other parts of the City. Despite multi-family development
increasing in popularity after 1970, by 2000 all kinds of residential development had leveled-off. Table
I-2 summarizes the rates of residential development in Pacifica since 1960. Between 1990 and 2010,
1,265 housing units were developed in Pacifica (with only 391 from 2000-2010). Compared to 1,146
units from 1980-1989 and more than 3,000 units in each of the three preceding decades, it is apparent
that housing production has slowed tremendously in recent years. While it is difficult to pinpoint the
cause of the dramatic reduction in housing unit production, the increasing scarcity of vacant, buildable
sites in Pacifica is believed to be a significant factor.

To gain a better perspective of Pacifica’s population, it is helpful to compare its various aspects to those
of the broader populations in San Mateo County and statewide. The next several tables and figures
make comparisons across several dimensions.
In 2011, 37,361 people lived in Pacifica, down more than 1,000 residents from a decade earlier.
Pacifica's population was comprised of slightly fewer children and many more seniors than San Mateo
County. Table I-3 summarizes population by age group.

Pacifica’s largest racial group was white persons, who comprised 68 percent of the population in 2011.
The largest minority group was Asian persons, at 19 percent of the population. Filipino and Chinese
persons comprised two-thirds of the city’s Asian population. Black persons accounted for the smallest
share of population of any single-race group at 3 percent. Persons of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, while
not counted by the U.S. Census as a separate racial group, comprised 18 percent of the population (most
of these persons were counted within the “white” racial group). Non-Hispanic whites comprised 55
percent of the population. Table I-5 provides additional information on Pacifica’s racial composition.

        C. Persons with Disabilities
In 2011, 8 percent of Pacificans had one or more diagnosed disabilities, the same rate as San Mateo
County (8 percent). Disabilities include physical and mental disabilities such as deafness, blindness,
immobility, and cognitive challenges, as well as other conditions. As used throughout the housing
element, the term “disability” includes, without limitation, developmental disability. Disabilities can
affect the ability of affected persons to work, live independently, drive, and ride public transportation.
Limitations of this sort can affect the type of housing needed by persons with disabilities. Perhaps most
impactful to housing needs is the ability of persons with disabilities to live independently and to travel
outside the home to work and shop.
The prevalence of disabilities in Pacifica varied widely by age group. The population segment with the
greatest rate of disabilities was persons age 65 years or older, at 28 percent. Among the working age
population 18 to 64 years of age, the disability rate was 5.8 percent. San Mateo County’s respective
rates were 31 percent and 5.0 percent. Information on persons with ambulatory (i.e. mobility), self-care,
independent living, and other disabilities is summarized in Table I-6:

      Note: Some people may have multiple disabilities
A segment of the disabled population with particularly challenging housing needs is those with
developmental disabilities. The California Welfare and Institutions Code describes a developmental
disability to be one that originates prior to adulthood, that continues or can be expected to continue
indefinitely, and that constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. Specific conditions include
intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism, but not disabilities that are solely physical in
nature. Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment; however, more severely disabled individuals require a supervised group living
environment, often with medical care and physical therapy provided on-site. Given the pre-adulthood
onset of developmental disabilities, a primary concern is transitioning a developmentally disabled
person to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The U.S. Census does not track developmental disabilities specifically, meaning the City must estimate
the population with a developmental disability in another way. The State Department of Developmental
Services (DDS) is the lead agency in providing community-based services to approximately 243,000
developmentally disabled persons statewide through a system of 21 regional centers. The Golden Gate
Regional Center provides services within San Mateo, San Francisco, and Marin counties. The
information from the Golden Gate Regional Center in Table I-7 shows the number of Pacificans (ZIP
Code 94044) who received services for a developmental disability in 2014:

San Mateo County is fortunate to have access to a variety of resources to assist persons with
developmental disabilities in addition to the Golden Gate Regional Center. Many of the organizations
work in close partnership with the Regional Center on a referral basis to ensure continuity of care for
developmentally disabled persons. Services of these groups include focusing on job skills to enhance

economic stability, and thereby housing stability, as well as direct housing support through counseling,
advocacy, search assistance, and direct placement into units. The organizations available to Pacifica
residents include the following:
      -    Abilities United: Provides training, education, and support for persons with developmental and
           physical challenges.
      -    The Arc: Provides a range of services relevant to all areas of adult life, from independent living
           supports and skills building to employment training and creative expression.
      -    Poplar ReCare: Provides therapeutic treatment, equipment loan, and other services for those
           with developmental disabilities, illness, or injury.
      -    Puente Clinic: Provides mental health services for developmentally disabled clients by bridging
           resources from San Mateo County Behavioral Health & Recovery Services (BHRS), Golden
           Gate Regional Center (GGRC) and Health Plan of San Mateo (HPSM).
      -    West Bay Housing Corporation: Provides affordable, community-based supportive housing for
           individuals with developmental disabilities and other people with special housing needs.
4. Housing Characteristics
          A. Households and Housing Units
In 2010, there were 13,967 households4 and 14,523 housing units5 in Pacifica. Compared to 2000, these
figures decreased .2 percent and increased 2 percent, respectively. The annualized production of
housing units from 2000 to 2010 was 27 units per year. In effect, Pacifica’s household creation and
housing unit production have remained relatively static. Average household size reduced to 2.65
persons per household in 2010 from 2.73 in 2000, a decrease of 3 percent. This continues a trend of
shrinking household size that started at least as early as 1980. Basic information on households,
housing units, and average household size for Pacifica for 1990, 2000, and 2010 are summarized in
Table I-8.

  The U.S. Census Bureau defines “household” as “all the persons who occupy a housing unit as their usual place of
residence.”
5
  The U.S. Census Bureau defines “housing unit” as “a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a
single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters.” Separate living
quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have
direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person
living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated persons who share living
arrangements. People not living in households are classified as living in group quarters.

Single-family detached housing dominates Pacifica’s housing stock. This housing type comprised 73
percent of housing units in 2011, with another 6.8 percent of units in the single-family attached
category. Combined, approximately 80 percent of the housing stock is single-family. The share of
the housing stock comprised by single-family-type units has increased since 2000, when attached
and detached types were 72 percent and 5.4 percent of the housing stock, respectively. Compared to
San Mateo County, Pacifica has a much greater share of detached single-family housing units. The
County edges out Pacifica in all other housing categories, except that they both have similar shares
of the mobile home housing type. Table I-9 summarizes Pacifica’s housing types.

Pacifica’s predominately single-family housing stock has contributed to high rates of home
ownership. Owner-occupied housing units accounted for 69 percent of the housing stock in 2011, a
rate that held steady since 2000 and which is 10 percent greater than in San Mateo County. Vacancy
rates in Pacifica in 2011 were very low, with the homeowner vacancy rate at 1.5 percent and the
rental vacancy rate at 2.4 percent6. Vacancy rates in each category increased since 2000.
6
  The U.S. Census Bureau considers a housing unit as vacant if no one is living in it at the time of the Census interview,
unless its occupants are only temporarily absent. In addition, a vacant unit may be one which is entirely occupied by
persons who have a usual residence elsewhere. New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if
construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place.

Homeowner vacancy was comparable to San Mateo County, although rental vacancy was almost-
half of the County’s rate. It is generally accepted that an overall vacancy rate of 4 percent is needed to
provide for normal turnover in housing units, which means Pacifica was experiencing an insufficient
supply of housing. Table I-10 summarizes vacancy rates for Pacifica, San Mateo County, and the
State of California.

          B. Income
Pacifica’s residents enjoy greater household incomes than those in San Mateo County as a whole.
Median household income in Pacifica in 2011 was 4.7 percent higher than in the County as a whole.
Nearly half of all households earned $100,000 or more per year, and there were also fewer Pacifica
households at the lowest income levels than in the County. Household income characteristics,
summarized in Table I-11, contribute to the particular housing needs of the City’s population.

The poverty threshold income as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau is another measure commonly
used to assess income levels of a given population. The Census Bureau establishes poverty-level
income based on family size, and for 2011 the level ranged from $10,788 for an individual over 65
years of age with no dependent children to $43,487 for a family with eight or more children. Poverty
threshold amounts are set nationally, and the Census Bureau does not adjust them for variations in cost
of living throughout the country. The overall poverty rate for families in Pacifica in 2011 was 1.9
percent, less than half the rate for San Mateo County. The lowest observed rate among various family
groups was for married couples at 0.2 percent. The highest rate was for families headed by a female
with no husband present, at 7.7 percent. Across all family categories, the presence of children under 18
years of age dramatically increased family poverty rates.
The Census Bureau also calculates poverty rates for individuals by age. The overall individual poverty
rate in Pacifica was 4 percent. The highest observed poverty rate was for working age individuals from
18 to 64 years old at 4.7 percent. The poverty rate for persons 65 years of age and older was 2.7
percent. All poverty rates for Pacifica were noticeably lower than corresponding rates for San Mateo
County, as shown in Table I-13.

In January 2014, San Mateo County Housing Authority indicated that 4,416 households countywide
received housing assistance either through vouchers or by direct placement into public housing units.
Within Pacifica, 208 residents received housing assistance, all of them through vouchers.
        C. Housing Costs
Housing costs in Pacifica, as in much of the Bay Area, tend to be higher than California as a whole.
Pacifica is a costly place to live for homeowners and renters alike. Given the predominance of single-
family housing among Pacifica’s housing stock and the high rates of homeownership, the prices of
single-family homes have a significant effect on housing affordability. Table I-14 lists median home
sale prices for detached and attached single-family units from 2005 through 2012.

The table shows that detached single-family housing in Pacifica tends to be 40 to 70 percent more
expensive than elsewhere in the State but 10 to 20 percent less expensive than San Mateo County.

Attached single-family housing in Pacifica tends to be 15 to 20 percent more expensive than elsewhere
in the State but 10 to 15 percent less expensive than elsewhere in the County.
The cost of rental housing is also an important factor in housing affordability in Pacifica. Lower “costs
of entry” to rental housing as compared to ownership units makes it a vital source of housing for those
with lower incomes, which can include single heads of household with children, young professionals, or
senior citizens. Table I-15 shows average rents for a variety of unit types in Pacifica from 2005 through
2013, and Table I-16 compares average rents in Pacifica to those in San Mateo County.

The tables show that, with the exception of studio rental units, rental housing in Pacifica was less
expensive than in San Mateo County. Rents for one- and two-bedroom units in Pacifica in 2013 were
approximately 10% less expensive than those elsewhere in the County. However, with both ownership
and rental units, affordability depends on income, and it is important to assess household housing costs
from that perspective. Housing cost burden, or overpayment, will be discussed later in this document.

        D. Household Characteristics
The make-up and size of households can have an important influence on the type of housing units
needed and desired within a community. In 2011, Pacifica’s most common household type was the
family with no children, which comprised 41 percent of households. The least common household type
was multi-person, nonfamily, at 7 percent. Table I-17 summarizes Pacifica’s household types in
relation to San Mateo County and State households.

                   Source: 2009-2011 American Community Survey
The composition of Pacifica’s households has changed in recent years. In 2000, single-person
households made up 16 percent of the City's households. Only 31 percent of households were families
without children, and 32 percent of households had children.

II. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
1. Purpose
The housing needs assessment summarizes the specific types of housing needed by various populations
within Pacifica. Data and housing issues are discussed and analyzed, and housing needs are quantified
wherever possible. The Community Profile (Section I) provides background information for these
housing needs.
State housing law, in Government Code Sections 65583(a)(1)-(9), requires that a housing element shall
consist of “an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs," which includes:
        Analysis of population and employment trends and documentation of projections;
        Analysis and documentation of household and housing characteristics;
        Analysis of any special housing needs, such as those of the elderly, persons with disabilities,
         large families, farmworkers, families with female heads of household, and families and persons
         in need of emergency shelter;
        Identification of at least one zone where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use;
        Analysis of potential and actual governmental and nongovernmental constraints upon the
         maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels and for persons
         with disabilities;
        Analysis of existing assisted housing developments that are eligible to change from low-
         income housing uses during the next 10 years due to certain conditions.
        Analysis of opportunities for energy conservation with respect to residential development; and,
        Inventory of land suitable for residential development and an analysis of the relationship of
         zoning and public facilities and services to these sites;
The following analysis satisfies the requirements outlined above.
2. Population Trends and Projections
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) has estimated Pacifica's future population growth
in its publication "Projections 2009." ABAG expects the City's population to increase 6 percent from
2010 to 2020 and 1 percent from 2020 to 2030. Both growth rates are significantly lower than those
projected for San Mateo County. Table II-1 demonstrates population growth from 1990 through 2030
(projected), and compares Pacifica to San Mateo County and the State of California.

Pacifica will trail growth in San Mateo County by an even greater percentage than in population
growth. Table II-2 shows these projected figures.

Pacifica's projected low growth rate may be attributable to certain governmental and nongovernmental
constraints, as this document will discuss later in this section.
3. Employment Trends and Projections
Pacifica is primarily a residential community, and contained nearly three-times more employed
residents than jobs in 2010. Despite the existing imbalance, employment growth increased at a faster
rate than population growth between 2000 and 2010. Job growth increased 14 percent with the addition
of 780 jobs, while population growth was -3 percent with a loss of 1,156 residents over the same period.
Relative to San Mateo County, Pacifica’s job growth was positive compared to a 10 percent contraction
countywide.

 In 2011, there were 30,807 persons of working age (16 years and over) in Pacifica, 21,582 of which
 were in the labor force (70 percent). Of those in the labor force, the unemployment rate was 6.7
 percent.7 Pacifica’s unemployment rate was slightly higher than San Mateo County’s (6.0 percent) but
 lower than California’s (7.7 percent). Table II-3 displays historical and 2025 projected figures for jobs
 and employment in Pacifica.8 The 2025 projection of a reduction in employed residents may be
 attributable to the aging of Pacifica’s population as many residents will leave the workforce during that
 timeframe. Still, it appears Pacifica will benefit from strong job growth through 2025, providing greater
 employment opportunities for residents.

 Pacifica has few major employers. Employment is greatest in education, government, and food
 retailing. Table II-4 summarizes Pacifica’s largest employers in 2013.

   Unemployment data from 2011 were provided for consistency with other statistics in the housing element. However,
 by 2013 the Pacifica economy had improved to 22,082 residents in the labor force with an unemployment rate of 4.2
 percent.

   Employment figures may vary somewhat between the narrative and the table due to the former’s reliance on U.S.
 Census Bureau 2009-2011 American Community Survey data and the latter’s reliance on ABAG Projections 2009 data.

Clearly, Pacifica’s residents have access to jobs not only within the city, but also jobs in large
employment centers throughout the Bay Area. Employers outside of Pacifica represent a broader
variety of sectors than those found in the city. Table II-5 provides a more compressive depiction of the
San Mateo County and Bay Area job market, including employment projections through 2025.

   Note: Employment data includes jobs within the jurisdictional sphere of influence
Major Bay Area employment sectors in 2010 included Health, Educational and Recreational Services,
and Financial and Professional Services. The greatest regional employment growth projected by
ABAG is in Health, Educational and Recreational Services. In Pacifica, ABAG projects the greatest
growth in Financial and Professional Services.

4. Household and Housing Characteristics
        A. Income
In 2011, median household income in Pacifica was $96,289. Household income increased by 2.1
percent over the 2000 figure of $94,300. When adjusted for inflation, however, real household income
decreased by 22 percent during this period. Shrinking purchasing power can pose a serious challenge
for individuals and families seeking quality, affordable housing, especially in the expensive Bay Area
housing market. Still, Pacifica’s households had 4.7 percent higher household income compared to San
Mateo County households, which in 2011 had a median household income of $91,958. This is a
significant change from 2000, when Pacifica’s household income trailed San Mateo County by 17
percent.
Median income is a helpful measure to demonstrate community-wide economic strength. Yet, it does
not provide a complete picture of the earnings of different subsets of the population. For instance,
Table II-6 demonstrates income levels of seniors in Pacifica.
                                                TABLE II-6

More than two-thirds of seniors had incomes below the Pacifica median household income level in
2011. Lower incomes can present challenges to finding adequate, affordable housing for seniors,
especially at market rate. Considering the growing proportion of Pacifica’s population comprised by
seniors, these figures demonstrate the importance of understanding housing needs of this key population
segment. There are likely other segments of Pacifica’s population, such as persons with disabilities or
female-headed households, which require special housing considerations.
        B. Housing Costs
Pacifica’s median single-family detached home sale price in 2011 was $527,638. Attached single-
family homes had a median sale price of $314,363. These sales prices were 24 percent and 31 percent
lower than San Mateo County, respectively. Pacifica is fortunate to enjoy a more affordable housing
stock than in nearby communities.

Overpayment
Affordability is a relative concept, not an absolute one. Affordability is relative not only to surrounding
communities, but also to resident income. Overpayment for housing involves a household paying more
than 30 percent of its gross income on housing expenses. Table II-7 shows the number of Pacifica
households that overpaid for housing in 2011, and the proportion of each income group that overpaid.

             Note: Excludes Households with no income or cash rent.
 Of the 14,061 total households in Pacifica in 2011 (Table I-16), 42 percent overpaid for housing.
Those with the lowest household incomes were the most likely to over pay for housing, although 40
percent of those in the highest income category still overpaid. The figures in the table are indicative of
the high expense of housing in Pacifica relative to household income.
Another helpful way to assess housing affordability is to view the “amount” of housing a household can
afford, both in terms of purchase price and monthly rent. Tables II-8 and II-9 demonstrate the
maximum purchase price and monthly rent affordable to persons of various income levels from
Extremely Low (30 percent of County median) to Moderate (120 percent of County median) income. A
median price detached home in Pacifica was unaffordable to households at all income levels except
those well above Moderate income. A median price attached home was affordable only to those
slightly above Moderate income.

Overcrowding
Overcrowding is typically defined as more than one person per room, based on the Census Bureau’s
definition of “room,” which excludes bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyers, halls, or half-rooms.
Severe overcrowding occurs when there are more than 1.5 persons per room. Overcrowding can
result when there are not enough adequately sized units within a community, or when high housing
costs relative to income force too many individuals or families to share housing.
In 2011, there were 282 overcrowded households in Pacifica. These comprised 2.0 percent of total
households. Overcrowding was worse for owner-occupied households, where the rate of
                                                                27

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
overcrowding was four times greater than in renter households. Pacifica had no “extremely”
overcrowded households. Rates of overcrowding in Pacifica were substantially lower than
elsewhere in San Mateo County, where rates of overcrowding among owner-occupied and renter
households reached 4 percent and 13 percent, respectively.

        C. Rehabilitation
Pacifica has a relatively old housing stock (see Table II-11). In 2011, more than one-third of homes had
been built more than 50 years ago and nearly two-thirds had been built more than 40 years ago. The last
period of major residential construction was in the 1970s, when 22 percent of houses were built. By
comparison, within the last 30 years, only 16 percent of the housing stock had been constructed. The
advancing age of the housing stock means ongoing rehabilitation and preventative maintenance will be
necessary to maintain homes in a habitable condition.

Homes in Pacifica are exposed to more extreme weather than elsewhere in the Bay Area. Strong winds,
near-constant exposure to salty air, and frequent heavy rains during the winter months (in non-drought
years) combine to degrade paint, rust metal objects, and blow away roof shingles. Frequent
maintenance and repairs are necessary, especially for houses west of Highway 1. Neighborhoods where
homes are the oldest and rehabilitation needs are greatest include Sharp Park, Pacific Manor, Edgemar,
Pedro Point, Fairmont and Vallemar.

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
Yet, despite the harsh weather conditions and aging nature, Pacifica’s housing stock remains in good
condition. The Building Official and Code Enforcement Officer, who frequently inspect residential
properties, estimate that no more than 2 percent, or 291, of Pacifica’s 14,577 housing units require
rehabilitation. Still, rehabilitation of homes that do become distressed is important to preserve their
viability as housing choices and to sustain neighborhood attractiveness.
5. Regional Housing Needs
The State of California, Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), and local governments
determine each locality’s share of regional housing needs through a process known as the Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). The RHNA allocations set housing production goals for the
planning period that runs from January 31, 2015, through January 31, 2023, using a “fair share”
approach. The approach is based mainly on projected household and employment growth.
San Mateo County benefits from the ability to more precisely allocate planned housing units among the
21 local jurisdictions (20 cities/towns and unincorporated San Mateo County). Through the creation of
a subregion – known as the City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG) – local governments
were able to exercise more control over the allocation process. Those jurisdictions with a higher
likelihood or ability to accommodate more housing units received a greater allocation, while others with
limited development capacity received a lower allocation.
Overall, ABAG has determined that the Bay Area region must plan for 187,990 new housing units
during the planning period. Of those, San Mateo County must plan for 16,418 units, and Pacifica must
plan for 413 units. Table II-12 shows the income categories for which Pacifica must plan.

The table depicts planning requirements for housing units affordable to a range of income levels. In
practical terms, it means a mix of housing types may be necessary to meet future housing needs, to
include low-density single-family housing and higher-density housing in mixed-use developments.

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
Unmet Need During Past Planning Period (2007-2014)
The City of Pacifica had an adjusted RHNA of 115 housing units for the 2007-2014 planning period
(revised downward from 275 units, to reflect units constructed prior to the late adoption of the 2007-
2014 Housing Element in 2012). Subsequent to 2007 Housing Element adoption, the City approved 10
total units. When combined with the 195 units approved prior to 2007 Housing Element adoption but
during the planning period, the City ultimately met 75 percent of its original 275-unit allocation. Table
II-13 demonstrates the income-level breakdown of approved units, as well as unmet housing needs.
ABAG did not carry forward Pacifica’s unmet housing needs from the 2007-2014 planning period into
the City’s total allocation for the 2014-2022 planning period. The allocation for the 2014-2022 period
is based upon new analysis of regional growth projections.

Section III “Land Inventory,” found later in the Housing Element, analyzes land in the City to
determine sites suitable for housing unit construction. The Land Inventory will assess whether adequate
sites exist to meet the RHNA for the current planning period.
6. Special Housing Needs
        A. Large Families
The Census Bureau defines “large family households” as households containing five or more
persons. Due to the limited supply of adequately sized units to accommodate large family
households, large families face above-average difficulty in locating adequately-sized, affordable
housing. The lack of supply, compounded with incomes stretched thin by the greater needs of large

In 2011, 9.5 percent of Pacifica's households had five or more persons. Fewer large family households
live in Pacifica than in either San Mateo County or statewide. Fortunately, reported overcrowding does
not appear to be widespread in the City (Table II-10). Yet, it is apparent large family households are
facing challenges finding appropriate housing in light of Pacifica’s existing housing stock.
Table II-15 shows the number of bedrooms per housing unit in the City. Only 3 percent of units have
five or more bedrooms, although nearly 10 percent of households have more than five members.
Despite low reported levels of overcrowding, large families must be using large areas of housing units
for sleeping purposes. Doing so is unfortunate, as it denies them optimal use of their housing, which
should include open areas for relaxation or recreation (living rooms, offices, etc.).

         B. Single Parent Households
Single-parent households frequently have lower incomes and higher living expenses than dual-head
households. Lower incomes make the search for adequate, affordable housing more important, but
also more difficult. Single-parent households also need convenient access to other support services to
assist with their parenting responsibilities while balancing employment, such as childcare, recreation
programs, proximity to public transit, and other social services. These needs influence their housing
decisions and should shape future housing developments in Pacifica.

In 2011, a single parent headed 7.2 percent of Pacifica households, as shown in Table II-16. Single-
parent households were more than twice as likely to be female-headed. These figures were higher than
in San Mateo County but lower than elsewhere in the State.

           Male-headed, no wife                                    301      2.1%    1.8%       2.7%
       Total Households                                         14,061      100% 256,305 12,433,049
       Source: 2009-2011 American Community Survey, Table DP02
Income levels of single-parent households are also of critical importance when considering housing
needs. Single parents must provide for themselves and for their children on one income, stressing their
abilities to afford housing. The poverty rate in Pacifica in 2011 for female-headed households with
children was 12 percent, as compared to 0.6 percent for married households with children. Comparable
figures for male-headed single-parent households were unavailable.
To address both the housing needs and the supportive service needs of single-parent households, the
City may consider encouraging development of additional multi-family housing units with integrated
child care facilities.
         C. Seniors
The 2010 U.S. Census found that 12.1 percent of Pacifica’s population was age 65 years or older, up
from 9.7 percent in the 2000 Census. The number of seniors as a percentage of the total population
is expected to continue increasing due to the aging of the "Baby Boom" generation, lower birth rates,
and extended life expectancies. San Mateo County’s share of population over 65 years is higher
than Pacifica’s, although Pacifica has a higher median age – 41.5 years – than both the County and
the State. Table II-17 shows comparative figures for Pacifica, San Mateo County, and California.

Seniors comprised the largest group in Pacifica with special housing needs in 2011. There were
4,519 residents 65 years of age or older and demographic trends suggest this segment of the
population will continue to grow. The growing senior population has distinct housing needs,
considering seniors are more likely than the general population to have one or more disabilities
(Section I.3.C) and to have lower incomes (Tables II-6, II-18, and II-19). In fact, some seniors
subsist on Social Security income alone. The average pension under this program in 2013 was
$1,294 monthly ($15,528 annually). For a family of two, each receiving his or her own pension, an
annual income of $31,056 would result in the household being considered to have Very Low
income. The situation is more acute for a senior living alone, as he or she would be considered to
have Extremely Low income. It is apparent then that the combination of disabilities and low
incomes present unique challenges to seniors searching for accessible, affordable housing.

Housing choices for seniors are further complicated by their homeownership status. As shown in
Table II-20, 69 percent of Pacifica households own their homes. Among the senior population,
however, that figure is 87 percent. The incredibly high homeownership rate for seniors provides
both opportunities and risks as they age. Having a large asset such as a home can help to provide the
financial means for a senior to pursue alternative housing, whether by downsizing to a home
requiring less maintenance or to an assisted living facility that provides for their daily needs. Yet,
many seniors are reluctant to sell the homes they have owned and lived in for years. And retrofitting
single-family homes to be accessible to persons with disabilities can be complex and costly. The
result is that many seniors are not living in housing optimized to the needs they have later in life.

related challenges are greatest for those in the lowest defined income category, Extremely Low. The
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) defines “Extremely Low”
income as household income at or below 30 percent of County median. The threshold values vary
by family size from one to eight members. In San Mateo County, that ranges from $23,750 for an
individual to $44,800 for a family of eight (see Table I-12). For the purposes of this section, the
analysis will rely upon the threshold value for a family of four, $33,950.
Households with Extremely Low income (ELI) encompass those in many different life situations.
This includes households with one or more full-time wage earners. A person working a full-time,
2,080 hour-per-year job earning an $8.00 hourly wage (the 2011 California minimum wage) would
earn $16,640 annually, well below the ELI level. Even with two minimum wage incomes, a family
of four would still have ELI.
Available household income statistics do not categorize household income to align precisely with
HCD income levels. However, the income data in Table I-12 approximate the ELI level for a family
of four. Using this rough measure, as many as 1,968 Pacifica households have ELI, representing 14
percent of total households. The same rough measure, based on the data in Table II-7, demonstrates
that as many as 63 percent of homeowner and 94 percent of renter households with ELI overpay for
housing (1,524 total households). These figures, especially for households that rent, demonstrate the
acute need for housing affordable to those with ELI.
        E. Families and Persons in Need of Emergency Shelters
Many groups in Pacifica have ongoing special needs, but none are more urgent than the needs of
families and persons who are homeless or in immediate risk of becoming homeless. Government
Code Section 65583(a)(7) requires cities to provide an analysis of these needs in order to plan for
appropriate shelter. Measuring the scale of the homeless population has historically been very
difficult as it tends to be transient and strives to remain unseen (and thus, undisturbed). In response,
the County of San Mateo spearheads an annual Homeless Census and Survey to attempt to obtain a
maximum count of the County’s homeless population. An accurate count is a prerequisite to
marshalling resources appropriate for the problem.
The 2013 San Mateo County Homeless Census and Survey found there were 2,281 homeless persons
in San Mateo County. The number of homeless counted increased by 217, or 11 percent, since 2007.
Within Pacifica, census takers identified 150 homeless persons, all of whom were unsheltered.
Table II-21 lists the various locations where census takers found homeless (based on countywide
figures). The most common location was on the street, followed by a car, recreational vehicle (RV),
or encampment. These locations accounted for more than half of the homeless population identified.
Around 34 percent were found in a shelter or transitional housing, while the remaining 13 percent
were institutionalized (hospital, jail, or substance abuse treatment). Using an annualization formula
the Census and Survey estimated there were 6,737 homeless persons in San Mateo County in 2013.

The demographics of homelessness in San Mateo County show that there are certain characteristics
commonly associated with the homeless. Table II-22 shows several categories including marital
status, gender, race, and others. Nearly all homeless identified in the County were single male
adults, white, non-veteran, and suffering from one or more incapacities such as alcohol/drug
addiction, disability, and physical/mental illness.

The complexity of the individual situations of homeless persons makes providing shelter and support
services all the more difficult. Providing a place to sleep is but one part of the solution, along with
physical and psychological treatment programs. Homeless families with children and homeless,
unaccompanied children are among the neediest categories. Additional support services are needed
to help children cope with the mental and other stigmas associated with homelessness. The County

Census and Survey found many instances of homelessness involving children, as summarized in
Table II-23. Fortunately, all homeless children without parents had been sheltered, but sadly, many
families with children remained without proper shelter (all but one “adults with children” household
were found in cars or RVs, and none were found in encampments).

The City of Pacifica has strived to expand shelter opportunities for homeless families and persons. To
that end, it has removed any zoning obstacles to establishment of emergency shelters in several zoning
districts. The Pacifica Municipal Code in Title 9 “Planning and Zoning” permits by-right in all
residential districts “special care facilities” for up to six persons. A special care facility includes
“twenty four (24) hour shelters for victims of family violence, homeless persons, or other need
categories” (PMC Section 9-4.273.1). Residential zones are inherently suitable for establishment of
small shelters due to the wide availability of existing structures available for conversion to shelter use.
There are also sufficient undeveloped areas with residential zoning that could accommodate new
construction of a shelter. The clean, quiet, and safe character of Pacifica’s residential neighborhoods
also provides a welcoming environment to those in need of emergency shelter.
Any special care facility seeking to open in any residential zoning district would simply need to comply
with the objective development standards for residential construction. Residential development
standards regulate physical aspects of development such as setbacks, height, lot coverage, landscaping,
and off-street parking, and there is no public notice requirement. Notwithstanding the City’s zoning,
however, special care facilities proposed for construction within the Coastal Zone Appeals Zone would
still require a discretionary Coastal Development Permit under the Coastal Act (see PMC Title 9,
Article 43 “Coast Zone Combining District). Additionally, certain additions to a single-family
residential structure resulting in floor area over 2,800 square feet, or additions increasing floor area by
50 percent or more in certain residential zoning districts, would require issuance of a discretionary Site
Development Permit.9 Special care facilities for more than six persons in a residential zone, and any
special care facility in a commercial zone, must obtain a discretionary conditional use permit.
According to the San Mateo County Human Services Agency, there were a total of 1,258 shelter
beds in the County in 2010, the most recent year for which data were available. This figure includes
agencies that are not a part of the County of San Mateo such as Samaritan House, Shelter Network,
9
  The residential districts subjected to the 50 percent floor area threshold by Pacifica Municipal Code Title 9, Article 32
“Site Development Permit” are R-1-H, R-3, R-3.1, R-3-G, R-3/L.D., and R-5.
                                                               37

and Telecare, among others. Of the 1,258 beds, 142 were in emergency shelters, 660 were in
transitional shelters, and 456 were in permanent supportive housing.
An insufficient number of shelter beds exist in Pacifica to accommodate the number of homeless
observed during the 2013 count. By applying the County’s annualization formula to Pacifica’s 2013
count, there were an estimated 469 homeless in the City in 2013. The annualization formula also
estimates the number of individuals that became homeless within the last seven days, which was 10
persons based on Pacifica’s overall count. The “last seven-day” figure should serve as a minimum
figure for determining the number of emergency shelter beds needed in the City. Ultimately, at least
150 emergency shelter beds should be available to accommodate actual need by all homeless
individuals on any night. Using these figures, it is next important to estimate the specific needs of these
homeless groups in order to provide appropriate shelter and services. Applying countywide
demographics of the unsheltered homeless population to the number of persons needing shelter within
Pacifica, Table II-24 shows specific needs.10

Other, non-shelter resources exist in Pacifica to help families and persons experiencing or at-risk of
homelessness. The Pacifica Resource Center provides families and individuals with shelter referral,
housing assistance, food, clothing and other information and on available services. Shelter referral
requires a screening interview at the Resource Center and an intensive interview at the shelter site
before acceptance. The Pacifica Resource Center also provides referrals to Communities
Overcoming Relationship Abuse (CORA), which provides emergency shelter for battered women.

         F. Transitional and Supportive Housing
Transitional and supportive housing are two important links in the continuum of care for homeless
families and persons. Emergency shelters provide immediate relief from the jarring impacts of
sudden homelessness, but transitional and supportive housing provide the basis for long-term
improvement in the situations of the homeless. Transitional housing is rental-type housing that
allows residency for not less than six months, but that ultimately requires the termination of
assistance and recirculation of the unit to another eligible recipient. Supportive housing provides
long-term residency with no limit on length of stay for target populations, and links the target
populations to on- or off-site services that improve health or enhance their ability to live and work in
the community. The target populations for supportive housing are those suffering from mental
illness, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS),
substance abuse, or other chronic health conditions, or individuals eligible for services provided
under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act.
Senate Bill 2 (SB 2), enacted in 2007, expanded protections for transitional and supportive housing
from local zoning discrimination. Pursuant to SB 2, the City must explicitly permit transitional and
supportive housing and apply development standards to these uses in an identical fashion as applied
to other residential uses in the same zone. The City of Pacifica has yet to amend its zoning
ordinance to explicitly permit by-right these uses in residential zoning districts, but the City is aware
of SB 2’s requirements and will process any application for a transitional or supportive housing
facility in accordance with state law. The City also will amend its zoning code within one year of
adoption of the housing element in order to comply with SB 2, as described in an action program.
         G. Persons with Disabilities
A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life
activities. Persons with disabilities in Pacifica face unique problems in obtaining adequate and
affordable housing. This segment of the population, which includes individuals with mental,
physical, and developmental disabilities, needs affordable, conveniently-located housing which is
near supportive services and which is adapted to special needs, such as wheelchair accessibility.
In 2011, 7.6 percent of Pacifica’s residents, or 2,849 persons, experienced a disability of some sort
(Table I-6). The single largest category of disabilities was ambulatory disability. Ambulatory
disabilities limit or restrict one’s ability to walk, significantly affecting the suitability of many housing
options. Many individuals experienced multiple disabilities, compounding the challenges to finding
appropriate housing. Living arrangements for persons with disabilities depend on the severity of
their disabilities. Independent living, or mostly independent living with limited assistance from
family members, are options for some persons with disabilities. Others, including those with severe
developmental disabilities, require dedicated caregivers and housing with special design features to
accommodate a specific disability or combination of disabilities. A common example is wheelchair
accessible housing, which might include a single-story residence without interior level changes; or,
apartment housing with an elevator, wide hallways and doorways, and other design factors that
enable full wheelchair mobility throughout. Additionally, certain disabilities – or even the costs of
owning a specially-equipped automobile – make it impossible to drive. In such cases, housing
proximate to public transportation is important.
                                                       39

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
Persons with disabilities face heightened challenges with securing adequate, affordable housing. In
addition to the special requirements of the built environment briefly discussed above, there are
significant financial challenges, as well. The majority of persons with disabilities live on incomes
that are significantly lower than the non-disabled population. Many disabled individuals live on a
small fixed income which severely limits their ability to pay for housing. Table II-25 demonstrates
that in 2011 the annual earnings of persons with disabilities were 31 percent lower than persons
without disabilities. For females with disabilities, the situation was even more challenging. They
earned 25 percent less than males with disabilities, and 41 percent less than the non-disabled
population overall.

Employment is also a challenge for persons with disabilities. Table II-26 demonstrates the
employment status in 2011 for those aged 18-64 years, with and without disabilities. Persons with
disabilities were employed at less than half the rate as those with no disabilities. Unemployment
was also higher among persons with disabilities, but not substantially greater.

                Percentages are of total population subsets in Pacifica, as follows: Aged 18-64 years –
                Disability (1,481 persons); and, No Disability (23,986 persons)
The greatest difference between the disabled and non-disabled working age populations, however,
was among those not in the labor force. Persons with disabilities were nearly four times as likely not
to be in the labor force, meaning they were either unable to work or not seeking employment. This
much higher rate reflects the economic disadvantage faced by persons with disabilities, which
                                                               40

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
translates into additional difficulty finding suitable housing. Accordingly, housing affordability at
all income levels is a major consideration for the disabled population.
A large proportion of disabled persons are also seniors. Forty-two percent of those with disabilities
in Pacifica, or 1,195 persons, were aged 65 years or above in 2011. The multi-faceted nature of
housing needs for this population presents many challenges, but also a unique opportunity. By
providing adequate and affordable senior housing, with design features and support services suitable
to persons with a variety of disabilities, the City can meet the housing requirements of two or more
special needs categories. Due to the unique opportunity it presents, the City may consider making
affordable senior housing a priority for future housing development in order to make the most of
scarce building sites.
The State Department of Social Services Community Care Licensing Division indicated that in 2014,
there were four adult residential facilities in Pacifica that provided 24-hour non-medical care for
adults aged 18-59 years who were unable to provide for their own daily needs. These four facilities
provided capacity for 28 adults. Consistent with State law, group homes such as these (known under
the City’s zoning regulations as “special care facilities”) with six or fewer residents per facility are
allowed by right in all residential zones. The City may allow special care facilities with more than six
residents in residential and commercial zoning districts with the approval of a Conditional Use Permit.
The purpose of a Conditional Use Permit is to establish a procedure for approving or denying land uses
that are not automatically permitted because of their unique nature. The City can approve a unique land
use if its effect on the surrounding environment is found to be acceptable through the application of
conditions of approval. Several findings need to be made to approve a Conditional Use Permit,
including that the proposed use will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental
to the health, safety, and welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood or to the general
welfare and that it will be consistent with the applicable provisions of the General Plan and other
applicable laws of the City and, where applicable, the local Coastal Plan, and where applicable that the
use is consistent with the City's adopted Design Guidelines.
Other appropriate housing for persons with disabilities includes very low cost units in large group
home settings; supervised apartment settings with on- or off-site support services; outpatient/day
treatment programs; inpatient/day treatment programs; crisis shelters; and, transitional housing.
Ideally, these housing types would be near retail services and public transit. The age of Pacifica’s
housing stock, with much of it built prior to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,
unfortunately complicates locating accessible housing within existing structures. Often times,
expensive upgrades are necessary to make housing accessible for persons with a variety of
disabilities. Fortunately, Federal and State law now require that all multi-family residential
construction projects containing five or more dwelling units be accessible and adaptable to disabled
persons. This means any new multi-family housing projects should be more suitable for conversion to
housing for disabled persons.
The City ensures that new housing developments comply with California building standards in the
California Building Code (Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations), including disabled
accessibility requirements. The City also works with applicants who wish to retrofit their single- or
multi-family residences to make them suitable for persons with disabilities and to ensure that
application of the building code requirements does not create a constraint. There are no identified
                                                    41

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
zoning or other land use regulation practices that could discriminate against persons with disabilities
and impede the availability of such housing for this special segment of the population. In fact, the
City’s regulations encourage production of housing for persons with disabilities. Projects that provide
housing for persons with disabilities in accordance with the City’s Density Bonus Program are entitled
to a reduction of planning application fees and certain other incentives, including greater allowable unit
density.
Additionally, the City of Pacifica's Zoning Ordinance allows second units constructed on single-family
properties to be larger than standard size if they are designed to be accessible to persons with
disabilities. The standard second unit size limitation is 750 square feet. Accessible units may measure
up to 850 square feet. Zoning allows second units in the R-1(Single-Family Residential) zoning district
on lots measuring at least 5,000 square feet. Other development standards also apply, but in many cases
it is possible to construct a second unit accessible to disabled persons with a building permit application
only, without undergoing a discretionary review process.
In order to explicitly communicate its support for housing retrofits that expand accessibility for persons
with disabilities, the City will undertake an action program to adopt a reasonable accommodation policy
and procedures. Reasonable accommodation policies provide a formal mechanism to waive local
zoning standards that might otherwise inhibit the construction of access-related architectural features.
For instance, a minimum front setback of 15 feet might prohibit construction of a wheelchair ramp to
provide access to a front door. By following the reasonable accommodation procedure, a property
owner or resident can petition the City for waiver of the setback requirement, and can also appeal any
adverse decisions by City staff.
         H. Farm Workers
Farm workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Farm workers are generally considered to have special
housing needs due to their limited income and the often unstable nature of their employment.
Traditional leases for rental property can be a barrier for farm workers to access adequate, affordable
housing. Lower incomes make it difficult for them to qualify for leases, and the mobility they
require to pursue work in different regions limits makes it difficult for them to commit to typical
long-term leases.
The housing needs of farm workers are many throughout the state, but in Pacifica there is little need for
farmworker housing. Pacifica is an urbanized area of San Mateo County and does not have any
working farms. In 2011, U.S. Census data found that only 70 residents worked in agriculture, forestry,
fishing, hunting, and mining. The figure increased from 23 residents in 2000, but remains a very small
segment of the population.
The City has several parcels of land zoned for agriculture use, but none of those parcels are being
actively used for agriculture purposes. Should agricultural employment increase during the planning
period and a need for farmworker housing arise, it will be possible to accommodate the need. The
City’s A (Agricultural) zoning district allows ranch and farm dwellings appurtenant to the agricultural
district without a Use Permit or Site Development Permit. These dwellings could house a small number
of workers depending on the size of the farm. Larger agriculture operations requiring more housing,
                                                      42

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
such as a labor camp, could construct farmworker housing consisting of no more than 36 beds in a
group quarters or 12 units or spaces designed for use by a single family or household without issuance
of a Conditional Use Permit, in accordance with Health and Safety (H&S) Code Section 17021.6.
Development of larger farmworker housing developments is permissible subject to approval of a
Conditional Use Permit and Site Development Permit. Within the Coastal Zone, all housing
developments would require a Coastal Development Permit.
Residential zones provide another alternative for lower-cost farmworker housing. In all residential
zones, farmworker housing for six or fewer employees is permissible subject to development standards
applicable to other single-family housing in the same zone, in accordance with H&S Code Section
17021.6. The R-3 (Multiple-Family Residential) zoning district further allows rooming houses and
boarding houses for more than six farm workers upon approval of a Conditional Use Permit and Site
Development Permit. Sites located within the Coastal Zone would require approval of a Coastal
Development Permit for any residential development.
The City has yet to amend its zoning code to explicitly permit by-right the types of housing described in
H&S Code Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6, but will process any application in accordance with state
law. It will consider an action program amending all residential zones and the A zone to comply with
these provisions.
7. Constraints Upon Housing Maintenance, Improvement, and Development
State housing element law requires local agencies to analyze actual and potential constraints upon the
maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels. The following section
discusses governmental, nongovernmental, and environmental constraints affecting housing in Pacifica.
         A. Governmental Constraints
Several actual and potential constraints upon housing maintenance, improvement, and development
exist in Pacifica as a result of City regulations and procedures. They include:
        Building Codes and Improvement Fees
        Land Use Controls
        Processing and Permitting Procedures
        Growth Control Ordinance
                 i. Building Codes and Improvement Fees
State law requires local agencies, including the City of Pacifica, to enforce the California Building Code
(CBD) and other construction-related codes when reviewing and inspecting new developments and
modifications to existing developments. In addition to the minimum standards set forth in the CBC, the
City has adopted minor amendments to address certain unique aspects of development in Pacifica. For
example, the requirement for the installation of fire sprinkler systems was adopted in 1998 to better
                                                      43

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
protect life and property from fire hazards. The City has also prohibited wood shake shingle roofing
due to fire hazards. Building codes, to include the CBC and local amendments, preserve the public
welfare by setting standards for structural, electrical, plumbing, and environmental safety. Application
of these building codes does, however, lead to increased housing costs. It takes architects, engineers,
and contractors additional time to comply with detailed provisions of the codes. Code-compliant
construction materials and fixtures may also have additional associated costs as compared to lesser
quality items. It also takes the time of City staff to review project plans and to conduct inspections in
the field to ensure compliance.
There are many tangible examples of building codes that enhance public safety but that also increase
maintenance, improvement, and development costs for housing projects. Once such example is that of
fire sprinkler installations. All new buildings and additions to existing structures in excess of 1,000
square feet require fire sprinkler systems. These improvements can cost tens of thousands of dollars,
yet provide greatly enhanced protection to life and property in the event of a fire. Another example is
the California Energy Code. Energy Code requirements can increase construction costs (and the
subsequent sales prices) by several dollars per square foot.
Improvement fees can also constrain maintenance, improvement, and development of housing. The
most common improvement fee is the building permit fee. Building permit fees include initial review
of construction plans and subsequent inspections of the work at the job site. Plan review fees are related
to the floor area of projects and the number of electrical, plumbing, and other specialized fixtures
installed. Inspection fees relate to the number of inspections and time spent during each inspection at an
hourly rate. Simple projects, such as a 500 square foot addition of two bedrooms and a half-bathroom
to a single-family residence would typically incur approximately $3,000 in review fees and $570 in
inspection fees. Building permit fees for a small project of this sort are modest. However, cumulative
fees for larger multi-family new development projects can be much higher. Total fees for a substantial
multi-family residential apartment complex renovation to improve housing might also be so costly as to
discourage property owner investment to enhance the housing stock. Fees are also likely to increase
annually in response to increased City staff administrative costs. The City Council has mandated that
staff recover actual costs of providing services to the community. During the last fiscal year, the City
Council altered how staff calculated building permit fees to better align with industry standard practices,
and the results was an overall increase in fees. However, Pacifica's fees are average when compared to
those found in other communities in the Bay Area.
There are other improvement fees associated with maintenance, improvement, and development of
housing. The Planning Department assesses fees for its review of entitlement applications, which
generally precede building permit reviews and fees. Entitlement applications include major efforts, like
amending the City’s General Plan to allow housing or processing a subdivision or condominium map
for new single-family housing. Entitlements can also be smaller, such as a Use Permit to allow an
addition to a house that does not conform to the City’s current zoning standards. A common
entitlement in Pacifica is a Coastal Development permit, mandated by the state for many types of work
within the Coastal Zone. In some areas of the Coastal Zone (the Coastal Zone Appeals Zone), additions
exceeding 10 percent of existing floor area require a Coastal Development Permit.
The cost of Planning Department fees generally will not be cost prohibitive to a project. Planning
Department fees relate directly to the scale of a project, with the City charging an hourly fee for actual
                                                     44

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
time spent working on a project. For instance, a modest-sized multi-family development project of 30
units may typically take 40 hours of staff time to complete the Planning process, not including
environmental review. Planning fees would amount to $7,200 or $240 per dwelling unit, based on a
2014 hourly rate of $180 per hour. Like building permit fees, Planning Department fees are subject to
annual increases if administrative costs increase. However, the true cost of entitlement processing can
be in the time it takes to receive an approval. Common entitlement processing can take three to four
months, with larger projects sometimes taking a year or more to clear all review and appeal processes.
Major delays add uncertainty and cost to housing projects, and may act to discourage pursuit of certain
housing-related activities. The City maintains its annual list of user fees in Administrative Policy No.
2. An attachment to the Housing Element is the 2014-2015 Master Schedule of Fees.
Beyond basic permit review and inspection fees, the City commonly assesses fees for infrastructure or
other improvements associated with development. These fees are generally described as “impact fees.”
Frequently, these come in the form of off-site improvements, although sometimes developers pay fees
in lieu of physical improvements. The City's requirements regarding off-site improvements vary,
depending on the scale of the project or its relative location within the city.
Redevelopment or in-fill development of existing sites in some cases may incur fewer impact fees.
However, the City’s Complete Streets Policy, adopted in 2012, requires developers of in-fill sites to
either install sidewalks, curbs, and gutters along the site frontage, or sign a deferred improvements
agreement to install them at a later time. In-fill developers must install on-site utilities underground
between structures and utility poles, but in most cases need not “underground” the utility poles. Larger
projects (i.e. subdivisions of more than four parcels) may have to underground utility poles in addition
to providing other improvements listed above.
Street construction is a major off-site improvement cost for new developments. Where a development
requires new streets, the slope of the development site determines the minimum street width
requirement. The wider the street, the more expensive it is to construct. In general, the steeper the
slope the narrower the required street width. However, with rare exception, the City’s minimum street
width requirement is 22 feet.
The City's Subdivision Ordinance allows the Planning Commission to relax utility and street
improvement standards where topography, probable future traffic, or other circumstances justify a lesser
standard. The City Engineer may waive the requirement to underground utilities if he finds that the
subdivision is within an area where previous developers had not installed underground utilities, that
underground utility installation is impractical due to physical constraints, or that overhead utilities will
have no significant visual impact. While the City Engineer can waive certain off-site improvements, he
can also require others such as street lights, street signs, street trees, fire hydrants, and monuments.
These requirements are consistent with most surrounding jurisdictions.
                 ii. Land Use Controls
The City of Pacifica mostly relies on two sources of authority to regulate all development, including
housing – the General Plan and Zoning Code. The Land Use Element of the General Plan provides
overarching guidelines for land categories and includes a map of assigned land uses. The Local
Coastal Land Use Plan is a companion to the General Plan, and contains additional provisions for
                                                      45

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
land uses in the Coastal Zone. The Zoning Code also includes a map and contains detailed standards
for development, regulating specific uses and imposing physical development standards. These
development standards can impact the type and intensity of development, which can directly
translate into the cost to maintain, improve, and develop housing units. In the event of any conflict,
the provisions of the General Plan are controlling.
Zoning Development Standards
Table II-27 summarizes Pacifica’s residential development standards. The table includes standards for
minimum lot size, minimum site area per unit, minimum setbacks, maximum height, maximum lot
coverage, minimum landscaping, minimum open space, and minimum parking. The standards apply to
each of the City’s residential zoning districts; different standards apply to mixed-use developments
within commercial zones.

The City’s main residential zoning districts are the R-1 (Single-Family Residential), R-2 (Two-Family
Residential), R-3 (Multiple-Family Residential), and R-3-G (Multiple-Family Residential Garden)
districts. The City’s zoning regulations also permit residential development in the C-1 (Neighborhood
Commercial) and C-2 (Community Commercial) zoning districts. The allowable densities for
residential development based on the zoning development standards range from 9 to 21 dwelling
units per acre in the residential zones (R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-3-G) and up to 22 dwelling units per
acre (2000 square feet of lot area per dwelling unit) in the commercial zones (C-1 and C-2).

   Usable open space shall mean common or private outdoor living, recreation, domestic use, or landscaping. Such area
may be on the ground or on, a roof, porch, deck, court, or balcony.

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
The development standards in each zoning district can restrict the maximum number of housing
units it is possible to construct on a given site. Sometimes a trade-off is made to reduce density in
order to preserve other desirable aspects of development, including open space, views, and reduced
congestion. These trade-offs can increase the per-unit cost of housing. Trade-offs among zoning
districts notwithstanding, the internal consistency that exists between the General Plan densities and
Zoning Code standards results in a situation where it is feasible for developers to achieve maximum
allowable residential densities within each respective zoning district. Furthermore, in certain cases,
the Density Bonus Ordinance (discussed later) may allow density up to 50 percent beyond the basic
allowance.
Listed below are various types of residential uses allowed in the City and a description of which zoning
districts in which they are permitted. The lower the density of development, the higher the per-unit cost
of housing.
         Single-Family Residential – The Zoning Code allows single-family residential development by-
right in the R-1 and R-2 districts and subject to a conditional use permit in the R-3 and R-3-G districts.
The R-1 district includes most of the City’s established neighborhoods. It allows detached single-
family residential development on lots of 5,000 square feet or greater. Subject to more restrictive
regulations, it is also possible to develop housing on lots of less than 5,000 square feet. The purpose of
the R-1 district is to retain the low-density character of these areas and its development standards are
structured accordingly.
The R-2 district encourages the development of slightly more dense, attached single-family housing that
blends easily with single family neighborhoods. Minimum lot sizes are 5,000 square feet and the
minimum lot area per dwelling unit is 2,900 square feet. It permits single-family detached housing on
lots of 5,800 square feet or less.
In both the R-1 and R-2 districts, a Coastal Development Permit is necessary if a development is located
in the Coastal Zone.
         Multiple-Family Residential – The Zoning Code allows multiple-family residential development
in the R-3 and R-3-G districts subject to a Site Development Permit and in the C-1 and C-2 districts
subject to a Conditional Use Permit. A Coastal Development Permit is necessary if a development is
located in the Coastal Zone.
Pacifica’s multi-family residential districts vary only slightly. In each one, duplexes and multi-family
dwellings are permitted, while single-family detached houses are permitted with approval of a
Conditional Use Permit. Multi-family residential zoning covers a significant area between the coastal
bluff and Highway 1 at the north end of the city, sections of West Sharp Park, and other pockets of the
city.
Most of the recent large developments in Pacifica have been within the Planned Development (P-D)
zoning district. The purpose of the P-D district is to allow diversification of the relationships of
various buildings, structures and open spaces in planned building groups, while ensuring substantial
compliance with the district regulations and other provisions. The P-D section of the Zoning Code
                                                     47

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
states that development standards shall be guided by the regulations of the zoning district most similar
in nature to the proposed use. In some of these cases, the R-3 development standards guided the
developments. The P-D designation allowed development of these sites with more flexibility and in
some cases included new parks and open space.
Parking Standards
Parking can account for a substantial share of residential development expenses. Surface parking –
the least expensive parking option – can occupy large portions of a development site, rendering the
underlying areas unsuitable for other development. Covered parking, especially garage parking,
requires effort and expense to incorporate it into the architecture of the associated structure. Parking
structures – the most expensive parking option –– can allow development above or below the
parking area, but require substantial engineering and construction resources.
The Zoning Code sets different parking requirements depending on the type of housing
development. Single- and two-family structures have a parking requirement of two garage spaces
per unit. Attached or detached garages satisfy this requirement. Multi-family structures, including
apartments, townhouses, and condominiums, have parking standards that vary by the size of the
units. Standards range from one parking space per studio unit to two spaces for units with two or
more bedrooms. Every four units require a guest parking space. At least one of the required spaces
for each unit must be in a garage or carport. A carport is less expensive to construct than a garage
space, which can make a housing unit more affordable. The Zoning Code does not allow tandem
parking to satisfy parking requirements except in mobile home developments, which can further add
to development costs on smaller lots or those with unique design challenges. The Zoning Code does,
however, allow for a reduced parking requirement for senior housing (1 space for every 2 units and 1
guest parking space for each 5 units), which can reduce the cost of senior housing development.
Certain other parking requirements exist for mobile home parks, lodging and boarding houses, and
projects with affordable units. The standards for each are less restrictive and assist with reducing the
housing unit development costs.
Clustered Housing Standards
The Zoning Code’s Residential Clustered Housing Development Standards apply to condominiums,
community apartments, stock cooperatives, zero lot line projects, and similar developments.
Clustered housing standards impose additional requirements onto such developments in order to
ensure high-quality site design and resident amenities. Additional requirements imposed on
clustered housing, but which do not automatically apply to multi-family rental housing, include
minimum amounts of usable open space, private open space, building separation, laundry facilities
private storage, and individual utility metering. Furthermore, every clustered housing development
must undergo a discretionary review process for a Conditional Use Permit and Site Development
Permit, unless the site is within the P-D zoning district (which has its own process for discretionary
review). The high level of design and lengthy processing required by the clustered housing
standards result in greater development costs per housing unit.

Park Dedication Fees
The City's Subdivision Ordinance requires that any subdivision of more than four (4) parcels either:
       Dedicate land for park and recreation facilities sufficient in size and topography to serve
        present and future needs of subdivision residents (.02 acre per unit), or
       Pay a fee in-lieu of dedication equal to the value of the land which would otherwise be
        dedicated.
The City uses in-lieu fees it has collected for developing new or rehabilitating existing neighborhood or
community parks or recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the subdivision. Parkland
dedication can add substantially to the cost of housing development. Dedication of land in the case of
single-family detached dwellings can comprise as much as 15 percent of the area developed, or between
17 and 30 percent for multi-family developments.
The City's parkland dedication requirement is consistent with those of neighboring communities. This
requirement is typically associated with mitigating environmental impacts of a development. If it is
found that the parkland dedication requirement is impossible or impracticable in a particular case for a
subdivider to conform fully to the subdivision regulations, the Planning Commission may approve a
modification to the subdivision regulations. Additionally, where a substantial private park and
recreational area is provided in a proposed subdivision, and the space is to be privately owned and
maintained by the future residents of the subdivision as permanent open space, partial credit, not to
exceed fifty percent, may be given against the requirement of land dedication or the payment of fees in
lieu of dedication if the Parks, Beaches, and Recreation Commission finds that it is in the public interest
to do so and certain standards are met. In addition, the Density Bonus Ordinance allows the Planning
Commission to grant additional incentives if necessary to make the housing units economically feasible.
Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance
The City’s Below Market Rate (Inclusionary) Program (i.e. Inclusionary Ordinance) codified in Pacifica
Municipal Code Title 9, Article 47 establishes requirements for housing developers to provide housing
units affordable to a range of income levels under certain circumstances. The Inclusionary Ordinance
applies to all residential developments of eight or more units, lots, or parcels, including those in which
eight or more units will be added to existing projects. Projects subject to the requirement must ensure at
least 15 percent of all units, lots, or parcels are affordable to persons with very low, lower, or moderate
income.
The Inclusionary Ordinance establishes affordability as follows:
        Outside the redevelopment project area, the first required below-market rate (BMR) unit and at least 50
percent of the required BMR units shall be restricted to occupancy by lower income households and the
remaining required BMR units shall be restricted to occupancy by moderate income households. Provided, the
developer has the right but is not required to increase the percentage of lower income household BMR units.
The City approves sales prices and rental rates to ensure their affordability to low, lower, or moderate
income individuals and families. The Inclusionary Ordinance also establishes minimum periods of
                                                          49

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
affordability of 45 years for ownership units and 55 years for rental units, in addition to other use
restrictions. In lieu of constructing affordable units, a developer may pay a fee to the City’s housing
trust fund to enable housing construction by another developer at a different site. Developers providing
affordable housing on-site can qualify for a density bonus and other development incentives.
Permit and Impact Fees for Two Sample Developments
In order to provide some context for prospective developers considering the development of housing in
Pacifica, Table II-28 presents two sample developments that could foreseeably occur during the
planning period and estimated permit and impact fees associated with them. The estimates rely on
certain assumptions regarding the size and architectural details of the sample developments.
Considering the number of variables inherent in any land use development, estimating permit and
impact fees is challenging. Accordingly, these estimates may not be applicable to an actual
development undertaken in the future. Furthermore, the estimates reflect fees set in the Fiscal Year
2014-2015 Master Schedule of Fees and Charges, which is subject to change.
                                                           TABLE II-28

             three unit types, each with one bathroom: 5 studio units of 500 sq. ft. each; 10 one-bedroom units of
             750 sq. ft. each; and, 5 two-bedroom units of 1,000 sq. ft. each. Overall site area estimated at 41,500

             per unit, plus Oceana Boulevard trip-based fees of $309 per estimated trip (10 trip minimum per
             development).

   Typical entitlements required for a 5-unit detached single-family residential development include Tentative and Final
Subdivision Maps and a Negative Declaration. Typical entitlements required for a 20-unit attached multiple-family
residential development include a Site Development Permit and Negative Declaration. See Table II-29 for typical
processing times for these permits.
                                                                  50

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
                 iii. Processing and Permitting Procedures
Special processing and permitting procedures required for certain types of housing projects may
increase the costs of development and delay the start of construction. Even projects that may
otherwise meet zoning development standards and General Plan development guidelines still must
undergo special processing due to requirements established in the Zoning Code. For example, all
projects within the R-3 (Multiple-Family Residential) or any commercial zone require issuance of a
Site Development Permit prior to authorizing construction. Furthermore, housing developments
within any commercial zone require approval of a Use Permit. Typical processing times for projects
of this sort are between three and eight months. Appeals to the City Council or Coastal Commission
can extend that timeline further. Delays and uncertainty complicate the investment decisions of
developers. For those that choose to proceed, they often must price housing units higher to account
for the delays and risks they incurred to reach the construction phase.
Projects within the P-D (Planned Development) district also receive careful scrutiny through the
discretionary review process. Review and approval of an overarching Development Plan is
necessary for any project within the P-D (Planned Development) zone as a pre-requisite to
considering more detailed plans for each parcel. After Development Plan approval, a developer
must then seek approval of a Specific Plan for each structure or parcel within the Development Plan
area. The only housing projects in the city that may avoid discretionary review in most cases are
single-family homes and duplexes outside of the Coastal Zone. These types of housing
developments are unlikely to meet the total housing demand in Pacifica given the scarcity of
buildable land for these housing types and their relatively high per-unit development costs.
Therefore, the bulk of the city’s future housing development will undergo lengthy develop
processing and permitting prior to receiving construction approvals.
The City’s Zoning Code vests the Planning Commission with authority to approve, deny, or approve
with conditions most developments in Pacifica. Decisions of the Planning Commission are subject
to appeal to the City Council. The Planning Commission must make certain findings in order to
approve each permit type. A summary of these findings for the most common permit types is below.
In addition to these findings, in most cases the Planning Commission must also affirm environmental
findings unique to each development site.
         Site Development Permit Findings – A permit shall not be issued if the Commission finds:
                 1) That the location, size, and intensity of the proposed operation will create a
hazardous or inconvenient vehicular or pedestrian traffic pattern, taking into account the proposed
use as compared with the general character and intensity of the neighborhood;
                 2) That the accessibility of off-street parking areas and the relation of parking areas
with respect to traffic on adjacent streets will create a hazardous or inconvenient condition to
adjacent or surrounding uses;
                 3) That insufficient landscaped areas have been reserved for the purposes of
separating or screening service and storage areas from the street and adjoining building sites,
                                                     51

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
breaking up large expanses of paved areas, and separating or screening parking lots from the street
and adjoining building areas from paved areas to provide access from buildings to open areas;
                4) That the proposed development, as set forth on the plans, will unreasonably restrict
or cut out light and air on the property and on other property in the neighborhood, or will hinder or
discourage the appropriate development and use of land and buildings in the neighborhood, or
impair the value thereof;
                5) That the improvement of any commercial or industrial structure, as shown on the
elevations as submitted, is substantially detrimental to the character or value of an adjacent R
District area;
                6) That the proposed development will excessively damage or destroy natural
features, including trees, shrubs, creeks, and rocks, and the natural grade of the site, except as
provided in the subdivision regulations as set forth in Chapter 1 of Title 10 of this Code;
                7) That there is insufficient variety in the design of the structure and grounds to avoid
monotony in the external appearance;
                8) That the proposed development is inconsistent with the City's adopted Design
Guidelines; or
                9) That the proposed development is inconsistent with the General Plan, Local
Coastal Plan, or other applicable laws of the City. If the proposal, however, does not have any of the
impacts listed above, the Site Development Permit may be granted.
        Conditional Use Permit Findings – A permit shall be issued only if the Commission finds:
                1) That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use or building applied for
will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, and
welfare of the persons residing or working in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the City;
                2) That the use or building applied for is consistent with the applicable provisions of
the General Plan and other applicable laws of the City and, where applicable, the local Coastal Plan;
and
                3) Where applicable, that the use or building applied for is consistent with the City's
adopted Design Guidelines.
        Development Plan Findings (P-D District) – Approval shall be granted only if the
Commission finds that:
                1) The proposed P-D District can be substantially completed within the time schedule
submitted by the applicant;
                                                    52

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
                 2) Each unit of the development, as well as the total development, can exist as an
independent development capable of creating an environment of sustained desirability and stability
or adequate assurance that such objective will be attained;
                 3) The land uses proposed will not be detrimental to the present or potential
surrounding uses but will have a beneficial effect which would not be achieved through other
districts;
                 4) The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to carry
anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic in such amounts as to overload
the street network outside the P-D District;
                 5) Any proposed commercial development can be justified economically at the
location proposed and will provide adequate commercial facilities for the area;
                 6) Any exception from the standard district requirement is warranted by the design of
the project and amenities incorporated in the development plan;
                 7) The area surrounding the development can be planned and zoned in coordination
and substantial compatibility with the proposed development, and the P-D District uses proposed are
in conformance with the General Plan and, where applicable, the Local Coastal Plan, or that changes
in the General Plan or Local Coastal Plan are justified;
                 8) The project is consistent with the City's adopted Design Guidelines; and
                 9) The project is consistent with the City's General Plan and, if applicable, Local
Coastal Plan.
         Specific Plan Findings (P-D District) – Approval shall be granted only if the Commission
finds:
                 1) That the specific plan is consistent with the approved development plan; and
                 2) That the specific plan is consistent with the City's adopted Design Guidelines.
The time required to process a project varies greatly from one project to another and is directly
related to the size and complexity of the proposal and the number of actions or approvals needed to
complete the process. Table II-29 identifies typical entitlement processing timelines. It should be
noted that each project does not necessarily have to complete each step in the process (i.e., small-
scale projects consistent with General Plan and zoning designations do not generally require
Environmental Impact Reports (EIR), General Plan Amendments, Zone Changes, or Variances).
Also, in most cases certain review and approval procedures run concurrently. For example, a review
for a condominium project would be processed concurrently with the Site Development Permit,
Conditional Use Permit, and Tentative Subdivision Map, as well as any necessary Variances,
Parking Exceptions or other permits. Environmental review is also processed simultaneously.

Planning Department processing fees also act as a constraint to housing maintenance, improvement, and
development. The Planning Department bases its review fees on the City Council-adopted fee
schedule, which for 2014-2015 established an hourly rate of $180.00. Some projects require minimal
staff review and are relatively inexpensive to process for entitlements. However, large projects – such
as those requiring an environmental impact report (EIR) – require a public hearing and can take from 6
to 8 months to process, with a corresponding increase in staff time and cost. The City works closely
with developers to expedite approval procedures so as not to put any unnecessary timing constraints
on development. Other agencies including Public Works, Fire, Building, and Police review
submittals concurrently for consistency with City ordinances, Design Guidelines and General Plan
consistency.
After project approval by the Planning Commission or City Council, City permitting and processing
continues during the Building Permit stage. The Building Division of the Planning Department
performs plan checks and issues building permits. Throughout construction, the Building Division
performs building inspections to monitor the progress of the project. Corrections needed during the
plan review portion of the building permit stage, or failed inspections during the construction phase,
can delay project completion. State law requires local agencies to implement plan reviews and
construction site inspections to ensure compliance with the California Building Code, limiting
Pacifica’s ability to mitigate this constraint.
Table II-30 lists the typical discretionary permits required for the sample developments presented in
Table II-28. Certain discretionary permit requirements tend to be site specific, and will depend on
site location, topography, zoning, and other factors. Thus, as with the fee estimates for these sample
developments, determining the discretionary permits required for the sample developments relied on
certain assumptions that may be different for an actual project.

Second Units
Construction of second dwelling units in conjunction with existing single-family detached residential
structures is an important way to expand the City’s housing stock. It can benefit property owners
with additional income, or allow them to care for a family member that needs to be close to care, but
still desires some independence. Pacifica’s zoning regulations allow construction of second units in
many situations within the R-1 zoning district subject only to issuance of a building permit, in
accordance with state law. Government Code Section 65852.2(a) allows a local agency to establish
regulations for construction of second units. The City of Pacifica has adopted regulations that
impose certain limited restrictions on second unit construction.
Pacifica’s ordinance allows second units only within the R-1 district. In the R-1 district, the
ordinance limits by-right construction of second units to lots in full conformance to development
standards. It further limits the density of second units to no more than 25 percent of lots on any
block. Additional development standards and density limitations exist, as provided in Pacifica
Municipal Code Section 9-4.453. The City’s current ordinance requires more than one parking
space for a second unit; prohibits the use of tandem parking spaces to meet the minimum parking
requirements; and prohibits locating a required parking space for a second unit within a required
front yard setback. These provisions are inconsistent with state law, and the City has included an
action program in this housing element to adopt a revised ordinance to comply with the Government
Code.
                     iv. Growth Control Ordinance
In January 1982, the Pacifica City Council adopted Ordinance No. 322-C.S., an initiative ordinance
known as the “Growth Control Ordinance” which provided for controlled residential growth through
1992. A series of ordinances have extended growth control policies to present day. The current
                                                                  55

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
ordinance controlling growth in Pacifica is set to terminate on June 30, 2017. The purpose of the
Growth Control Ordinance (GCO) is to manage the timing of residential growth in Pacifica so that
development does not outpace the City’s ability to provide essential services and infrastructure to
support the growth. The Ordinance does not place a cap on residential development. The GCO
contains findings concerning adverse effects of rapid residential growth in Pacifica and, as a result,
limits new dwelling units to a maximum of 70 units annually. To ensure an equitable distribution of
units and to encourage in-fill, the GCO provides that no applicant for development approval shall
receive greater than 20% of the annual allotment each year.
There are a number of factors that determine actual development allocations under the GCO. Since
enactment, the City has interpreted the GCO to allow accumulation of unallocated units for
development in subsequent years. As of December 2014, the balance of units available for allocation
was 1,415, resulting from a large number of unused development applications in recent years. A single
housing developer could propose a project at any time for up to 283 housing units, or 20 percent of the
available allocations. There are also a number of exclusions from the annual development limitations.
These include one single-family dwelling unit on an individual existing lot; affordable, senior, or
accessible dwelling units; second units; any statutory housing programs which are excluded from
growth controls limitations; and any future amendments to the Growth Control Ordinance. At the
beginning of fiscal year 2008-2009, there were 1067 allocations available. As of July 2010, a balance
of 1,144 permits remained. An excess of permits (over the 70 units allotted per year) has accumulated
due to a carry-over of unused permits from previous years.
The GCO provides for a competitive evaluation system to distribute development allocations. The
competitive allocation procedure includes criteria and a ranking process. Criteria include, but are not
limited to, the following: ability of public facilities, utilities and services to meet the demands created
by the project; presence or absence of adverse environmental impacts; site and architectural design
quality; the provision of private or public usable open space; consistency with neighborhood character;
and, provision of affordable housing, senior housing and housing for persons with disabilities. Low and
moderate income projects receive preferential ranking. The Planning Commission must consider each
application for a residential development allocation at a public meeting and evaluate and rank the
applications according to these criteria. The Planning Commission recommendations are forwarded to
the City Council for review and approval. At the public hearing, the City Council must consider the
Planning Commission's recommendations and ranking. The City Council then adopts a final ranking
list and award residential development allocations pursuant to that list. The City Council may adopt,
reject or modify the recommendations and ranking of the Planning Commission.
To permit phasing of multi-unit projects, where such projects exceed the available annual allotment
of residential development allocations, the allocation procedure includes a procedure for the phasing
of such projects over more than one fiscal year by reservation of succeeding year allotments. Such
reservations can be deducted from the number of residential development allocations to be awarded
for the fiscal year under consideration. When the number of available residential development
allocations exceeds demand for the allocations, the City Council may issue the allocations on an “as
needed basis” (i.e., without following the competitive evaluation system process) throughout the year.
The GCO also provides that property zoned A (Agricultural) or HPD (Hillside Preservation) district
may not be rezoned out of agriculture or hillside preservation uses without a vote of the people. The
                                                      56

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
purpose of retaining agricultural zoning is to prevent premature conversion of agricultural land to urban
uses, to prevent urban sprawl, and to conserve coastal and open space resources upon which Pacifica's
economy depends. The purpose of retaining hillside areas is to protect against potentially hazardous
conditions peculiar to hillsides, to ensure development compatible with Pacifica's hillside resources, to
preserve open space, and to retain natural terrain by encouraging the concentration of dwelling within
developed areas of the city.
The GCO in its current state is not constraining housing maintenance, improvement, or development.
Several large developments could occur simultaneously before depleting the existing balance of housing
unit allocations. However, should several years of strong residential development occur during the
planning period, it is possible the GCO could constrain housing development in the mid- to long-term,
especially for larger mixed-use developments with many units. Developments of this sort are essential
to meeting Pacifica’s housing needs, especially for affordable housing units for extremely low-, very
low-, and low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
          B. Nongovernmental Constraints
Many nongovernmental factors can constrain the maintenance, improvement, and construction of
housing. Factors include access to financing, costs of land and construction, and community
opposition.
                  i. Availability of Financing
Housing prices continue to recover from the devastating economic downturn that occurred during the
Great Recession starting in 2007. The median sales price of a single-family detached home in 2007 was
$841,860, while in 2012 it was down to $535,846 (in 2013 dollars). The median sales price for a single-
family attached home was similarly depressed, falling from $589,120 in 2007 to $314,363 in 2012.
Falling housing prices makes access to financing for purchases more difficult for home buyers. Lenders
face uncertainty about the future value of the property serving as collateral for the loans, and as a result
are less likely to lend to prospective purchasers. This limits the ability of purchasers, especially those
with lower incomes or imperfect credit histories, to pursue home ownership. When individuals and
families are unable to access financing to purchase homes, residential developers in turn are less likely
to pursue permits for housing developments. The cycle results in fewer home ownership opportunities
for Pacificans.
Limited access to financing not only affects home buyers and residential developers, but it also affects
existing owners seeking to maintain or improve their housing. Financing plays an important role in
funding additions to accommodate growing families or aging family members. It also helps with
renovations and upgrades to beautify or improve energy efficiency of the housing stock.
Unfortunately, the City of Pacifica can do little to affect the mortgage lending market. Until mid-2008,
home mortgage financing was readily available at attractive rates throughout San Mateo County and
California. Rates varied, but ranged from 6.25 percent to 7 percent from 2006-2008 for a 30 year
fixed rate loan (HSH Associates Financial Publishers).13 Starting in late-2008, it became difficult to
obtain a home purchase loan, even though the average interest rate had fallen to around 5 percent. In

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
particular, people with short credit histories, lower incomes, or self-employment incomes, or those
with other unusual circumstances, have had trouble qualifying for a loan or were charged higher
interest rates.
Small changes in the interest rate for home purchases can dramatically affect affordability. A 30-
year home loan for $400,000 at 5 percent interest would result in monthly payments of roughly
$2,150. A similar home loan at 7 percent interest would result in payments of roughly $2660, an
increase of more than 20 percent.
Many builders have also struggled recently to find construction loans for residential properties.
Complicated projects, like mixed-use developments, are often the hardest to finance. Nonprofit
developers find it especially difficult to secure funding from the private sector. In past years, lenders
would provide up to 80 percent of the cost of new construction. Yet in recent years, due to market
conditions and government regulations, banks require larger investments by builders. All of these
factors combine to constrain residential development in Pacifica.
                   ii. Land Costs
The cost of land is one of the most basic elements of housing development. The more expensive the
underlying land, the more expensive the resulting units for prospective purchasers or renters. Opinions
vary as to the relative importance of land costs in contributing to housing price increases, although the
price of land undoubtedly plays a major role.14 For example, in 1990 a standard size (5,000 square feet)
vacant infill lot in Pacifica, zoned for residential use, sold for $150,000 to $175,000 (in 2013 dollars).
In 2001, a similar lot sold for $165,000 to $295,000 (in 2013 dollars). In 2009 a standard lot for
residential use sold for $325,000 to $540,000 (in 2013 dollars). 15 Prices have moderated for some
inland lots, with several selling for approximately $155,000 in 2014. Still, land prices in Pacifica are
high, equating to well over a $1,000,000 per acre based on recent sales data. It is difficult to estimate
the cost of land zoned for multi-family residential development since so few vacant sites exist.
However, an estimate of $107,000 to 200,000 per unit is generally considered satisfactory.16
                   iii. Construction Costs
According to the Pacifica Building Division, in 2014 the cost of developing a 2,000 square foot single-
family residence in Pacifica ranged from $180 to $220 per square foot, including the price of land.
Construction costs for multi-family developments ranged from $150 to $200 per square foot. Costs
vary depending upon the type of construction, building materials, and quality of finishes. Soft costs,
such as architectural and engineering services, development fees, etc., usually comprise an additional 10
to 15 percent of the construction and land costs. The City attempts to mitigate the cost of construction
of affordable rental and ownership housing through granting density bonuses and allowing second
residential units.

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
                iv. Community Opposition
Community opposition can be a significant obstacle to obtaining approvals for new housing
developments. Traffic, parking, and/or visual impacts are usually the greatest concerns of residents
opposed to new developments. Among the visual impacts that are most sensitive in Pacifica is the
concept of “private open space.” Many residents have become accustomed to certain privately-owned
properties in their neighborhoods remaining undeveloped for many years. These undeveloped
properties have served as open space for them, and there is a perception they will remain indefinitely in
this state. However, these properties are owned by private individuals who may have expectations of
development and corresponding financial returns. When owners finally unveil development plans,
resident opposition can be fierce. Affordable housing developments also elicit community concerns
about crime and property values. Residents can exert significant political pressure on the elected City
Council to oppose developments on vacant land or affordable housing developments. Unknown
likelihood of approval or a bruising public engagement process that could tarnish a developer’s
reputation can discourage new developments in these circumstances. The City can strive to provide
accurate information on all aspects of new developments, but cannot always satisfy resident concerns
and quell community opposition.
         C. Other Constraints
Pacifica has two constraints to development which are not governmental or nongovernmental
limitations. They include geologic hazards and highway capacity.
                i. Geological Hazards
In January 1982, Pacifica experienced widespread and severe landslides and flooding which caused loss
of life and significant property damage. These events caused Pacifica to undertake a new approach to
development, including instituting a new geological review process and retaining an independent
engineering and geology firm to review all hillside projects. According to Pacifica's geotechnical
consultant, slope stability has been overrated in the past in Pacifica, and standards used to evaluate
hillside development must be reassessed and strengthened. Pacifica's Seismic and Safety Element
(adopted in September 1983) addressed and assessed these geologic events.
Pacifica also experienced coastal bluff retreat of approximately 75 feet in some areas as a result of
winter storms during 1983 and 2009. Areas previously considered stable were undercut, houses and
trailers were damaged, destroyed, or had to be relocated further inland. Coastal bluff retreat continued
throughout 2014 in the northwest section of the City west of Esplanade Avenue. Several apartment
buildings have been deemed uninhabitable, and another is at risk of becoming uninhabitable if bluff
retreat continues. City staff continues to encourage property owners to implement mitigation measures
to prevent the loss of valuable rental housing stock and to restore habitability to those units already lost.
The City now recognizes that geologic hazard mitigation will be required in many areas of Pacifica.
This may affect the timing, location, and intensity of future development. For example, geologic
studies of some bluff top properties may result in lowered densities by reducing the amount of net
developable acreage. Additionally, densities on inland sloping properties may be affected where
geologic studies indicate that the revenue produced by locating units to achieve maximum densities
                                                    59

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
does not justify the cost of providing engineering solutions sufficient to achieve those densities. In
these cases, hazard avoidance may be the only acceptable mitigation measure because mitigation of
both on- and off-site geotechnical hazards is a requirement of project approval or building permit
issuance.
Pacifica expects that mitigation of existing and potential geologic hazards will, to some extent, reduce
its growth rate; however, this effect cannot be quantified at this time, since these constraints are to some
extent site specific. It is possible that land use designations may be revised to reflect changed
conditions and policies, and this, too, may constrain Pacifica's future housing development potential.
                ii. Highway Capacity
The primary north-south traffic corridor to, from, and through Pacifica is State Highway 1. The
roadway is also known as Coast Highway and Cabrillo Highway. In 1978, Caltrans noted that
considerable vehicular and pedestrian traffic was present (Report of Engineering and Traffic Survey -
March 31, 1978). Studies prepared in 1979 (Mori Point Project and Rockaway Beach Condominiums
Draft Environmental Impact Reports) indicated that service at critical intersections was at or below
Level of Service (LOS) D. Roadway operation at LOS D results in unstable flow and tolerable delays.
The Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for each anticipated development concluded that without
mitigation, roadway operation would drop to LOS E and possibly LOS F (unacceptable and intolerable
congestion and delays).
The 1985 Rockaway Beach Redevelopment Plan EIR indicated that the Highway 1/Reina Del Mar
intersection operated at LOS E and F during both A.M. and P.M. peak hours. While the Highway
1/Fassler Avenue intersection operated at LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and LOS C in the P.M. peak
hour, the EIR also described alternative Highway 1 improvement options to improve roadway
operations.
More recent traffic studies and impact analyses along Highway 1 between Reina Del Mar and Fassler
Avenue confirmed that the level of service at the Highway 1/Reina Del Mar intersection operated at
LOS F during A.M. and P.M. peak hours while the Highway 1/Fassler Avenue intersection operated at
LOS F in the A.M. peak hour and LOS C in the P.M. peak hour. The City has long held that LOS C
(stable flow, acceptable delay) or better is a satisfactory level of service for Highway 1 and facilitates
movement and commerce while preserving public safety.
In response to the ongoing peak hour congestion on Highway 1, Caltrans has proposed highway
widening improvements between Westport Drive and Fassler Avenue. Known as the “Calera Parkway
Project,” it would (if ultimately constructed) add a third lane for both northbound and southbound traffic
along Highway 1 between the intersection with Reina Del Mar and the intersection with Fassler
Avenue. Caltrans expects the project would improve peak hour traffic level of service to LOS C from
the current LOS F. Construction of the project is not a certainty, however. In mid-2013, opponents of
the highway widening challenged Caltrans’s Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the project in
Superior Court. After conclusion of the trial, the Superior Court took no action to stop the project, and
instead issued a ruling rejecting the petitioners’ claims on March 10, 2015. Despite the Court’s ruling
to allow Caltrans to continue preparations for the project, the agency has yet to obtain approval of all
required permits for the Calera Parkway Project. Whether the Calera Parkway Project is eventually
                                                     60

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
constructed or not, the City should still identify the constraint that traffic flow on Highway 1 may pose
to future housing development.
Another important roadway within Pacifica is Sharp Park Road. Sharp Park Road is the city’s major
east-west thoroughfare, handling approximately half of the total peak hour trips leaving Pacifica each
day. Drivers exit Highway 1 at Sharp Park Road to drive towards South San Francisco, San Bruno, and
other Peninsula cities along Skyline Boulevard or Interstate 280. The remainder of trips continue
northbound on Highway 1 to San Francisco or the East Bay via Interstate 280. In the fall of 1990 the
reconstruction of lower Sharp Park Road commenced. Construction lasted for one year and was
reopened in 1991. This new section of Sharp Park Road now has 2 lanes for both westbound and
eastbound traffic directions. The improvement resulted in a roadway with greater capacity that is less
winding and safer to travel due to a new concrete median barrier. However, severe slopes along the
roadway limit opportunities for future widening, and this could be a major constraint on housing
development.
        D. Mitigation of Constraints
The City has a strong interest in mitigating constraints on the maintenance, improvement, and
development of housing. Its residents need adequate and affordable housing options so persons with
extremely low, very low, and low incomes can pursue their livelihoods and care for their families.
Quality housing development can strengthen the community and the economy, enhancing the already
desirable character of Pacifica. The summary below addresses the City’s attempts to mitigate the
constraints identified above. Some constraints are extremely difficult to mitigate, but the City will
continue to consider ways to promote appropriate housing development.
                i. Governmental Constraints
Land Use Controls
        Exemptions from Standards
Pacifica’s Zoning Code contains provisions that allow relief from the strict application of
development standards. Allowing flexibility for developers can result in lower construction
expenses or higher densities, which lead to more housing units affordable to persons with extremely
low, very low, and low incomes. In extreme cases, relaxing a particular requirement can mean the
difference between pursuing project approvals and abandoning a housing development altogether.
The Planning Director, acting as the Zoning Administrator, may grant Minor Modifications to
standards governing area, yard requirements, distance between buildings, lot coverage, fence/wall
height, and off-street parking. Modifications approved by the Zoning Administrator may not exceed
20 percent of the respective standards, except in the case of off-street parking, where a reduction of
one space is allowable.
When circumstances warrant a greater departure from development standards, the City may grant a
permit known as a Variance. A Variance authorizes any deviation from zoning regulations the
                                                     61

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
Planning Commission finds is necessary to allow a property owner to enjoy the same privileges
enjoyed by other owners with similarly situated property. The main limitation to a Variance is that it
may not authorize a use not permitted by the zoning of the subject site.
The Planning Commission may grant a Variance only if it finds:
                1) That because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including size,
shape, topography, location, or surroundings, the strict application of the provisions of this chapter
deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under an identical
zoning classification;
                2) That the granting of such variance will not, under the circumstances of the
particular case, materially affect adversely the health or safety of persons residing or working in the
neighborhood of the subject property and will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be
materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the area;
                3) Where applicable, that the application is consistent with the City's adopted Design
Guidelines; and
                4) If located in the Coastal Zone, that the application is consistent with the applicable
provisions of the Local Coastal Plan.
        Definition of "Family"
The term "single-family residential" can be confusing or misleading in some cases. In the traditional
sense a family includes members such as parents, their children, and perhaps an elderly relative for
whom the family provides care. The City's Zoning Code does not define a family in these same terms,
however. The City has a more flexible definition that respects different associations of individuals,
whether related by blood or not, that choose to live with one another.
The Zoning Code defines "family" as "one or more persons occupying a premises and living as a single
housekeeping unit, as distinguished from a group occupying a hotel, club, or fraternity or sorority
house. A family shall be deemed to include necessary servants." Pacifica's definition of family does not
discriminate against unrelated individuals living within a single dwelling unit, whether in a single-
family or multi-family residential development. The only requirement to qualify as a "family" is that
the individuals living together must function as a single housekeeping unit. Generally, this means
cooking and sharing meals in a common kitchen as well as sharing other housing-related expenses with
one another (i.e. utility bills, insurance, groceries). Pacifica’s definition of “family” provides flexibility
to those seeking adequate, affordable housing. These persons can safely and lawfully form a household
with unrelated persons in order to share housing-related expenses.

Land & Construction Costs
         Allowances for Residential Uses in Commercial Zoning Districts
Most of the City’s future housing development potential lays in commercially-zoned sites. The days
of large tract housing development on vacant sites are over in Pacifica. The few remaining vacant
sites zoned for residential development are small, fragmented, and often have geological challenges
to development. Therefore, it is important to consider commercial sites for their ability to meet
Pacifica’s future housing need.
The City permits housing development in several commercial zones, most notably the C-1
(Neighborhood Commercial) and C-2 (Community Commercial) zones. Residential development in
commercial districts must have a mixed-use configuration with residential uses above ground floor
commercial spaces. Approval of mixed-use housing developments is not by-right, but is subject to
approval of a Conditional Use Permit and Site Development Permit. Table II-31 indicates the
development standards for residential uses in the City’s main commercial zones. For clarity in
presentation below, the table will only display standards for the C-1 and C-2 districts. The Zoning
Code applies standards from the C-1 district to developments in the C-1-A district and from the C-2
district to developments within the C-R and O districts.

Development standards in commercial zones are generally favorable to mixed-use (residential and
commercial) development. These commercial zones have no front, side, or rear setbacks, no floor
area ratio limitations, and no lot coverage limits. The flexibility inherent in these regulations create
larger developable areas than comparably sized residential sites, helping to mitigate land costs,
construction costs, and delays associated with processing and permitting. Larger developable sites

   Usable open space shall mean common or private outdoor living, recreation, domestic use, or landscaping. Such area
may be on the ground or on, a roof, porch, deck, court, or balcony.

result in greater density, which in turn reduces the per-unit cost of development and ultimately can
make housing more affordable to persons with extremely low, very low, and low incomes.
In terms of parking, multi-family units in mixed use projects are subject to the same requirements
that apply to other multi-family dwellings. The requirements are cumulatively added to the
requirements for the commercial portions of the project to determine the total number of spaces
needed. In certain cases, the Planning Commission can grant a lower parking requirement if a
developer can show the characteristics of uses within a development can offset parking demands
from one another. For instance, certain commercial uses may have large parking requirements
during business hours when many residents are away from the site at work. Correspondingly, during
evening hours the residential use has a large parking demand while most businesses are closed.
Combined, the favorable treatment of mixed-use housing developments in commercial zones
mitigates the constraints of land and construction costs. Given that the City is relying on
commercial sites to accommodate housing, the City will encourage and facilitate residential
development on commercial sites (mixed-use) for lower-income households.
         Density Bonus Ordinance
The Density Bonus Ordinance, adopted in April 1984, offers the incentive of increased density and
flexibility in development standards in exchange for housing which will meet the City's need to provide
ownership and rental housing affordable to persons with extremely low, very low, and low incomes.
Multi-family residential projects can exceed their maximum density, reduce unit floor area, or provide
less parking, if provision is made for rental housing, affordable housing, or housing for the elderly or
persons with disabilities. The amount of the density bonus ranges from 15 percent for rental housing
(including market rate projects) to 50 percent for housing affordable to persons with extremely low,
very low, and low incomes, elderly persons, or persons with disabilities. The Density Bonus Ordinance
ensures the continued availability of housing granted a density bonus by requiring deed restrictions or
other legal arrangements on properties so developed.
Higher housing density combined with relaxed floor area and parking requirements allows
developers to mitigate the constraints imposed by land and construction costs. Lower per-unit costs
of construction can result in lower per-unit sales costs or rental rates, making housing more
affordable to persons with extremely low, very low, and low incomes. An added advantage of the
Density Bonus Ordinance is that it provides the greatest bonus for providing housing to the neediest
groups: those with extremely low, very low, and low incomes, and seniors or persons with disabilities.
Pacifica’s Density Bonus Ordinance requires certain revisions to remain consistent with state law,
and the City will undertake an action program to initiate the amendment.
         Manufactured Housing
The City’s development standards allow construction of manufactured housing in any zoning district
that permits single-family dwellings. The R-1 (Single-Family Residential) zoning district permits
single-family dwellings by-right, and a property owner or developer can construct manufactured
housing without undergoing discretionary review. In the R-2 (Two-Family Residential) and R-3
                                                   64

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
(Multiple-Family Residential) zoning districts, single-family dwellings – including manufactured
housing – require a Use Permit.
The City enacted its Manufactured Housing Ordinance in January 1982. A manufactured house is a
structure comprising two or more modules, including mobile homes, which is manufactured off-site and
later assembled or installed on a property. Manufactured housing, by virtue of being mass-produced,
can be significantly less expensive to develop and to purchase than traditional single-family structures.
The design of manufactured housing has improved greatly in recent years, and is a viable option for
many lower-income residents. The City’s main requirement for manufactured housing is that it meets
all California Building Code requirements so that the housing is safe.
Community Opposition
         Study Sessions
The City offers study sessions to developers seeking to gauge community and Planning Commission
receptiveness to various development proposals. Ahead of a study session, the City sends notices to
property owners within 300 feet of a potential development site and holds a public meeting hosted by
the Planning Commission. Commissioners, members of the public, and City staff have an opportunity
to discuss details of the project in an informal setting. Developers can then build on feedback to revise
their development proposals before investing substantial time in finalizing detailed plans.
Offering study sessions allows the City to help developers minimize review time and associated costs
by identifying major issues prior to formal application processing. Study sessions fees for commercial
projects are refundable if a developer pursues to final building permit inspection the entitlements
covered in the study session. For mixed-use projects including housing, the fee refunded is proportional
to the amount of the project dedicated to commercial use.
                 iii. Other Constraints
Highway Capacity
         Collection of Improvement Fees
Pacifica has established special funds for the deposit of impact fees to assist in the construction of
needed improvements to meet or approach LOS C. Developers of residential projects must contribute a
per-unit fee according to the location of their projects within the City. The primary impact area south of
Westport Drive in the Fairway Park neighborhood requires relatively higher contributions per unit than
the secondary impact area to the north. The fee schedule has been established because the majority of
improvements will be necessary along the southern stretch of the highway. Until traffic flow along
Highway 1 improves – either by roadway widening or other improvements – the City intends to control
the timing of residential development through its Growth Control Ordinance.

8. Affordable Units at Risk
A potential threat to existing housing units affordable to persons with extremely low, very low, and low
incomes is the termination of rental contracts by owners of properties subject to federal subsidy
programs. Such contracts may be terminated through cancellation of a Section 8 contract ("opting out")
after a certain number of years, or early pay-off of the interest loan after 20 years ("pre-payment").
Project owners who opt-out or pre-pay their rental contracts are free to rent at market rate or, with City
approval, may convert rental units to condominiums or a nonhousing use.
The following analysis complies with Section 65583 of the Government Code, which requires that cities
analyze and develop programs to preserve assisted housing developments:

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
       How Units are at Risk:           The owner has already renewed the Section 8 which was due
                                        on January 30, 2015. If the owner fails to renew its Section 8
                                        participation by January 30, 2020, the project could lose its
                                        low-income use restrictions. The project could then be
                                        "converted" to market rate units. One-bedroom units rented for
                                        $2,021 per month in 2015, an increase from $1,292 per month
                                        in 2014. The substantial increase reduced market pressure for
                                        the owner to discontinue participation in the Section 8
                                        program. However, if annual increases allowed by HUD do
                                        not keep pace with market rates over the term of participation,
                                        the owner may at some point feel financial pressure to pursue
                                        greater financial returns.
       Factors Which May
       Eliminate or Reduce Risk:        1. Should the owner decide to "opt-out" of the Section 8 contract,
                                        this action would be subject to provisions of federal and state law
                                        designed to minimize hardship for the project's tenants.
                                        2. The owner has had renewal options in the past (1987, 1992,
                                        1997, 2005, 2010, 2015) and has always renewed.
                                        3. An "opt-out" is only valid if a one-year notice is provided,
                                        allowing time to develop a strategy for preservation of units
                                        affordable to persons with extremely low, very low, and low
                                        incomes.
                                        4. The Casa Pacifica project includes a condition of approval
                                        making the Use Permit valid only for a multi-family senior
                                        housing complex. Should the owner attempt to convert the
                                        project to non-senior housing, it would require a new Use Permit
                                        from the City. However, the condition of approval does not
                                        require that the owner maintains the units for low-income
                                        occupancy.
                                        5. The City also granted the Casa Pacifica project a Variance
                                        from the required number of parking spaces on the condition that
                                        the property is used solely as residential housing for seniors.
                                        Should the owner attempt to convert the project to non-senior
                                        housing, the Variance would no longer be valid and the parking
                                        would have to meet current standards. Alternatively, the
                                        property owner could request a new Variance. However, the
                                        condition of approval does not require that the owner maintains
                                        the units for low-income occupancy.
No other projects are "at risk" during this ten-year period.

       B. Cost Analysis of Preserving Versus Replacing At-Risk Units
               i.     Cost to Replace
                      It is estimated that replacing the Casa Pacifica units would cost approximately
                      $14,962,967 ($150 per square foot plus $50,000 per unit).
               ii.    Cost to Preserve
                      It is estimated that the cost to preserve the units would be substantially less than
                      to replace due to the cost and scarcity of developable land and increased
                      construction costs.

      Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) funds for the purpose of preserving
       low-income housing.
                                The City does not currently receive any CDBG funds for the purpose of
                                preserving low-income housing.

       Administrative fees (reserves) of any housing authority operating within the community.
                                 There is no local housing authority operating within Pacifica.
       Pacifica Housing Fund
                                 The City has limited financial resources that in some instances may assist
                                 with preservation of senior housing units. The primary source of funding
                                 for affordable housing development or preservation in the future is
                                 expected to be the City’s in lieu housing fee. The City adopted an
                                 inclusionary zoning ordinance in April 2007 which contains a provision
                                 allowing developers to pay an amount of money "in lieu" of constructing
                                 an affordable unit. The in-lieu payment for each below market rate unit
                                 (BMR) shall reflect the estimated cost to provide the BMR unit.
        D. Other Projects
Three other projects in Pacifica offer subsidized low-income housing for seniors. The Ocean View
Apartments at 555 Crespi Drive are entirely occupied by seniors receiving Section 8 rental assistance.
However, the owners of the project (National Church Residences) have already fulfilled their mortgage
obligations, and the City is not required to analyze the "at-risk" potential of the project. National
Church Residences has previously expressed its commitment to continuing Section 8 rentals at the site.
Nevertheless, the City should continue to monitor the status of the Ocean View Apartments. As with
the Casa Pacifica project, the City granted a Parking Variance to the Ocean View project on the
condition that the project remains senior housing, and the Variance will become "null and void" if
converted to market rate housing (and the site will require additional parking). This condition will
encourage the maintenance of senior housing at the Ocean View project. If necessary, the City could
use the resources noted above to help preserve the project for low-income use. In 2015, BRIDGE
Housing was in the process of purchasing the project from National Church Residences. BRIDGE
Housing is a non-profit affordable housing development and property management organization.
Another project for low-income seniors in Pacifica is the Pacific Oaks project at 750 Oddstad
Boulevard. The covenants, conditions, and restrictions for Pacific Oaks run with the life of the project,
and no preservation efforts by the City are necessary.
The Good Shepherd Senior Housing project has added an additional 42 units for the elderly population
of Pacifica. The Good Shepherd project is located at 901 Oceana Boulevard and has restrictions
protecting the status of the units as senior housing. No preservation efforts by the City are necessary.
9. Opportunities for Energy Conservation
In December 2013, the City of Pacifica adopted the state Green Building Standards Code in
California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 11. These standards, more commonly known as the
“Green Building Code,” regulate many aspects of construction to reduce the impacts of buildings on
the environment. The City’s regulations are in conformance to statewide standards.

There are several benefits of green building:
        Environmental benefits
                  Reduces use of natural resources
        Health and safety benefits
                  Enhances occupant comfort and health, as well as that of the greater
                   community
        Community benefits
                  Minimizes strain on local infrastructure, improves the quality of the building
                   stock, and extends the useful life of structure
        Economic benefits
                  Improves the bottom line for owners, building professionals, and the
                   community
Prior to its adoption of statewide standards, in May 2008, the City of Pacifica created a Citizens’
Green Building Task Force to provide a forum for development of “green building” regulations. The
City thereafter developed and adopted its own Green Building Ordinance in late-2010. The City also
adopted a Climate Action Plan in 2014 which identifies strategies to reduce energy consumption,
thereby reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The City of Pacifica has demonstrated a strong
commitment to pursuing energy conservation in the built environment.

                                   III. LAND INVENTORY
1. Purpose
State housing law (Government Code Section 65583(a)(3)) calls for "an inventory of land suitable for
residential development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment and an
analysis of the relationship of zoning and public services to these sites." In 2009, a City consultant
completed a survey of vacant or undeveloped sites. These sites were identified by field surveys,
aerial photographs, and County Assessor data. Despite being five years old, the survey remains
valid due to the low-level of residential development in Pacifica during the interceding period.
Furthermore, no zoning changes with significance for housing development have occurred. Based
on an updated review of the survey in 2015, the City has concluded that sufficient land exists to
accommodate residential development within the eight-year planning period covered by this
Housing Element update.
The following section summarizes the survey results and identifies sites in Pacifica where development
of housing can occur within the current housing element planning period. More detailed site specific
information is available in the "Pacifica General Plan Existing Conditions and Key Issues” report from
July 2010.
2. Sites Available Within the Eight-Year Planning Period
The land identified in the survey is designated in the Land Use Element of the General Plan for
residential or mixed-use (commercial/residential) development, and public services are available to all
the sites. For the eight-year planning period covered by this Housing Element, the 2009 survey
referenced above indicated that adequate land is available for Pacifica to meet its regional housing
needs. Many of the sites are easily served with utilities and roads, are close to community services and
shopping, have no major physical hazards, would be consistent with adjoining development, and are
zoned for residential development. These sites can also accommodate housing for all income levels.
For a discussion of farm worker housing, see Section II.6.H.
It should be noted that the survey did not include second unit potential or density bonuses. Significant
variability in the factors contributing to eligibility and suitability for second units and density bonuses
made such analysis infeasible. Therefore, the potential number of new units presented for each site
could be higher than the range of units presented in the survey.
At the time of adoption of the 2015-2023 Housing Element, the City was in the process of updating its
General Plan, including the Land Use Element. Some General Plan land use designations affecting
housing may change if the City Council adopts the draft Land Use Element of the General Plan in its
current form. Notably, the residential component permissible in all “Commercial” designations in the
current General Plan may be consolidated within new mixed use designations in the draft Land Use
Element of the General Plan. The result would be that housing would be allowed in fewer areas of the
city but at higher densities. In order to circumvent the need to amend the Housing Element after
adoption of a new Land Use Element, the Housing Element contains two maps and two tables of
potential housing development sites. The first map/table set identifies sites suitable for housing
                                                      71

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
development under the current Land Use Element of the General Plan, adopted in 1980. The second
map/table set identifies sites suitable for housing development under the draft Land Use Element of the
General Plan if it is adopted in its current form (March 2014 version). The City will take appropriate
steps to ensure General Plan consistency and RHNA accommodation within the Housing Element if
there are any changes to the draft Land Use Element of the General Plan that affect the housing sites
identified below.
Figure III-1 displays the locations of potential housing sites suitable under the current Land Use
Element of the General Plan, and Table III-1 summarizes site-specific details pertaining to the
development potential of these sites. The City has identified sites capable of accommodating 434
housing units.

            A. Environmental and Physical Constraints
  Environmental constraints known to the City that could affect residential development in areas planned
  for such use are the potential presence of the San Francisco garter snake and the California red-legged
  frog. These species are present in various locations throughout Pacifica, and only site-specific
  biological analysis can confirm their presence. When biological investigations for earlier developments
  have located populations of these species, the City has worked with developers to provide mitigation by
  protecting potential affected areas of habitat for these species. Mitigation has included altering
  development plans so as not to disturb site areas comprising habitat. Although the City does not
  consider the presence of these species a significant constraint to the accommodation of the City's share
  of regional housing needs, identification of these species at any given housing development site could
  be quite impactful on an individual project basis.
  Physical constraints to housing development in Pacifica include hillside erosion, coastal erosion, and
  seismic hazards. Landslides and slope failures can result from any of the listed hazards and have
  presented serious problems in the past. The City is unaware of any immediate or direct threat to any of
  the identified housing sites from these constraints, but further geological analysis as part of a
  development review process could jeopardize initial site plans. Unstable or unsuitable soils for
  development could reduce maximum density at housing sites. It is possible, however, to address most
  physical constraints of this sort through enhanced engineering techniques and appropriate residential
  design. The trade-off to this approach is greater development expense, which can jeopardize housing
  affordability. None of the sites identified for residential development during the planning period are
  within known hazard areas. Seven of the selected sites, however, are identified in the Open Space Task
  Force report as candidates for preservation. These parcels include the Calson, Fish, Hacienda
  Court/Place, Lower Gypsy Hill, Rock, San Pedro Road, and Zeebros properties. Although these
  properties have been identified in the Open Space Task Force report as candidates for preservation, they
  have not been designated as open space and there are no development limitations imposed on these
  properties.
                                                                  80

All sites identified for residential development are within existing service areas for water, sewer, and
electrical utilities. The City is unaware of any service limitations that would affect any of the residential
development sites.
        B. Zoning Appropriate to Accommodate Lower Income Housing
Government Code Section 65583.2 provides two options to demonstrate zoning appropriate to
accommodate housing affordable to lower income households. A jurisdiction may provide an analysis
demonstrating how identified zoning and densities encourage and facilitate the development of housing
for lower income households, or may utilize a default density deemed appropriate for the jurisdiction.
State law specifies the default density for Pacifica as 30 units per acre based on its “metropolitan”
location within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) with a population of 2,000,000 or greater.
However, Pacifica’s highest density residential designation allows 16-21 units per acre, less than the
State’s default density. Therefore, the City will not rely upon the default density method, and instead
will conduct the alternative analysis.
The following analysis, based on factors including market demand, financial feasibility, and
development project experience, will demonstrate Pacifica’s existing adopted densities are appropriate
to accommodate housing affordable to lower income households, including those with extremely low,
very low, and low incomes.
As indicated above, the City is relying primarily on sites with High-Density Residential (HDR) and
Commercial land use designations within its General Plan. The corresponding zoning for these sites is
R-3, R-3-G, C-1, or C-2. The HDR land use designation has a minimum density of 16 units per acre.
When combined with R-3 zoning, R-3/HDR sites allows up to 21 units per acre, the maximum
permissible density under the HDR designation. Sites with Commercial land use designations have no
minimum residential density. The maximum density of Commercial sites with C-1 or C-2 zoning is 22
units per acre. The calculated maximum densities for each site in Table III-1, above, are realistically
attainable, as will be shown in the analysis that follows.
Affordable housing developers have stated that Pacifica’s adopted densities are appropriate for the City
and that several developments at similar densities have been constructed in jurisdictions similar to
Pacifica. The City evaluated its current multi-family development standards and on-site improvement
requirements (e.g., setbacks, building height, parking and open space requirements, commercial
component requirement in commercial zones), and determined that maximum densities could be
obtained in R-3, R-3-G, C-1, and C-2 zones. As an example, using a typical site plan design for a three-
story mixed-use development on a .96-acre site with a 35-foot building height requirement, 2 parking
spaces per unit parking, and 450 square feet per unit open space requirement, maximum densities of 21
or more units per acre can be achieved.
Supporting the realistic capacity estimates are the high land costs. For example, residential parcels in
Pacifica in 2014 cost over $1,000,000 per acre, with associated construction costs exceeding $150 per
square foot (Section II.7.B). These costs promote development at maximum densities to make multi-
family residential development economically feasible by maximizing the number of residential units per
acre.

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
In addition, a review of recent multi-family residential developments approved and constructed reveal
that multi-family developments, as a result of incentives for housing affordable to lower income
households and a local density bonus, achieved densities greater than the maximum density of 21 units
per acre. This is a direct result of City efforts to assist developers in making residential development
economically feasible in a high cost area by maximizing density. See Table III-3.

In addition to State Density Bonus Law, the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance offers the incentive of
increased density and flexibility in development standards in exchange for housing which will help
meet the City’s need to provide rental housing and housing affordable to persons with extremely low,
very low, and low incomes. Multi-family residential projects can exceed their maximum density if
provision is made for rental housing, affordable housing, housing for seniors, or housing for persons
with disabilities. The amount of the density bonus ranges from 15 percent for entirely rental housing to
50 percent for housing affordable to persons with extremely low, very low, and low incomes, seniors, or
persons with disabilities. The ordinance allows, in addition to a density increase, a reduction in the
floor area of affordable units and a relaxation of City parking standards. This has resulted in densities
that exceed those allowable under the density bonus alone.
Commercially Zoned Sites
As discussed earlier, the City’s Commercial-zoned sites will accommodate a majority of the housing
need for lower income units based on the minimum and average expected densities. The City based this
conclusion upon two assumptions: First, most sites identified in districts allowing mixed-use (C-1, C-2
and C-R), will be developed with residential components, and second, developers will build to the
average expected densities for each of these districts.
The first of these assumptions is prudent in light of recent trends. As shown in Table III-4, all recently
proposed mixed use projects in Commercial zone sites were almost exclusively residential use projects.
                                                            82

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
The commercial to residential ratios show that the developments were more residential and commercial
uses were only proposed on ground floors that faced a major street. Additionally, every project listed in
Table III-4 exceeded the average allowable density of the zone it was located in.

                     Source: City of Pacifica Planning Department, 2014
There are several other reasons why the majority of commercial sites are likely to develop as mixed-use
projects during the planning period:
         1. Mixed use zones have minimal commercial component requirements.
         2. The City supports housing in the City’s mixed-use areas.
         3. The General Plan supports residential development in mixed-use areas with incentives and
             programs for reduced parking and other cost-reducing measures.
         4. The majority of mixed-use sites are not prime corner sites favored by commercial
             establishments.
         5. The sites are located in close proximity to other sites where new residential development has
             been built or approved.
Thus, it is reasonable to assume that while not all future mixed-use sites will be developed as majority
residential-use projects, the vast majority of them will be developed as such with densities at or above
the average allowable densities. As mentioned previously, high land costs in Pacifica will require
developers to maximize density in order to ensure sufficient returns on their investments. Finally, the
City’s Draft General Plan amendment that is underway also suggests increasing housing densities to as
many as 50 units per acre in one of the new mixed-use designations that would be created.
Small Sites
Many of the available vacant sites identified by the City are located on smaller parcels. While it can be
difficult to develop housing affordable to lower income households, the City has provided incentives
and assistance resulting in such affordable housing on small sites. For example, the City approved an
affordable 10-unit project on a small 11,831 square foot lot that provides rental housing for families.
Three of the units are marketed to low-income families whose incomes are at or below 40 percent of the
Area Median Income. Five of the units are offered to low-income families whose incomes are at or
                                                             83

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
below 50 percent of the Area Median Income, and the remaining two units are leased to families whose
incomes are at or below 60 percent of the Area Median Income. This project, Pacifica Pines
Apartments, was financed by HOME funds, tax credit equity, and Community Development Block
Grant (CDBG) funds. Based on this example, it is clear that delivering affordable housing on small lots
is feasible in Pacifica. As listed in Table III-1, the Fish site is comprised of eight small parcels ranging
from 3,920 to 6,818 square feet. An opportunity exists to promote parcel consolidation to ensure that
minimum densities are achieved and integrated site planning occurs by working in partnership with
affordable housing developers to develop a Priority Lot Consolidation List with the goal of creating a
list of “ready to go” development sites that can be shown to potential developers. The list should:
         1. Prioritize sites located in General Plan land use areas designed for multi-family residential
             development (High-Density Residential and Commercial sites);
         2. Consider common ownership patterns, the physical condition of existing buildings, on-site
             constraints, and the Assessor’s ratio of improvement value to land value – an indicator of
             underutilization of land; and
         3. Focus efforts on specific geographic areas with the greatest development potential according
             to the latest development trends and expressed developer interest, further identifying sites
             that may be candidates for the Affordable Housing Overlay District designation. The
             identified sites should be ideally located to meet the criteria for affordable housing grants
             and financing.
Vacant and Underutilized Properties
While the recycling (redevelopment) of sites would be new to the community, there are several
examples of existing mixed-use developments in Pacifica. The mixed-use aspect of such developments
is not only consistent with the City’s policies, but also recent trends throughout the County and
neighboring jurisdictions.
The City will assist developers in the redevelopment of nonvacant sites with residential uses by:
         1. Providing regulatory incentives;
         2. Developing and distributing promotional materials and public outreach;
         3. Tracking and monitoring the redevelopment of nonvacant sites identified in Table III-1 to
             identify best practices and cite examples of successful redevelopment to residential uses;
             and
         4. Review and revise programs as necessary if monitoring reveals that residential development
             of nonvacant sites is not occurring and if residential development on the sites is not resulting
             in appropriate affordable units to accommodate the City’s housing needs for each income
             group, specifically those with extremely low, very low, and low incomes.
The City will also:
         1. Contact owners of contiguous vacant and underutilized sites and introduce them to the idea
             of parcel consolidation; explaining the City’s regulations and how standards may be
             modified to make site assembly feasible and the use of affordable housing resources for
             financial or technical assistance;
                                                      84

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
         2. Conduct outreach to affordable housing developers informing them of development
             opportunities in the City through targeted mailings, emails and phone calls;
         3. Provide information on these “ready to go” sites on the City’s website and in response to
             inquiries by interested prospective affordable housing developers;
         4. Sharing examples with housing developers of successful development projects in the City
             on consolidated parcels;
         5. Offer incentives to developers to promote parcel consolidation, such as:
             a.  Density bonuses;
             b.  Priority permit processing;
             c.  Exemptions for zoning requirements;
             d.  Ministerial review of lot line adjustments;
             e.  Deferred development fees; and
             f.  Other incentives under the proposed Affordable Housing Overlay Zone program.
The City’s analysis of vacant and undeveloped sites identified approximately 926 acres of undeveloped
land within City limits. Underutilized sites were identified by using a ratio of the assessed value of
improvement to the assessed value of land (AV ratio). Parcels with an AV ratio of less than 1.0, where
the value of the building is less than the value of the land, were assumed to have redevelopment
potential. Parcels zoned for single-family residential use were not included in this analysis; neither
were protected open space, churches and institutional uses, or sites in public ownership. The analysis
found 121 acres of “underutilized” land in Pacifica in designations other than agricultural, public,
community, or institutional use.
City-owned Sites
City-owned housing sites provide unique opportunities to maximize the affordability of new housing.
This is especially important when considering how to accomplish development of housing for
extremely low income (ELI) individuals and families. Development of ELI housing is challenging
given the lower financial return to developers. Without appropriate incentives, developers typically
target affordable units to very low or low income categories.
When it owns a development site, the City may offer additional incentives if a development proposal
satisfies a special housing need or a special affordable housing need, including ELI units. The City-
owned Sanchez Library site shown in Table III-1 is zoned C-1 (Neighborhood Commercial) and may
provide an opportunity for ELI unit development. This site was originally developed in the early 1960’s
with a relatively low intensity, single-story library use. While the site houses an existing library, the use
will be discontinued if a new library is constructed elsewhere in the city, leaving the site available for
potential redevelopment. The site is near both residential and commercial areas, and has existing
infrastructure (water delivery and sewage treatment). These factors make the site available and
attractive for new and more intensive residential redevelopment. The development of this site in a
                                                      85

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
mixed-use configuration, consisting of commercial and residential uses, would be consistent with the
City’s economic and land use development strategies.
The Sanchez Library site holds additional promise as an affordable housing site in that the City, as
property owner, will possess greater control of its development potential. At the Sanchez Library site,
the City can exert leverage on any developer to encourage to the maximum extent practicable the
development of housing affordable to those with ELI. The City’s leverage may include an appropriate
array of development incentives, contributions from the housing trust fund, fee waivers, or other
incentives. The City will consider extending this philosophy to other sites it owns should their
development or redevelopment occur during the planning period.
Developable Units
As noted above, the majority of the affordable units constructed in the City are located in the R-3
(Multiple-Family Residential) district which allows for a density of 16-21 dwelling units per acre. A
total of five projects with 357 affordable units have been developed at this density. Another 15 acres of
vacant or underutilized land is within the R-3 zone. Based on this land availability, there is a possibility
for development of another 315 units at existing General Plan densities.
Further, approximately 95 acres of vacant or underutilized land exists in the C-1 (Neighborhood
Commercial), C-2 (Community Commercial), and C-R (Commercial Recreation) Districts. These
commercial zoning districts provide an opportunity for extremely low, very low and low income
housing. In the commercial districts density is controlled by a minimum lot area per dwelling unit of
2,000 square feet. Sites available within these zoning districts have the potential for an additional 2,069
residential units at maximum density.

IV. GOALS, QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES, AND POLICIES TO
MAINTAIN, PRESERVE, IMPROVE AND DEVELOP HOUSING
1. Purpose
The City has a number of ongoing policies and ordinances guiding its actions related to housing
development. These resulted from past efforts and completed programs from prior housing elements.
Policies in this section are integrated into the everyday activities of the City, and support the
development and preservation of housing at all income levels. In certain cases, however, the City’s
existing policy and legal framework are inadequate to fully support and foster housing development.
State Housing Law requires each housing element to document such situations where a local agency
must undertake additional policy or legislative actions related to the need to maintain, preserve, improve
and develop housing. The following section identifies these shortfalls, identifying action programs with
quantified objectives the City will undertake during the planning period. Specifically, California
Government Code, Article 10.6, Section 65583, states that the Housing Element shall include:
        "an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals,
policies, quantified objectives, financial resources, and scheduled programs for the preservation,
improvement, and development of housing..."
The following complies with state law, and also provides an analysis of Pacifica's success in achieving
the objectives identified in the 2007 Housing Element. The "2007 Objectives" are stated with a brief
overview of accomplishments, followed by new "2015 Objectives."
2. Overall Goals
Pacifica's General Plan contains overall goals that are applicable to each of the General Plan's 12
elements. Goals most relevant to the Housing Element are as follows:
           Strive to provide a decent home and satisfying environment for each resident.
           Protect the social mix, variety, and fundamental character of each neighborhood by
            providing for the safety and welfare of all residents equally.
3. Quantified Objectives
The goals, objectives, and programs contained in the City of Pacifica Housing Element strive to
encourage and incentivize the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing
affordable to persons of all income levels and special needs categories. Actions to be undertaken by the
City during the planning period seek to address City processes and policies (governmental constraints)
and external factors such as development costs (nongovernmental constraints) to reduce barriers to the
development of housing affordable to those with extremely low, very low, or low incomes.
                                                     87

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
Based on its goals, objectives, and programs outlined in the Housing Element, the City expects its
combined efforts and resources to achieve the following quantified objectives during the planning
period:

              subject to the provisions of Pacifica Municipal Code Title 9, Chapter 1, Article 2 “Rent
              Stabilization Regulations.”
              ** Includes preservation of 101 senior housing units at Casa Pacifica.
4. Ongoing Policies
The City of Pacifica embraces the need to maintain, preserve, improve, and develop housing for persons
at all income levels and for persons with certain special housing needs. As a result of its past efforts,
including action programs in previous housing elements, the City has incorporated various activities
related to housing best practices into its standard policies and operations. The following summary lists
the City’s orientation to the four key aspects of housing element actions: maintenance, preservation,
improvement, and development. The list is not inclusive of all housing policies of the City, but rather is
representative of Pacifica’s supportive orientation to housing projects. Some of the items listed were
previous action programs that the City accomplished, and it is no longer appropriate to list them as
action programs during the planning period. Other items listed do not have a timeline for
implementation given their ongoing nature, making it inappropriate to list them as action programs
during the planning period in response to SB 375’s requirements pertaining to action programs. Such
items included in this list may lack specific beneficial impacts and a defined date for accomplishment
                                                            88

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
given the uncertain nature and timing of applications for housing-related permits. Nevertheless, the
items below are best described as ongoing policies which are in place to facilitate housing projects
whenever necessary.
       A. Maintenance of Housing
                i. Implement the safe and sanitary criteria of the Housing Code.
       To encourage Code compliance and rehabilitation of housing in a degraded condition, City staff
       will note Housing Code violations during all field inspections. Common inspections include
       those for building permits or investigative inspections related to code enforcement complaints.
       The emphasis will be on voluntary compliance; however, where violations include immediate
       threats to life, safety, or sanitary conditions, staff will implement immediate corrective actions
       to mandate compliance. Staff will coordinate with the San Mateo County Health Department
       whenever necessary to leverage maximum resources to quickly resolve unsafe conditions.
                    Specific Action          - Document Housing Code violations during all inspections.
                    Responsible Agency - Building Division and Code Enforcement Division
       This policy was Action Program No. 1 in the 2007 Housing Element. It had a continuous time
       frame for implementation, and is more appropriate as an ongoing policy. City staff contacted
       more than 298 property owners related to housing maintenance issues during the 2007-2014
       planning period.
                ii. Prevent blight and the deterioration of housing units resulting from deferred
                    maintenance.
       The City has a large housing stock but relatively few building inspectors and code enforcement
       officials. Therefore, staff is unlikely to proactively identify all blighted or deteriorated
       conditions that exist at housing units. Staff will continue to respond to resident complaints
       about such conditions in their neighborhoods, partnering with property owners to make needed
       improvements.
                    Specific Action          - Document Housing Code violations during all inspections.
                    Responsible Agency - Building Division and Code Enforcement Division
       This policy was Action Program No. 2A in the 2007 Housing Element. It had a continuous time
       frame for implementation, and is more appropriate as an ongoing policy. City staff responded
       to 209 complaints regarding blight and deterioration during the 2007-2014 planning period;
       staff resolved all cases with the completion of necessary upgrades to abate the blight and
       deterioration of the respective housing units.
                                                     89
City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
                iii. Conserve energy through implementation of the California Green Building Code.
       The City adopted the California Green Building Code on 12/25/2013. Building Division staff
       review all building permit applications for new construction and building alterations for
       compliance with the Green Building Code.
                     Specific Action       - Adopt a Green Building Ordinance to assure that all new
                                             buildings and significant remodels incorporate green
                                             building practices and materials into the design.
                     Responsible Agency - Building Division
       This policy was Action Program No. 4B in 2007-2014 Housing Element (and program
       accomplishment is demonstrated under Action Program No. 4 in this Housing Element). The
       City will continue to implement this policy on an ongoing basis.
       B. Preservation of Housing
                i. Smoke Detectors
       In 1983, the City Council enacted Ordinance 363-C.S. requiring the installation of Fire
       Detection Systems in all housing units within the City. The Building Division verifies
       installations whenever there is an inspection related to other City permits. Otherwise, the
       Ordinance requires property owners to maintain smoke detectors as specified in Pacifica
       Municipal Code Article 4, Chapter 13.
                     Specific Action       - During all building permit inspections, verify installation
                                             of smoke detectors in accordance with the City Ordinance.
                                           - Issue correction notices and conduct follow-up inspections
                                             of housing units without required smoke detectors.
                     Responsible Agency - Building Division and Fire Department
       This policy was Action Program No. 3 in the 2007 Housing Element. It had a continuous time
       frame for implementation, and is more appropriate as an ongoing policy. City inspectors
       conducted more than 2,254 building permit inspections at different housing units during the
       2007-2014 planning period, verifying smoke detector installation in each case. The performed
       number of inspections – 322 – far exceeded the goal of inspecting 50 units per year.
                ii. Conditions of Approval
       As a condition of approval for housing developments dedicated to housing for seniors and/or
       lower income occupants and where the City grants a parking exception, parking waiver, or
       variance (typical Density Bonus Ordinance provisions), the City will impose a condition of
       approval requiring the developer to record a deed restriction on the property. The deed
                                                   90

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
       restriction will place in the chain of title notice that approval of the development was based
       upon a waiver or exception from City standards and that conversion of such development from
       its originally approved purpose may be infeasible unless it meets all applicable standards.
                     Specific Action        - Impose this condition of approval on all permits
                                               benefitting from a Density Bonus Ordinance approval or
                                               other projects receiving authorization to deviate from
                                               development standards in order to develop affordable
                                               housing types.
                     Responsible Agency - Planning Division
       This policy was Action Program No. 5f in the 2007 Housing Element. It had a continuous time
       frame for implementation, and is more appropriate as an ongoing policy. The Casa Pacifica
       Apartments development received a variance during its development, and any subsequent use
       will need to comply with all City development standards or else apply for a new variance
       permit.
                iii. Condominium Conversion
       The City minimizes housing impacts to renters by regulating the conversion of rental apartment
       housing to condominiums. The City’s Condominium Conversion Ordinance codified in
       Pacifica Municipal Code Title 9, Chapter 4, Article 24.5 requires an apartment property owner
       to demonstrate satisfaction of one of three pre-requisites prior to pursuing a conversion:
                    a. Multi-family vacancy rates exceed 5 percent citywide; or,
                    b. A super majority (75 percent) of existing tenants vote for conversion; or,
                    c. The property owner agrees to sell or rent 40 percent of converted units at rates
                       affordable to persons with low or moderate income.
                     Specific Action        - Implement the provisions of the Residential Condominium
                                               Conversions ordinance to minimize impacts on low- and
                                               moderate-income persons.
                     Responsible Agency - Planning Division
                iv. Designation of Historical Structures
       The City supports and encourages property owner-designation of historic structures as set forth
       in Pacifica’s Historic Preservation Ordinance. Enacted in 1984, one of the purposes of the
       Ordinance is to encourage preservation of historic structures. The Pacifica Historical Society
       has prepared a detailed inventory of historical and cultural sites and structures that would benefit
       from the appropriate designation. Additional structures and sites not included in the inventory
       are also eligible for designation subject to certain criteria.
                                                     91

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
                   Specific Action         - City staff will educate and encourage property owners
                                              about the benefits of pursuing historic preservation
                                              designation, including tax benefits. The financial benefits
                                              of designation can help owners dedicate additional
                                              resources toward property maintenance and/or
                                              improvements.
                   Responsible Agencies - Planning Division, Pacifica Historical Society
       This policy was Action Program No. 8 in 2007 Housing Element. It had a continuous time
       frame for implementation, and is more appropriate as an ongoing policy. The City has
       observed little interest from property owners in pursuing historical designations for their
       properties. Since 2010, only one site – the Dollar Radio Station – received a historical
       designation. Pacifica's ability to designate historical structures and sites is contingent upon
       property owner willingness. However, the City will continuously monitor opportunities to
       designate appropriate historical resources to protect and enhance their historical character,
       educating property owners about the benefits of historical designation. The City will strive to
       designate one site every other year.
       C. Improvement of Housing
               i. Engage with Property Owners of Deteriorated or Deteriorating Housing
       City Building Division and Code Enforcement staff will respond to complaints of substandard
       housing and unsafe building conditions. Upon initiating contact, City staff will inform property
       owners of the funding resources available to assist lower income property owners with housing
       improvements. The City will pursue a collaborative code enforcement posture when
       investigating and resolving these types of complaints whenever possible, except where
       immediate life or safety issues are present.
                   Specific Action         - Respond to complaints pertaining to blight or deterioration
                                              of housing units, providing informational materials on
                                              programs and funding available to eligible property
                                              owners in order to restore substandard housing.
                   Responsible Agency - Building Division and Code Enforcement Division
                   See Section 4.A.i and ii for related policies.
                                                    92

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
       D. Development of Housing
                i. Prioritize In-fill Residential Development
                     Specific Action          - Discuss this option with individual developers on a
                                                  project-by-project basis. Encourage inclusion of second
                                                  floor residential units where feasible.
                     Responsible Agency - Planning Division, Economic Development Division
       This policy was Action Program No. 9 in the 2007 Housing Element. It had a continuous time
       frame for implementation, and is more appropriate as an ongoing policy. The City has
       encouraged in-fill development in its meeting with developers. In 2013, the City encouraged
       infill within the Rockaway Beach neighborhood which resulted in the construction of three
       housing units in a mixed-use development on Dondee Way. The City will continue to work
       with property owners to facilitate mixed-use development on underutilized and vacant lots.
       However, the timing of individual development applications is difficult for the City to predict,
       and it is thereby difficult to establish a specific timeline and quantification for goal achievement.
       The main ways the City will prioritize in-fill development is by encouraging developers to
       intensify already developed sites with residential units above ground floor commercial spaces;
       by encouraging developers to develop vacant lots interspersed among developed sites, ensuring
       housing wherever possible; and, if the pace of development was to increase during the planning
       period, by ranking higher in the Growth Management Ordinance scoring process those
       developments planned for in-fill.
                ii. Provide an Encouraging Environment for Construction of Second Units
       City staff shall encourage and foster construction of second units when interacting with property
       owners and development professionals. Staff shall strive to find solutions to challenging
       development standards and to provide a clear explanation of necessary permit approvals
       required to construct a second unit, including estimated time frames and costs.
       It is not possible to assess the number of second units that will be developed in the City. The
       amount of such development will depend on a variety of factors including the size of individual
       properties, the placement and design of structures on individual sites, and neighborhood
       acceptance. The Second Unit Ordinance is discussed further under Action Program No. 11.
                     Specific Action          - Discuss this option with individual property owners.
                                                  Explain and encourage the development of second units
                                                  where feasible.
                     Responsible Agency - Planning Division
       This policy was Action Program No. 10 in the 2007 Housing Element. It had a continuous time
       frame for implementation, and is more appropriate as an ongoing policy. Since 1982, when the
                                                        93
City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
       City of Pacifica passed a Second Residential Unit Ordinance, it has permitted construction of
       second units on single family properties. It is still confusing and intimidating for many property
       owners to consider construction of a second unit, however. Planning and Building Division
       staff shall reduce barriers to second unit construction whenever possible.
               iii. Identify Opportunities to Include Housing Incentives in Development Applications
       Despite the dissolution of redevelopment agencies in California, the City still has tools and
       programs available to encourage development of housing affordable to those with extremely
       low, very low, and low incomes. These include the inclusion of Section 8 units in new
       developments; granting additional density and relaxing development standards under the
       Density Bonus Ordinance; requiring affordable housing through the Inclusionary Zoning
       Ordinance; allowing manufactured housing in residential zones; and, ensuring sufficient zoning
       for mixed-use development. City staff will seek all opportunities to encourage affordable
       housing development using these tools and others.
                     Specific Action        - Train staff on available housing tools.
                                            - Require staff to identify opportunities to explain
                                               affordable housing incentives to prospective developers.
                     Responsible Agency - Planning Division
               iv. Assist Affordable Housing Developers with Preparation of Funding and
Development Applications
       The City can assist with affordable housing development by providing nonfinancial support.
       City staff can provide assistance with affordable housing developer applications for government
       and nonprofit funding by serving as co-applicant or by endorsing applications. Staff can also
       assist developers to submit more complete planning applications by scheduling no-cost pre-
       application meetings to discuss City requirements and processes. More complete applications
       can undergo the City review process more quickly, thus saving time and money, and resulting in
       faster construction of affordable housing units.
                     Specific Action        - Co-apply or endorse funding applications.
                                            - Provide no-cost pre-application meetings for affordable
                                               housing projects.
                     Responsible Agency - Planning Division
               v. Require a Geotechnical Site Investigation Prior to Permitting Site Development
       Some potential building sites in Pacifica have unknown geological hazards that only a
       geotechnical site investigation can uncover. The potential of these hazards to threaten newly
       developed housing units warrants a careful investigation of each proposed housing site prior to
                                                    94
City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
       granting development approvals. In most cases, appropriate structural engineering can allow a
       development project to proceed. However, in extreme cases, identifying geotechnical hazards
       will allow the City to prohibit development in hazardous areas, including flood zones.
                    Specific Action         - Require geotechnical reports for all development
                                               applications where a property may be susceptible to
                                               hazardous impacts.
                    Responsible Agency - Planning Division, Building Division, Public Works
                                               Department
       This policy was Action Program No. 19 in the 2007 Housing Element. It had a continuous time
       frame for implementation, and is more appropriate as an ongoing policy. The City has
       implemented expanded requirements for geotechnical investigation since 1999, and strictly
       applies the requirements.
                vi. Reference the Open Space Task Force Report When Evaluating Development
Proposals for Sites Identified in the Report
       Open space preservation is an important community priority. In 1988, the City Council
       accepted a report prepared by the Open Space Task Force, a group comprised of Pacifica
       residents interested in protecting undeveloped lands within the City (the report was updated in
       2000). While not regulatory in nature, the Open Space Task Force Report identifies sites within
       Pacifica where proposed development should receive enhanced review. The purpose of the
       enhanced review is to consider ways to achieve the goals of a developer while preserving the
       natural aesthetic of a site whenever possible.
                    Specific Action         - Refer to the Open Space Task Force Report when
                                               reviewing    residential   development      applications.
                                               Encourage developers to retain natural features of
                                               development sites whenever possible.
                    Responsible Agency - Planning Division
       This policy was Action Program No. 14 in the 2007 Housing Element. It had a continuous time
       frame for implementation, and is more appropriate as an ongoing policy. The City will
       implement this ongoing policy as part of a broader framework of General Plan objectives and
       policies and Municipal Code ordinances that address development of open space areas.
                vii. Encourage development of a shared living community (co-housing) in an
appropriate location to provide diversity in housing opportunities.
       The City has included this action program in at least its previous two housing elements
       (covering 20 years or more). During this time, no shared living/co-housing communities have
       been developed in Pacifica. However, the Planning Commission and some members of the
       community believe this remains an important type of development that the City should
                                                    95
City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
        encourage. The City’s existing Zoning Code could accommodate such a development if
        proposed.
                    Specific Action         - Discuss the potential for development of a co-housing
                                                project with owners, prospective developers, and
                                                organizations specializing      in      shared        living
                                                communities. Encourage applications in appropriate
                                                locations.
                    Responsible Agency - Planning Division
        This policy was Action Program No. 17 in the 2007 Housing Element. It had a continuous time
        frame for implementation, and is more appropriate as an ongoing policy.
5. Housing Maintenance
A majority of residents in Pacifica live in high-quality, safe housing. The City strives to keep the good
condition of the housing stock by promoting property maintenance. It is far less expensive to maintain
housing units than it is to build new housing or to renovate substantially deteriorated housing.
Therefore, maintenance is an essential aspect to providing adequate, affordable housing. However,
there are housing units in Pacifica that require rehabilitation. The City’s Building Official estimates that
approximately 3 to 5 percent of all units within the City need rehabilitation.
        A. Policies, Programs and Objectives to Maintain Housing
POLICIES        - ENCOURAGE UPGRADES TO AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CITY'S
                  EXISTING HOUSING UNITS;
                - IMPROVE NEIGHBORHOOD AESTHETICS;

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
Action Program No. 1
Advertise available grant and loan funding for lower income property owners to rehabilitate
substandard housing units.
Specific Action      - Display program literature at the Planning Department counter and website.
                     - Distribute program literature to potential participants identified during
                        housing-related inspections.
Responsible Agency - Building Division; Code Enforcement Division; San Mateo County Housing
                        and Community Development Division
Financing            - Community Development Block Grants, California Housing Finance Agency,
                        Federal Housing Authority
2007 Objectives      - Continue to assist the San Mateo County Housing and Community
                        Development Division with advertisement of their programs on the City's web
                        site and by distributing literature from the County at the Planning Department,
                        Sharp Park Library, Sanchez Library, Pacifica Resource Center, City
                        Community Center, and other public locations while decreasing the 18 unit per
                        year rehabilitation goal to 2 units per year. In addition, the City will explore
                        the feasibility of applying for housing rehabilitation funds.
Accomplishments      - Distributed more than 75 program brochures throughout all City facilities.
                     - The San Mateo County Housing Authority Rehabilitation Program
                        rehabilitated 37 Pacifica housing units between 2007-2014 with approximately
                        $105,000 in funding.
2015 Objectives      - The City has observed little interest from residents to apply for housing
                        rehabilitation loans. Additionally, County program staff has indicated that
                        budget reductions have impacted its ability to administer the program,
                        resulting in a lower program capacity to assist Pacifica residents. The City
                        will, however, continue to market the County’s rehabilitation program to
                        provide the opportunity to apply to any interested residents. The City will
                        strive to refer enough residents to ensure two residents will successfully apply
                        for the program each year.
Time Frame           -  1/31/2015 through 12/31/2015: Two applicants
                     -  1/1/2016 through 12/31/2016: Two applicants
                     -  1/1/2017 through 12/31/2017: Two applicants
                     -  1/1/2018 through 12/31/2018: Two applicants
                     -  1/1/2019 through 12/31/2019: Two applicants
                     -  1/1/2020 through 12/31/2020: Two applicants
                     -  1/1/2021 through 12/31/2021: Two applicants
                     -  1/1/2022 through 1/31/2023: Two applicants

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
Action Program No. 2 (formerly Action Program No. 4A in 2007-2014 Housing Element)
Reduce potential loss of life and property damage from earthquakes by requiring seismic upgrades
(structural strengthening and hazard mitigation) to unsafe buildings, which includes unreinforced-
masonry buildings and soft-story buildings (those with ground floors having a lateral stiffness
significantly less than that of the stories above).
Specific Action          - Consider development of a mandatory seismic upgrade ordinance.
                         - Develop long-term funding sources to assist property owners with the
                           expenses of upgrading housing units.
Responsible Agency - Building Division
Financing                - City funds; Grant funding from federal or state agencies, or nonprofit
                           organizations.
2007 Objectives          - Develop funding sources to minimize the financial impact of retrofits on low-
                           and moderate-income residents.
Accomplishments          - The City has not enacted a mandatory seismic upgrade ordinance. Therefore,
                           it has not developed a funding program to implement an ordinance. The City
                           continues to consider whether such an ordinance and funding program are
                           feasible. In the meantime, property owners may perform seismic upgrades on
                           a voluntary basis and obtain private financing for the work. Since 2007, zero
                           property owners have performed voluntary seismic upgrades.
2015 Objectives          - Continue to distribute program literature.
                         - Successfully refer five households per year.
Time Frame               - 12/31/2016: Determine whether development of a mandatory seismic upgrade
                           ordinance and sourcing of sufficient funding to implement upgrades are
                           feasible.
                         - 12/31/2017: If feasible, complete enactment of ordinance and implementation
                           of seismic upgrade funding program(s).

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
6. Housing Preservation
Development of rental housing affordable to persons with extremely low, very low, and low incomes in
Pacifica has lagged behind demand for affordable units for many years. Therefore, preservation of
existing affordable units is essential to meeting affordable housing demands. The loss of any affordable
units due to preventable circumstances would exacerbate the housing affordability problem in Pacifica.
A continued supply of affordable rental housing is important to meet the housing needs of Pacifica's
population.
Rental housing, dedicated housing for lower income persons, seniors, and persons with disabilities, as
well as mobile homes all provide vital affordable housing. The City has many market rate apartment
developments, several dedicated senior housing developments, and a 93-unit mobile home park. All of
these units are essential to a mixed, affordable housing stock. Yet, units of this sort are particularly
threatened by potential decisions of property owners to pursue market rate returns. Apartment owners
could pursue conversion to condominiums to generate immediate capital from the long-term value of
their properties. Owners of subsidized developments could choose to terminate their participation in the
programs, triggering a chain of events leading to displacement of long-time low-income tenants.
Additionally, the mobile home park operator could seek to develop other housing types at the site,
causing the relocation of low-income tenants with existing support systems in place in the community.
There are three main ways to preserve existing rental housing affordable persons with extremely low,
very low, and low incomes in Pacifica: a) to monitor rental units developed with a density bonus or
other development concessions; b) to regulate conversions of rental housing to condominiums; and, c)
to monitor long-term plans for the mobile home park operator. The Density Bonus Ordinance permits
certain housing projects (see Section 7.D.ii) to exceed the maximum density designation for a site and
also to develop the site with relaxed standards. The City grants these allowances subject to the
continued affordability of units for a defined period of time. The City must monitor housing units to
ensure property owners are operating the sites in conformance with their development approvals.
Conversions of apartments to condominiums can also result in significant losses of rental housing when
market conditions are suitable for conversion. When conversions occur, many renter occupants are
unable to obtain financing necessary to purchase their units, which can lead to their displacement. The
City has enacted an ordinance regulating condominium conversions, and limits conversions to a defined
set of circumstances.
The Land Use Element recognizes the importance of preserving the mobile home park. Accordingly,
the City adopted an ordinance in 1990 which regulates conversion of mobile home parks to other uses.
The ordinance provides procedures and standards for closure of the mobile home park to mitigate
adverse impacts of displacement of existing residents while providing economically viable and
reasonable use of the land.

        A. Preservation of Housing Affordability
POLICY          -        PREVENT THE CONVERSION OF EXISTING AFFORDABLE
HOUSING UNITS TO LESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING TYPES
Action Program No. 3
Develop programs to help preserve the "at risk" units at Casa Pacifica senior housing complex.
Specific Actions         - Contact the Casa Pacifica owner to inquire about ongoing intentions to
                           continue participation in the Section 8 program. The property owner is
                           currently bound by a five year program participation agreement. Any decision
                           to end program participation would require a notice by1/31/2019.
                         - Respond to any notice of intent required by Government Code Section
                           65863.10 or federal law, and send copies of any notice received to the
                           California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD).
                         - Upon any indication of owner intent to end Section 8 program participation,
                           partner with HCD and other county, state, federal, and nonprofit partners to
                           assess potential impacts and to formulate a strategy to mitigate any negative
                           impacts on apartment residents.
Responsible Agency - Planning Division
Financing                - City funds
2007 Objectives          - The 2007 Housing Element did not contain clear objectives related to this goal.
                           The intent of the action program was to preserve affordability of the Casa
                           Pacifica Apartments.
Accomplishments          - Casa Pacifica Apartments continued its participation in the Section 8 subsidy
                           program throughout the 2007-2014 planning period.
2015 Objectives          - Monitor Casa Pacifica Apartments for any indication of intent to cease
                           participation in the Section 8 program. Formulate a comprehensive response
                           with affordable housing partners to any notice of intent to cease Section 8
                           participation.
Time Frame               - 12/31/2018: Contact property owner to inquire about long-term intentions for
                           the site. Due to the length of the current participation agreement (1/31/2015
                           through 1/31/2020), a single inquiry will suffice during the planning period.
Additional Discussion: The 2007 Housing Element contemplated a variety of potential responses to a

Action Program No. 4
Encourage preservation of the existing mobile home park as an important source of low- and moderate-
income housing.
Specific Actions     - Contact mobile home park operator to inquire about ongoing intentions to
                       maintain the use. The City has an established relationship with the operator of
                       the 93-unit Pacific Skies Estates mobile home park on Palmetto Avenue. The
                       operator recently made substantial investments into park improvements, and
                       has stated its intention to operate the mobile home park on a long-term basis.
                     - Maintain in effect the mobile home park conversion ordinance (Ordinance No.
                       550-C.S.) and monitor the city’s only mobile home park for any indications of
                       a potential conversion.
                     - Upon any indication of park operator intent to pursue site conversion,
                       administer and enforce Ordinance No. 550-C.S. to regulate conversion of
                       mobile home parks to other uses without relocation assistance to tenants and
                       other mitigation measures.
Responsible Agency - Planning Division
Financing            - City funds
2007 Objectives      - Continue preservation of the existing 93 mobile home units.
Accomplishments      - The mobile home park is still in operation, providing a valuable source of
                       housing for low- and moderate-income individuals and families. There were
                       no applications for conversion of the mobile home park during the 2007-2014
                       planning period.
2015 Objectives      - Monitor mobile home park operator’s long-term intentions for the site,
                       encouraging maintenance of the mobile home park use. Administer Ordinance
                       No. 550-C.S. if necessary. Unless development of additional mobile home
                       parks occurs during the planning period, the maximum performance related to
                       this policy would be one mobile home park conversion.
Time Frame           - By 12/31 in 2017 and 2020: Contact property owner to inquire about long-
                       term intentions for the site.

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
Action Program No. 5
Ensure proper marketing of housing affordability programs and groups by partner agencies, including
the Reverse Annuity Mortgage (RAM) program, Human Investment Project (H.I.P.) Homesharing
Program, Lease-Purchase Program, emergency shelters, Project Sentinel, and Center for the
Independence of the Disabled. These programs and organizations assist lower income persons,
seniors, and persons with disabilities to stay in their homes. Project Sentinel specifically, and other
organizations generally, will provide fair housing services to the City’s residents and property owners.
Services may include:
                      - Distributing educational materials to property owners, apartment managers,
                         and tenants.
                      - Conducting public presentations with different community groups.
                      - Responding to complaints of discrimination (e.g. complaint intake,
                         investigation, and resolution).
                      - Referring services to appropriate agencies.
Specific Action       - Periodically train City staff with frequent public interactions on available
                         resources.
                      - Periodically contact partner agencies to verify referrals and cross-referrals are
                         ongoing.
Responsible Agencies - Planning Division; Parks, Beaches, and Recreation Department
Financing             - City funds
2007 Objectives       - One (1) home per year
Accomplishments       - Despite repeated attempts, staff was unable to obtain performance data
                         indicating the number of Pacifica residents enrolled in the RAM program and
                         participating in the H.I.P Homesharing program.
2015 Objectives       - Pacifica will change the focus of this goal to staff training and encouragement
                         of partner organizations. City staff will train other staff on available housing
                         referral resources, and will contact partner agencies to determine the level of
                         service they are providing to Pacifica residents. The City has no control over
                         the quantity of persons served by the referral programs, but can monitor the
                         level of service being provided to residents.
Time Frame            - Bi-annually by 12/31 in 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021: Conduct training of
                         Planning Division, Code Enforcement Division, and Parks, Beaches, and
                         Recreation staff regarding available housing referral programs, services, and
                         agencies.

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
                        - Bi-annually by 12/31 in 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021: Contact partner agencies
                          to verify whether they continue to make referrals and cross-referrals to other
                          assistance agencies.
         The following is a summary of the above-mentioned housing referral programs and
organizations:
                The Reverse Annuity Mortgage (RAM) Program
                This program allows people over 62 to borrow from their home equity at a fixed interest
rate for up to 10-12 years. To qualify, RAM loan recipients must live in their homes and have little or
no mortgage balance. The loans allow homeowners to live in their homes, and convert equity into
income.
                Human Investment Project (H.I.P.) Homesharing Program
                H.I.P – funded through private and public sources – matches homeowners seeking
housemates with tenants seeking housing. Income provided to senior and single-parent homeowners
from renting a room in their home can help them to afford monthly housing payments. The H.I.P.
program identifies and screens potential tenants for program participants. Although not explicitly
limited by income, the program focuses on assisting lower income individuals.
                Lease-Purchase Program
                The California Home Source Lease-Purchase Home Ownership Program is a new tool
for cities, counties, and other government agencies in the Bay Area to help their constituents achieve
home ownership. The program helps individuals and families overcome the cash and credit barriers
they often face when attempting to purchase a home. California Home Source is a service of the
Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) Finance Authority for Non-Profit Corporations. The
program provides down payment and closing costs assistance to help working individuals and families
with credit problems.
                Project Sentinel
                A program that advances fair housing by investigating complaints of discrimination in
housing due to race, religion, marital status, sex or national origin.
                Center for Independence of Individuals with Disabilities
                An organization that provides services to persons with disabilities, including housing
rehabilitation assistance and accessibility modifications.
                                                    104

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023

7. Housing Improvement
There are many expenses associated with owning housing. Whether one owns a single-family home or
a multi-family apartment complex, the challenges of paying monthly loans, annual taxes and insurance
can leave few resources remaining to maintain the property. After extended neglect, many properties
decline in exterior appearance and interior functionality. Neighborhood aesthetics and character can
suffer as disinvestment by a single property owner can encourage disinvestment by others. Inside
housing units, deterioration can lead to violations of building, health, and safety codes, creating
substandard housing conditions.
Property owners, especially those with lower incomes, can feel trapped by declining properties. Unable
to afford less expensive maintenance activities, many remain unable to afford costly repairs stemming
from neglect. The result is the continued decline of distressed properties until they detract from
neighborhood character and are unsuitable for habitation. Proactive measures are necessary to restore
declining housing stock to a safe and attractive condition. To the maximum extent feasible, the City
shall seek to leverage its own investments and available funding from external partners to improve the
quality of its housing stock and neighborhoods. Energy conservation also can play an important role in
improving housing. Less energy consumption means lower monthly utility bills, saving property
owners money each month and allowing them to direct some of the savings towards improving their
housing.
        A. Policies, Objectives, and Programs to Improve Housing
POLICIES         - ENCOURAGE          CODE       COMPLIANCE           THROUGH           PROACTIVE
                   ENGAGEMENT, EDUCATION, AND ENFORCEMENT;
                 - LEVERAGE CITY INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE THE CHARACTER OF
                   NEIGHBORHOODS;
                 - ENHANCE         HOUSING        AFFORDABILITY            THROUGH          ENERGY
                   CONSERVATION AND OTHER STRATEGIES.

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
Action Program No. 7
Emphasize housing rehabilitation to forestall decline in the housing stock. Utilize government subsidies
including Section 8 or other rental assistance programs to enhance owner affordability. Use the Code
Enforcement process to refer owners to apply for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds
for housing rehabilitation.
Specific Action         - Distribute program literature to property owners contacted during deteriorated
                          housing-related inspections.
                        - Include rehabilitation program information on the City’s website.
Responsible Agencies - Building Division; Code Enforcement Division; San Mateo County Housing
                          and Community Development Division
Financing               - Community Development Block Grants, California Housing Finance Agency,
                          Federal Housing Authority
2007 Objective          - Pacifica's goal is to increase awareness of the San Mateo County Department
                          of Housing and Community Development's housing rehabilitation programs
                          through more aggressive advertising on the City's web site and through the
                          distribution of brochures at the City Hall (annex), Sharp Park Library, Sanchez
                          Library, Pacifica Resource Center, community center and other public
                          locations. Pacifica will modify its Action Program goal from 34 rehabilitated
                          units per year to 10 units per year - 2 low-income rental units and 8 low-
                          income owner occupied units.
Accomplishments         - The San Mateo County Housing Authority Rehabilitation Program
                          rehabilitated 37 Pacifica housing units between 2007-2014.
2015 Objectives         - Distribute rehabilitation and housing affordability program information to 300
                          property owners during building code or property maintenance code
                          interactions with City inspectors. Building Division and Code Enforcement
                          staff responded to 298 housing-related complaints between 2007-2014 (42 per
                          year), and the City estimates the figure will remain consistent during the
                          planning period.
Time Frame              - 1/31/2015 through 12/31/2015: Three referrals
                        - 1/1/2016 through 12/31/2016: Four referrals
                        - 1/1/2017 through 12/31/2017: Four referrals
                        - 1/1/2018 through 12/31/2018: Four referrals
                        - 1/1/2019 through 12/31/2019: Four referrals
                        - 1/1/2020 through 12/31/2020: Four referrals

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
Action Program No.8 (formerly Action Program No. 7A in 2007-2014 Housing Element)
Establish an incentive program for voluntary housing rehabilitation.
Specific Action        - Review each development application for opportunities to improve
                          community infrastructure and aesthetics. Pursue all available funding sources
                          to upgrade and enhance infrastructure and public property/right-of-way
                          aesthetics with improvements to streets, gutters, sidewalks, street trees, sewer
                          laterals, and other infrastructure.
Responsible Agencies - Department of Public Works; Planning Division
Financing              - Property owner funds; City funds
2007 Objectives        - The City shall support voluntary housing rehabilitation by upgrading streets,
                          gutters, sidewalks, street trees, sewer laterals, etc. Information will be
                          provided to developers and homeowners on the City's web site by early-2011.
Accomplishments        - In 2008, the City developed a Palmetto Avenue streetscape improvement plan
                          to underground utilities and improve the sidewalks, roadway, and landscaping
                          between Paloma Avenue and Clarendon Road. The plan has multiple phases
                          and timing of improvements is funding dependent. The City continues to
                          seek funding to proceed with Phase I (Utility Undergrounding). Once
                          completed, the project will mark a significantly improved aesthetic
                          environment along Palmetto Avenue and should spur additional private
                          investment in real estate improvements.
                       - The City Council in December 2011 enacted Ordinance No. 784-C.S.
                          requiring inspection of sewer laterals concurrent with transfer of title to
                          property, certain renovations, and in several other instances. Property owners
                          must improve sewer laterals to reduce the likelihood of blockage or failure
                          when inspections identify blockages or other substandard conditions. Since
                          enactment, the Ordinance has led to nearly 1,000 sewer lateral inspections, of
                          which almost two-thirds resulted in upgrades.
                       - The City Council took another infrastructure-related action in November
                          2012 with adoption of a resolution calling for complete streets throughout
                          Pacifica. The resolution approved a new administrative policy emphasizing a
                          connective street network and consideration of all modes of travel. Since
                          adoption, City staff has conditioned seven development approvals to require
                          installation of sidewalks and other pedestrian- and bicyclist-oriented
                          improvements.
2015 Objectives        - Continue implementation of Complete Streets policies. Condition all
                          development approvals to require improvements infrastructure and multi-
                          modal connectivity. Pursue funding to implement Phase I of the Palmetto
                          streetscape improvements and planning for subsequent phases.

Action Program No. 9 (formerly Action Program No. 4 in 2007-2014 Housing Element)
Promote Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) Company’s "Energy Savings Assistance Program." The
program is free and helps income-qualifying homeowners and renters make vital energy saving
improvements to their homes, including weatherstripping, caulking, insulation, minor home repairs,
compact fluorescent bulbs, and appliance replacement.
Specific Action       - Display program literature at the Planning Department counter and Planning
                        Department website.
                      - Distribute program literature to potential participants identified during
                        housing-related inspections.
Responsible Agency - Building Division; Planning Division; PG&E

2007 Objectives       - 35 units per year
Accomplishments       - Since 2007, PG&E has provided free weatherstripping, caulking, insulating,
                        and minor home repairs to 882 low income Pacifica residents. These
                        improvements have led to average energy savings of 391 kilowatt-hours
                        (kWh) for single-family residential participants; 229 kWh for multi-family
                        residential participants; and, 401 kWh for mobile home participants. Pacifica

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
8. Housing Development
As discussed in Section 5 “Regional Housing Needs,” Pacifica must approve or develop an average of
52 housing units per year between 2015 and 2023 to meet its housing needs across all income levels.
Categorized by income level, that equates to annual approval or development of 8 units each for
extremely low-income and very low-income persons, 9 units each for low-income and median-income
persons, and 20 units for moderate income persons. Considering the residential development trends in
Pacifica in recent decades, the City faces significant challenges to meeting these needs. It must ensure
to mitigate as many constraints as possible and undertake other activities to encourage and incentivize
housing development.
        A. Policies, Objectives, and Programs to Improve Housing
POLICY - PRIORITIZE MIXED-USE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT ON INFILL SITES.
Action Program No. 10
Prioritize in-fill mixed-use and residential development on underutilized sites and vacant sites
interspersed with developed areas.
Specific Action        - Encourage property owners to redevelop underutilized sites into mixed-use
                         developments with housing. Also encourage property owners of vacant lots
                         within developed areas to construct mixed-use or multi-family housing at these
                         sites.
Responsible Agency - Planning Division, Economic Development Division
Financing              - City funds
2007 Objectives        - None. New program in 2015 Housing Element.
Accomplishments        - In 2013, the City encouraged infill within the Rockaway Beach neighborhood
                         which resulted in the construction of three housing units in a mixed-use
                         development at 411 Dondee Way.
2015 Objectives        - Contact two property owners of identified underutilized sites per year to
                         encourage redevelopment with higher density, mixed-use projects.
                                                   111

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
Action Program No. 11
Encourage and facilitate construction of second residential units on properties zoned for single-family
residential uses in conformance with existing zoning regulations.
Specific Action         - The City should periodically evaluate the second unit requirements and review
                          procedures to ensure minimal constraints exist to their construction.
Responsible Agency - Planning Division
Financing               - City funds
2007 Objective          - Encourage the construction of two second residential units per year. There is
                          potential that approximately 14 second residential units will be developed
                          during this planning period. To further encourage the development of second
                          residential units, the City shall explore the feasibility of relaxing some of the
                          development regulations such as on-site parking. Other incentives to
                          encourage the development of second residential units may include fee
                          reductions and priority permit processing.
Accomplishments         - Three (3) second units were constructed from January 2007 to December
                          2014, resulting in an 11 unit shortfall from its 14 unit goal. Pacifica currently
                          promotes the second-unit program by providing property owners and
                          developers development information about adding a second unit.
2015 Objectives         - Encourage construction of two second residential units per year, or 16 second
                          units during the planning period. Periodically evaluate the City’s second unit
                          zoning regulations and inquire with residents and construction professionals as
                          to the perceived level of difficulty and expense associated with second unit
                          construction. Where perceptions suggest second unit construction is difficult,
                          develop strategies to revise the City’s regulations, such as by relaxing second
                          unit parking requirements.
Time Frame              - Bi-annually by 12/31 in 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022: Review and revise, as
                          necessary.

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
Action Program No. 16 (formerly Action Program No. 16C in 2007-2014 Housing Element)
Amend Zoning Ordinance to allow Emergency Shelters, Transitional and Supportive Housing.
Specific Actions     - Amend the Zoning Code to comply with Senate Bill (SB) 2 to allow
                        Emergency, Transitional and Supportive Housing without discretionary
                        approval.
                     - Create a definition of “emergency shelter” as “housing with minimal
                        supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six
                        months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may be
                        denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.”
                     - Create a definition of “transitional housing” as “buildings configured as rental
                        housing developments, but operated under program requirements that require
                        the termination of assistance and recirculating of the assisted unit to another
                        eligible program recipient at a predetermined future point in time that shall be
                        no less than six months from the beginning of the assistance.”
                     - Create a definition of “supportive housing” as “housing with no limit on
                        length of stay, that is occupied by the target population, and that is linked to
                        an onsite or offsite service that assists the supportive housing resident in
                        retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his
                        or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community. For the
                        purposes of this definition, “target population” means persons with low
                        incomes who have one or more disabilities, including mental illness, human
                        immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome
                        (AIDS), substance abuse, or other chronic health condition, or individuals
                        eligible for services provided pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental
                        Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5, commencing with Section 4500, of

                        from institutional settings, veterans, and homeless people.”
                     - Create a new permitted use in the R-1 (Single-Family Residential) zoning
                        district, an overlay zone, or another zoning district to permit emergency
                        shelters for up to 15 occupants, subject only to those development and
                        management standards that apply to residential development within the same
                        zone, except that the City may develop written, objective standards for those
                        criteria identified in Government Code Section 65583(a)(4)(A).
                     - Create new permitted uses in all residential districts and in commercial
                        districts permitting residential uses to permit transitional housing and
                        supportive housing as a residential use, subject only to those restrictions that
                        apply to other residential dwellings of the same type (e.g., single family,
                        duplex, condominiums, apartments) in the same zone in accordance with
                                                  117

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
                        Government Code Section 65583(a)(5). For example, transitional housing
                        located in an apartment building is permitted in the same manner as an
                        apartment building in the same zone or supportive housing located in a single-
                        family home is permitted in the same manner as a single-family home in the
                        same zone.
Responsible Agencies - Planning Division
Financing            - City funds
2007 Objectives      - Amend zoning ordinance to make explicit provisions for transitional and
                        supportive housing, and emergency shelters. Develop objective standards to
                        regulate emergency shelters as provided for under SB 2.
Accomplishments      - The City’s Zoning Code already permits by-right establishment of emergency
                        shelters under the zoning classification “special care facility” in all residential
                        districts. The by-right allowance pertains to facilities serving six or fewer
                        individuals. The special care facility classification also allows shelters for
                        “other need categories,” which can include transitional and supportive
                        housing. However, the City should consider enacting explicit authorization
                        for these types of uses as well as development standards for their
                        establishment and operations.
2015 Objectives      - Amend the Zoning Code to create new definitions for emergency shelters,
                        transitional housing, and supportive housing. Create new permitted uses for
                        these types of facilities to clarify their treatment by the City. Create
                        development standards for the establishment and ongoing operations of these
                        facilities.
Time Frame           - 9/30/2015: Develop and discuss at the Planning Commission potential
                        development standards for emergency shelters, transitional housing, and
                        supportive housing.
                     - 1/31/2016: Amend the Zoning Code to explicitly permit by-right emergency
                        shelters, transitional housing, and supportive housing.

                          annual developer roundtable to discuss development opportunities sites and
                          other development issues. Provide permit material and information about the
                          review process at the public counter explaining the various steps in the
                          process. This includes what materials need to be submitted and when and how
                          long review will take at each juncture, and support applications for funding.
Accomplishments        - The City frequently receives inquiries from developers of market rate and
                          affordable housing. Staff provides them with information related to Pacifica’s
                          development process and encourages them to proceed with their projects.
2015 Objectives        - Begin a bi-annual housing developer roundtable hosted by the City to provide
                          factual information on development sites and the City’s development process,
                          as well as to demonstrate a strong City commitment to affordable housing
                          development.
Time Frame             - Bi-annually by 12/31 in 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022: Host developer
                          roundtable.

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
9. Discontinued Programs
The City of Pacifica is a dynamic place, continually evolving and changing over time. This evolution
impacts the City across numerous dimensions, including the natural, built, political, legal, and financial
environments, The result is that certain programs proposed or undertaken in previous housing elements
are no longer relevant or feasible within the context of the current planning period. The following is a
summary of discontinued programs, including a brief listing of their accomplishments (if any) during
the 2007-2014 Housing Element planning period.
        A. Discontinued Program Listing
                i. Action Program No. 4B
             Complete and Adopt Green Building Ordinance.
      Specific Action                Adopt a Green Building Ordinance to assure that all new buildings
                                     and significant remodels incorporate green building practices and
                                     materials into the design.
      Reason for Discontinuance      The City enacted a local Green Building Ordinance on 12/13/2010,
                                     thereby establishing local standards for new and altered buildings.
                                     The City superseded its ordinance with the adoption of the
                                     California Green Building Code on 12/25/2013. The program is no
                                     longer necessary because the City completed this activity,
                                     achieving the desired outcome.
                ii. Action Program No. 11
             Develop program for establishment of Housing Fund from tax increment revenues to
             increase and improve low and moderate-income housing.
      Specific Action                Develop a program which will set forth the means of distributing
                                     funds generated by the Redevelopment Agency. Establish priority
                                     system.
      Reason for Discontinuance      In 2012 the California Legislature dissolved redevelopment
                                     agencies statewide with passage of Assembly Bill (AB) x1 26 and
                                     AB 1484. Dissolution of the City’s Redevelopment Agency
                                     rendered this activity infeasible.
                iii. Action Program No. 13
             Develop regulations to encourage density-open space trade-offs, such as clustering
             development, transferring development rights from sensitive to less sensitive land, and
             dedication of open space.
                                                   122

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
     Specific Action               Amend Zoning Ordinance to include procedure for transfer of
                                   development rights. Prepare inventory of potential "receiver sites."
                                   Continue to administer open space dedication policies.
     Reason for Discontinuance     The City enacted an ordinance governing transfer of development
                                   rights in 1989 (Ordinance No. 539-C.S.). The City also already has
                                   development provisions within the P-D (Planned Development)
                                   zoning district that allow deviation from strict implementation of
                                   development standards in order to achieve clustered development
                                   when it would lead to superior site design. This program was
                                   carried forward erroneously into the 2007-2014 Housing Element.
               iv. Action Program No. 13A
            Encourage housing development in clusters.
     Specific Action               Review clustered housing standards for incentives to build housing
                                   development in clusters
     Reason for Discontinuance     The City already has codified development provisions within the
                                   P-D (Planned Development) zoning district that allow deviation
                                   from strict implementation of development standards in order to
                                   achieve clustered development when it would lead to superior site
                                   design. The P-D district regulations have existed in Pacifica since
                                   1975, and this program was carried forward erroneously into the
                                   2007-2014 Housing Element.
               v. Action Program No. 15
            Promote the Density Bonus Ordinance in all new multifamily residential development.
            Encourage a mix of rental and owner housing types, including senior, low income,
            moderate, above moderate income, and entry-level home ownership for teachers, City
            employees, and others in Pacifica's workforce.
     Specific Action               Discuss the ordinance with individual developers.             Stress
                                   incentives for inclusion of affordable units.
     Reason for Discontinuance     Incorporated into ongoing policies related to Development of
                                   Housing (Section 4.D).
               vi. Action Program No. 16
            Encourage development of small houses which will fit more appropriately on small lots.
            Encourage development of small units in multi-family projects to provide more density
            without increasing massing. The market should limit cost of the units based on size.
                                                 123
City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
     Specific Action                Utilize the City’s Design Guidelines, design review process, and
                                    adaptable zoning provisions to encourage developers to build small
                                    units under appropriate circumstances.
     Reason for Discontinuance      The City has reviewed its Zoning Regulations and procedures and
                                    believes they are sufficient to encourage small unit development
                                    without undertaking an additional housing element program.
               vii. Action Program No. 16E
            Apply for State and Federal monies for direct support of extremely low-income housing.
     Specific Action                The City shall consider applying for State and Federal monies for
                                    direct support of low-income housing construction and
                                    rehabilitation. The City shall assess potential funding sources,
                                    such as, but not limited to, the Community Development Block
                                    Grant (CDBG), and HOME. The City shall also seek State and
                                    Federal funding specifically targeted for the development of
                                    housing affordable to extremely low-income households, such as
                                    the Proposition 1-C funds. The City shall promote the benefits of
                                    this program to the development community by posting
                                    information on its web page and creating a handout to be
                                    distributed with land development applications.
     Reason for Discontinuance      The City does not have a housing authority and does not have staff
                                    dedicated to housing programs. Given current budget constraints,
                                    establishment of such an agency with staff is infeasible. The San
                                    Mateo County Housing Authority administers the activities
                                    described in this action program and pursues funding on behalf of
                                    the City of Pacifica and other cities in San Mateo County.
               viii. Action Program No. 16F
            Consider using redevelopment funds for affordable housing.
     Specific Action                Consistent with State law, the City shall consider directing 20
                                    percent of the tax increment funds accruing to the Redevelopment
                                    Agency to affordable housing. If successful in receiving matching
                                    funds from other sources, the City shall encourage the
                                    Redevelopment Agency to work with affordable housing
                                    developers to utilize a portion of set-aside funds for development
                                    of housing affordable to extremely low-income households.
     Reason for Discontinuance      In 2012 the California Legislature dissolved redevelopment
                                    agencies statewide with passage of Assembly Bill (AB) x1 26 and
                                    AB 1484. Dissolution of the City’s Redevelopment Agency
                                    rendered this activity infeasible.
                                                  124

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
               ix. Action Program No. 18A
            Consider streamlining the permit process to expedite housing construction.
     Specific Action               Ensure that projects are reviewed and acted on in the shortest
                                   possible time consistent with the City's interest in complete review.
     Reason for Discontinuance     The City’s permitting process has not caused delays to housing
                                   development in any fashion that would benefit from streamlining
                                   actions.     Major delays to projects typically stem from
                                   environmental review under the California Environmental Quality
                                   Act (CEQA), a state statute the City cannot affect with
                                   streamlining actions.
               x. Action Program No. 18B
            Amend Manufactured Housing Ordinance regulations.
     Specific Action               Initiate the amendment of the manufacture housing building
                                   regulations to comply with state law.
     Reason for Discontinuance     The City has assessed its ordinance and believes it complies with
                                   state law. It allows manufactured housing to be installed in the R-1
                                   zoning district subject to a non-discretionary building permit.
               xi. Action Program No. 18C
            Consider streamlining the permit process to encourage and facilitate residential
            development on commercial sites (mixed-use).
     Specific Action               Ensure that commercial/residential projects are reviewed and acted
                                   on in the shortest possible time.
     Reason for Discontinuance     The City’s permitting process has not caused delays to housing
                                   development in any fashion that would benefit from streamlining
                                   actions.     Major delays to projects typically stem from
                                   environmental review under the California Environmental Quality
                                   Act (CEQA), a state statute the City cannot affect with
                                   streamlining actions.
                                                  125

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
               xii. Action Program No. 20A
            Encourage development of lower and moderate income housing in suitable areas to meet
            ABAG's projected housing need.
     Specific Action                 Prepare, publish, and distribute inventory of available sites.
                                     Facilitate development process.
     Reason for Discontinuance       Action program combined with 2015-2023 Housing Element
                                     Action Program No. 22.
               xiii. Action Program No. 21
            Continue to cooperate with the Pacifica Resource Center and emphasize its role in housing

                                     include shelters for victims of family violence, homeless persons,
                                     or “other needs categories” such as transitional housing and
                                     emergency shelters are permitted in the R-1 (Single-Family

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
                           V. COASTAL ZONE HOUSING
1. Purpose
The coastal zone in Pacifica is that area west of Highway 1 with a small extension east of the highway
between Reina del Mar and Burns Court. Pacifica has six coastal neighborhoods, which include (from
north to south) Fairmont West, West Edgemar/Pacific Manor, West Sharp Park, Rockaway Beach,
West Linda Mar, and Pedro Point. The coastal zone contains 16 percent of Pacifica’s land area but only
13 percent of its population.
State law includes several requirements for housing in the coastal zone. Specifically, Government Code
Section 65588 calls for jurisdictions to include in their housing elements information on the following:
        The number of new housing units approved for construction within the coastal zone after
         January 1, 1982;
        The number of existing residential dwelling units occupied by persons and families of low or
         moderate income that have been authorized to be demolished or converted since January 1,
         1982, in the coastal zone;
        The number of housing units for persons and families of low or moderate income required to
         be provided in new housing developments either within the coastal zone or within three miles
         of the coastal zone;
        The number of residential dwelling units for persons and families of low or moderate income
         that have been required for replacement or authorized to be converted or demolished. The
         review shall include the location of the replacement units in or within three miles of the coastal
         zone.
State law calls for replacement of demolished if determined to be feasible. In addition, all new
development in the coastal zone is required to include low and moderate income units if feasible. Due
to the small size of all new development in Pacifica's coastal zone, only one project approved since
1982 has included affordable units. Future projects within the coastal zone are also unlikely to yield
affordable units unless they develop eight or more housing units, and which point they become subject
to the City’s Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance.
2. Housing Unit Construction, Demolition, and Replacement
During the 2007-2014 Housing Element planning period, 11 housing units were constructed in the
coastal zone. When including areas in or within three miles of the coastal zone, the figure rose to 17
housing units (note: all developable areas of the City are located within three miles of the coastal zone).
During this same period, four housing units were demolished within the coastal zone. All four were
moderate-income units. Three units have been replaced with above-moderate income units, with two of
                                                     128

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
these units underway in the construction phase. The replacements occurred on the same sites within the
coastal zone. One unit, on Carmel Avenue, was not replaced.
While not demolished, other coastal zone housing units have been impacted during the 2007-2014
Housing Element planning period in such a way as to have the effect of demolition. The City’s
Building Official has determined that 20 rental housing units located at 320 Esplanade Avenue and 12
rental housing units located at 330 Esplanade Avenue (all 32 of which were affordable to low-income
persons) are unsafe for habitation due to severe coastal erosion.22 The units have not been replaced, and
it is unlikely they will ever be replaced on the same site. The City’s opinion of conditions at the site is
that coastal erosion is too severe and that future development at the site is unlikely, including remedial
measures to make the buildings once again habitable.
Since January of 1982, a total of 25 housing units have been demolished in the coastal zone. Of these, 5
were low-income units, 17 were moderate-income units, and 3 were above-moderate income units.
Two of these homes, located west of Beach Boulevard in West Sharp Park were lost in a storm.
Another unit on Olympian Way in Pedro Point was demolished because it was threatened by a slide.
Eight of the units demolished since 1982 did not suffer storm damage. One moderate-income structure
on Salada Avenue was demolished because it was not up to Building Code standards. It was not
replaced. Two moderate-income units on Francisco Boulevard were demolished because they were not
up to Building or Fire Code standards. These units have not yet been replaced.
Additionally, in 1998 seven homes, located on Esplanade Avenue in Pacific Manor were lost in a storm.
Another above-moderate income unit on Blackburn Terrace in Pedro Point was demolished. It was
replaced in 1998 by an above-moderate income unit. Two above-moderate income units in the West
Rockaway Beach area were also demolished.
Twenty-two mobile homes threatened by the 1983 storm were moved out of the Pacific Skies Estates
Mobile Home Park on Palmetto Avenue. To date, 14 of the mobile homes have been replaced in the
park and the park operator will continue to replace older mobile homes.
Nine structures outside the coastal zone have been demolished since January of 1987. Four destroyed in
a 1982 storm included two on Valdez Way in Linda Mar and two on Oddstad Boulevard in Park
Pacifica. Three other structures on Reina del Mar in Vallemar were demolished. They were replaced in
1984, 1998, and 2000, respectively. Another unit was demolished in 1999 on Crespi Drive in the West
Linda Mar neighborhood. In 1992 a unit was demolished on Perez Drive in the Linda Mar area. The
unit was replaced on-site.
No housing units for persons and families of low or moderate income were required to be provided in
new housing developments either within the coastal zone or within three miles of the coastal zone
during the 2007-2014 Housing Element planning period.

   The Building Official notified tenants of 330 Esplanade Avenue December 17, 2009, and tenants of 320 Esplanade
Avenue on April 29, 2010.

                            VI. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
On December 16, 2014, the Planning Commission held a study session public review workshop to
discuss the draft Housing Element and to solicit new ideas for policies and action programs from
residents, housing advocates, and other interested parties. Additionally, on April 20, 2015, the Planning
Commission held a public hearing to consider the Housing Element, including public testimony. The
Planning Commission forwarded the Housing Element to the City Council with a recommendation of
approval. The City Council held a public hearing on the Housing Element on May 11, 2015, again
seeking public input from residents, housing advocates, and other interested parties. As the public
review process progressed, the City posted a draft version of the Housing Element on the City’s
website, as well as on the “21elements.com” website for convenience of public review.
Notices of the study session workshop and public hearings were published in the Pacifica Tribune
newspaper, e-mailed via the City’s public information system, posted on the Nextdoor community
engagement web platform, posted on the City’s website, mailed to interested parties, and posted in the
following locations:
        1.  Sanchez Library (Park Pacifica)
        2.  Pacifica Library (West Sharp Park)
        3.  Pacifica Community Center (Linda Mar)
        4.  Pacifica City Hall
        5.  Planning Department
Additionally, the City sent notices to 50 nonprofit housing organizations and service providers servicing
special needs populations, including Bay Area Legal Aid, Center for the Independence of the Disabled,
Center on Homelessness, Community Legal Services, Golden Gate Regional Center, HIP Housing,
InnVision/Shelter Network, Mental Health Association of San Mateo County, and the San Mateo
County Commissions on Aging/Disabilities.
                VII. CONSISTENCY WITH GENERAL PLAN
The City will review the Housing Element during the annual review of the General Plan to ensure
consistency is achieved and maintained during the planning period with all other legally required
elements, and revise as necessary. The City will consider whether major changes in objectives and
policies are necessary to achieve its goals, and undertake revisions as necessary.

City of Pacifica Housing Element: 2015-2023
VIII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Pacifica’s population decreased by 3 percent between 2000 and 2010. In the last 30 years the largest
population change occurred between 1980 and 1990, with an increase of 804 residents (+2.2 percent).
The City is becoming more diverse as the white population shrinks and the Asian and Latino
populations increase.
The City is no longer experiencing periods of rapid population growth as it did during the mid-twentieth
century, and development of housing units has slowed as a result. Slowing development of housing
units places greater emphasis on maintenance, preservation, and improvement activities by the City.
Yes, development of new housing units will be critically important to meet the increasing needs of
seniors and persons with disabilities. Maintenance, preservation, and improvement alone will not meet
the housing needs of these groups and other lower income persons.
The City has identified sites where focused housing development can occur. Sufficient sites exist to
meet the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for the period from January 31, 2015,
through January 31, 2023. The City has also identified certain programs and activities it can implement
and undertake to encourage development of housing, or to enhance maintenance, preservation, and
improvement of existing housing.
Constrained housing resources in a post-redevelopment environment will make development of
affordable housing more challenging for Pacifica, but the City is determined to apply all available
resources to meet the housing needs of current and future residents.
