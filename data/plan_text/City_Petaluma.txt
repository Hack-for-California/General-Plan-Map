Introduction and Overview
i.1	     PETALUMA GROWTH AND
         EVOLUTION
Evolution of the City
Petaluma’s historical evolution is closely tied to
development along the Petaluma River. In 1850, a
group of hunters established a primitive camp on the
west bank of the river, and as the burgeoning city of San
Francisco increased its demands on the surrounding
region for food and supplies, a trading post was built in
Petaluma. More permanent settlement soon followed,
and in 1858, Petaluma incorporated with approximately
1,340 residents.
The city’s downtown grew on the southwest bank of the
Petaluma River along what is now Petaluma Boulevard
North, south of Washington Street. Later, commercial
and industrial uses grew on the northeast riverbank.
The river, coupled with the arrival of the railroad in the
1870s, transformed the city into a thriving center of
agricultural commerce for the region.

Petaluma General Plan 2025
In Petaluma’s early days, the riverbanks were crowded                   Petaluma, however, experienced growth spurts in the
with piers, boat landings, and local manufacturing                      early 1980s and again in the early 1990s. As easily
businesses such as tanneries, flour mills, carpentry                    developed land inventory diminished, infill projects
shops, and wagon-making shops. With the growth of                       reflected a slowed growth rate during the first five years
the dairy and poultry industries, the riverfront evolved                of the new century—to an annual average rate of just
into a thriving center of agricultural commerce. By                     0.8 percent, or an increase of 2,100 people. Between
1917, the river channel was widened and deepened for                    1985 and 2005 Petaluma’s population has grown at an
steamship services to San Francisco.                                    average annual rate of 1.8 percent.
Petaluma began to transform into a bedroom                              Figure i-1 illustrates the evolution of urban land

the late 1950s provided improved automobile access to
San Francisco, and diminished the importance of rail
and river transportation. Residential neighborhoods
and business parks expanded east of the new highway,
where access was improved and land was flat and readily
available. Commercial buildings and business parks
were developed around thoroughfares close to highway
interchanges in addition to those near the river and
railroad corridors.
Petaluma has grown steadily since its incorporation in
1858, with a notable spurt following suburbanization
from the 1950s to 1970s. Following the adoption of
Residential Growth Management legislation, in the
early 1970s, the city slowed its residential growth rate
to not exceed 500 units per year through the turn of
the century.
In Petaluma’s early days, the banks of the turning basin were crowded
                                                                        The General Plan 2025 will guide development in Petaluma over the

Neighborhood and special area plans
The City may consider establishing neighborhood
and special area plans for areas with unique planning
needs. Adopted in 1996, the Petaluma River Access
and Enhancement Plan is an example of such a plan.
Although they must be consistent with the General Plan,
neighborhood and special area plans need not necessarily
address all the topics required by State law for specific
plans. For several decades the City has used the Planned
Unit District (PUD) method to define neighborhood
specific development standards. Combining a PUD with      Rosamond Street is an example of a Planned Unit District constructed

The Plan also introduced the concept of constructing
flood terraces along the River to increase its carrying

Goals and policies in many instances are supplemented
by:
•     Programs. These represent implementation
      commitments to specific goals and policies.
      Language may refer to existing programs or call for
      establishment of new ones. Programs are denoted
      by letters under associated policies.
Together, the Elements articulate a vision for Petaluma
that the General Plan seeks to achieve. They also provide
protection for the city’s resources by establishing
requirements, thresholds, procedures, and criteria for
project review.
Explanatory material accompanies some Goals, Policies
and Programs (often in the form of bulleted lists). This
explanatory material provides background information
or is intended to guide Plan implementation. Where
the same topic is addressed in more than one chapter,
sections and policies are cross-referred, typically in
italics for easy reference.
The Guiding Principles, Goals, Policies and Programs
are ‘adopted’ while the supporting text is explanatory
and shall not be considered adopted mandates.
The provisions of this General Plan shall not apply to
the extent that they would violate the constitution or
laws of the United States or the State of California. The
purpose of this provision is to ensure that this General
Plan does not violate any person’s constitutional or legal
rights.
Policy Numbering System
Policies in the General Plan are organized using a two-
part numbering system that is intended to give each
goal and policy a discrete, easily referenced number.
The first part refers to the chapter/element (and the
subsection within the chapter), followed by a letter
identifying the Goal (G) or Policy (P), and finally by a
second number referring to the specific policy. Thus, the
first goal in Chapter 3 would be 3-G-1, and subsequent
implementing policies would be 3-P-1, 3-P-2, etc.
Programs are listed under each relevant goal and/or
policy. For example, Policy 3-P-1 may have Program
A, B, C, etc. Bullets within Programs offer additional
direction regarding implementation.
                                                                                 i-19

Land Use, Growth Management,
and the Built Environment
The text and policies of the Land Use, Growth
Management, and the Built Environment Element
along with the General Plan Land Use Map constitute
the physical framework that guides land use decision-
making. The Element provides the General Plan land
use classification system, information on population
and projected buildout, and outlines citywide land use
policies. It also includes policies on pacing growth and
possible Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) expansion.
Detailed policies for each of the 14 individual sub-areas
that comprise the General Plan Planning Area are in

Community Design, Character,
and Green Building
Petaluma has a unique identity valued by residents
and visitors alike. This element includes policies aimed
at protecting and enhancing the physical elements
(both natural and created) that have helped shape this
identity. Included among these are the city’s setting,
general distribution of neighborhoods and land uses,
landmarks, special neighborhoods, open space amenities,
and historical and archeological resources. On a more
detailed level, the discussion outlines policies for each
of Petaluma’s 14 planning subareas, as well as green
building policies. Policies focus attention on the city’s
neighborhoods, on the creation of pedestrian-oriented
activity centers, and linkages.
In addition to the information provided in this element,
the Central Petaluma Specific Plan provides a detailed
vision for the design and character of the city’s center,
while the Natural Environment Element and the
Petaluma River Access and Enhancement Plan more
specifically describe the areas along the riverfront.

historic designation. Commercial and office uses within
Downtown are housed in historic structures constructed
at a pedestrian scale. Additional commercial development
along the Petaluma Boulevard corridor provides
neighborhood shopping, service commercial, and minor

Junior High and High Schools, three elementary schools,
City Hall, and the School Administration Center.
The West subarea provides a significant amount (105
acres) of the city’s vacant land acreage, although much of
it is located in areas constrained by topography. Because
neighborhoods in this subarea are the longest established
in Petaluma, infill development needs to carefully
consider issues of scale and character.

character of existing neighborhoods while allowing
intensification of Downtown’s unique mix of uses.

Historic Preservation
The Petaluma River Valley has been the location of
human settlement for hundreds of years. The California
Historical Resources Information System records 14
Native American and 19 historic era cultural resource
sites within Petaluma’s UGB. In addition, Petaluma has
two City-designated local Historic Districts and one
Nationally Registered Commercial District as well as
over 300 properties that have been surveyed for potential
historical significance (see Figure 3-1). Additionally,
the Petaluma Vallejo Adobe, located just east of the city’s
UGB, is a State Historic Park and National Landmark.
Examples of individual properties listed as National
Register Buildings include, but are not limited to: the
Sweed House, United States Post Office (4th and D
Streets), the Opera House, the former Carnegie Library
(now the Petaluma Historical Library and Museum), and
the Old Silk Mill.

The Natural Environment
Petaluma is a city defined by the natural environment.
The aquatic and riparian resources along the Petaluma
River; the rich, ecologically diverse plant and wildlife
communities; the area’s precious water and air resources;
and productive open space resources—contribute greatly
to the city’s quality of life. Protection, restoration, and
enhancement of the natural environment are intrinsic
components of fostering sustainability.
This element outlines policies related to the river,
biological resources, air quality, energy, and solid waste.
Detailed background information about the natural
environment in Petaluma is provided in the Biological
Resources Review (Appendix F-3, Volume 4 of Technical
Appendices).

Mobility
The Mobility Element identifies long-range
transportation needs for moving people and goods in and
around Petaluma. It is comprehensive and far-reaching,
addressing bicycle, motor vehicle and pedestrian travel
as well as public transit, rail, air, and water travel. A range
of public safety, environmental, and social equity issues
associated with transportation are addressed through
the policies and programs identified in this section.

 Notes:
 * Type of bicycle facility will vary based on site context, e.g. use of Class I, Class II, or Class III bikeways.
 ** Main Street sidewalk width of 12’ to 13’ includes 4’ tree planters placed intermittently.
 *** Traffic calming measures on arterial streets may be limited to pedestrian enhancements, such as bulb-outs, and beautification measures, such as landscaped
 medians.
 Transit Facilities:
 “Priority” = Regular bus service with short headways between buses and amenities at bus stops
 “Accommodate” = Regular bus service with longer headways and limited amenities at bus stops
 “Infrequent” = Demand responsive service, such as paratransit, on a limited basis
      should be maintained and transit access prioritized.
      An optional design element could include medians
      that separate travel lanes from parking access lanes,
      to reduce delays caused by on-street parking and
      provide an additional buffer for adjacent land uses.
      Examples of streets in the Bay Area with boulevard
      treatments include Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley
      and Octavia Boulevard in San Francisco. Such a
      treatment could be considered for segments of
      Petaluma Boulevard North.
•	 Private Streets: Private streets provide a solution
      to unique situations where public streets standards
      require excessive grading or to meet site-specific
      issues. Private streets shall retain public access
      easements and shall not prohibit access by way of
      gates or barriers.

•	 Long-term Bicycle Parking: Bicycle Lockers
     are covered storage units that can be locked
     individually, providing secure parking for one
     bicycle. Bicycle cages are secure areas with limited-
     access doors. Occasionally, they are attended. Each
     of these means is designed to provide bicyclists with
     a high level of security so that they feel comfortable
     leaving their bicycles for long periods of time. They
     are appropriate for employees of large buildings and
     at transit stations.
•	 Shower and Locker Facilities: Lockers provide a
     secure place for bicyclists to store their helmets or
     other riding gear. Showers are important for bicycle
     commuters with a rigorous commute and/or formal
     office attire.                                         Many bicycle collisions result from riding the wrong way on a street.

Recreation, Music, Parks, and
the Arts
Recreation programs, city and county parks, music
opportunities, and the arts are significant contributors
to Petaluma’s quality of life. They provide opportunities
for Petaluma residents to experience and develop their
physical, mental, creative, and social abilities in an
atmosphere that promotes individual achievement,
satisfaction, self-esteem, and community pride.
This element outlines the City’s policy approach to
developing parks, open spaces, and trails. Policies for
preserving and enhancing opportunities in the fields of
music and the arts are also included.

Neighborhood Parks
Neighborhood parks are devoted primarily to serving
a small portion of the city, usually within walking
and biking distance from residences. These parks are
typically designed for non-organized and unsupervised
recreation activities. Play equipment, ball fields and
open turf areas, and picnic tables may be provided,
although restrooms and off-street parking are generally
not provided, but are encouraged. Neighborhood parks
typically measure between three and five acres, though
some parks are larger. The city’s neighborhood parks are
listed in Table 6.1-3.
Pocket Parks
Pocket parks are very small park sites (less than one acre) Leghorns Park is a community park providing a wide range of amenities
providing tot lots, playgrounds, or small-scale facilities  including ballfields, playground, tennis courts, picnic areas, and
to a localized area. Pocket parks are listed in Table 6.1-  restrooms.
4. Many of the city’s pocket parks are located within or
near multifamily developments.
Public-Private Partnerships
The City of Petaluma owns 161 acres of recreational
facilities that are under contract with private
organizations. These public-private partnerships allow
this expansive recreational acreage to be used and
maintained by private organizations, which reduces the
City fiscal burden of the operations and maintenance
costs. As part of the lease contract, the City receives
a portion of the revenues collected by the facility and
controls the setting of public use fees. One facility that
falls under the public-private partnership includes the
Rooster Run Golf Course. Rooster Run, the facility
within this category, is a 161-acre golf course located at  La Tercera is a neighborhood park, intended to serve a localized area.
the northeastern edge of the city on East Washington
Street, near the Petaluma Municipal Airport.
Joint-Use Recreational Facilities and Playing Fields
The City, Petaluma City Schools, and the other school
districts have joint-use agreements that permit the shared
use of many parks and recreation facilities located on or
near school sites. These agreements allow both weekday
student users, and after-school and weekend users
access and use of the facilities. Recognizing the value of
these shared resources this plan creates a new standard
seeking 1 acre of joint-use land per 1,000 residents.
While in 2005 this standard was being met, there are
no proposed joint-use facilities identified in this Plan.
The City and school districts will need to work together
in order to make additional joint-use acreage available.    The skate park provides important recreational and social opportunities
The following schools have joint-use facilities on school   for youth and teens.

Parks and Open Space Standards
The City has adopted a citywide parks standard of 5
acres of parkland per 1,000 residents and as of October
2005, the City was providing 5.1 acres of parkland per
1,000 residents.
Future Parks Needs
The buildout population under the General Plan
estimates a population increase of approximately
16,000 residents between 2005 and 2025. In addition
to other new community services and facilities, new
parks and open space will need to be provided to meet
the City’s adopted parkland standards. The addition of
approximately 16,000 residents generates the need for
approximately 80 additional acres of new parkland. As
detailed in Tables 6.1-2 and 6.1-3 above, the City is
proposing approximately 103 acres of new parkland to
be constructed under the General Plan, which results in
a total of 370 acres of parkland (existing plus proposed)
at buildout. With a projected population of 72,707
residents by the year 2025, the City will be providing

   The parkland ratio was calculated using community, neighborhood, and

    This is the combined standard for neighborhood and community parks. The 1987 General Plan provided separate standards for community (3.0 acres/1,000
 residents) and neighborhood (2.0 acres/1,000 residents) parkland. As established in Section 20.34 of the Petaluma Municipal Code (dated 2004), the 2025
 General Plan will include a combined community and neighborhood parkland standard of 5.0 acres per 1,000 resident.

    The parkland ratio was calculated using community, neighborhood, and pocket parks as well as several urban separators. Urban separators included in the
 parkland acreage are those that provide recreational amenities such as playing fields and/or multi-use trails, located on City-owned property.

Hospitals and Health Care Facilities
Petaluma currently has four health care facilities—
Petaluma Valley Hospital, Petaluma Health Center,
Kaiser Permanente and the Hospice of Petaluma.
Demand for health care will likely increase as Petaluma’s
population ages over the General Plan time frame. The
Petaluma Health Center is planning to expand to meet
the needs of a growing service area population. Other
hospitals and health care facilities may also desire to
expand or relocate during the General Plan time frame.

Water Resources
The Water Resources Element brings four components
(Water Supply and Demand, Recycled Water,
Wastewater, and Surface Water) of Petaluma’s water
systems to the forefront, equal in weight to the other
elements, rather than obscured within an element
covering a multitude of community facilities topics.
As quoted by Mark Twain “Whiskey’s for drinking,
water’s for fighting”; water has been the source of the
most intensive part of the work effort of this Plan, and
certainly much of the controversy and public discussion.
The approach to the community’s water resources,
through direction from the City Council, has been to
address water related issues holistically. Recognizing
the scarcity of the resource and the need to use water
in the most environmentally sensitive and responsible
manner has resulted in an element that offers innovative
solutions to meet the community’s needs now and well
into the future.

Petaluma General Plan 2025
         for implementation of surface water
         improvements and riparian habitat
         enhancements.
     J.  Consider development of a program whereby
         projects may acquire property(ies) and
         construct planned flood terracing and/or
         detention/retention facilities as mitigation
         for surface water impacts. The result of the
         improvements must result in an improvement
         to the pre-project conditions by way of a
         net reduction in storm water elevations and
         downstream flows.
Goal 8-G-10: Water Quality
Reduce pollutant load in surface water runoff,
thereby improving water quality within the
Petaluma River and its tributaries.
Policies and Programs:
8-P-38	 All development activities shall be constructed
         and maintained in accordance with Phase
         2 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
         System (NPDES) permit requirements.
     A. The Water Resources and Conservation
         Department shall review, and have the
         authority to conditionally approve, all
         development permits to insure compliance
         with NPDES Phase 2 requirements.
     B. Maintain, update as needed, and implement
         the City’s Storm Water Management Plan to
         retain a current storm water discharge permit
         with the California Regional Water Quality
         Control Board.
     C. A funding mechanism, such as a storm water
         utility fee, shall be implemented by the
         City to insure a dedicated source of funds is
         available for all surface water drainage system
         maintenance and improvement needs.
Goal 8-G-11: Sustainable Site Planning
Improve natural hydrologic functions and water
quality through sustainable site planning.
Policies and Programs:
8-P-39	 Consider, to the extent practicable, requiring  
         sustainable site design practices as outlined

Economic Health & Sustainability
Petaluma’s earliest economic activity was concentrated in
trade clustered around the Petaluma River—the Petaluma
area supplied basic agricultural and timber products
to the San Francisco Bay Area. Petaluma’s economy
has greatly expanded to include telecommunications,
research and development, manufacturing, retail trade,
services, and tourism as well as agricultural products.
Petaluma’s economy in the last two decades shows
several persistent characteristics: 1) there has been
almost continuous employment growth and 2) local
employment growth has outstripped that of the region,
as Chart 9-1 illustrates.
Petaluma’s employment growth has been diverse. The
five-sector economic classification system used by the
Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) shows
that employment growth during the 1990s was dramatic
in three areas: the services sector grew by 70 percent;
the manufacturing and wholesale trade sector grew by
33 percent, and “other” (including the subsectors of
transportation, finance, and government) grew by 30
per­cent.
The natural resources sector (agriculture and mining)
remained about the same. Retail employment change
has been negligible locally (and retail employment has

provide funding for improvements or new facili­ties that
would serve the City as a whole.
Most ongoing costs of service delivery—e.g., for fire
and police protection, street maintenance, parks and
rec­reation, and general government functions—are
typically covered by a variety of taxes, fees, and service
charges. These revenues are collected in the general
fund. In recent years, California cities have faced
increasing stress on their general fund resources, as
revenues have not kept up with the cost of providing
ser­vices. Constrained by a prohibition against operating
at a deficit, cities have continually found ways to reduce
costs: they have reduced staffing ratios, rescheduled
park and street maintenance, reduced street lighting, or
adopted other strategies to balance costs with expected
revenues. At times, it is necessary to draw down the
reserve fund to maintain fiscal balance.
In this fiscal environment, it is critical for cities to
maintain awareness of their fiscal prospects—that is,
the anticipated balance between revenues and costs—
and to identify strategies for increasing revenues so
that the most basic public services can be maintained.
New development can help achieve and maintain fiscal
sol­vency if it generates revenues that equal or exceed
the costs of service provision over time. For residential
development, future increases in property tax may be
expected from owner-occupied units, which are likely
to be sold (and, therefore, reassessed) periodically. For
nonresidential development, property tax increases are
less likely, as properties are sold less often; instead, the
most fiscally advantageous types of development will
be those that generate sales taxes (which are distributed
in California based on “point of sale”) or tran­sient
occupancy taxes.

Health and Safety
The Health and Safety Element seeks to minimize
risks posed by environmental hazards that may
impact Petaluma resident’s health, safety, and welfare.
These include geologic and seismic hazards, noise,
and hazardous materials and waste. This element also
addresses emergency preparedness and management,
including fire and police protection, hospitals, and
health care facilities.
