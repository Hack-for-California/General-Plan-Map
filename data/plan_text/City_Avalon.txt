    2030 GENERAL PLAN / LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
                                  I.       INTRODUCTION
The Avalon General Plan / Local Coastal Plan represents the City's comprehensive effort to
define what makes Avalon a special place, delineate a vision for its future, and formulate action-
oriented programs to achieve that future. The Plan functions as a blueprint that defines not
only how the City will evolve through 2030, but the steps the community will take to make this
vision a reality.
Avalon is located in the southeast portion of Santa Catalina Island (Catalina), which is the only
island in the eight-island archipelago of the Channel Islands with significant human habitation.
Set approximately 25 miles off the coast of Southern California, Avalon is a small tourist
community that thrives on its natural setting. The City strives to serve the needs of its
permanent residents and the tourist population while protecting the natural resources that
make it a popular destination.
As of 2010, the City of Avalon's
corporate boundaries
encompassed approximately 2.81
square miles, or 1,798 acres of
land. The City’s 2010 population
is estimated at 3,559 permanent
residents. In addition, the
General Plan addresses
unincorporated areas
surrounding the City that may be
considered for future annexation.
These unincorporated areas
include open space, the landfill,
and the quarry located south of
Pebbly Beach. The hills that form the backdrop of Avalon are an integral element of the City’s
identity and infrastructure. The planning boundary includes all lands up to the ridge line (Divide
Road). This boundary is intended to meaningfully analyze and envision the viewshed and
watershed issues that impact Avalon. Planning boundaries are shown on Figure I-1.
I.A      General Plan / Local Coastal Plan Background
Avalon adopted its first General Plan in 1978. That plan’s theme was to “target the permanent
population at a level consistent with the availability of natural resources, public services, and
other factors that affect the ambience of that resource described as ‘Avalon’, while continuing

to attract, accommodate and satisfy tourists, enhance the natural and man-made features of
the City, carefully control land use densities and intensity of use, and improve commercial and
recreational facilities”. The plan included all elements required by California General Plan law.
The City’s Local Coastal Program was certified by the California Coastal Commission on May 21,
1981, and the City assumed coastal permit-issuing authority on August 24, 1981. The LCP does
not yet include provisions for the upper Avalon Canyon area and the industrial Pebbly Beach
area that the City annexed from Los Angeles County in 1998.
I.B       Nature and Purpose of the General Plan / Local Coastal Plan
The Avalon General Plan functions as a guide to the type of community that Avalon citizens
desire for their future and provides the means by which that desired future can be achieved.
The General Plan is a "blueprint" for local decision making that addresses the range of
immediate, mid-, and long-term issues with which the community is concerned, including but
not limited to environmental sensitivity and preservation, public services, and economic vitality.
The Plan is intended to allow land use and policy determinations to be made within a
comprehensive framework that incorporates public health, safety, and "quality of life"
considerations in a manner that recognizes the resource limitations and the fragility of the
community's natural environment.
According to the State guidelines for the preparation of general plans, the role of the General
Plan is to establish a document that will "...act as a 'constitution' for development, the
foundation upon which all land use decisions are to be based. It expresses community
development goals and embodies public policy relative to the distribution of future land use,
both public and private" (General Plan Guidelines, 2003). As further mandated by the State, the
General Plan must serve to:
     ·    Identify land use, circulation, environmental, economic, and social goals and policies for
          the City and its surrounding planning area as they relate to land use and development;
     ·    Provide a framework within which the City's Planning Commission and City Council can
          make land use decisions;
     ·    Provide citizens the opportunity to participate in the planning and decision-making
          process affecting the City and its surrounding planning area; and
     ·    Inform citizens, developers, decision-makers, and other agencies, as appropriate, of the
          City's basic rules which will guide both environmental protection and land development
          decisions within the City and surrounding planning area.
State law requires that the General Plan include seven mandatory elements, but allows
flexibility in how each local jurisdiction structures these elements. The general contents of the
seven state-mandated elements are described on the following page.
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

CITY OF AVALON
2030 GENERAL PLAN / LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
I.        INTRODUCTION
The General Plan also satisfies State requirements for the City’s Local Coastal Program in
accordance with the California Coastal Act (Public Resources Code § 30000 et seq.). Actions in
the General Plan that affect coastal resources are intended to become part of the Land Use Plan
of the Local Coastal Program. The California Coastal Commission oversees all Local Coastal
Programs.
                              Mandated General Plan Elements
      ·    The LAND USE ELEMENT designates the general distribution and intensity of
           uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space, education, public
           buildings and grounds, waste disposal facilities, and other categories of public
           and private use.
      ·    The CIRCULATION ELEMENT is correlated with the land use element, and
           identifies the general location and extent of existing and proposed major
           thorough-fares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities
           and facilities.
      ·    The HOUSING ELEMENT is a comprehensive assessment of current and
           projected housing needs for all economic segments of the community. It
           embodies policy for providing adequate housing and includes action programs.
      ·    The CONSERVATION ELEMENT addresses the conservation, management, and
           use of natural resources, including water, soils, biological habitats, and mineral
           deposits.
      ·    The OPEN SPACE ELEMENT details programs for preserving open space for
           natural resource protection, the managed production of resources, outdoor
           recreation, and protection of public healthy and safety.
      ·    The NOISE ELEMENT identifies and appraised noise problems within the
           community and forms the basis for land use distribution.
      ·    The SAFETY ELEMENT establishes policies and programs to protect the
           community from risk associated with seismic, geologic, flood, and fire hazards.
I.C      Internal General Plan Consistency: Competing Objectives
In addition to providing a comprehensive view of the community's future physical, social, and
economic environments, general plans must be internally consistent. In order to function as a
useful statement of local policy, the various components of the General Plan need to "comprise
an integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting
agency" (Government Code, Section 65300.5). The following factors must be considered with
respect to internal consistency:

     ·   Equal Status Among General Plan Elements - All elements of the General Plan have
         equal legal status. Because no element is legally subordinate to another, the General
         Plan must resolve potential conflicts between or among the elements through clear
         language and policy consistency.
     ·   Consistency Between Elements and Within Individual Elements - All General Plan
         elements must be consistent with one other. Any individual provision of the General
         Plan should not require the City to take an action prohibited by another General Plan
         provision. In addition, the assumptions and vision used to create individual portions of
         the General Plan need to be uniform and consistent.
     ·   General Plan Text and Diagram Consistency - Because General Plan text and diagrams
         are both integral parts of the General Plan, they must be consistent with each another.
         Thus, the diagrams of the General Plan are intended to be a graphic reflection of the
         General Plan text.
     ·   Competing Objectives – Although the General Plan must be internally consistent, it is
         important to recognize that community objectives are sometimes inherently in conflict.
         Therefore, blind pursuit of one objective may, in some cases, inhibit the achievement of
         other community objectives. For example, the Avalon General Plan recognizes the need
         to minimize water consumption in light of limited water resources. However, to
         eliminate watering of sites being graded for permitted development or eliminate
         landscape irrigation may conflict with objectives relating to maintenance of air quality or
         community design and beautification. Thus, when implementing the General Plan,
         decision makers must strike a balance between competing objectives, recognizing that
         all objectives cannot be fully implemented all the time.
I.D      General Plan Format & Organization
The Avalon General Plan is organized into 8 chapters, which include this Introduction, and 7
General Plan elements. An appendix describing policy terms used in the plan is also included, as
is a glossary. The 7 General Plan elements encompass all of the elements required by California
General Plan law. The content of each of the 8 General Plan chapters is summarized below.
The Introduction (Chapter I) provides an introduction to the community of Avalon, the overall
General Plan document, and an overview of Avalon's vision for the future.
The Land Use Element (Chapter II) details Avalon's program to manage its physical environment,
and meet State requirements for the Land Use Element. Land use objectives, general plan
approaches, policies, and implementation actions are presented. In addition, Chapter II
delineates the land use districts presented on the General Plan Land Use Map. The land use
districts define acceptable land uses throughout the General Plan study area.
                                                                                   CITY of AVALON

CITY OF AVALON
2030 GENERAL PLAN / LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
I.        INTRODUCTION
The Open Space Element (Chapter III) details Avalon's commitment to preserving open space in
and around the City. It also identifies additional areas that the City may wish to set aside as
open space and describes methods by which the City will manage associated resources.
The Conservation Element (Chapter IV) describes Avalon's program to manage its natural
resources. The primary objective of this element is to define environmental features within the
plan area and provide each feature with an appropriate level of protection. The Conservation
Element meets the requirements of State General Plan law. Specifically, the Conservation
Element covers the following issues:
    ·    Biotic Resources                                ·    Solid Waste Management
    ·    Air Quality                                     ·    Soil Conservation
    ·    Coastal Resources and Sea Level Rise            ·    Cultural Resources
    ·    Water Resources                                 ·    Mineral Resources
    ·    Energy Resources
The Housing Element (Chapter V) presents Avalon's commitment to provide housing
opportunities to meet the needs of all economic segments of the community, and to ensure the
continued high quality of the City's housing stock. This element contains the following
components.
    ·    Housing Needs - summarizes existing and projected needs for housing for all economic
         segments of the community, including new construction needs and particularly the
         needs of such groups as the handicapped, the elderly, large families, female-headed
         households, and the homeless
    ·    Opportunities for the Creation of New Housing - examines the inventory of land that is
         available to meet identified needs for new housing construction
    ·    Constraints on the Production of Housing - explores governmental and non-
         governmental obstacles that need to be overcome if the City of Avalon is to meet its
         housing needs
    ·    Housing Goals, Quantified Objectives, Programs, and Specific Actions - outlines the
         specifics of Avalon's housing improvement program
The Circulation Element (Chapter VI) outlines the City's program to provide mobility within the
General Plan study area. This element addresses motor vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian
circulation, as well as parking issues. A major thrust of this element is to ensure that roadways
and transportation facilities support, rather than lead to, the type of community which Avalon
wishes to maintain. Thus, environmental considerations have been incorporated into the
Circulation Element and recommendations to increase the traffic carrying capacity of the area's
roadway system were designed to recognize and protect significant environmental features.
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

                                                                           I.     INTRODUCTION
The Safety Element (Chapter VII) addresses the relationship between natural and manmade
hazards and existing and future development. Key features of this element are the definition of
"acceptable risk" and identification of the extent to which natural and manmade hazards will be
managed in order to protect public health and safety. The Safety Element meets State
requirements and addresses the following specific topics:
    ·    Geology and Seismicity
    ·    Flooding
    ·    Fire Hazards
    ·    Hazardous Materials
    ·    Disaster Response
The Noise Element (Chapter VIII) identifies existing and projected future noise sources and
levels throughout the City. It also provides policies and standards to limit noise exposure. The
Noise Element meets the requirements of State General Plan law.
I.E      Community Vision
The Avalon General Plan is intended to provide a vehicle for maintaining the community
qualities that make Avalon a healthy, small town island community that is characterized as a
quaint, unique and ecologically sensitive tourist destination. It is also important to recognize
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

I.        INTRODUCTION
that the authenticity of Avalon will be sustained only if the needs of locals are met first. Keys to
maintaining the desirability of Avalon for residents and for visitors are:
    ·    Maintaining a population size (residents and visitors) that is consistent with the natural
         resources, public services, and other factors, while continuing to attract, accommodate
         and satisfy tourists upon which the local economy is dependent;
    ·    Maintain and enhance Avalon’s unique ecology and environmental features for the long
         term enjoyment of residents and visitors;
    ·    Exemplify environmental awareness and stewardship through the use of new
         technologies, conduct practices that are energy efficient, reduce pollution and waste,
         conserve water, and protect the environment, natural features, and open spaces of the
         City and the island as a whole; and
    ·    Provide services to all types of visitors and maintain the sense of place that is part of the
         draw for tourists and residents alike.
Avalon is distinguished from other small towns by the natural beauty of its island location and its
historic ambiance. Residents are enthusiastic about their community, value their cultural
diversity, and take care to preserve their rich history and local traditions. It is a friendly, close-
knit community, whose members feel responsible to and for each other and work together to
improve their quality of life.

                               II.      LAND USE ELEMENT
The Land Use Element of the General Plan establishes Avalon's fundamental land use
philosophy, which is to improve the economic health and vitality of the area, direct
development to the most suitable locations, and maintain the environmental, social, and
physical health and vitality of the area. This Land Use Element therefore focuses on the
organization of the community’s environment by establishing the type, intensity, location, and
character of land uses that will be permitted in the future.
This Land Use Element is also the heart of the Land Use Plan pursuant to the requirements of
the City’s Local Coastal Program (California Coastal Act of 1976, § 30108.5). All of the other
elements are also included as components of the Land Use Plan for the purposes of complying
with the Local Coastal Program. This Land Use Element (and Land Use Plan pursuant to the
Coastal Act) reflects an approach to future development and growth that is most protective of
significant coastal resources. The changes from the existing Land Use Plan are intended to
concentrate development in close proximity to urban and employment centers and to facilitate
expansion of recreational opportunities and access near the coastline. Locations where the City
is projected to grow in response to demand for new housing, resort services, infrastructure, or
recreational uses will not conflict with coastal resources.
II.A     COMMUNITY DESIGN
Avalon's land use pattern is well established and therefore is not intended to change drastically
over time. The urban fabric of Avalon is relatively compact, with approximately 80-90 acres of
existing development already located within the valley floor and the immediately surrounding
hillsides. Just over 700 additional acres surround the built environment as open space. About
                                                                                   CITY of AVALON

88% of Catalina Island as a whole is owned by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy (referred to
in this document as the “Conservancy”). About 13% belongs to the Santa Catalina Island
Company (referred to in this document as the “Company”); individually owned lots in Avalon
comprise less than 1% of the total city acreage.

                                                                  visitors seeking recreation,
ecological and historical tours, as well as rest and relaxation. Avalon has been a destination for
generations of families of all income groups in Southern California by providing quick access to a
place unlike any other in the region. The community is designed to provide services to all types
of visitors and maintain the sense of place that is part of the draw for tourists and residents
alike. Compatibility between tourism and permanent residents is essential to the economic
success of the community. The limited physical area of the City requires that special attention
be given to the balance between tourism and residents.
On December 11, 2008, the California Air Resources Board adopted its Proposed Scoping Plan
for Assembly Bill (AB) 32. This scoping plan included the approval of Senate Bill (SB) 375 as the
means for achieving regional transportation-related GHG targets. SB 375 provides guidance on
how curbing emissions from cars and light trucks can help the state comply with AB 32. The
Land Use Element is designed to achieve consistency with SB 375 as is discussed below.
II.B     LAND USE GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
Avalon’s vision is to continue to be a healthy, small town island community that is characterized
as a quaint, unique and ecologically responsible tourist destination. Based upon this vision, the
following land use goals, policies and implementation measures have been developed and sited
into one of five categories. The five categories include: General Land Use, City Center, Open
Space/Recreation/Coastal Resources, Economic Development, and Plan Area Boundaries.
                                                                                      CITY of AVALON

General Land Use
This category is designed to provide general guidance on land use throughout the City.
Goals
Maintain Avalon as a healthy, small town island community.
Maintain, enhance and protect Avalon’s unique ecology and environmental features for the long
term enjoyment of residents and visitors.
Permit strategic growth and change that maintains existing neighborhoods and provides a
mixture of market rate and affordable housing types.
Permit the development of infrastructure systems capable of sustaining long-term growth.
General Land Use Policies
II-1  Use the City’s Zoning Ordinance and any applicable residential, commercial, resort, and
      open space design standards to guide the character of development and ensure
      compatibility with existing residential, commercial, resort, and open space uses.
II-2  Preserve and strengthen the visual and physical connections between the waterfront, City
      Center, and neighborhoods surrounding the City Center, middle canyon, upper canyon
      and open spaces.
II-3  Incorporate the policies of the Coastal Act (Public Resources Code Section 30210 through
      30263) as guiding policies of City’s land use.
II-4  Promote land development practices that reduce energy and water consumption, air and
      water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste, incorporating such techniques as:
        ·   Concentration of uses and design of development to promote walking and use of
            transit in lieu of the automobile
        ·   Capture and re-use of stormwater on-site for irrigation
        ·   Orientation of buildings to maximize opportunities for solar energy use, daylighting,
            and ventilation
        ·   Use of permeable paving materials
        ·   Shading of surface parking, walkways, and plazas
        ·   Convert waste to energy
        ·   Upgrade the wastewater disposal system to allow for recycled water use
II-5  Require buildings to be oriented toward and actively engage the public realm through
      such features as location, incorporation of windows, avoidance of blank walls, and
      articulated building elevations fronting sidewalks and public spaces. Parking policy should
      encourage use of alternate forms of transportation other than personal vehicles.
                                                                                  CITY of AVALON

II.        LAND USE ELEMENT
II-6   Encourage the retention of existing structures and promote their adaptive reuse with
       “green” building technologies in accordance with a green building standard, such as
       Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEEDTM), or other equivalent.
II-7   Develop land uses that enhance the existing transportation network, minimize the
       impacts of vehicles in the City, and encourage alternative means of transportation.
II-8   Enhance the pedestrian character and pedestrian linkages between the waterfront, City
       Center, neighborhoods surrounding the City Center, middle canyon, upper canyon and
       open spaces.
Implementation Actions
·    Update the City’s Zoning Ordinance to reflect the Land Use map and policies of the General
     Plan Land Use Element.
·    Continue to regulate the levels of building intensity and density according to the standards
     and land use designations specified by the General Plan and the Avalon Municipal Code.
·    Phase private development and public infrastructure projects based upon input from utility
     providers, private developers, and other public agencies to assure that adequate public
     facilities are available at the time of occupancy.
·    Require new development to demonstrate incorporation of techniques that reduce energy
     and water consumption, air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste
City Center
This section specifically
addresses City Center which
is the hub of commercial and
residential development
within the valley floor of
Avalon. As the majority of
City Center is already built,
new development will be
primarily infill that is
designed to maintain a
variety of uses including
commercial, residential and
resort recreational that
provide housing options and
services to both residents and tourists. This type of land use promotes and preserves the
compact, walkable character of Avalon for visitors and locals alike and provides diverse housing
options by making housing more affordable. In addition, infill development would promote less
                                                                                    CITY of AVALON

reliance on vehicles, which would reduce air pollution and noise and would also alleviate
congestion and pressure on available parking.
SB 375 requires integrated land use, housing, and transportation planning to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions from automobiles and light trucks and thus comply with AB 32 (please see the
Conservation Element for further discussion regarding AB 32). The Southern California
Association of Governors (SCAG) developed a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) to
implement SB 375. The SCS focuses the majority of new housing and job growth in existing main
streets, downtowns, and commercial corridors. By promoting infill development within the City
Center, the land use plan is consistent with the objectives of SB 375 and the SCS and would
assist in reducing vehicle emissions.
Goals
Facilitate well-designed, mixed-use “infill” development within the City Center and the
surrounding uses.
Maintain the City Center as the original commercial hub of Avalon that provides a variety of
services for both residents and visitors, including daytime/waterfront oriented activities and
evening amenities.
Establish diverse housing options that are affordable for residents and located in close proximity
to jobs and services.
Policies
II-9   Encourage infill of the City Center area and where appropriate, increase the intensity of
       development on vacant and underutilized properties, in lieu of expanded development
       outward into Avalon’s hillsides, natural areas and open space.
II-10 Concentrate high intensity commercial and “mixed-use” type development in the City
       Center as a means to encourage revitalization while also avoiding more intense
       development at the City’s edge.
II-11 Encourage the revitalization of commercial areas through mixed-use developments to
       promote a range of business and visitor serving activities. The commercial uses as part of
       the mixed use developments shall create vitality, revenue, and employment opportunities
       and shall be compatible with Avalon’s small town island lifestyle.
II-12 Require infill development to incorporate design elements with buffers and transitions in
       density, scale, and mass to assure compatibility with adjacent uses.
II-13 Promote the balanced mixture of retail and service needs within the City Center area for
       the benefit of citizens and tourists.
                                                                                   CITY of AVALON

Economic Development
The City of Avalon recognizes the importance of maintaining a strong economic base that
provides employment opportunities while generating revenues for ongoing City operations,
infrastructure, and public services. However, its economic base is overwhelmingly influenced by
                                                                                       CITY of AVALON

tourism; therefore the City’s primary economic development policies must support
improvements in the desirability of Avalon to both residents and visitors. Furthermore, its
dependence on a continually evolving tourist economy requires dedication to protecting the
authentic aspects of its natural and cultural environment.
Goals
Improve the community’s economic base, provide employment opportunities, enhance tourist
services, and generate sufficient revenues for ongoing City operations, infrastructure, and public
services.
Enhance the City’s visitor serving facilities in order to improve competitive positions and
maintain an economy based on tourism.
Policies
II-20 Pursue new developments and businesses that add to the City’s economic base,
       particularly those that general sales tax and transient occupancy tax.
II-21 Expand lodging choices by attracting and retaining desirable and high-quality facilities to
       the community.
II-22 Preserve and strengthen the City Center’s historic status as the center of commercial and
       tourist activity by encouraging a range of uses that serve both residents and visitors.
II-23 Promote the retention of existing and attraction of new commercial, office, visitor serving,
       and light industrial business and afford opportunities for their growth and expansion.
II-24 Develop expanded and new recreational opportunities that will meet the needs of local
       residents and attract visitors.
II-25 Work collaboratively with land owners such as the Company to achieve a jobs/housing
       balance in Avalon.
Implementation Measures
·    Collaborate with the Company and the Conservancy to determine the kinds of visitor-
     serving facilities that benefit both the City and the overall community.
·    Collaborate with local tourist attractions and cultural organizations to determine ways in
     which the City can support these institutions to reach a broader audience and attract
     visitors outside the City’s current constituent base.
·    Cooperate and coordinate business outreach programs with the Chamber of Commerce and
     other community organizations, and actively encourage business owners to engage City
     departments to address the business community’s needs.

·    Pursue a variety of funding approaches, including grants, impact fees, transportation funds,
     and other programs to fund City programs, services, and capital investments.
Plan Area Boundaries
Section 65300 of the Government Code requires that a City address all territory within the
boundaries of the City as well as “any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency’s
judgment bears relation to its planning.” The law allows communities to plan for areas outside
of their jurisdiction because certain issues are not confined to political boundaries. As a result,
the City of Avalon strongly favors an urban/rural boundary, which is consistent with Coastal Act
policies. There are areas adjacent to the City’s existing incorporated boundaries that merit
inclusion into the City because they represent a logical extension of city boundaries given the
existing pattern of development or the need for public services. The City proposes to increase
the Sphere of Influence (as shown on Figure II-1), driven largely by a desire to protect the scenic
viewsheds, protect water quality, and develop a more distributed array of infrastructure. This
potential Sphere of Influence expansion would also include three potential annexation areas,
each designed to meet Avalon’s future needs.
Goal
Expand the City boundaries to increase local control over natural resource conservation,
recreation planning, and infrastructure planning.
Policies
II-26 Pursue annexation of key areas surrounding the current City limits in order to facilitate
       local planning objectives, including the preservation of natural resources and expansion of
       recreational opportunities and infrastructure. Specific annexations to be considered
       include:
         ·    The landfill and quarry area (Parcel # 7480-045-033) south of the Pebbly Beach area.
              Within this area (Expansion Area No. 1) to facilitate light industrial uses with the
              potential to transition over time to more visitor-serving uses as part of a Pebbly
              Beach Specific Plan Overlay District
         ·    Company land (various parcels) between Hamilton Cove and the Divide Road
              (Expansion Area No. 2) to facilitate Resort/Recreational land uses
         ·    Conservancy land (Parcels #7480-045-013 and #7480-045-014) located between the
              City limits separating Pebbly Beach and the eastern boundary of Avalon Canyon
              (Expansion Area No. 3) for more open space uses within the City limits
II-27 Require annexation proposals to demonstrate a positive relationship between City facility
       and service costs and the revenues that will be generated subsequent to annexation with
       the exception of areas to be annexed for the purpose of parks, schools, open space, and
       other public facilities.
                                                                                       CITY of AVALON

Implementation Measures
·    Undertake studies (such as a Municipal Service Review) to determine the feasibility of
     expanding the City’s Sphere of Influence. The Sphere of Influence expansion plan shall be
     driven by viewshed, watershed protection, and infrastructure expansion opportunities.
·    Collaborate with the Company regarding the annexation of Expansion Area No. 1. The
     majority of this area is owned by the Company and would also incorporate the City landfill
     and Company quarry for future infrastructure opportunities. The appropriate land use
     designation for this area would be Light Industrial with the potential to transition over time
     to more visitor-serving uses as part as part of a Pebbly Beach Specific Plan Overlay District.
·    Collaborate with the Company regarding the annexation of Expansion Area No. 2. This area
     contains some of Avalon’s most significant viewsheds. The lower lying areas (Descanso
     Beach and Hamilton Cover) also could provide additional opportunities for
     resort/recreational uses. The appropriate land use designation for this area would be Resort
     Recreational-Low Density.
·    Collaborate with the Conservancy regarding the annexation of Expansion Area. No. 3. This
     area contains undisturbed open space. Incorporation of this area into the City would allow
     greater coordination with respect to watershed protection, trail development and
     sustainable infrastructure development. The appropriate land use designation for this area
     would be Open Space.
II.C     GENERAL PLAN LAND USE DISTRICTS
Table II-1 outlines the various districts that are delineated on the Avalon General Plan Land Use
Map (Figure II-2). Figure II-3 also provides a focused view of the land uses within the City Center
area. Two levels of land use are designated. At the broadest level, urban land uses are
distinguished from non-urban uses. Urban land uses are organized into Residential, Commercial,
Public, Industrial, and Recreational land use types. Non-urban uses include the Open Space land
use type. The City of Avalon has the legal responsibility to insure that the General Plan land use
designations and City zoning designations are consistent. As a result, the City may appropriately
amend zoning designations in a specific area while still reflecting the intent of the General Plan.
The intent is to establish zoning categories that mirror the land use categories of this plan,
leaving no doubt as to their consistency.
Based on the plan and the remaining areas of the city that are not developed or are
underdeveloped, most new development would be infill within the City Center area. The plan
would maintain the City’s island lifestyle and would encourage a range of uses that serve both
residents and visitors while keeping the City Center’s historic status as the center of commercial
activity. The plan also provides a mix of resort recreational areas and open space areas that
exemplify the City’s coastal resources. The plan would also provide a mix of market rate and
affordable housing units while preserving the City’s existing neighborhoods.
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

                                                                                II .      LAND USE ELEMENT
  As part of the City’s desire to forecast potential growth out to a planning horizon of 2030,
  growth assumptions were made based on the existing population according to the California
  Department of Finance (2012) statistics and future projections based on the Southern California
  Association of Government (SCAG) 2012–2035 Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable
  Communities Strategy (RTP/SCS) Growth Forecast for Avalon, adopted in April 2012. SCAG's
  regional and small area socio-economic estimates and projections are used for federal and state
  mandated long-range planning efforts such as the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), the Air
  Quality Management Plan (AQMP), the Regional Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP),
  and the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA).
  Table II-2 on page II-13 illustrates the growth forecast for Avalon based on these assumptions.
  Overall, Avalon’s special island resort environment and relative isolation creates limitations with
  respect to the capacity of infrastructure facilities and services. These infrastructure and
  locational limitations combined with topographic and land use limitations have created a City
  that is largely built out. Nevertheless, during this General Plan’s planning horizon (through the
  year 2030), Avalon is forecast to experience an increase in its estimated population (permanent
  residents) of up to 22%. The total number of permanent housing units is also forecast to
  increase 22%, from 2,289 units to 2,920 units.

                                               the possible eventual transition to other uses that take advantage of
                                               this area’s coastal location. It is anticipated that new lands uses may
                                               include visitor-serving facilities such as a new public dock/ferry
                                               terminal, commercial retail, restaurants, hotels/motels, and/or
                                               recreational facilities that serve both residents and visitors.
LC-SP                                          The LC-SP overlay identifies the area above Lover’s Cove and
Lover’s Cove-Specific Plan Overlay District    surrounding area for eventual development of a specific plan. This area
                                               is currently undeveloped. However, if development is anticipated in the
                                               future, a specific plan is to be developed to guide the possible eventual
                                               transition to other uses that take advantage of this area’s views and
                                               proximity to visitor services. It is anticipated that the area may be
                                               utilized for visitor serving facilities such as a hotel, spa, or social and

The purpose of the Open Space Element is to guide the comprehensive and long-range
preservation and conservation of open space land within Avalon. Open space is a key component
of the City’s character, representing a scenic resource of great value and importance to the
quality of life for Avalon residents and visitors. Open space protects significant environmental
resources as many of the open space areas within and around Avalon contain an abundance and
variety of sensitive vegetative and wildlife habitats. It
also creates opportunities for public recreation and            Open space may be defined as

form and identity to the City. Expansion of the uses
allowed in the Resort/Recreational High Density and
Resort Recreational Low Density designations will also provide opportunities to accommodate
active and passive recreation. Enhanced recreation facilities must be achieved in a manner that
balances resident and visitor needs, and protects the natural environment.
This element identifies existing open space resources within Avalon, and sets forth goals and
policies to guide decision making with regard to the management of open space. The Open
Space Element also contains implementation actions which the legislative body intends to
pursue, as required by Government Code Section 65564.
As required by Government Code Section 65560, the Open Space Element takes into
consideration open space lands, defined as any parcel or area of land or water which is
designated on a local, regional, or state open space plan as any of the following:
    ·    Open space for the preservation of natural resources including, but not limited to, areas
         required for the preservation of plant and animal life, including habitat for fish; areas
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

         estuaries; and coastal beaches, banks of rivers and streams, and watershed lands.
     ·   Open space for outdoor recreation, including but not limited to, areas of outstanding
         scenic, historic and cultural value; areas particularly suited for park and recreation
         purposes, including access to lakeshores, beaches, and rivers and streams; and areas
         which serve as links between major recreation and open space reservations, including
         utility easements, banks of rivers and streams, trails, and scenic highway corridors.
     ·   Open space for public health and safety, including, but not limited to, areas which
         require special management or regulation because of hazardous or special conditions
         such as unstable soil areas, flood plains, areas presenting high fire risks, areas required
         for the protection of air and water quality.
     ·   Open space used for the managed production of resources, including but not limited to,
         forest lands, rangeland and areas of economic importance; areas for recharge of
         groundwater basins; bays, estuaries, rivers and streams for the management of
         commercial fisheries; and areas containing major mineral deposits.
Open Space and Ownership
Preservation of the natural environment on
Catalina has been an integral part of the island’s
development since the early 20th century, when
William Wrigley, Jr. took over the Santa Catalina
Island Company (“Company”) to conserve and
protect Catalina and keep its future
development both orderly and limited.
Ownership of the land plays an important role in
land use and open space within the City limits.
About 70% of the land within Avalon is owned and managed by the Company. It was realized
early on by both the City of Avalon and the Company that unique methods of development
would have to be employed in the future in order to preserve the natural ecology and beauty of
the remaining undeveloped hillsides and canyon areas and still provide areas for residential
development. The City and the Company proposed to leave 70-80% of the overall land in its
present natural state, including the area above the 750 foot elevation level to the ridge line,
which would serve as an open space buffer zone. This land would serve as a natural preserve for
native vegetation, birds and wild animal, and provide for outdoor recreation opportunities
including golf, hiking, bicycling, horseback riding and camping. Today, only about 10-20% of the
more than 800 acres that comprise the City are developed. Most of the development in the City
is within the canyon floor, while most of the undeveloped area is located on the rugged and
steep hillsides and canyons to the east and west, consistent with the City and the Company’s
vision. Figure III-1 shows the current inventory of designated open space and recreation areas
within City boundaries.

III.       OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
Within the Avalon planning area, the Catalina Island Conservancy (herein referred to as
“Conservancy”) also plays a key role in preserving undeveloped areas for open space and
recreational purposes. The Conservancy is a nonprofit organization established in 1972 in part
by the Wrigley family to protect and conserve Santa Catalina Island. The Conservancy owns 88%
(42,134 acres) of the land on the island, and is charged with preserving the land, providing for
low-impact recreational uses such as hiking and camping and promoting preservation and
restoration efforts based on sound science. Approximately 41,000 of the Conservancy’s 42,134
acres are dedicated for recreational use under an open-space easement agreement with Los
Angeles County.
III.A OPEN SPACE TO PROTECT SENSITIVE AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Much of the open space within Avalon
contains an abundance and variety of
sensitive and natural resources including,
but not limited to, vegetative and
wildlife habitats and linkages, existing
landforms, cultural and historic
resources, bays and beaches. It also
represents a scenic resource of great
value and importance to the quality of
life of area residents and enhances the
visual experience of visitors to the area.
Open space areas uniquely suitable for
these high priority environmental
resources exist only in certain areas and
in limited amounts and should be
preserved for these purposes.
Goals
Preserve open space to protect and conserve sensitive and natural resources.
Preserve the natural landforms and open spaces that help make Avalon unique.
Policies
III-1     Protect open space and other properties that contain or protect significant sensitive
          resources, such as special-status plant and wildlife species know to occur in or near the
          City, natural habitats, and habitat linkages.
III-2      Maintain the natural topographic characteristics of hillside areas, ocean cliffs, canyons,
          beaches, and major rock outcroppings.
III-3     Protect open space that contains significant historic, cultural and archaeological
          resources.
III-4     Preserve and increase the amount of open space and native trees and vegetation within
          the City to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

                                                                                   CITY OF AVALON
                                                   2030 GENERAL PLAN / LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
                                                                  III.      OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
Implementation Actions
      ·   Expand the Open Space designation as necessary to encompass areas that have
          important open space values, such as biologically/ecologically sensitive areas.
      ·   Within areas having significant open space values, establish criteria and procedures for
          assessing the environmental impact of public and private projects.
III.B OPEN SPACE FOR PUBLIC RECREATION
Open space for public recreation within Avalon includes both passive and active areas, including
multi-use trails, parks, public beaches/waterfronts and areas of scenic and cultural value, which
are shown on Figure III-1. In addition to the natural open space areas, there are three parks,
including Mole Park, People’s Park and City Park. People’s Park and Mole Park provide picnic
areas, and Crescent Beach is a public beach area located along the harbor. Catalina Island Golf
Course is open to the public, as are Wrigley Memorial and Botanic Gardens and Hermit Gulch
Campground, which are located southwest of town. The City also has public
beaches/waterfront areas that offer a range of aquatic recreational opportunities. The hillsides
surrounding Lover’s Cove including Buena Vista Point offer scenic views for hikers and bikers. A
network of trails also surrounds the community, providing hiking and bicycling opportunities for
residents and tourists. However, a lack of adequate recreation facilities and programs (e.g.,
sports fields, destination 18-hole golf course, etc.) and missing links in the current trail network
are a concern for the community. Some areas in the City may be used for such recreation
facilities in the future (e.g., Citrus Canyon may be capable of accommodating sports fields or a
swimming pool). It is the intent of the City to preserve existing recreational areas, expand the
amount of land devoted to public recreation and provide a connected network of trails to access
recreation areas and facilities.
Goal
Preserve open space to provide quality recreation opportunities and facilities that meet public
needs.
Provide and maintain a comprehensive public access network between open space lands,
beaches, recreational facilities, and parks.
Policies
III-5     Provide an open space and recreation system with an appropriate balance of facilities
          suitable for intensive use (beaches, playgrounds, sports fields) and those suitable for
          low intensity use (hiking, camping, golf) that meets the needs of residents and visitors.
III-6     Provide high-quality recreational facilities and programs to attract tourists and meet
          residents’ needs.
                                                                                      CITY of AVALON

III.     OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
III-7   Create and maintain a linked system of open spaces to provide opportunities for long
        distance hiking, horseback riding and biking.
III-8   Improve public access to designated open space areas and recreation facilities.
III-9   Beach front parks should be sought and designed using a most careful and thoughtful
        process of pedestrian and bike linkages.
III-10  Protect coastal areas suited for water-oriented recreational activities as necessary.
III-11  Preserve open space areas needed to provide cultural, historical, and educational
        opportunities for the City’s and Santa Catalina Island's residents and visitors.
III-12  All beach areas should be preserved as a scenic and recreational asset.
III-13  The City should continue a program of acquiring sand portions of beach areas and
        easements.
Implementation Actions
      · Expand the Open Space and Resort/Recreation land use designations as necessary to
        encompass areas that have recreational value.
      · Identify missing linkages in the parks, trails and coastal access system and work with the
        Company and the Conservancy to link and protect them via acquisition, zoning or other
        preservation mechanisms.
      · Accommodate and encourage active (e.g., zipline, recreation/sports facilities, golf
        course expansion, etc.) in the Resort Recreation zones and passive (e.g., hiking,
        camping, etc.) recreational uses within portions of the area designated Low Density
        Residential.
      · Consider establishing secondary coastal access to Hamilton Cove and Pebbly Beach.
      · Work with the Company, Conservancy and other community organizations to create a
        comprehensive parks and trails plan.
      · To ensure the availability of adequate park and recreation programs and facilities,
        Avalon will coordinate recreational programming, park planning and park acquisition
        activities with Los Angeles County, Company, Conservancy and other community
        groups. City efforts shall include, but not be limited to:
             o   Coordinating planned locations of parks and recreation areas within the City
             o   Pursuit of alternative sources of funding for the acquisition and development of
                 active park land.
                                                                                    CITY of AVALON

III.C OPEN SPACE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
Within Avalon, certain areas require special management or regulation because of hazardous or
special conditions to protect public health and safety. These areas include hillsides, shorefronts,
flood plains, waterbodies and areas presenting high fire risks. Thus, this section includes policies
to provide a margin of safety and protection. The application of these policies will minimize the
extent of development in these areas and potentially increase the amount of land designated as
open space.
Goal
Preserve open space to protect public health and safety.
Policies
III-14   Promote the protection of open space on public and privately owned property for the
         protection of health and safety through continued application of the Open Space and
         Resort/Recreation land use designations, as appropriate.
III-15   Preserve sensitive lands, including permanent bodies of water, floodways,
         beaches/shorelines and slopes over 35 percent as open space.
III-16   The undevelopable lands around Avalon should be retained in their natural beauty as an
         open space buffer zone.
III-17   Through the development review process, ensure that new development located in or
         near areas that may pose public health and safety hazards (such as on hillsides,
         shorefronts, flood plains, and/or areas of known or suspected fire hazard) is designed to
         minimize potential impacts on people and property.
Implementation Action
     ·   Expand the Open Space land use designations as necessary to encompass areas needed
         to protect public health and safety.
III.D OPEN SPACE FOR THE MANAGED PRODUCTION OF RESOURCES
Open space for the managed production of resources typically includes areas reserved for
mineral extraction or agricultural production; forest lands, rangeland and areas of economic
importance; areas required for groundwater recharge; and bays, estuaries, rivers and streams
for the management of commercial fisheries. There are no areas within Avalon currently
utilized for agricultural or forestry activities; however, some areas within the City contain
mineral resources and are appropriate for mineral extraction. Mineral resources are discussed in
greater detail in the Conservation Element of this General Plan. In addition, there are
waterbodies and areas important for the management of commercial fisheries and groundwater
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

recharge. It is the intent of the City to conserve areas needed for the managed production of
these resources.
Goal
Preserve open space for the managed production of resources.
Policies
III-18    Continue to protect areas required for groundwater recharge to ensure groundwater
          quality and quantity.
III-19    Protect bays, estuaries, rivers and streams as necessary for commercial fishing.
Implementation Action
     ·    Expand the Open Space land use designations as necessary to encompass areas needed
          for the managed production of resources.
III.E     OPEN SPACE FOR THE PROTECTION OF SCENIC RESOURCES
Much of the character of Avalon is due to the small scale of development and the scenic vistas
that are visually available to residents and visitors from all areas of the City. With the vision of
being a model city for environmental responsibility, allowing smart development of the lower
hillsides while restricting the more visible higher elevations and ridgelines is prudent. With that
vision in mind, it is the intent of the City to preserve the prominent views of hillsides
surrounding Avalon Canyon. The ridgelines are mapped on Figure III-2.
Goal
Retain as much as possible, the existing scenic hillsides for the community of Avalon and its
visitors.
Policy
III-20    Preserve views of 18 prominent ridgelines in Upper Avalon Canyon, as depicted on
          Figure III-2, by restricting development in the vicinity of the ridgelines.
Implementation Action
     ·    Establish a Scenic Hillside Restricted Zone and appropriate development standards to
          restrict development from unnecessarily encroaching on scenic hillsides.
                                                                                      CITY of AVALON

   2030 GENERAL PLAN / LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
                            IV.     CONSERVATION ELEMENT
Conservation is defined in this General Plan as the careful preservation, protection, or planned
management of a natural resource to prevent its exploitation, destruction, or neglect. The term
sustainable has become common parlance when referring to principles, practices, and
application of techniques that conserve energy, water, and other natural resources; manage the
use of renewable and non-renewable resources in an efficient and responsible manner with an
emphasis on self-sufficiency; preserve and improve the environment, from the local to the
global level; reduce pollution and solid waste; improve human health and safety; and strengthen
the economy.
Avalon possesses many resources that contribute to its unique character, beauty, and
desirability as a place to live, work, and visit. Key to maintaining this healthy and vibrant
community as Avalon continues to grow is the conservation and sustainable stewardship of our
natural resources—such as air quality, water, energy, and soil—for the protection of plant and
wildlife habitats, and public health, safety and welfare. Avalon’s cultural resources are also
important, as they provide a link to the City’s past, help shape its present-day character,
celebrate its unique identity, and offer a source of pride and community connection for its
residents. Conserving resources, promoting clean energy generation, and reducing the amount
of community-generated waste will help preserve non-renewable resources, reduce air
pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and increase self-sufficiency on the island.
The Conservation Element emphasizes Avalon’s desire to become a model town for
sustainability and its commitment to conserve, preserve, and enhance its valuable resources.
The Element establishes a number of goals, policies and implementation actions for the long-
term conservation and sustainable management of the rich natural resources that help define
the City’s identity, contribute to its economy, and improve its quality of life.
The topics addressed in this Conservation Element include:
    ·    Biotic Resources
    ·    Air Quality
    ·    Coastal Resources and Sea Level Rise
    ·    Water Resources
    ·    Energy Resources
    ·    Solid Waste Management
    ·    Soil Conservation
    ·    Cultural Resources
    ·    Mineral Resources

IV.      CONSERVATION ELEMENT
The Conservation Element fulfills the requirements of the State-mandated Conservation
Element as defined in Section 65302 of the Government Code. According to these
requirements, the General Plan must provide direction regarding the conservation,
development and utilization of natural resources, including rivers and water, forests, wildlife
and other natural resources. This element also addresses cultural resources as required in
Section 65302 of the Government Code. The preservation and/or sustainable management of
other resources, such as air quality and energy, and reduction of GHG emissions pursuant to
recent legislation, also may be included. The conservation and preservation of open space areas
is covered in the Open Space Element of the General Plan.
IV.A BIOTIC RESOURCES
Avalon is home to large expanses of open land, natural hillsides, natural stream channels,
beaches and harbors, wildlife, and panoramic views. Natural landscapes within the City include
the valley floor, which comprises the downtown area, and rugged canyons, hillsides and
beaches/waterfronts and the harbor. Animal species include the Santa Catalina Island Fox,
Catalina California ground squirrel, Northern Elephant Seal, California Sea Lion, the California
Kingsnake, and dozens more. Among the approximately 37 bird species known to reside on the
island are the Bald Eagle, Orange crowned Warbler, and the Catalina California Quail. Hundreds
of plants are known to occur on the island, including endemic species such as Catalina
Mohagany, Catalina Ironwood, Catalina Manzanita, and dozens more (Catalina Island
Conservancy, 2010). These endemic species give the island a special ecological interest. In
addition to the abundance of endemic and native species, some non-native species have
appeared on the island throughout its history. Non-
native species include animals such as American Bison
and mule deer, and hundreds of plants species such as             Sensitive species are specific
flax leaf broom, fennel, and Horehound. Non-native                    organisms that have
species can also be invasive and require management,                   regionally declining
such as the plants previously listed. The surrounding              populations   such that they

is host to a wide range of resident and migratory birds.           declining  population trends

communities within and proximate to Avalon.
Preservation of the natural environment on Catalina has been an integral part of the island’s
development since the early 20th century, when William Wrigley, Jr. took over the Santa Catalina
Island Company (Company). Over 75% of the land within the City limits is owned and managed
by the SCIC. Goals and policies set forth in this section emphasize the City’s long-standing
commitment to the protection of the natural environment and are designed to preserve the
City’s existing biotic resources.

Goal
Preserve critical biotic resources and enhance habitat value and biotic resource diversity within
the Avalon area.
Policies
IV-1     Ensure that new developments, including roads, maintain the biotic habitat value of
         riparian areas, oak woodlands, habitat linkages, and other sensitive biological habitats.
IV-2     Regulate construction activities to eliminate potentially destructive practices that
         adversely affect environmentally sensitive areas.
IV-3     Preserve the integrity of the riparian habitat areas, creek corridors, and other drainages
         that support biological resources and contribute to the overall health of the watershed
         areas through the preservation and restoration of native plants and the removal of
         invasive, exotic, and nonnative species.
IV-4     Preserve existing mature indigenous
         trees, unless they are detrimental to
         public health and safety.
IV-5     Promote the planting of additional trees
         in developed locations. Plantings should
         include replacement of trees that are, or
         have been, removed and new trees in
         locations where none are currently
         present.
Implementation Actions
·   Within areas having significant biotic values, develop criteria and procedures for assessing
    the environmental impact of public and private projects.
·   Enforce state and federal conservation and avoidance regulations, through the development
    review process, for all new development projects on private property that may potentially
    impact affect natural vegetation communities or biological resources.
·   Continue to require development proposed in areas identified or expected to contain
    sensitive vegetation and wildlife communities to consult with wildlife agencies (i.e., United
    States Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS] and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife
    [CDFW] (formerly Fish and Game)) and the Catalina Island Conservancy (Conservancy) early
    in the development review process regarding special status plant and wildlife species;
    conduct biological assessments, as appropriate; and develop and implement project-specific
    mitigation measures to mitigate impacts on threatened and endangered species.

IV.B AIR QUALITY GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS
Air quality in Avalon is generally good, which is important for the health of those who work and
live in Avalon, and for the visual beauty of the area. The ocean breezes create relatively good air
quality conditions in Avalon. In addition, the City regulates the number of vehicles permitted
within City limits, and most residents drive small vehicles, or autoettes. Common generators of
pollutants, such as vehicle emissions, construction, and industrial operations, are limited within
the City and the island as a whole. Therefore, activities that exceed South Coast Air Quality
Management District (SCAQMD) thresholds are relatively infrequent.
Although Avalon is not a major contributor to the effects of global climate change (GCC), GCC
has emerged as an important planning issue and recent changes to state law require all
communities in California to address climate change through various processes. Specifically,
Assembly Bill (AB) 32 (the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006) requires attainment of
a statewide GHG emissions limit equivalent to 1990 emissions (essentially a 15% reduction below
2005 emission levels) by 2020 and the adoption of rules and regulations to achieve the maximum
technologically feasible and cost-effective GHG emissions reductions. A companion bill known as
Senate Bill (SB) 375 requires the inclusion of sustainable communities’ strategies (SCS) in regional
transportation plans (RTPs) for the purpose of reducing GHG emissions. SB 375 requires the
development of regional targets for the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
from passenger vehicles, for 2020 and 2035 and provides incentives for communities to develop
plans that comply with regional plans and GHG reduction targets. Avalon is an active participant
in the development of the Southern California Association of Governments’ SCS.
The goals, policies and implementation actions set forth in this section are intended to preserve
Avalon’s good air quality and reduce the City’s contribution to global climate change. This is
consistent with AB 32, which calls for a greenhouse gas emissions cap for 2020 that would
reduce such emissions to 1990 levels.
Goals
Maintain air quality that meets state and federal standards.
Reduce greenhouse gas emissions from community activities and municipal facilities and
operations within the City boundaries to support the State’s efforts under Assembly Bill 32,
Senate Bill 375, and other state and federal mandates.
                                                                                      CITY of AVALON

Policies
IV-6     Facilitate compliance by local employers and businesses with regional air quality
         regulation through education, outreach, involvement, and policies that assist them in
         meeting regulations, while cultivating and supporting a positive business climate.
IV-7     Reduce community-wide emissions of greenhouse gases by at least 15% from 2005
         levels as stipulated in AB 32.
IV-8     Evaluate and disclose the contribution of development projects on climate change and
         require mitigation measures as appropriate.
IV-9     Minimize emissions of air pollutants, including greenhouse gases, generated by
         electricity and natural gas consumption, waste disposal, and vehicles through
         implementation of the energy conservation policies and actions listed in subchapter
         IV.E, the solid waste recycling policies listed in subchapter IV.F, and the alternative
         transportation policies in the Circulation Element.
Implementation Actions
·   Monitor changes in State regulations related to air quality and update local regulations as
    appropriate.
·   Participate in inter-agency and/or inter-jurisdictional meetings and planning activities to
    share best practices and adaptation strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase
    community sustainability, and educate the public about climate change.
·   Develop a public outreach program to increase public awareness of climate change and
    climate protection challenges; publicize the importance of reducing GHG emissions; and
    provide information on actions community members and businesses can take to reduce
    their individual impacts.
·   Develop and adopt City purchasing practices and standards to support reductions in GHG
    emissions, including preferences for energy-efficient equipment and the use of recycled
    materials and manufacturers that have implemented green management practices;
    encourage other public agencies and private businesses within Avalon to do the same, when
    feasible.
IV. C COASTAL RESOURCES AND SEA LEVEL RISE
The City of Avalon is located entirely within the coastal zone. The City’s coastal resources are
treasured as they contribute to the local economy and provide opportunities for tourism,
recreation, research and education, and marine-related industry. Some of the most prominent
coastal resources in Avalon include the City’s beach areas, Avalon Bay, adjacent coves, and
marine life. Therefore, the goals and policies in this section place a high priority on preserving
Avalon’s coastal resources and emphasize environmentally sustainable and prudent use by
current and future generations.
                                                                                      CITY of AVALON

2030 GENERAL PLAN / LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
IV.       CONSERVATION ELEMENT
In addition, the goals and policies in this section detail ways to protect Avalon’s coastal
resources from dangers, including sea level rise that may occur as a result of global climate
change. Over the past century, sea level has risen 2 to 4 inches, and scientists forecast that sea
level rise will by 4 to 36 inches between 1990 and 2100.1 As a result, coastal areas may be
subject to increasing risk of inundation and erosion. Sea-level rise may threaten coastal
wetlands, infrastructure, and property.
Goals
Maintain the integrity of beaches, coves, harbor, and bays.
Protect Avalon and its coastal resources from sea level rise.
Policies
IV-10     Protect marine resources (shorelines, lagoons, bays, harbors, sea cliffs, etc.) that
          have scenic, recreational, educational, or ecological value.
IV-11     Discourage development that may be adversely affected by sea level rise.
IV-12     Improve infrastructure as needed to address rising sea levels.
IV-13     Protect water supplies from contamination by saltwater.
Implementation Actions
·     Engage state and local governments in defining responses to sea level rise.
·     Collaborate with climate science experts on local climate change impacts, mitigation,
      and adaptation, including sea level changes, to inform public policy decisions.
·     Integrate protection against the effects of sea level rise into the design of coastal structures.
·     Collaborate with climate science experts to identify areas that may be exposed to risks due
      to sea level rise, such as flooding or erosion.
IV.D WATER RESOURCES
Avalon recognizes the critical nature of water resources on Santa Catalina Island. Southern
California Edison currently owns and operates the water utility on Catalina Island, which
provides service to the City. The primary source of fresh water is groundwater, which is pumped
into the Middle Ranch/Thompson Reservoir. In addition, Southern California Edison operates a

desalination plant, located at Pebbly Beach, which uses reverse osmosis of ocean water to
produce potable fresh water. Avalon’s freshwater demand is 477 acre feet per year, and the
total island’s current demand is 505 acre feet per year, which is approaching the groundwater
supply safe yield.
Due to the limited water resources available, the City has a variety of water conservation
mechanisms in place. During droughts water rationing measures set forth in the Municipal Code
include a limitation of three gallons for washing exterior surfaces and vehicles, limited hours for
landscape irrigation, and prohibition of serving drinking water in restaurants and bars unless
specifically requested. Saltwater is also
used as a water supply source for toilet
flushing and fire suppression, and this
service is provided by the City. There are
two saltwater reservoirs: Mount Ada
Reservoir and Falls Canyon Reservoir.
However, this process requires specialized
maintenance due to corrosion and
biological growth. Salt water is not
available at elevations greater than 170
feet above sea level, as the system is
dependent on pressure generated from the
reservoir elevations. Because of the
corrosion and other limitations associated
with the salt water system, the City has considered updates to the system. One possibility that
has been considered is a freshwater tertiary treated waste water system. Any new
development is required to provide proof of the availability of fresh water from Southern
California Edison, per the City’s Municipal Code.
Another challenge involving water resources in Avalon is the maintenance of good water quality
through stormwater management. The City operates the sewer and storm water infrastructure
and has recently adopted a Sewer System Management Plan. The sewer system is a gravity-
based system with smaller diameter lines in higher elevations and larger diameter lines in lower
elevations. Sewage is transported and treated at the Avalon Wastewater Treatment Facility
(AWTF) before it is discharged into the ocean. Sewer line capacity is unknown at this time;
however, as of 2011, estimated sewage generation within the City is 802,880 gallons per day
and AWTF operating capacity is 1.2 million gallons per day. Furthermore, in an effort to
preserve harbor water quality during storm events, the first 9,600 gallons of initial storm water
is diverted into the sewer system to be treated at the AWTF. The storm water treated is
included in the estimated daily sewage generation.
Avalon’s sewer pipelines are old and leaks have been identified throughout the system,
contributing to the degradation of water quality in Avalon Bay. The Sewer System Management
Plan addresses these leaks and the City is in the process of implementing the plan.
Nevertheless, water quality remains an issue at Avalon Bay.

IV.E ENERGY RESOURCES
Avalon is committed to the wise use of natural resources, including energy resources, and the
development of alternative sources of energy. Electricity and gas in Avalon are provided by
Southern California Edison. Electricity is produced through the use of diesel fuel, but new
combustion microturbines are currently being constructed to utilize propane as a source of
energy. LNG is barged to the island and converted to a domestically usable gas for distribution
to residents.
Establishing more local energy sources, with an emphasis on clean, renewable sources, will
provide increased economic stability and environmental benefits. The use of renewable energy
sources and electricity and gas conservation reduces dependence on fossil fuels and imported
fuels, and also helps to reduce carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Water
conservation also helps reduce energy use, as much of the energy used within the City goes for
pumping and treating water. The water conservation policies in Subchapter IV.D will help to
reduce energy consumption. Increasing the use of energy efficient or alternative energy
                                                                                       CITY of AVALON

         heaters, and other forms of renewable energy production.
IV-27    Minimize the amount of energy consumed by City operations by taking a leadership role
         in the application of new technologies at City facilities. As feasible, cooperate with
         Southern California Edison and the South Coast Air Quality Management District to set
         up energy conservation demonstration projects, and to serve as a laboratory for testing
         new energy conservation techniques.
IV-28    Use small, decentralized, aesthetically-designed, and appropriately-sited energy
         efficient power generation facilities to the extent feasible.
IV-29    Maintain and promote water conservation and waste diversion programs to conserve
         energy.
IV-30    Reduce the "heat island effect" (especially within the center city area) by promoting
         such features as white roofs, light colored hardscape paving, construction of shade
         structures, installation of mature trees, and by reducing the extent of unshaded parking
         lots.
Implementation Actions
·    Collaborate with Southern California Edison to promote energy conservation programs,
     Energy Star® appliance change-out programs, rebates, vouchers, and other incentives to
     install energy-efficient technology and products.
·    Pursue state and federal funding opportunities for research and development of alternative
     and renewable energy sources as needed.

IV.F SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
CR&R, Inc. (as of June 2013) provides solid waste management services for the City at Pebbly
Beach Landfill. Pebbly Beach Landfill consists of the landfill, a transfer facility, a materials
recovery facility, and a composting facility. The landfill itself is small at only four acres, and the
total size of the disposal facility is 7.7 acres. The Pebbly Beach Landfill has an estimated closure
date of 2033 (CR&R, Inc., March 2013). The city recently entered into a new contract with CR&R,
Inc. as of March 2013. Under this new disposal agreement with CR&R, the life and capacity of
the landfill would be extended to the year 2033 on account of a larger baler that would be
installed at the landfill site. Additionally, CR&R has agreed to pay for up to $200,000 in planning
costs to raise the height of the landfill which, when accomplished, would add additional years to
the landfill. Finally, CR&R and the City are currently working on an energy to power plant that
would be used to further extend the life of the landfill and could potentially, depending upon
technological advances, be utilized to "mine" existing waste in the landfill and turn into energy,
thus reducing the current waste in the landfill and extending its life indefinitely.
Avalon realizes the issues related to solid waste and has been making arrangements to ensure
that waste disposal needs are met. In response, the City promotes solid waste reduction
through 35 diversion programs aimed at reducing the amounts of solid waste going to landfills.
Major programs include residential and commercial site pickup, government source reduction,
greenwaste reduction, electronic disposal, recycling, economic incentives, and educational
programs. The goals and policies in this section provide an integrated approach to waste
management, focusing on the reduction, recycling, and reuse of materials, as well as the
purchase of sustainable products and materials.
Goals
Provide efficient, economically, environmentally-sound waste collection, management, and
disposal.
Achieve the maximum diversion of materials from disposal through the reduction, reuse, and
recycling of wastes to the highest and best use.
Policies
IV-31    Minimize waste generation through reduction of waste generation at the source (source
         reduction) and reuse and recycling of materials.
                                                                                        CITY of AVALON

        deploy environmentally responsible waste-to-energy technologies.
IV-34   Promote organic waste reuse to produce compost and/or biofuel from the maximum
        amount of organic waste generated within the City as possible.
Implementation Actions
·   Continue to implement and expand ongoing City waste diversion programs.
·   Continue to identify and assess alternatives to standard disposal practices as fiscally- and
    environmentally-sound technologies become available.
·   Cooperate on a regional basis with local governments, state agencies, and private solid
    waste companies to find the best practicable and environmentally safe solutions to waste
    management.
·   Educate the public on the purchase of environmentally preferable purchasing of products
    and materials.
·   Reduce subsidies to disposal and encourage incentives for waste diversion.
IV.G SOIL CONSERVATION
Grading and construction associated with development projects can cause soil erosion, including
removal of topsoil, and can create large amounts of dust. The City will continue to require
developers to implement water erosion control plans in accordance with National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements and dust control plans in accordance with
South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) requirements.
Grading can also result in significant changes to site topography, which can in turn result in long-
term topsoil loss. In addition, unbalanced grading can create the need for transport of soils on
                                                                                   CITY of AVALON

or offsite. Consequently, to the maximum extent practical, alteration of natural landforms
should be minimized and grading should be balanced onsite.
Goal
Avoid potentially significant impacts relating to soil erosion through the application of
appropriate soil management techniques.
Policies
IV-35    Require the use of best management practices for soil erosion control as part of any
         grading activity or natural landform alteration. Additionally, require erosion control
         measures prior to grading operations commencement.
IV-36    Preserve vegetation needed to prevent erosion and sedimentation.
IV-37    Promote balanced onsite grading operations to eliminate the need for transporting soils
         on or offsite. In addition, promote phased grading operations rather than mass grading.
Implementation Actions
·    Regulate construction activities to eliminate potentially destructive practices that remove
     topsoil.
·    Continue to enforce the requirements of the federal National Pollutant Discharge
     Elimination System (NPDES) and other federal and state requirements pertaining to soil
     management and surface runoff.
IV.H CULTURAL RESOURCES
The city of Avalon has a cultural heritage that stretches back thousands of years and spans many
cultures which have inhabited Santa Catalina Island. Traces of Gabrielino/Tongva, Spanish,
Mexican, and US cultural traditions can still be seen in Avalon today.
Earliest dated evidence of occupation on the island comes from Little Harbor at approximately
7800 B.P. (or between 5,000-6,000 BC). However, San Clemente and San Nicolas have dates
reaching back 10,000 years ago. The four Southern Channel Islands (San Clemente, Santa
Catalina, San Nicolas, and Santa Barbara) were inhabited by the Gabrielino/Tongva people, while
the northern Channel Islands are identified as being Chumash. Over thousands of years people
from the islands utilized the rich land and marine resources, as well as visited and traded with
each other and the mainland. Fish, sea mammals, and soapstone were some of the items traded
for chipping stone, deer, and other mainland items. When the Spanish arrived in 1542 under
Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, he reported rich, thriving villages eager to trade. He mentions visiting
villages at Avalon Bay, Nájquqar (Two Harbors), and likely White’s or Empire Landing. The island
was called Pimugna. Even though Cabrillo named the island San Salvador in the name of the
Spanish crown, it was renamed Santa Catalina when General Sebastian Viscaino visited on the
eve of Saint Catherine’s Day in 1602.
                                                                                    CITY of AVALON

Visits to the island continued sporadically including Russian fur traders, adventure seekers,
privateers, and miners. The island moved from Spanish to Mexican hands with Mexican
Independence and Thomas Robbins received a grant to Catalina in 1846 from Governor Pio Pico.
Many cattle and sheep were pastured on the island both in town and within the many coves as
squatters. Title was clarified and consolidated by James Lick with the assistance of the US union
soldiers that resided in Two Harbors during the Civil War. While Lick was unable to make owning
the island profitable, George Shatto made a valiant attempt with his purchase of the island in
1887. He ordered the construction of the Hotel Metropole and sold lots on the flats near the
hotel. It was Shatto’s sister, Etta Whitney, who suggested Avalon as a better name than Shatto
City with its romantic and mysterious tones.
While the start of Avalon was realized, Shatto could not make a meet his mortgage payments
and the island reverted back to the James Lick trustees, who then sold it to William, Hancock,
and Joseph Banning in 1892. Much of the infrastructure of Avalon was formed during the
Banning Brothers tenure including the layout of streets and recreational pastimes. They created
the stage coach roads around the island, built Eagles Nest Hunting Lodge in Middle Canyon, and
started regular transportation to the island to bring the many tourists looking for a great escape
from Los Angeles.
The term “cultural resource” means any tangible or observable evidence of past human activity,
regardless of significance, found in direct association with a geographic location, including
tangible properties possessing intangible traditional cultural values. Cultural resources include
both archaeological (pre-historic) and historic resources.
Roughly, 2,000 archaeological sites have been recorded across the island, including villages, tool
manufacturing locations, soapstone quarries, and food refuse piles (middens). Few have been well
documented and some have unfortunately been disturbed by pot hunting and amateur excavations
that started in the 1870s. Major collections from
the island exist in places such as the Peabody
Museum at Harvard University, the Smithsonian
Natural History Museum, and the National Museum
of the American Indian. The Catalina Island
Conservancy (Conservancy) and Santa Catalina
Island Company (Company) are continually striving
to preserve and protect the cultural resources on
the island.
Three properties in Avalon are listed in the National
Register of Historic Places: the Tuna Club of Avalon,
the Peter Gano House (Holly Hill House), and the Wrigley Summer Cottage (Inn at Mt. Ada). In
addition, there are a number of structures of local historical and architectural interest within
Avalon, including:

IV.I     MINERAL RESOURCES
Some areas within the City contain mineral resources and are appropriate for mineral
extraction. The rock quarry, located within the City’s Sphere of Influence boundary as shown in
Figure II-1 in the Land Use Element, is still in production (operated by Connolly-Pacific Co.) and
produces crushed rock or aggregate primarily for construction uses. Historically, mining
operations Island were conducted to extract silver, lead, and zinc on several places on Catalina

                                V.       HOUSING ELEMENT
The Housing Element represents an awareness of the need to assure that housing is provided
for all economic segments of the community. The Element also satisfies the legal requirements
that housing policy be a part of the General Plan. The Housing Element is concerned with
specifically identifying ways in which the housing needs of existing and future resident residents
can be met.
This Housing Element covers the Fifth Revision Cycle – October 15, 2013 through October 15,
2021. The Housing Element identifies goals, policies, and programs that focus on:
    ·    Conserving and improving existing affordable housing;
    ·    Providing adequate housing sites;
    ·    Assisting in the development of affordable housing;
    ·    Removing governmental and other constraints to housing development; and
    ·    Promoting equal housing opportunities.
A goal is a general direction-setter. It is an ideal future end. A policy is a specific statement that
guides decision- making. It indicates a commitment of the local legislative body to a particular
course of action.
An important goal of this element is to ensure that the City of Avalon continues to grow and
develop as a clean and safe town where residents have access to adequate, dignified, and
affordable housing without overcrowding, where population density is in balance with
resources, and where land use planning, zoning, and building code enforcement carry out this
expressed vision.
Public Participation
The City held a series of public workshops and meetings as part of the General Plan update
process, including the Housing Element updates for the 2008-2013 and 2013-2021 planning
periods. The first of these public meetings occurred on December 7, 2010 during a Special Joint
Meeting of the City Council and Planning Commission, followed by a Community Workshop on
December 8, 2010. In addition to announcing the meetings in City newsletter, website, and
public notices, special invitations were also sent to a list of agencies and organizations that serve
the low and moderate income households and those with special needs, community
stakeholders, and housing professionals. These include:
                                                                                       CITY of AVALON

Five members of the public attended the Community Workshop. Comments made during these
public meetings centered primarily on the need for more affordable housing and the desire to
establish mixed use opportunities in the City’s commercial centers. Residents also stated a need
to improve overcrowding conditions. The housing programs contained in this Housing Element
specifically address housing opportunities in mixed use areas, affordable housing through new
construction and rehabilitation, and alleviation of overcrowding through the provision of
affordable housing.
On September 20, 2011, the City conducted a public hearing before the City Council to review
the Draft Housing Element specifically for the 2008-2013 planning period and on August 1, 2012,
the City Council and Planning Commission conducted a joint workshop to receive input on the
Draft Housing Element that covers both 2008-2013 and 2013-2021 planning periods, and
authorized staff to submit the Draft Element for HCD review.
Public Hearings for Adoption
The City of Avalon will conduct additional public hearings before the Planning Commission and
City Council to adopt the Housing Element for the 2008-2013 and 2013-2021 planning periods.
These meetings will be publicly noticed and agencies on the City’s outreach list will be notified.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
According to State planning law, the Housing Element must be consistent with the other General
Plan elements. While each of the elements is independent, the elements are also interrelated
to a degree. Certain goals and policies of each element may also address issues that are primary
subjects of other elements. This integration of issues throughout the General Plan creates a
strong basis for the implementation of plans and programs and achievement of community
goals.
The 2008-2014 Housing Element was developed in conjunction with the other Elements of the
General Plan as part of a comprehensive update, and is consistent with the policies and
proposals set forth in the Plan. As an element of the General Plan, the Housing Element has
been reviewed and modified if necessary to ensure continued consistency among the various
elements. Specifically, new State law requires that the Safety and Conservation Elements
include an analysis and policies regarding flood hazard and management information upon
                                                                                  CITY of AVALON

3. Preservation of At-Risk Units: Pursuant to the Housing Element law, the at-risk housing
    analysis covers a ten-year period from the start date of the Housing Element cycle. Since
    the Housing Element Technical Appendix covers two Housing Element cycles (2008-2013
    and 2013-2021), the at-risk housing analysis must extend ten years from 2013 (i.e., through
    2023). Of the City’s 127 affordable units, only one project, the Tremont Street Apartments,
    with 50 very low and low income units, is at-risk due to an expiring Section 8 contract. The
    Section 8 contract for the project is due to expire in August of 2016. The project includes 10
    one-bedroom units, 37 two-bedroom units, and 15 three-bedroom units.

V.B       ASSISTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Providing affordable housing is essential for a healthy community. In addition to a diverse mix
of housing types, it is necessary to make available housing for residents of all income levels.
Seeking funding from varied sources increases the opportunities for development of affordable
housing units. The Avalon Planning and Building Department actively works with both non-
profit and for-profit developers in the production of affordable for-sale and rental housing.
Recognizing that homeownership plays a significant role in establishing strong neighborhoods
and a sense of community pride, the City supports programs that make purchasing a home a
realistic option for lower and moderate income households.

V.C      PROVISION OF ADEQUATE HOUSING SITES
A major element in meeting the housing needs of all segments of the community is the
provision of adequate sites for all types, sizes and prices of housing. Persons and households of
different ages, types, incomes, and lifestyles have a variety of housing needs and preferences
that evolve over time and in response to changing life circumstances. Providing an adequate
supply and diversity of housing accommodates the changing housing needs of residents. To
provide adequate housing and maximize use of limited land resources, new development should
be constructed at appropriate densities that maximize the intended use of the land.
Goal
Provide for the development of a variety of housing types in Avalon, and attain dignified, safe,
and affordable housing opportunities within decent living environment for households of all
socioeconomic segments in Avalon.
Policies

Programs
7. Affordable Housing Development: The primary funding source for affordable housing in
   Avalon was the Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside funds, which will generate no future
   revenue due to the dissolution of redevelopment agencies in California. The City will pursue
   additional funding for affordable housing development and acquisition/ rehabilitation. The
   City will work with the Company and other qualified developers to pursue appropriate
   funding. City involvement may include:
   ·    Review of pro forma analyses;
   ·    Provision of demographics and other background data for preparation of funding
        applications;
   ·    Review and comment on draft funding applications;
   ·    Provision of letters of support;
   ·    Assistance in monitoring compliance with funding program regulations; and
   ·    As necessary and financially feasible, provision of local match funds.
   The City’s website will be used to promote housing programs and assistance available to
   residents and property owners.

8. Inclusionary Housing Program: The City recently amended the inclusionary housing
   program to include housing for middle income households and to extend inclusionary
   housing requirements to all new commercial developments. The amended program also
   offers a flexibility income distribution for the inclusionary units to be determined at the time
   of project approval. An in-lieu fee option is also offered. These options allow the program
   to respond to changing market conditions in a timely manner and therefore enhance project
   feasibility.

10. Adequate Sites Monitoring Program: The City of Avalon General Plan provides for a range
    of residential land use designations, such as single-family residential, multi-family
    residential, manufactured homes, condominiums, and mixed-use housing. The General Plan
    identifies adequate sites to accommodate the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation
    (RHNA) for both Housing Element cycles. Most of the community’s remaining sites available
    for development are owned by the Company. The City will work cooperatively with the
    Company to monitor the sites inventory and its obligation toward accommodating the
    RHNA.

11. Density Bonus Program: Current state law requires jurisdictions to provide density bonuses
    and development incentives to all developers who propose to construct affordable housing
    on a sliding scale, where the amount of density bonus and number of incentives/regulatory
    concessions vary according to the amount of affordable housing units provided. The existing
    Avalon density bonus provisions are not consistent with the State density bonus law in that
    no incentives/concessions are included.

governmental constraints affecting the maintenance, improvement, and development of
housing. Removing constraints on housing development can help address housing needs in the
City by expediting construction, and lowering development costs.

13. Clarify Parking Requirement: The City requires one standard parking space per residential
    unit. However, the City’s Zoning Ordinance is unclear regarding the size of a standard
    parking space. Historically, the City interpreted the requirement as one conventional
    parking space (eight feet by 17 feet) space and permitted the substitution with an autoette
    space (six feet by ten feet) via the approval of a variance. However, because the number of
    allowable conventional automobiles in the City is limited and the waiting list to bring an
    additional conventional automobile onto the island is at least ten years long, the City’s
    policy has changed. The current City Council policy is to require one autoette parking space
    per unit in the downtown area. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to clarify its
    parking standards. Specifically, the City will establish the autoette as the minimum parking
    requirement citywide, thereby removing the need to process a variance.

V.E     PROVISION OF EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
To meet the housing needs of all segments of the community, the Housing Plan includes a
program to promote housing opportunities for all persons. The City works with the Housing
Rights Center and Fair Housing Foundation, which provides fair housing and tenant/landlord
services for Avalon residents.
Goal
Promote equal opportunity for all residents to reside in housing of their choice.
                                                                                    CITY of AVALON

    jurisdiction. As a participating jurisdiction of the Los Angeles County CDBG program, the
    City is served by the Housing Rights Center and Fair Housing Foundation.

    Funding Sources:          General funds
15. Reasonable Accommodation: The Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, requires that
    cities and counties provide reasonable accommodation to rules, policies, practices, and
    procedures where such accommodation may be necessary to afford individuals with
    disabilities equal housing opportunities. While fair housing laws intend that all people have
    equal access to housing, the law also recognizes that people with disabilities may need extra
    tools to achieve equality. Reasonable accommodation is one of the tools intended to
    further housing opportunities for people with disabilities. Reasonable accommodation
    provides a means of requesting from the local government flexibility in the application of
    land use and zoning regulations or, in some instances, even a waiver of certain restrictions
    or requirements because it is necessary to achieve equal access to housing. Cities and
    counties are required to consider requests for accommodations related to housing for
    people with disabilities and provide the accommodation when it is determined to be
    “reasonable” based on fair housing laws and the case law interpreting the statutes.
    The City currently has no established reasonable accommodation process in place. The City
    is densely built out and because of its topography, extensive accessibility improvements to
    existing individual homes are difficult to accomplish, if not impossible. Such requests are
    rare and are typically handled on a case-by-case basis.
                                                                                        CITY of AVALON

                             VI.     CIRCULATION ELEMENT
The Circulation Element addresses broad issues of physical mobility -- how goods and people
move about within the community. Transportation relates to land use, community design, air
quality, energy consumption, and the City's infrastructure. Section 65302(b) of the State of
California Government Code requires all general plans to include a circulation element that
identifies the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares,
transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with
the land use element of the plan.
This portion of the Avalon General Plan documents and analyzes existing circulation conditions
in the City of Avalon, as well as projected conditions that can be expected as a result of the full
buildout of the land use element of the proposed General Plan in 2030. This portion of the plan
also identifies capital and operational improvements to address transportation- and circulation-
related issues.

CITY OF AVALON
2030 GENERAL PLAN / LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
VI.      CIRCULATION ELEMENT
I.A BACKGROUND & CONTEXT
Circulation issues are not simply local concerns, but require coordination with regional, state,
and federal agencies. The following summarizes regional planning efforts and regulatory issues
related to transportation in Avalon.
Regional Transportation Planning
The Metro Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) articulates prioritized transportation
improvements to Los Angeles County, including freeway, transit, bikeway, and grade crossing.
Avalon is included within the Gateway Cities Subregion. Given its unique location and
characteristics, the current LRTP does not include any planned improvements within the City of
Avalon. The plan, however, does show continuation of ferry service from San Pedro and Long
Beach to both Two Harbors and Avalon Harbor.
Regulatory Issues
AB 1358 – Complete Streets Act
The California Complete Streets Act of 2008 was signed into law on September 30, 2008.
Beginning January 1, 2011, AB 1358 requires circulation elements to address the transportation
system from a multi-modal perspective. The bill states that streets, roads, and highways must
“meet the needs of all users…in a manner suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context of
the general plan.” Essentially, this bill requires a circulation element to plan for all modes of
transportation where appropriate—including walking, biking, car travel, and transit.
The Complete Streets Act also requires circulation elements to consider the multiple users of the
transportation system, including children, adults, seniors, and the disabled. For further clarity,
AB 1358 tasks the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research to release guidelines for
compliance with this legislation by January 1, 2014.
SB 375
SB 375, described in detail in the Land Use Element, requires synchronization of regional
transportation plans on eight-year schedules. As changes to regional transportation plans
occur, the City will need to update its plans as appropriate to conform to changing regional
direction.
VI.B TRAVEL CHARACTERISTICS AND EXISTING CONDITIONS
Several factors contribute to the unique character of the transportation system in Avalon. The
City is compact, encompassing about three square miles of land area with a compact urban form
and no traffic signals. In addition, circulation within the City is comprised of multiple modes
with a particular emphasis on pedestrian and bicycle travel. The predominant vehicle type is the
                                                                                      CITY of AVALON
                                                  VI-2

                                                                                   CITY OF AVALON
                                                   2030 GENERAL PLAN / LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
                                                                   VI.     CIRCULATION ELEMENT
autoette, which is smaller and travels at lower speeds than traditional automobiles. During
peak times, visitors can triple the population of the City.
Many roadways in Avalon operate at or near their maximum vehicle capacity, and pedestrian
and bicycle facilities often overflow into vehicle travel lanes during peak periods. Future
increases in local and visitor populations will likely lead to increased trip making within the City.
Although the high volume of pedestrians, bicyclists, and automobiles accessing the downtown
area often result in traffic congestion, this congestion is a sign of economic and social vitality.
Redirecting pedestrians and bicyclists or discouraging tourist travel would have implications for
businesses downtown and for the overall quality of life within the City.
Vehicles
Vehicle demand in the City does not
approach concentrations observed in
other urban areas. This is primarily
the result of effective demand
management. Avalon’s vehicle
permitting system and land use
parking approval process regulate
vehicle demand for roadway
capacity, benefitting drivers,
bicyclists, and pedestrians who use
the City’s street network.
The number of vehicles permitted in Avalon in 2005 was 2,502, which includes autoettes, cars,
and trucks (PMC, 2006). Autoettes are defined as measuring up to 120 inches in length by 55
inches in width and weighing up to 1800 pounds. Full size vehicles can be no longer than 200
inches in length by 80 inches in width (with no maximum weight).
Vehicle usage within the City limits is strictly regulated. As specified in the Avalon Municipal
Code, all autoettes, cars, and trucks must have a permit to be parked or operated in the City.
There are four separate types of vehicle permits: residential (full size or autoette), commercial,
and interior commercial (for vehicles outside Avalon). A single new residential permit is issued
when two full-size existing residential permits have become ineligible for renewal or have been
voluntarily surrendered. The City restricts autoettes to one per registered legal dwelling unit. A
new commercial and interior commercial permit is issued when an existing permit expires.
Separate waiting lists are maintained for those interested in obtaining residential, commercial,
or commercial interior vehicle permits.
Residential vehicle permits may not be bought and sold, and permits may only be transferred
under unique circumstances specified by the City’s Municipal Code. Commercial vehicle permits
may be transferred when a business is sold if the transfer is approved by the City’s Vehicle
Hearing Officer. All residential permits expire on April 1st of each year and interior commercial
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

vehicle permits expire on November 1st of each year. Commercial vehicle permits are valid for a
full year from when they are issued before they must be renewed.
Vehicle Facilities
The roadway network in the center of town from Metropole Avenue to Clemente Avenue and
Crescent Avenue to Tremont Street follows a grid-like pattern. This area is considered “The
Flats” and is the floor of Avalon Valley. Outside of The Flats, roadways begin to mimic the
natural landscape, which results in curvy and sloped roadways. Figure VI-1 shows the existing
street system.
Major facilities within the vehicle network include the following:
     •   Pebbly Beach Road East (Cabrillo Mole to Pebbly Beach) - As the route connecting the
         Cabrillo Mole boat landing with the center of the City, Pebbly Beach Road East is used by
         vehicles transporting both people and freight to and from the light industrial zone in
         Pebbly Beach. The roadway is 24 feet wide.
     •   Pebbly Beach Road West (Cabrillo Mole to Clarissa Avenue) - Pebbly Beach Road West
         provides vehicle access to passenger and cruise ships. The roadway is 30 feet wide
     •   Clarissa Avenue - Provides the eastern portion of the truck route outside the pedestrian
         center of the City. The roadway is 30 feet wide.
     •   Beacon Street - Borders the central commercial pedestrian area of Avalon. The
         roadway is 25 feet wide.
     •   Sumner Avenue – Provides access from City Center south of Crescent Avenue to the
         Five Points Intersection, which provides access to Avalon Canyon Road. The roadway
         has a typical width of 25 feet, but expands to 30 feet between Beacon Street and the
         Five Points Intersection.
     •   Avalon Canyon Road - The single roadway into the upper canyon area. The roadway is
         30 feet wide.
     •   Metropole Avenue - Part of the loop of roads circling the central commercial pedestrian
         area of the City. The roadway has a typical width 40 feet wide between Crescent
         Avenue and Beacon Street, but narrows to 20 feet between Beacon Street and Tremont
         Street.
     •   St. Catherine Way - Primarily serves the Casino, Hamilton Cove, and Descanso Beach;
         these facilities are typically 24 feet wide.
Pedestrians and Bicycles
Walking and biking are common modes of transport due to Avalon’s small geographic area.
Residents and visitors alike use these modes of transportation to access City attractions.
                                                                                   CITY of AVALON

VI.      CIRCULATION ELEMENT
Visitors to Avalon are responsible for peak demands on pedestrian facilities. Visitors arriving by
ship or ferry disembark at the Cabrillo Mole boat landing and follow Pebbly Beach Road into the
City. Cruise ships typically unload between 300 and 1,000 passengers per day. Ferries from the
mainland load and unload passengers continually throughout the day at an estimated rate of
500 per hour.
Crescent Avenue
Major facilities within the pedestrian network include the following:
     •       Pebbly Beach Road (Cabrillo Mole to Crescent Avenue) - Functions as the primary
             route into the City for pedestrians. The walkway is about 12 feet wide.
     •       Crescent Avenue - Used by pedestrians for both recreational purposes and access to
             commercial amenities. The walkway is up to 30 feet wide in some segments.
     •       Avalon Canyon Road - Adjacent to the Catalina Island Golf Club, Avalon Canyon
             Road is the primary walkway into the Interior and upper canyon area. The walkway
             is typically around 10 feet wide.
     •       Sumner Avenue – Used by pedestrians for both recreational purposes and access to
             commercial amenities as it begins at Crescent Avenue (where it is pedestrian only)
             and terminates southwest at the Five Points Intersection where pedestrians can
             continue to the interior on Avalon Canyon Road. The walkway is typically around 10
             feet wide.
                                                                                  CITY of AVALON

     •       Eucalyptus Avenue - Connects Beacon Street with Tremont Street. The paved area
             is typically up to 30 feet wide, and serves pedestrians and is restricted from
             vehicular traffic.
     •       Beacon Street - Serves a collection and dispersion function for access within the
             central commercial area of the City. The walkway is typically around 3 feet wide.
     •       Casino Walkway - Connects central Avalon with the Casino, Descanso Beach, and
             Hamilton Cove. The walkway is 10 feet wide.
Transit
Avalon offers contracted transit service to residents and visitors through Catalina Transportation
Services. Catalina Transportation Services provides taxis, shuttles, and charter vans for the City
and the Interior. It also operates the Avalon Trolley, which provides fixed-route service to
destinations in town and inland as far as the Wrigley Memorial & Botanical Garden.
Key Circulation Issues
Avalon is unlike most California cities with regard to traditional travel conditions. Traffic control
devices such as signing, striping, and marking are minimal and in fact not largely necessary due
to low traffic volumes and limited vehicle conflict locations. There are no traffic signals within
the community and none are anticipated. Transportation issues and conditions do not lend
themselves to typical level of service analysis, so a more qualitative narrative is provided below.
     ·  Pedestrian/bicycle/vehicle mix. Stakeholders indicate, and field observations support,
        a less-than-desirable mix of autoettes, motor vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles on
        streets generally bounded by Crescent Avenue, 3rd Street, Clarissa Avenue, and
        Metropole Avenue. The pedestrian and bicycle experience could be enhanced by a
        strategic separation of these modes within this general area.
     ·  Parking. Autoette and vehicle parking is not generally concentrated; rather, parking
        occurs throughout the Flats area, resulting motorists hunting for limited on-street
        parking.
     ·  Noise. Although not directly a circulation issue, autoette noise is frequently identified
        as a key issue impacting Avalon’s character.
     ·  School traffic. The propensity of parents to drive children to school, rather than allow
        walking or bicycling, contributes to morning traffic congestion in and around Avalon’s
        public school.
     ·  Transit. Transit options are seasonable in nature and somewhat limited, especially for
        residents traveling to and from the mainland.
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

Accommodating Planned Land Use Changes
As a mature community, the quantity of horizon year (2030) Avalon land use growth is fairly
modest relative to existing conditions. Typically, the Circulation Element would include
analytical, quantitative analysis of future conditions with the addition of new growth. However,
given the unique mix of autoettes, motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians and the mature
built environment, traditional impact analysis is not feasible.
What is relevant, however, is an examination of key circulation improvement ideas and their
relevance to existing and future conditions. Figure VI-2 depicts a number of future
transportation improvements, summarized in the narrative below.
    ·    Safe Routes to Schools Project. This project, which has a completed conceptual plan,
         would include roadway and pedestrian improvements along Tremont Street between
         Clarissa Avenue and Avalon Canyon Road. Using both the existing roadway and nearby
         channel, a combination concrete deck and wood deck would provide continuous
         sidewalk along Tremont Street. In addition, ADA compatible ramps would be
         constructed to provide pedestrian linkages between Eucalyptus Avenue, Catalina
         Avenue, Descanso Avenue, and Clarissa Avenue with Tremont Street. Given the close
         proximity of the project site to Avalon School, a reduction in school trips by automobile
         is likely when the project is completed.

     ·   Five Points Intersection Improvements. This project, which has a completed design,
         will enhance the five-legged intersection consisting of Avalon Canyon Road, Country
         Club Drive, Sumner Avenue, and Tremont Street (east/west). The project includes
         traffic calming, a roundabout, landscaping, lighting, decorative pedestrian walkways,
         sidewalks, and irrigation controls. This project would clean up misaligned roadways,
         enhance circulation, and increase the likelihood that students will walk or bike to school
         instead utilizing motor vehicles.
     ·   One-way street designations. Metropole Avenue narrows south of Beacon Street.
         Consider the merits of designating a segment of the street as one-way, to better
         facilitate mobility.
    Metropole Avenue
         Parking. Avalon has only a limited number of joint parking facilities (e.g. parking lots).
         Significant parking takes place on-street, which creates friction (particularly on narrower
         streets) with cyclists and pedestrians. Complementary wayfinding and signage, would
         direct autoette traffic to key locations from which pedestrians could access multiple
         places of interest. This would reduce traffic on popular streets.
     ·   Thru-traffic closure. Following the success of the Eucalyptus Street partial closure,
         examine closure of Descanso Avenue to thru traffic. The concept would limit access
         between Tremont Street and Beacon Street, and between Beacon Street and 3rd
         Avenue. Descanso Avenue has only limited purpose for through traffic, and this
         proposed strategy would enhance the residential character of the street.

VI.D TRANSPORTATION OPERATING SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS
The narrative above describes a number of physical improvements associated with the 2030
General Plan. Avalon, however, is a mature community with limited opportunities to build new
roadway facilities. Maintaining the community’s quality of life, while addressing existing issues
and accommodating a modest amount of growth, will require focus on physical improvements
and operational improvements.
The transportation system approach focuses on creating transportation systems that enhance
performance and increase access choices for people. Developing a transportation system for a
community can provide individuals with viable, real-time access alternatives, to better allow
them to make the economic, environmental, and personal choices about where and how they
access the events of their lives.
City of Avalon stakeholders, elected officials, and others have identified a number of operating
system improvements for consideration, as articulated below.
    ·    Parking. In order to provide more orderly on-street parking, consider special parking
         restrictions for rented autoettes. Examine parking resources specially designated for
         residents leaving the island and vehicle permits at lodging facilities. Current policies
         may allow the potential to permit more vehicles than that which is consistent with
         Avalon’s vehicular restriction objectives.
    ·    Car sharing. Consider car sharing as a strategy for residents that do not need 24-hour,
         7-day access to an automobile. This could potentially reduce the number of vehicles on
         the island, while preserving mobility and access needs of residents.
    ·    Bicycle enhancements. Enhance bicycle racks and bicycle parking throughout the
         community.
    ·    Transit. Provide additional access for residents, year-round, which could take place
         through implementation of fixed route “transit spine” connecting key community
         locations. A convenient, frequent, reliable system would reduce the need and
         frequency of vehicular trips.
    ·    Vehicle technology. Phase-out two-cycle engines for autoettes to reduce autoette
         emissions and noise. In the mid-term and long-term, explore alternative fuel and
         electric vehicles (both having superior environmental and noise impacts). New
         development could be conditioned to support these newer technologies.
    ·    Wayfinding and signing. Enhance wayfinding and signage to accompany the physical
         and operational improvements discussed above. Given the high frequency of unfamiliar
         visitors, this will be key to maximizing improvement effectiveness.
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

VI.E VEHICULAR TRAVEL
As a compact island community, Avalon has unique characteristics that are conducive to the use
of alternatives to the drive alone automobile for transportation. Nevertheless, automobiles
(autoettes) remain an important component of circulation within the City. As such, the City will
continue to accommodate vehicular travel while minimizing the environmental and safety
effects associated with motor vehicle use.
Goal
Provide for safe and efficient travel on City of Avalon streets and pathways.

     with new development.
VI.F ALTERNATIVE TRAVEL MODES
Avalon’s compact size, mix of land uses, and tourist-oriented economy make the use of
alternative transportation modes (walking, bicycling, transit, carpooling) both feasible and
desirable. Consequently, providing a variety of transportation options to serve residents and
visitors will remain a focus of the City’s transportation and circulation. In combination with the
land use strategies described in the Land Use Element, planned improvements to the City’s
circulation network will continue to expand opportunities for the use of alternatives to the
drive-alone automobile (autoette).
Goals
Balance the needs of all travel modes within the City.
Reduce the amount that people drive by increasing opportunities for walking, bicycling and
transit.
Policies
VI-7     Ensure that residents and visitors can walk, bicycle, or use transit to access key Avalon
         attractions, businesses, and places.
VI-8     Include alternative mode accommodations in transportation capital improvement
         projects and programs.
VI-9     Enhance the pedestrian environment by providing a continuous network of pedestrian
         facilities and minimizing conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles.

VI.H REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION
As a tourist-oriented island community, Avalon is dependent on water and air transport to and
from the mainland in order to allow City residents access to services not available on Santa
Catalina Island and to facilitate the tourism upon which the City’s economy depends. Although
the City does not directly provide these services, continuing to facilitate transportation between
Avalon and the mainland is critical to the City residents and business owners.
Goal
Ensure the continued availability of water and air transport between Avalon and the mainland.
Policies
VI-14    Facilitate and, as feasible, enhance water and air transport between Avalon and the
         mainland.
VI-15    Facilitate continued operation of cruise ships, cross channel carriers, and freight service
         serving Avalon and, as feasible, enhance facilities accommodating cruise ships, cross
         channel carriers, and freight service.

                                 VII. SAFETY ELEMENT
The Safety Element is concerned with identifying and, whenever possible, reducing the impact
of natural and man-made hazards that may threaten the health, safety, and property of Avalon
residents, business owners, and visitors. The State of California General Plan Guidelines state
that the aim of the Safety Element is to reduce the potential risk of death, injuries, property
damage, and economic and social dislocation resulting from fires, floods, earthquakes,
landslides, and other hazards. As such, the element emphasizes hazards reduction and accident
prevention for known hazards and potential disasters. In addition, the element emphasizes the
importance of reducing risk and the effects of disaster prevention and/or preparedness.
Hazards are an unavoidable aspect of life, and the Safety Element cannot eliminate risk
completely. Instead, the Element contains policies to minimize the level of risk.
A variety of potential hazards that could affect life and property are present in and around
Avalon. Safety hazards can be generally grouped into two categories: naturally-occurring and
man-made. Some hazards – fires, for example – can be categorized as both naturally-occurring
and man-made.
Issues covered in this Safety Element include:
    ·     Geology and Seismicity
    ·     Flooding
    ·     Fire Hazards
    ·     Hazardous Materials
    ·     Disaster Response
This Safety Element provides a broad survey of hazards in Avalon for the purposes of general
land use planning. This information does not take the place of site specific evaluations by
qualified professionals. The City will use the goals, policies, and implementation actions to
review individual development proposals and site assessments.
VII.A GEOLOGY AND SEISMICITY
Avalon is exposed to a variety of seismic and geologic hazards given its geographic location and
natural topography. Like all of Southern California, Avalon is subject to substantial seismic
hazards. These seismic hazards can affect the structural integrity of buildings and utilities, and,
in turn, cause property damage and potential loss of life. Although it is not possible to prevent
earthquakes, their destructive effects can be minimized through comprehensive hazard-
mitigation programs and efforts. The potential for a major earthquake that may result in loss of
                                                                                    CITY of AVALON

life, injury, or displacement of many thousands
of persons is present throughout Southern                  The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act, a
California. Tsunamis and seiche events also              California law passed in 1990, requires
have the potential to affect the City, given its         the State Geologist to identify and map
proximity to the ocean and location off the                 zones prone to seismically induced
coast of Southern California. Structural                liquefaction, ground-shaking, landslides
hazards also present a major threat in the                  and other forms of ground failure
event of an earthquake.                                        resulting from earthquakes.
The risk of landslides is also a geologic concern
within Avalon given the steep hillsides that surround the center city area. Subsidence and wave
damage could also occur, although the threat is limited.
Faults
The frequency and strength of earthquakes depend on the number and type of faults that pass
through an area. Avalon is not located within an Alquist-Priolo Fault-Rupture Hazard Zone
(California Geological Survey, 1999) and is therefore not subject to surface rupture. However,
six active and potentially active faults are located within 25 miles of Avalon. For the purposes of
this Safety Element, an active fault is defined as a fault showing evidence of surface
displacement during Holocene time (within the last approximately 11,700 years). A potentially
active fault is defined as a fault showing evidence of surface displacement during Quaternary
time (within the last approximately 2.6 million years). These faults include:
Active Faults:
      ·   Palos Verdes
      ·   Cabrillo
      ·   San Diego Trough
Potentially Active Faults:
      ·   San Pedro Basin
      ·   Newport Inglewood
      ·   San Clemente
Figure VII-1 depicts regional the faults that could create severe groundshaking in Avalon.
Although no known faults are located within Avalon, the aforementioned fault systems could
cause property damage, possibly resulting in injury and loss of life in the event of a major
earthquake due to ground motion. The level of impact resulting from any seismic activity will
depend on factors such as: distance from epicenter, earthquake magnitude, and characteristics
of soils and subsurface geology.

VII.     SAFETY ELEMENT
Tsunamis
Tsunamis, or seismic sea waves, are great oceanic waves that are generated by earthquakes or
less commonly, by large submarine landslides. An individual earthquake can generate a
continuous train of tsunami waves that may oscillate for 8-12 hours. The first waves to reach
any locality are not necessarily the strongest ones. In the deep ocean, the wave-length, from
crest to crest, may be a hundred miles or more, although the wave height from crest to trough
may only be a few feet. They cannot be felt aboard ships in deep water and they cannot be
seen from the air, but the energy they contain is substantial. Tsunamis affect only coastal areas,
and watercourses emptying into these areas. The effects tend to be diminished in partially
enclosed bays and estuaries, but the wave may be driven many miles inland up unprotected
waterways.
The warning needed to avoid oncoming tsunamis is a basic function of the National Weather
Service West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center, administered by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration. Warning times vary with distance from the source, but for
most tsunamis approaching the California coast, several hours to many hours are available to
evacuate to safe places and to make emergency preparations. In the event of a tsunami
warning, the following considerations are suggested:
     ·   Any major subsea earthquake (magnitude 7 or more) in the seismically active Aleutian
         and Chilean trenches may cause a tsunami that will strike California, typically with a 4-6
         hour warning period. For Avalon, an earthquake involving the submarine sections of the
         Inglewood-Newport faults could cause a tsunami that could reach Avalon.
     ·   The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center will confirm whether a tsunami is
         or is not on the way, the probable arrival time, and the expected duration of its danger
         period.
     ·   Expect several waves, of wave periods that may range about 15 minutes to more than
         100 minutes. Waves may be arriving for 10 hours or longer, after the first wave’s
         arrival. The first wave may not be the largest.
     ·   Special problems may result if the tsunami arrives in coincidence with a flood tide.
         Arrival times should be checked against local tide tables.
     ·   Storm waves can increase the effects of the tsunami. Local weather conditions also may
         prevent sending boats to sea to escape the tsunami.
     ·   If the approach of a tsunami is confirmed:
              1) Alert all boatsmen
              2) Remove or lash down potentially hazardous objects such as timbers, oil tank
                  trucks, and haled lumber in waterside areas.
              3) Clear all low-lying critical areas, such as beaches and piers, of people.
              4) Allow no spectators in vulnerable areas until the official “all clear,” especially
                  not on normally submerged beaches that may be temporarily uncovered by
                  wave retreat.

Seiches
Seiches are periodic oscillations of water level in relatively confined basins, such as lakes,
estuaries, or bays, analogous to “sloshing” in a bathtub. Seiches, named for phenomena
observed in Lake Geneva, are resonant standing waves with the wave length controlled by the
width of the basin. This periodic oscillatory wave motion in bays and estuaries can be caused by
tsunamis, seismic ground waves, and more commonly, by cyclic winds and barometric pressure
oscillations on lakes. The periods of seiche waves may range from a few minutes to an hour or
more. Amplitude of the waves may reach a maximum of several feet.
Typically, surging in harbors is not due to seismic activity. A seiche resulting from an earthquake
results when the seismic wave has a frequency near the basin’s natural period and resonates to
amplify wave motions already active in the basin.
Earth Materials and Groundwater
Avalon is located on a bay on the eastern side of Santa Catalina Island. Most of the City rests on
the recent alluvium and alluvium fan deposits from Quaternary time periods. An earthquake
might cause buildings resting on alluvium to shake for a longer period of time than if those
buildings were on bedrock. However, as long as the water table is low and liquefaction unlikely,
alluvium is considered low risk. Other rock formations found within Avalon include Quaternary
nonmarine terrace deposits; tertiary metamorphic rock from the Franciscan formation derived
from eugeosynclinal sedimentary and volcanic rocks, consisting of metasandstone with up to
30% lawsonite and glaucophane, fine grained glaucophane schist, quartzite, metaconglomerate,
metavolcanic rocks, talc-actinolite schist, and local green or red chert; and tertiary intrusive
(hypabyssal) rocks undifferentiated. The latter comprises most of the earth materials
surrounding the City.
Seismic problems related to shallow groundwater, such as liquefaction, are not expected
because the water table is low (at or near sea level) and chance of liquefaction is small. Only on
rare occasions in the past has the water table risen high enough to undermine foundations.
However, investigations including local groundwater conditions should be conducted as normal
practice prior to any new construction in
Avalon.

VII.     SAFETY ELEMENT
The City will require building design to be commensurate with the expected level of
groundshaking in a major earthquake, based on site-specific soils and geologic conditions, as
well as on the level of risk associated with potential damage to the building. Thus, high
occupancy buildings and buildings that serve disaster recovery functions need to be designed to
withstand a greater degree of groundshaking than low occupancy, low risk buildings. For all
buildings, once environmental protection policies are met, construction techniques will be
regulated according to the latest edition of the California Building Code (CBC) with City of Avalon
amendments or increased requirements as necessary to reduce geologic and seismic risks to
acceptable levels.
Landslides
Landslides take place in widely different rock types and are of almost every conceivable size and
shape. They occur at elevations ranging from lofty mountain peaks to the sea floor. There are
basically three types of landslides:
     1) Fall – Limited to free falling of earth material of any size;
     2) Slides – Rock, debris, or soil movement takes place on one or more shear or slip surfaces
         and the affected mass consists of single to numerous segments bounded by slip
         surfaces;
     3) Flows – The displaced mass is deformed and moves like a viscous fluid.
There are two known landslide areas in Avalon. A fall area occurs along the road to Pebbly
Beach, where rocks fall onto the road. This condition only occurs during heavy rainstorms. The
other area is a slide area in the vicinity of Vieudelou Avenue, Hill Street, Olive Street, and
Maiden Lane. This area shows evidence of creep, in which the soil is pulled downhill by gravity
through numerous small, discrete movements over time. A retaining wall, or bulkhead, exists
along Olive Street to abate soil creep. Other hillside areas are also potentially subject to
landsliding.
Subsidence
Apart from landslides, structural damage as a result of subsidence or settling on individual
properties may cause problems. However, these problems, when they develop, are usually
extremely localized and do not appear to present a threat to the community as a whole.
Wave Damage
Strong winds generated by northeasterly wind storms have the potential to cause large waves
within the harbor. Wave damage is primarily limited to boats and structures in the harbor.
Breakwaters on the westerly and easterly sides of Avalon Bay have been constructed to reduce
the threat of large waves crashing in the harbor. However, boats moored in the central portion
of the harbor are still susceptible to surging effects caused by northeasterly wind storms.

VII.B FLOODING
Flooding is the inundation of normally dry land as a result of a rise in the level of surface waters
or the rapid accumulation of storm-water runoff; it becomes a hazard when the flow of water
has the potential to damage property and threaten human life or health. Flood risks are
greatest, and flood hazards most severe, in winter, when water bodies are usually full and soils
saturated. Flooding is primarily a natural process and, therefore, difficult to prevent. However,
land use and development decisions have a significant effect on the frequency and severity of
floods; in general, urbanization increases the risk of flooding by increasing stormwater runoff
and, to a lesser extent, erosion. Flooding is often a regional problem that crosses multiple
jurisdictional boundaries.
Substantial areas of the City are within

Within Avalon, the flood zone generally
includes the area southeast of Sumner
Avenue to Clemente Avenue, narrowing
slightly as it extends through Avalon Canyon. A 100-year flood represents the level of flood
water expected to be equaled or exceeded every 100 years on average, and can also be
described as a 1% annual exceedance probability flood, since it is a flood that has a 1% chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any single year. FEMA flood zones are shown on Figure VII-2. The
City and the Santa Catalina Island Company (Company) undertook significant storm
infrastructure improvements in 2004 and presumably the flood zone has been reduced as a
result of those efforts. However, the FEMA flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) have not been
updated to reflect these improvements.
Climate changes anticipated to occur throughout this century as a result of GHG emissions may
make Avalon more vulnerable to hurricanes, storm surges, flooding increases. Potential impacts
of expected sea level rise and increased storm surges may include flooding and overwhelming of
sewage systems by storm runoff and high tides. Jetties and seawalls may need to be raised and
strengthened to protect harbors which are used for shipping, recreation, and tourism (all from
California Energy Commission, 2010). Sea-level rise is addressed in the Conservation Element of
the General Plan.
Goal
Minimize the potential for loss of life, physical injury, property damage, and social disruption
resulting from flooding.

Policies
VII-7     Ensure that new development is in compliance with the provisions of the federal flood
          insurance program and require hydrologic investigations for all new development within
          or adjacent to sites identified in Flood Zone AE.
VII-8     Incorporate adequate mitigation measures into proposed development projects to
          achieve an acceptable level of risk from potential flooding hazards.
VII-9     Ensure that new flood control and drainage facilities, as well as improvements to
          existing facilities, are consistent with environmental protection standards.
VII-10 Eliminate as feasible the 100-year floodplain that covers much of the City by
          implementing upstream improvements to reduce peak surface runoff.
Implementation Actions
·    Continue to enforce the local, state, and federal regulations regarding the construction of
     buildings within flood hazard areas.
·    In conjunction with any development proposals within the Resort Recreation area along
     Avalon Canyon Road, require measures to reduce flood potential in downgradient areas of
     the Center City.
·    Review the potential for a public/private partnership for revision of the City’s Flood
     Insurance Rate Map to reflect upstream improvements (both completed and planned).
·    Develop a plan for watershed management.
VII.C       FIRE HAZARDS
Fire is a unique hazard in that it can result both from natural processes and from the intentional
or accidental actions of people. There are three main types of fire hazards:
(1) Wildfires, which affect open space and development on the urban fringe; (2) structural fires,
which occur in buildings; and (3) commercial/industrial fires, which generally result from the
ignition of flammable materials. While fires are not entirely preventable, it is possible to create
conditions that reduce the chances of fire and that facilitate efficient response in case fire
breaks out. When a fire does ignite, quick response from firefighters and an adequate supply of
water are essential in minimizing damage.
General factors that affect an area’s risk from fire hazards include its location, land uses,
distance from fire stations, ease of accessibility by fire-fighting equipment, and adequacy of
water supply. More specifically, the extent and severity of damage by fires are determined by
several key factors affecting vulnerability. The entire Santa Catalina Island, including Avalon, is

designated as a very high fire hazard zone by the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection. Due to the unique island geography, Avalon must be well prepared for emergency
response in the event of a fire, as back-up resources require more time to cross the channel and
reach the island.
The City of Avalon Fire Department provides fire protection service within the Avalon City limits.
The County of Los Angeles Fire Department is responsible for fire protection outside the Avalon
city limits. Three facilities in the City support fire service: Avalon Fire Station (Avalon City Fire
Department), Avalon Station #55 (CFPD), and Baywatch Avalon (CFPD). In addition, there are
two saltwater reservoirs within the city limits that provide water for fire suppression.
Chapter 3 of the City of Avalon Municipal Code provides standards for fire prevention, which are
adopted from the County of Los Angeles Fire Code. Measures in the California Building Code
reduce fire hazards in structures. These include use of specific building construction materials,
fire separation walls, building separation, and use of fire sprinklers. Included in development
regulations are requirements for minimum road widths that provide adequate access for
firefighting equipment and evacuation of residents, as well as clearance around structures (fuel
modification areas) to prevent the rapid spread of fire.
Goal
Minimize the potential for loss of life, physical injury, property damage, and social disruption
resulting from fires.
Policies
VII-11 Require all new development within the City to comply with applicable provisions of the
         Uniform Fire Code.
VII-12 Promote fire prevention as the City’s preferred management strategy; facilitate
         programs that are aimed at the prevention of fires.
VII-13 Require that new development in mountainous brush areas be supplied with adequate
         water supply and street dimensions are standardized to meet emergency access
         requirements.
VII-14 Require maintenance of native brush and other vegetation in the mountainous areas of
         the City in compliance with the Uniform Fire Code.
VII-15 Encourage property owners to landscape with fire resistive plants and shrubs, such as
         rock rose, saltbrush, yerba santa, dwarf coyote, and trailing rosemary.
VII-16 Require that roof coverings, building additions, and building projections for new
         structures be constructed of fire resistant material.
                                                                                       CITY of AVALON

VII.D HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Hazardous materials are not a substantial concern in Avalon as there are no large-scale
generators or users of hazardous materials in the City. Propane is barged over from the
mainland to the Southern California Edison facility in Pebbly Beach. The propane is barged over
in liquid form, then vaporized and cut with air to produce a gas that is domestically useful,
similar to natural gas. Southern California Edison manages the transport of the propane. Safety
measures follow Southern California Edison protocol and no incidents related to propane
transport have occurred. Any future large-scale activities with the potential to generate or use
hazardous materials in the City would be required to obtain a permit and comply with applicable
federal, state, and local regulations.
The residential sector is a smaller-scale generator of hazardous wastes, such as paints, cleaners,
oils, batters and pesticides that contain potentially hazardous ingredients and require special
disposal care. Improper disposal of such household hazardous wastes can include pouring them
down the drain, on the ground, into storm sewers, or in some cases putting them out with the
trash. The dangers of such disposal methods might not be immediately obvious, but improper
disposal of these wastes can pollute the environment and pose a threat to human health.
Recognizing that the residential sector is a producer of hazardous wastes, Avalon has
implemented a household hazardous waste collection program so that household hazardous
wastes are collected and disposed of in a safe manner. This program will continue to be
implemented and will be expanded as appropriate to address the City’s hazardous waste
disposal needs.
Asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint are also likely to be present in many of the
buildings within Avalon based on their year of construction. Such materials could be disturbed
by demolition and renovation activities on older structures; however, any activities with the
potential to release asbestos or lead into the atmosphere would be required to comply with
applicable federal, state, and local regulations.
                                                                                   CITY of AVALON

Goal
Protect life and property from potential short- and long-term adverse effects associated with
the transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials.
Policies
VII-18     Manage activities within Avalon involving the transport, use, storage or disposal of
           hazardous materials in a responsible manner that protects public health, safety, and
           the environment.
VII-19     Promote the availability of safe and legal options for the management and disposal of
           hazardous wastes generated by businesses and households within the Avalon area.
VII-20     Promote community education and understanding of sound management practices for
           the storage, handling, use and disposal of hazardous materials.
Implementation Actions
·    Continue to enforce applicable federal, state and local regulations pertaining to the
     transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials within Avalon.
·    Continue to provide hazardous waste disposal programs.
VII.E DISASTER RESPONSE
The management of emergencies and disasters consists of three distinct phases: (1) mitigation
of potential hazards and pre-event preparedness (including event forecasting, response
planning, training and public education); (2) response during or soon after the event, most often
by fire, police and medical-services personnel and trained volunteers (also includes public alerts
and notification, evacuation, search and rescue, and critical, short-term assistance to victims);
and (3) post-event recovery, which generally includes debris removal, re-establishment of public
and private services, financial and other longer-term types of assistance to victims,
reconstruction, and collection and analysis of data related to the event.
The City will continue to maintain an up-to-date emergency response operations plan to detail
Avalon’s planned response to emergency situations. Local disaster response will continue to be
coordinated under the Avalon Disaster Council, which is comprised of a Director of Emergency
Services (the City Manager), an Assistant Director of Emergency Services, Chiefs of emergency
services (Fire and Police Chiefs, Harbor Master), and other community representatives that may
be appointed by the Director.
Mutual aid agreements with regional agencies will be maintained to ensure the City’s ability to
receive assistance when demands for emergency services are greater than the City’s available
resources. The City will also continue to utilize the Emergency Management Information System
                                                                                   CITY of AVALON

of common sources of excessive noise levels. To that end, the Noise Element identifies and
addresses noise sources and establishes projected noise levels for significant noise generators.
The Noise Element also establishes performance goals, policies, and standards for the range of
proposed land uses present within Avalon, including mobile, stationary, and nuisance noise
sources. These goals, policies, and standards promote an appropriate pattern of land uses and
help to ensure that the various sources of noise pollution do not compromise the community’s
goal of preserving the island’s quiet and peaceful environment.
In addition to addressing the potential noise impacts
associated with new development, the City intends to                Noise is generally defined as

mitigate the effects of existing noise sources which
exceed the acceptable noise levels. The City will also
maintain the noise ordinance that governs allowable
noise levels on private properties in Avalon.
Figure VIII-1 shows noise acceptability levels for different land use types. In general, evaluation
of land use that falls into the “normally acceptable” or “conditionally acceptable” noise
environments should include consideration of the type of noise source, the sensitivity of the
noise receptor, the noise reduction likely to be provided by structures, and the degree to which
the noise source may interfere with speech, sleep, or other activities characteristic of the land
use. The Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments matrix (Figure VIII-1)
establishes noise levels that are compatible with existing and new uses proposed in the City.
This matrix will be used to determine whether a proposed new use would be compatible with
the ambient noise environment in which it is proposed.

VIII.A NOISE DEFINITIONS
Noise level (or volume) is generally measured in decibels (dB) using the A-weighted sound
pressure level (dBA). The A-weighting scale is an adjustment to the actual sound power levels to
be consistent with that of human hearing response, which is most sensitive to frequencies
around 4,000 Hertz (about the highest note on a piano) and less sensitive to low frequencies
(below 100 Hertz). Table VIII-1 lists a range of typical noise levels that one may encounter.

Sound pressure level is measured on a logarithmic scale with the 0 dB level based on the lowest
detectable sound pressure level that people can perceive (an audible sound that is not zero
sound pressure level). In general, a 3 dB change in community noise levels is noticeable, while
1-2 dB changes generally are not perceived.
In addition to the instantaneous measurement of sound levels, the duration of sound is
important since sounds that occur over a long period of time are more likely to be an annoyance
or cause direct physical damage or environmental stress. One of the most frequently used noise
metrics that considers both duration and sound power level is the equivalent noise level (Leq).
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

VIII.      NOISE ELEMENT
The Leq is defined as the single steady A-weighted level that is equivalent to the same amount
of energy as contained in the actual fluctuating levels over a period of time (essentially, the
average noise level). Typically, Leq is summed over a one-hour period.
The time period in which noise occurs is also important since noise that occurs at night tends to
be more disturbing than noise that occurs during the daytime. The Community Noise Equivalent
Level (CNEL) recognizes this fact by weighting hourly Leqs over a 24-hour period. Essentially, the
CNEL is a 24-hour average noise level that adds 5 dB to evening (7 PM to 10 PM) noise levels and
10 dB to nighttime (10 PM to 7 AM) noise levels to account for the greater sensitivity to noise
during those time periods.
VIII.B NOISE LEVELS IN AVALON
Figure VIII-2 shows noise levels measured at six locations throughout the City in 2010.
Measurements were taken throughout the day from 6:35 a.m. to 3:25 p.m. Table VIII-2
identifies those sites measured on Figure VIII-2. Figure VIII-3 displays existing noise contours for
Avalon, which are estimates of noise levels based on noise measurements taken.

 * See Figure VIII-1 for noise measurement locations. Leq is the average sound level. Lmin is the minimum instantaneous sound
 level. Lmax is the maximum instantaneous sound level.
The highest noise levels in Avalon are found on Avalon Canyon Road near City Hall during school
drop-off and pick-up hours. The high level of noise at this location is primarily generated by the
use of autoettes. Higher noise levels can also be found near the city center, along busy streets.
Noise in the city center is generated by the use of autoettes, commercial establishments,
landscaping/gardening equipment, large groups of pedestrians/ tourists, and various harbor
uses, including private boats in the harbor.

                                                                           VIII.  NOISE ELEMENT
Open space and the low density residential areas in Avalon have low ambient noise levels. Such
areas allow retreat from the busy city center by providing tranquility and a sense of
peacefulness. Maintaining a low noise environment within the low-density residential,
resort/recreational, and open space areas is a goal of the community, since they either contain
or are near sensitive biological resources and provide opportunities for eco-tourism.
VIII.C MOBILE NOISE SOURCES
Noise sources within Avalon are primarily attributed to transportation-related sources. The
main method of transportation in Avalon is by autoette, which is a small, gas-powered vehicle
similar to a golf cart. Autoettes can produce substantial noise levels, especially along busy
streets and are therefore considered the primary source of transportation noise in the City of
Avalon. Older model two-stroke autoettes produce higher noise levels than four-stroke
models. Secondary sources of transportation noise include heavy-duty industrial/ public service
vehicles, garbage/trash pickup trucks, power tools, air transportation, and water-based
transportation.
Goal
Reduce and minimize noise generated by transportation sources.
Policies
VIII-1   Incorporate noise reduction technology into the design of transportation systems and
         ensure that noise impacts associated with roadway extensions and capacity
         enhancement projects are mitigated to acceptable levels.
VIII-2   Utilize site planning and traffic control solutions (such as one-way streets) on major
         roadways to minimize traffic related noise.
VIII-3   Increase the number alternative transportation modes such as bicycle paths and
         pedestrian walkways to minimize automobile traffic and its associated noise.
VIII-4   When the replacement of City-owned motor vehicles is required, consider the use of
         electric-powered vehicles.
VIII-5   Ensure that gas-powered autoettes (two-stroke and four-stroke) are properly
         maintained according to State requirements.
VIII-6   Increase the number of electric-powered vehicles for private residents and tour
         operators.
VIII-7   Establish a noise level threshold for vehicles in order to maintain acceptable decibel
         levels.
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON
                                                  VIII-7

2030 GENERAL PLAN / LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
VIII.   NOISE ELEMENT
VIII-8  Enforce the noise level threshold such that vehicle noise is reduced and/or maintained
        at acceptable decibel levels.
VIII-9  Encourage conduct of flight operations in a manner to minimize noise.
VIII-10 Limit noise associated with landscaping/gardening equipment and power tool use by
        restricting the hours of operation for such equipment.
VIII-11 Limit the hours of operation for trash hauling services such that noise associated with
        such uses occurs outside of sleeping hours (generally 10 pm – 7 am).
Implementation Actions
     ·  Work with public and private transit providers and/or businesses to provide transit
        services that reduce traffic and associated noise.
     ·  Create an incentive program to help facilitate the replacement of gas-powered
        autoettes and older two-stroke autoettes with electric vehicles. The incentive program
        may include a prioritization schedule of electric vehicles for vehicle permitting.
     ·  Create a noise level threshold for vehicles and establish an enforcement program such
        that owners of vehicles exceeding the threshold would be subject to citation and fine
        until the vehicle’s noise is maintained within an acceptable decibel level.
     ·  Establish a protocol with the Catalina Island Conservancy to enforce noise abatement
        policies on aircraft using the Airport in the Sky and coordinate this protocol with the
        Federal Aviation Administration. The protocol should establish how aircrafts flying over
        the City and in violation of City noise policies would be penalized.
     ·  Enforce the standards set forth in the California Motor Vehicle Code in particular those
        standards related to autoette maintenance (i.e., mufflers).
     ·  Establish a Noise Ordinance that limits the hours of operations for landscaping/
        gardening, the use of power tools, and trash hauling services such that all related work
        is restricted during the evening and early morning hours all days of the week.
     ·  Develop a program to facilitate electric vehicle charging stations.
VIII.D STATIONARY AND NUISANCE NOISE SOURCES
Stationary noise sources are not a major source of noise within the City. Most stationary noise
within the City is generated by the industrial land uses in the Pebbly Beach area. Although not
residentially zone, there are approximately 30 residences within the Pebbly Beach area.
However, the industrial noise sources in this area are located over one-half mile from the
majority residential areas in Avalon and are separated by hills and canyons. This geographic
                                                                                    CITY of AVALON
                                                 VIII-8

                                                                                    CITY OF AVALON
                                                  2030 GENERAL PLAN / LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
                                                                           VIII.    NOISE ELEMENT
separation provides a natural noise barrier between the stationary industrial noise generators
and the sensitive receptors located in and around the city center.
Other noise sources in the City can be generally characterized as temporary nuisance noise,
which includes construction noise, recreation events, large gatherings of pedestrians/tourists, or
loud parties. Noise levels associated with these sources are typically low, but can be elevated
along busy thoroughfares within the city center area, where residences, hotels, and retail
establishments are mixed and often directly front the streets. Residential uses within a mixed
use environment can be affected by vehicular noise, as well as noise from nearby or ground-
floor commercial establishments.
Where the addition of a new noise source has a potential adverse effect on an existing use
(particularly a sensitive noise receptor), the new noise and its source will be examined to
determine if any noise standards, onsite or offsite, will be exceeded. Where noise standards will
be exceeded, mitigation must be included as part of the proposed project to reduce noise levels
below threshold criteria. Some traditional approaches to addressing noise issues, such as sound
walls, may not be acceptable in certain circumstances because of conflicts with other
community objectives.
Goal
Protect people from the harmful and annoying effects of noise exposure related to stationary
sources.
Policies
VIII-12 Locate and design noise-sensitive land uses and noise generators in such a manner that
         noise objectives will be maintained.
VIII-13 Emphasize the following City preferred noise management strategies as an alternative
         to the construction of noise barriers:
             · Avoid the placement of noise-sensitive uses within noisy areas
             ·    Orient buildings to shield noise sensitive portions of a project from noise
                  sources
             ·    Use sound attenuating architectural design and building features
VIII-14 Use noise standards during review of proposed development projects to determine
         whether a project promotes acceptable noise compatible land uses both during the
         construction and operational phases.
VIII-15 Establish and enforce noise standards for Avalon Harbor to limit noise associated with
         vessels traveling within or anchored within harbor waters.
                                                                                      CITY of AVALON

CITY OF AVALON
2030 GENERAL PLAN / LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
VIII.    NOISE ELEMENT
Implementation Measures
     ·   Review and enforce noise standards for all new developments in order to minimize
         noise generators in close proximity to noise-sensitive uses.
     ·   Monitor compliance with noise mitigation measures after completion of a new project.
     ·   Establish noise standards for Avalon Harbor that limit excessive noise from vessels
         traveling to/from the harbor or vessels anchored within the harbor. These standards
         shall be enforced by City staff and violations of the standards would be subject to
         citation and fine.
VIII.E SENSITIVE RECEPTOR EXPOSURE TO NOISE SOURCES
Depending on the type of land use that is exposed to unwanted sounds, noise can have little
effect or a substantially adverse effect on the use of land. Land uses that are generally more
sensitive to noise are those where people spend considerable time inhabiting a site and would
be disturbed by loud single event or continuous noise influences. These uses include residences,
schools, parks, hospitals, libraries, hotels/motels, places of worship, and auditoriums. Land uses
that are not typically noise sensitive are those that generate noise themselves or that are
otherwise resilient to loud noise exposures. Such uses include active recreation centers, offices,
commercial retail centers, business parks, utility stations, etc.
Land use types with the greatest sensitivity to noise typically have more stringent noise standard
requirements, while non-noise sensitive land uses or uses with reduced noise sensitivity have
less restrictive standards.
Goals
Achieve and maintain noise compatible land use relationships consistent with the nature and
character of individual land uses.
Emphasize the reduction of noise impacts through careful site planning and project design.
Policies
VIII-16 Use the Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments matrix (Figure VIII-
         1) to generally determine the compatibility of land use when evaluating proposed new
         land uses in the City. The matrix shall be used as a preliminary guide to assist in
         determining the acceptability of a proposed land use with respect to noise.
VIII-17 Ensure that the City complies with state and federal noise standards, including the
         following:
              · Department of Housing and Urban Development Noise Exposure Standards
              ·   California Noise Insulation Standards
                                                                                    CITY of AVALON

VIII-18 The City shall establish noise tolerance level standards for commercial and residential
        land uses.
VIII-19 Construction noise shall adhere to maximum acceptable noise levels and noise
        mitigation may be required to reduce noise to acceptable levels.
VIII-20 Construction activities and landscaping equipment are limited to the hours of 8:00 a.m.
        and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday, as enforced by the City of Avalon Municipal
        Code.
Implementation Actions
     ·  Review new public and private development proposals to determine compliance with
        the Noise Element.
     ·  Require noise studies when a project may expose people to noise levels exceeding
        acceptable limits.
     ·  Monitor compliance with noise mitigation measures after completion of a new project.
     ·  Update the Municipal Code noise chapter as necessary to ensure that local, state, and
        federal standards are enforced.
     ·  Update the Municipal Code to establish noise tolerance levels for commercial and
        residential land uses.
     ·  Continue to enforce existing noise abatement policies in Avalon.

The purpose of this Appendix is to define the terms used to describe the City of Avalon' policy
commitments. Table A-1 presents definitions for basic terms, such as "permit," "encourage,"
"manage," "require," "ensure," and others, not in alphabetical order, but in increasing levels of
commitment, ranging from "recognize" to "ensure."
Table A-2 defines terms such as "should," "shall," and "feasible," which are used to modify the
various descriptions of policy commitment made in the General Plan.

                             Avoidance of the action will receive positive treatment in written policy. In cases
                             where the City can compel action, such as in the Development/Environmental
                             Review process, the City will commit resources to assist others to avoid the action
                             or condition being discouraged. The expectation is that, to the extent that the

                      position will be on record as the official City position.
                      The action will receive positive treatment in written policy, and will be transmitted
                      as appropriate to influence others. In cases where the City can compel action,
                      such as in the Development/Environmental Review process, the City will commit
                      resources to assist others to achieve the action or condition being encouraged.
 Encourage
                      The expectation is that, to the extent that the action or condition meets both the
                      objectives of the City and the other party, that the action or condition will occur.
                      In cases where the City cannot compel the actions of others, encourage is
                      synonymous with support.
                      Action will be taken to improve existing conditions by increasing the quantity or
 Enhance              quality of beneficial uses or existing actions. The expectation is that a desirable
                      condition exists, and is to be improved by the action.
                      Action will be taken to guarantee a certain outcome or result. The expectation is
                      that, in guaranteeing a particular result, the City will commit resources, and has
 Ensure
                      the legal right to compel other parties to take a particular action or perform in a
                      prescribed manner.
                      Action will be taken to implement the policy by making an organizational
 Establish            commitment, initiate devoting resources, and instituting a process or program that
                      does not now exist. The expectation is that a new activity will be launched.
                      Action will be taken to investigate the subject to determine whether or not some
                      further commitment is in order. The expectation is that effort will be expended
 Explore
                      for research and evaluation, and that an open mind will be maintained until the
                      evidence is in.
                      Specific incentives, which may consist of monetary, time, development intensity,
                      and/or other benefits, will be created as an inducement for others to take action.
 Facilitate
                      The expectation is that the incentives will be sufficient to influence behavior in
                      ways beneficial to the City's interests.
                      Action will be taken to expend funds directly in implementing the policy. This may
                      include partial expenditures, operating expenses, contracting for services, or
 Invest
                      creating new staff responsibilities. The expectation is that City resources would be
                      directly committed to implementation.
                      Action will be taken to continue ongoing City programs or services. The
 Maintain             expectation is that active means may be employed to continue such programs or
                      services.
 Manage               Action will be taken to direct activities in order to achieve specific objectives.
                      Action will be taken to reduce or lessen, but not necessarily eliminate, an existing

Mitigate             undesirable situation or consequence of action. The expectation is that negative
                     consequences will be reduced to a level of insignificance.
                     Action will occur along with other entities, and the City will carry its share of the
Participate          responsibility. The expectation is that the policy will be carried out jointly, but
                     that the City will not be in the lead.
                     The action will be allowed if initiated by someone other than the City. The
                     expectation is that the policy will be carried out if it is important to someone other
Permit               than the City. This definition of "permit" as a verb is distinguished from "permit"
                     when used as a noun, which means an entitlement resulting from approval of a
                     development application.
                     Action will be taken to maintain beneficial uses or features in their present
Preserve             condition as nearly as possible. The expectation is that the feature itself will
                     endure over time as the result of that action.

                     The audience may be the general public, specific interest groups, or other entities.
Promote
                     The expectation is that the City would devote resources to advise others of its
                     belief as a means of convincing them to do so as well.
                     Action will be taken to keep a feature safe from destruction or decay, or to keep
Protect              that feature intact. The expectation is that the positive qualities of that feature
                     will endure over time as the result of the action.
                     Action will be taken to offer a product, service, or facility, though not necessarily
Provide              without a fee. The expectation is that the City will take direct responsibility for
                     making the action happen.
                     Action will be taken to offer an opportunity for others to undertake an activity or
                     achieve some objective. The expectation is that the City will take positive action to
Provide for
                     ensure that a specified opportunity is available for parties wishing to take
                     advantage of it.
                     Action will be taken to investigate the subject to determine whether or not some
                     further commitment is in order as a prelude to undertaking implementing action.
Pursue               The expectation is that effort will be expended for research and evaluation, and
                     that, if the proposed activity proves to be feasible and desirable, it will be
                     undertaken.
                     A given situation will be perceived and allowed to continue without interference
Recognize            and without determination of its positive or negative nature. The expectation is
                     that no other action is necessary.

Households, Number of
    The count of all year-round housing units occupied by one or more persons. The concept of
    household is important because the formation of new households generates the demand
    for housing. Each new household formed creates the need for one additional housing unit
    or requires that one existing housing unit be shared by two households. Thus, household
    formation can continue to take place even without an increase in population, thereby
    increasing the demand for housing.
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
    The State agency that has principal responsibility for assessing, planning for, and assisting
    communities to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income households.

    A housing unit has, at least, cooking facilities, a bathroom, and a place to sleep. It also is a
    dwelling that cannot be moved without substantial damage or unreasonable cost. (See
    "Dwelling Unit")
Hydrocarbons
    A family of compounds containing carbon and hydrogen in various combinations. They are
    emitted into the atmosphere from manufacturing, storage and handling, or combustion of
    petroleum products and through natural processes. Certain hydrocarbons interact with
    nitrogen oxides in the presence of intense sunlight to form photochemical air pollution.
Impact
    The effect of any direct man-made actions or indirect repercussions of man-made actions on
    existing physical, social, or economic conditions.
Impact Fee
    A fee, also called a development fee, levied on the developer of a project by a city, county,
    or other public agency as compensation for otherwise-unmitigated impacts the project will
    produce. California Government Code Section 66000, et. seq. specifies that development
    fees shall not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service for which the
    fee is charged. To lawfully impose a development fee, the public agency must verify its
    method of calculation and document proper restrictions on use of the fund.

    the highest level of service, as follows:
    ·    Level of Service A indicates a relatively free flow of traffic, with little or no limitation on
         vehicle movement or speed.
    ·    Level of Service B describes a steady flow of traffic, with only slight delays in vehicle
         movement and speed. All queues clear in a single signal cycle.
    ·    Level of Service C denotes a reasonably steady, high-volume flow of traffic, with some
         limitations on movement and speed, and occasional backups on critical approaches.

APPENDIX B. GLOSSARY
    ·    Level of Service D denotes the level where traffic nears an unstable flow. Intersections
         still function, but short queues develop and cars may have to wait through one cycle
         during short peaks.
    ·    Level of Service E describes traffic characterized by slow movement and frequent
         (although momentary) stoppages. This type of congestion is considered severe, but is
         not uncommon at peak traffic hours, with frequent stopping, long-standing queues, and
         blocked intersections.
    ·    Level of Service F describes unsatisfactory stop-and-go traffic characterized by "traffic
         jams" and stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at signalized intersections usually have
         to wait through one or more signal changes, and "upstream" intersections may be
         blocked by the long queues.
    (2) Some communities in California are developing standards for levels of service relating to
    municipal functions such as police, fire, and library service. These standards are
    incorporated in the General Plan or in separate "Level of Service Plans."

    front and rear access to the outside, no unit is located over another unit, and each unit is
    separated from any other unit by one or more common and fire-resistant walls.
    Townhouses usually have separate utilities; however, in some condominium situations,
    common areas are serviced by utilities purchased by a homeowners association on behalf of
    all townhouse members of the association. (See "Condominium.")
Traffic Model
    A mathematical representation of traffic movement within an area or region based on
    observed relationships between the kind and intensity of development in specific areas.
    Many traffic models operate on the theory that trips are produced by persons living in
    residential areas and are attracted by various non-residential land uses. (See "Trip.")
Transit
    The conveyance of persons or goods from one place to another by means of a local, public
    transportation system.
Transit-dependent

    A strategy for reducing demand on the road system by reducing the number of vehicles
    using the roadways and/or increasing the number of persons per vehicle. TDM attempts to
    reduce the number of persons who drive alone on the roadway during the commute period
    and to increase the number in carpools, vanpools, buses and trains, walking, and biking.
    TDM can be an element of TSM (see below).
Transportation Systems Management (TSM)
    A comprehensive strategy developed to address the problems caused by additional
    development, increasing trips, and a shortfall in transportation capacity. Transportation
    Systems Management focuses on more efficiently utilizing existing highway and transit
    systems rather than expanding them. TSM measures are characterized by their low cost and
    quick implementation time frame, such as computerized traffic signals, metered freeway
    ramps, and one-way streets.

    "attraction end," (destination). (See "Traffic Model.")
Trip Generation
    The dynamics that account for people making trips in automobiles or by means of public
    transportation. Trip generation is the basis for estimating the level of use for a

   Transitional areas between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually
   at or near the surface, or the land is covered by shallow water. Under a "unified"
   methodology now used by all federal agencies, wetlands are defined as "those areas
   meeting certain criteria for hydrology, vegetation, and soils."
Wildlife Refuge
   An area maintained in a natural state for the preservation of both animal and plant life.
Zoning
   The division of a city by legislative regulations into areas, or zones, which specify allowable
   uses for real property and size restrictions for buildings within these areas; a program that
   implements policies of the General Plan.
Zoning Map
   Government Code Section 65851 permits a legislative body to divide a county, a city, or
   portions thereof, into zones of the number, shape, and area it deems best suited to carry

C.1        DATA SOURCES
In preparing the Housing Element, various sources of information are consulted, including the
following:
     ·     2006-10 American Community Survey by the Census Bureau1
     ·     2010 Census by the Census Bureau
     ·     Population and demographic data updated by the State Department of Finance
     ·     Housing market information, such as home sales and rents, from Dataquick and
           Realtytrac, among other sources
     ·     Lending patterns from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) database
     ·     Labor statistics from California Employment Development Department
C.2        COMMUNITY CONTEXT
The City of Avalon is a unique, tourist-oriented
community located on the island of Santa
Catalina, 22 miles southwest of the Los Angeles
and Long Beach Harbors. Santa Catalina Island
is 76 square miles in area, with approximately
88 percent of the land comprised of a
conservancy area maintained in its natural state
in perpetuity. Incorporated in 1913, the
community of Avalon has a unique and colorful
history. While the tiny island had been
inhabited for nearly 7,000 years by original                     View of Avalon late 1800s.
                                                                 Source: History of California - Helen Elliott Bandini.

that large-scale development of Avalon
occurred.
Changing hands a number of times during the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Island has
belonged to the Wrigley family since 1919. Early settlers on Catalina Island raised sheep and
cattle in the mid-1800s. This introduced a ranching industry that continued in some form until
the mid-1950s.2 Mining and the occasional use of the island by the U.S. government during
wartime had also colored its history. Most importantly for its future, in the late 1880s, owner

George Shatto embarked on a campaign to turn Catalina Island into a tourist destination,
planning and building the town of Avalon as the focal point of the island and hub of this activity.
Successive owners continued to nurture his idea, constructing hotels, golf courses, and new
tourist attractions and encouraging hunting, fishing, and other outdoor pursuits. In 1975, Santa
Catalina Island Conservancy, a non-profit operating foundation, ownership to approximately
42,139 acres of Catalina, 88 percent of the Island's 76 square miles. Today, Avalon remains
Catalina Island's principal tourist attraction.
The City’s primary economic base is built upon the tourist industry. Lodging, restaurants, retails,
and other tourist activities/services employ a large number of employees. Traditionally, retail
and service employees earn low wages, and many of them cannot afford decent homes in the
City. Given the high costs of housing, even moderate- and middle-income workers such as
teachers, hotel/restaurant managers, and city and other civic employees have difficulty
affording in the City. Many employers face the challenge of attracting and retaining
management level workers.
C.3      HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Understanding the characteristics of a population is vital in the process of planning for the
future needs of a community. Population characteristics affect the type and amount of housing
need in a community. Issues such as population growth, race/ethnicity, age, and employment
trends are factors that combine to influence the type of housing needed and the ability to afford
housing. The following section describes and analyzes the various population characteristics and
trends that affect housing need.
Population Characteristics
Population Growth
For much of Avalon’s history, the community’s population was relatively stable, fluctuating
between 1,500 to 2,000 residents from 1930 to 1980 (Figure C-1). Then during the 1980s as the
City’s tourism industry began to grow, the population of Avalon grew significantly. From 1980
to 1990, the Avalon population increased by 44 percent, gaining almost 900 new residents. The
robust population growth during this period can be partially attributed to visitors from cruise
ships. Cruise ships started visiting Avalon in the late 1980s, adding to the total visitor population
and spreading out the need for year-round employees.
During the 1990s, Avalon experienced a steady but more modest rate of growth. According to
the Census, Avalon had a permanent population of 3,127 in 2000. The 2010 Census documents
that the Avalon population at 3,728 residents. This represents a 19-percent increase over the
past ten years. However, this population increase was attributable primarily to the annexation
of Pebbly Beach that occurred after the 2000 Census, not due to actual growth in the City
population. According to the Census, Pebbly Beach (Census Tract 5991) had a population of 671
persons in 2000. Therefore, the 601-person increase in population between 2000 and 2010 was
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

primarily due to the annexation of Pebbly Beach. In fact, the overall population in the same
geographic boundaries that now comprise Avalon actually decreased during the last ten years.
Back in 2000, Pebbly Beach (CT 5991) and City of Avalon (CT 5990) had a combined population
of 3,798, lower than the current population for the expanded City boundaries. Table C-1 shows
the population change between 1990 and 2010 for Avalon and nearby cities.

Age Characteristics
A community’s age characteristics can help identify its housing needs. Traditionally, younger
adults (18-34) tend to prefer low to moderate cost, smaller units. Persons between 35 and 54
years of age usually reside in higher priced, larger units since they typically have higher incomes
and a larger household size. Seniors generally require smaller sized, single-story units that are
easier to upkeep and are close to services and shopping. Also, seniors may have fixed or limited
incomes, which means that they need low to moderate cost housing.

  Between the 2000 and 2010 Census, the population characteristics show significant changes
  largely to the annexation of Pebbly Beach, where there were fewer families with children. As of
  2010, school aged youth (5-19 years of age) represented a smaller proportion (21.6 percent) of
  the population compared to the 2000 population (24.6 percent). Specifically, younger children
  (5-14 years) experienced a decline in population. This is probably attributable to the almost
  stagnant growth (0.8 percent) of the adult population in family-raising age (25-44 years). In
  comparison, mature adults and those reaching retirement age, as well as the senior population,
  experienced significant increases. These factors contributed to a rise in median age in Avalon
  from 33.7 in 2000 to 37.7 in 2010.
  These Census demographic trends are further affirmed by the student enrollment data. Avalon
  is served by the Avalon (K-12) School, which is part of the Long Beach Unified School District.
  According to historical school enrollment data, student enrollment climbed steeply through
  much of the 1990s, from 469 students in 1990/91 to 730 students in 1998/99. However,
  student enrollment over the past ten years has actually declined substantially. From school
  years 2002/03 to 2010/11, the total number of students enrolled in kindergarten through 12th
  grade at the Avalon School declined by nearly 20 percent from 753 to 609 students.
  These population trends point to the need for affordable and appropriate housing opportunities
  for young families and seniors. Several implementing actions presented in the Housing Plan aim
  at expanding affordable housing opportunities particularly for young families and seniors. These
  actions include: First Time Homebuyer Assistance; Inclusionary Housing Program; and Housing
  Trust Fund.
  Race and Ethnicity
  The racial and ethnic composition of a population may affect housing needs because of cultural
  practices associated with different racial/ethnic groups. Cultural influences of races may reflect
                                                                                         CITY of AVALON

preference for a specific type of housing. Research has shown that some cultures (e.g., Hispanic
and Asian) tend to maintain extended families within a single household. This tendency can lead
to overcrowding or an increased demand for larger housing units.
Avalon, like many communities throughout California, has experienced changes in the racial and
ethnic composition of its population. According to the Census, the proportion of White
residents continues to decline in Avalon. As of the 2010 Census, Hispanic persons now comprise
the largest racial/ethnic group in the community (Table C-3).

Table C-4 shows that Avalon’s racial/ethnic makeup differs from nearby beach cities and the
County of Los Angeles. Avalon has over 55 percent Hispanic/Latino population, compared to the
County’s 48 percent. In contrast, the proportion of White residents in Avalon (41 percent) is
significantly higher than in the County (28 percent). Other beach cities such as Dana Point,
Laguna Beach, Seal Beach and Manhattan Beach have significantly smaller Hispanic/Latino
populations (all less than 20 percent).

Economic Characteristics
Avalon’s unique island location and its tourist-based economy create special relationships
between employment characteristics, income levels, and housing needs. The tourism industry
generates a large number of service sector jobs that offer low wages. Since daily commuting is
not feasible for many employees, most residents who work in Avalon must also live in the
community. However, housing prices Avalon are influenced by the fact that this is a highly
desirable resort town with a small housing stock and virtually no room for expansion. The very
people who help keep this town a prosperous tourist attraction are not able to afford decent
homes here. Recruiting and retaining employees is a critical concern.
Educational Attainment
Educational attainment is closely linked to an individual’s ability to earn a living. As shown in
Table C-5, a higher proportion of Avalon residents have completed high school and attended
college when compared to residents countywide and statewide. However, Los Angeles County
residents and California residents demonstrate higher college and advanced degree
achievement than the residents of Avalon.

Employment Profile
An assessment of the needs of the community must take into consideration the type of
employment held by residents. Incomes associated with different jobs and the number of
workers in a household determines the type and size of housing a household can afford. In
some cases, the types of jobs themselves can affect housing needs and demand (such as in
communities with military installations, college campuses and seasonal agriculture).
Employment growth typically leads to strong housing demand, while the reverse is true when
employment contracts.
According to the Census, there were 2,188 employed residents in Avalon between 2006 and
2010 with an unemployment rate of 3.9 percent. Service-related occupations are by far the
leading industry within Avalon, employing approximately one-third of the workforce in that five-
year period. Other major occupations for residents include sales and office jobs (30 percent),
and management/ professional occupations (23 percent) (Table C-6). According to the State
Employment Development Department, the unemployment rate in Avalon as of March 2012
was 5.6 percent, less than half of the countywide rate of 11.9 percent.

In many cases, occupations held by residents determine their income and their corresponding
ability to afford housing. A more detailed breakdown of employment by industry is provided in
Table C-7. The majority of jobs in Avalon are within the arts, entertainment, accommodation,
and food service industries (32 percent), followed by retail trade (19 percent). These types of
service-tourism related jobs include many types of occupations such as restaurant servers, retail
clerks, and hotel front desk and cleaning staff. These types of jobs typically pay low wages, are
often only part-time, and provide few benefits. Many of these lower-wage jobs are held by
Hispanic individuals and young adults.

Table C-8 displays mean annual wage data for occupations compiled by the California
Employment Development Department (EDD) for the Los Angeles Metropolitan Statistical Area.
Table C-8 shows that the food preparation and serving, health care support, production, and
social services occupations offer lower wages. Approximately 13 percent of Avalon residents
work at government jobs, and educational, health and social services occupations. Depending
on the years of experience and specialty, these types of jobs typically pay higher wages.
According to EDD, the average salary in Los Angeles County in 2011 for these fields ranged from
$51,351 to $69,898. Jobs in finance, real estate, and management comprise approximately 13

Visitors to Avalon
Visitors to Catalina Island have a tremendous impact on Avalon’s economy. Avalon’s tax
revenue is closely tied with the tourist industry. City tax revenue is funded through four main
sources: Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) Revenue, Sales Tax Revenue, Admission Tax Revenue,
and Wharfage Fees for cross-channel carriers and manifest cruise ship passengers.
     ·   Transient Occupancy Tax: Avalon charges a 12 percent transient rental tax for hotel
         room rentals and for vacation homes and condominium units that are rented to visitors
         on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis for a period of less than 30 days. The City requires
         that any single-family unit or condominium unit must first receive a Conditional Use
         Permit (CUP) before being used as a transient rental. The tenants of the transient rental
         must pay the Transient Occupancy Tax.
                                                                                      CITY of AVALON

     ·   Wharfage Fees: A wharfage fee per passenger is charged for cross-channel passengers
         and for manifest cruise ship passengers.
     ·   Admission Tax Revenue: This fee is charged for event activities (not impacted by sales
         tax) such as boat tours, movie tickets, golf cart rentals, and bus tours. The admission tax
         revenue is four percent on land and seven percent for water activities in the harbor.
     ·   Sales Tax: The City charges sales tax consistent with tax rate in Los Angeles County.
Avalon offers a number of hotels, bed and breakfasts, and vacation rental properties for visitors.
Hotel occupancy varies tremendously by season but due to the economy, the number of visitors
to Avalon has decreased in the last two years. Nevertheless, as hotel occupancy increases
during peak season, the number of seasonal workers also increases. Temporary housing for
seasonal workers is difficult to find and often expensive. Many seasonal workers crowd into
small units to make ends meet.
Household Characteristics
The Census defines a "household" as all persons who occupy a housing unit, which may include
single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, or unrelated persons
sharing living quarters. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories, or
other group living situations are not considered households. Furthermore, the Census classifies
households by type according to the gender of the householder and the presence of relatives.
Household characteristics such as size, type, income and tenure reveal important information
about the housing needs of a community. Different household sizes, types and income levels
often prefer different housing options. This section details the various household characteristics
affecting housing needs in Avalon.
Household Type
Reflecting the increase in population, the number of households in Avalon also increased
between 2000 and 2010. While the population increased 19 percent, the number of households
increased 27 percent (Table C-9), resulting in a decrease in average household size. The number
of family households also increased significantly (23.9 percent) during the last ten years, with,
the majority of the increase came from married couples with no children or other families (such
as single-parent households or relatives living together). Non-family households (e.g., single-
households and households with unrelated persons living together) increased by 32.6 percent.
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

    Household Size
    Household size identifies sources of population growth and household overcrowding. A
    community’s average household size will increase over time if there is a trend towards larger
    families. In a community where the population is aging, the average household size may
    decline.
    Household size can also vary by tenure (whether a household rents or owns their home). In
    2010, renter-households in Avalon had a much larger household size at 2.68 persons compared
    to the average household size of 2.09 persons for owner-occupied units. Considering that rental
    units are often smaller than owner-occupied housing, this indicates that many renter-
    households may be experiencing overcrowded living conditions. Overcrowding among lower-
    pay and temporary workers continues to be a concern. The Inclusionary Housing and
    Temporary Summer Housing programs attempt to address the housing needs of retail and
    service workers.
    Figure C-2 illustrates how the average household size in Avalon compares to average household
    sizes in nearby communities. Household sizes decreased in Avalon, Dana Point, and San Juan
    Capistrano but increased in some other beach communities, according to the Census Bureau.
    The City of Avalon’s household size was smaller than the County’s as a whole, but higher than
    most of the nearby beachside communities.

Household Income
Household income indicates the wealth of a community and therefore is directly connected to
the ability to afford housing. Median household income compared to neighboring communities
provides a way to measure income in Avalon against other cities.
Between 2006 and 2010, households in Los Angeles County had a median income of $55,470.
However, households in the City of Avalon had a median income of $42,189. While the median
income in the City rose substantially by 21 percent from 2000 to 2010, the median income in
Avalon remains significantly lower than the median income of nearby beachside communities,
except for Seal Beach (Figure C-3).

The income earned by a household relates directly to the household’s ability to acquire
adequate housing. While upper income households have more discretionary income to spend
on housing, lower and moderate income households are more limited in the range of housing
that they can afford. Typically, as the income of households decreases, the incidence of cost
burden and overcrowding increases. For planning and funding purposes, the California State
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) has developed the following
income categories based on the Area Median Income (AMI) of a metropolitan area (such as Los
Angeles County):
    ·   Extremely Low Income Households earn up to 30 percent of AMI;
    ·   Very Low Income Households earn between 31 and 50 percent of the AMI;
    ·   Low Income Households earn between 51 percent and 80 percent of the AMI;
    ·   Moderate Income Households earn between 81 percent and 120 percent of the AMI;
        and
    ·   Above Moderate/Upper Income Households earn over 120 percent of the AMI.
Combined, the extremely low, very low, and low Income groups are referred to as lower income.
Federal programs provide assistance only to households in the lower income category (up to 80
percent AMI).
Median household income provides only partial insight into a community’s income profile. A
more detailed breakdown of households by income category can provide more information
about the proportion of households in Avalon whose limited incomes may lead them to have a
higher incidence of housing problems such as overpayment (paying more than 30 percent of
income on housing) or overcrowding (having more than one person per room).
According to the 2006-2010 ACS, approximately 20 percent of the households earned less than
$25,000, while approximately 32 percent of City households earned incomes between $25,000
and $49,999 (Table C-10). Approximately 28 percent of Avalon households earned incomes
between $50,000 and $99,999 and 20percent reported $100,000 or more in income. By
comparison, the County had greater proportions of households in the higher income categories,
explaining the lower median household income reported for Avalon when compared to Los
Angeles County.
Often household income varies by household type. As shown in Table C-11, the median
household income in Avalon varied considerably depending on whether a household owns or
rents their home. The median household income for owner-occupied households was $87,313
while the median income for renter-households was $40,604. About 44 percent of the renter-
households earned less than $35,000 per year compared to 17 percent of owner-households. In
contrast, almost 44 percent of owner-households earned $100,000 or more compared to less
than ten percent of renter-households.

        The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) uses Census data to develop
        special tabulations by HUD income group and household type.3 This data set is known as the
        Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS). While CHAS data has been updated for
        most communities using American Community Survey data, this update is not yet available for
        small communities such as Avalon as of the writing of this report (April 2012).
        Using CHAS based on 2000 Census, income data by household type (e.g. elderly, small family,
        large family) are presented in Table C-12. According to CHAS data, about eight percent of the
        City’s total households in 2000 qualified as extremely low income (0-30 percent AMI),
        approximately 11 percent as very low income (31-50 percent AMI), and almost 22 percent as
        low income (51-80 percent AMI). Countywide about 40 percent of total households were lower
        income (extremely low, very low, and low incomes), which is roughly equal to the proportion of
        lower income households in the City of Avalon.

        Table C-13 compares income levels by household type. Although senior residents accounted for
        just 10 percent of the City’s population in 2000, senior households comprise nearly one-quarter
        of all households in the community. This indicates than many Avalon seniors live alone. As
        shown in Table C-13, elderly households were much more likely to be lower income than any
        other household type. Approximately 46 percent of all elderly households were lower income
        (earned less than 80 percent AMI) and about one quarter of all elderly households earned less
        than 50 percent of the AMI.
        In particular, elderly renter-households had the highest proportion of lower income households.
        Among all elderly renter-households, approximately 66 percent were lower income (Table C-14).
        In contrast, just 30 percent of elderly owner-households were lower income. With limited
        incomes and living alone, seniors are vulnerable to rent increases. Many seniors who enjoy
        independent living may not be able to afford the rents anymore and be priced out of the Avalon
        if affordable options are not available to them.

  Housing Problems
  The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed by the Census for HUD
  provides detailed information on housing needs by income level for different types of
  households in Avalon. Detailed CHAS data based on the 2000 Census is displayed in
  Table C-15. Housing problems considered by CHAS include:
       ·    Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
       ·    Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
                                                                                                   CITY of AVALON

           ·    Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of gross income.
      The types of problems vary according to household income, type, and tenure. Some highlights
      include:
           ·    In general, renter-households had a higher level of housing problems (56 percent)
                compared to owner-households (34 percent).
           ·    Large renter-families had the highest level of housing problems regardless of income

      Cost Burden (Overpayment)
      A household is considered to be overpaying for housing (or cost burdened) if it spends more
      than 30 percent of its gross household income on housing. A household is considered
      experiencing a severe cost burden if it spends more than 50 percent of its gross income on
      housing. A household that spends more than it can afford for housing has less money available
      for other necessities such as food and clothing and emergency expenditures. Extremely low
                                                                                                          CITY of AVALON

income households with a housing cost burden are more likely to be at risk of becoming
homeless than other households. Problems of overpayment occur when housing costs rise
faster than incomes or when households are forced to pay more than they can afford for
housing of adequate size, condition, and amenities to meet their needs. The prevalence of
overpayment varies significantly by income, tenure, household type, and household size.
Table C-15 displays the percentage of cost burden by type of household. As shown in this table,
among all households in the City, extremely low income households had the highest incidence
of housing cost burden (83 percent) compared to other households. Approximately 75 percent
of all extremely low income households experienced a severe cost burden (spending more than
50 percent of their income on housing).
Among all very low income households, owner-households experienced a higher degree of
severe housing cost burden than renter-households. Approximately half of all owner-
households spent more than 50 percent of their income toward housing costs compared to one-
third of renter-households. Among all households, approximately 51 percent of low income
households experienced a cost burden, inclusive of the 15 percent that had a severe housing
cost burden. Among all low income households, elderly renter-households and large owner-
households experienced the highest degree of cost burden.
According to the ACS data, between 2006 and 2010, 70 percent of owner-occupied households
in Avalon spent more than 30 percent of their household income on housing. By contrast, a
lower percentage of renter-households (55 percent) overpaid for housing.
Overcrowding
Overcrowding is typically defined as a housing unit occupied by more than one person per room.
A severely overcrowded household is defined as one with more than 1.5 persons per room.
Overcrowding typically occurs when there are not enough adequately sized units within a
community, when high housing costs relative to income force too many individuals to share a
housing unit than it can adequately accommodate, or when families reside in smaller units than
they need to devote income to other necessities, such as food and health care. Overcrowding
tends to accelerate the deterioration of housing. Therefore, maintaining a reasonable level of
occupancy and alleviating overcrowding are critical to enhancing quality of life.
In 2000, 216 housing units, or 18 percent of all occupied units in Avalon were considered
overcrowded, with 69 percent of these considered severely overcrowded. Overcrowding
conditions appeared to have worsened, according to the 2006-2010 ACS. Overall, between
2006 and 2010, 20 percent of the occupied units in Avalon were considered overcrowded.
However, the rate of severe overcrowding decreased to 52 percent of all overcrowded
households.
As reflected in Table C-16, overcrowding rates vary considerably by tenure. While four percent
of owner-occupied households experienced overcrowded living conditions between 2006 and
2010, more than one-quarter of all renter-households were overcrowded. Approximately 14
                                                                                  CITY of AVALON

percent of renter-households were severely overcrowded compared to three percent of owner-
households. Overcrowding is a significant issue for renter-households in Avalon. The 2010
Census reports a higher average household size for renter-households (2.68 persons) than for
owner-households (2.09 persons). Of further concern, since housing demand in Avalon
fluctuates significantly by season, overcrowding during the summer months may be
considerably higher than indicated in Table C-16. During this peak tourist time, many seasonal
works have greater difficulty finding adequate and affordable housing. As a consequence many
will ‘double-up’ on sharing a rental unit or room, exasperating overcrowded living conditions.

The 2008-2013 Housing Element includes two implementing actions that address the housing
needs of retail- and service-sector employees, as well as seasonal employees – the Inclusionary
Housing and Temporary Employee Housing programs are particularly targeted toward assisting
the lower income employees.
Special Needs Populations
Certain groups have greater difficulty finding good quality, affordable housing due to special
needs and/or circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one’s employment and
income, family characteristics, disability, and household characteristics, among other factors.
Consequently, some residents in Avalon may experience a higher prevalence of housing
overpayment, overcrowding, or other housing problems. “Special needs” groups include the
following: seniors, persons with disabilities, homeless, single-parent households, and large
households (Table C-17).

The following section provides a detailed discussion of the housing needs facing each particular
group as well as programs and services available to address their housing needs.
Seniors
Many senior-headed households have special needs due to their relatively low incomes,
disabilities or limitations, and dependency needs. Specifically, people aged 65 years and older
often have four main concerns:
     ·    Housing: Many seniors live alone and may have difficulty maintaining their homes.
     ·    Income: People aged 65 and over are usually retired and living on a limited income.
     ·    Health care: Seniors are more likely to have high health care costs.
     ·    Transportation: Many of the elderly rely on public transportation; especially those with
          disabilities.
According to the 2000 Census, approximately 19 percent of Avalon households were headed by
elderly persons aged 65 years and older. Of the 221 elderly households, 54 percent (119
households) lived alone. The majority (57 percent) of senior-headed households owned their
own home while 43 percent were renter-households.
The proportion of senior-headed households was reported at 18.4 percent in the 2010 Census.
Of the senior-headed households, 125 (46 percent) were living alone. As in 2000 Census, 57
percent of the senior-headed households were homeowners and 43 percent were renters in
2010.
                                                                                               CITY of AVALON

Meeting the needs of Avalon seniors that wish to remain in the community is a continuing
concern. Many seniors are living on fixed incomes and do not have adequate funds to maintain
their homes or continue to afford their rent. As discussed in previous sections, elderly
households had a much higher percentage of lower income households than any other
household type. Aside from overpayment problems faced by seniors due to their relatively fixed
incomes, many seniors are faced with various disabilities. No disability data is available from the
2010 Census; approximately 43 percent of Avalon seniors had a disability in 2000.
Senior homeowners, particularly elderly women, may require assistance in performing regular
home maintenance or repair activities due to physical limitations or disabilities. These in-home
needs and other senior needs can be met through a range of services, including congregate care,
rent subsidies, shared housing programs, and housing rehabilitation assistance. For the frail or
disabled elderly, housing with architectural design features that accommodate disabilities can
ensure continued independent living. Those with a mobility or self-care limitation may require
transportation alternatives or shared housing options.
Persons with Disabilities
The Americans with Disabilities Act defines a disabled person as having a physical or mental
impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. In Avalon and elsewhere,
persons with disabilities have a wide range of different housing needs, which vary depending on
the type and severity of the disability as well as personal preference and lifestyle. Physical,
mental, and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from working, restrict one’s
mobility, or make it difficult to care for oneself. “Barrier-free design” housing, accessibility
modifications, proximity to services and transit, and group living opportunities represent some
of the types of considerations and accommodations that are important in serving this group.
Also, some residents suffer from disabilities that require living in a supportive or institutional
setting.
The 2000 Census defines six types of disabilities: sensory, physical, mental, self-care, go-outside-
home, and employment. The Census defines sensory and physical disabilities as “long-lasting
conditions.” Mental, self-care, go-outside-home, and employment disabilities are defined as
conditions lasting six months or more that makes it difficult to perform certain activities. A more
detailed description of each disability is provided below:
    ·    Sensory disability: Refers to blindness, deafness, or severe vision or hearing
         impairment.
    ·    Physical disability: Refers to a condition that substantially limits one or more basic
         physical activities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying.
    ·    Mental disability: Refers to a mental condition lasting more than six months that
         impairs learning, remembering, or concentrating.
    ·    Self-care disability: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to dress, bathe, or get
         around inside the home.
                                                                                        CITY of AVALON

     ·    Go-outside-home: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to go outside the home
          alone to shop or visit a doctor’s office.
     ·    Employment disability: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to work at a job or
          business.
According to the 2000 Census, 408 persons in Avalon had a disability, comprising approximately
13 percent of the population. Table C-18 displays the tally of disabled persons by age. The
proportion of individuals with disabilities increases with age. Approximately four percent of
children aged 5 to 15 had a disability, compared to 13 percent of adults aged 16 to 64 and 43

Perhaps the most important factor in regard to planning for housing for persons with disabilities
is that there are a wide range of different disabilities, and different people with the same
‘disability’ may have different levels of functioning which affect their housing needs and choices.
People with disabilities include parents who are raising families, teenagers who are members of
large families, seniors living with their spouses or children, and young people who desire to live
on their own, as only a few examples.
The Census tallied the number of disabilities by type for residents with one or more disabilities.
Among the disabilities tallied, 14 percent were sensory disabilities, 28 percent were physical
disabilities, 13 percent were mental disabilities, five percent were self-care disabilities, 16
percent were disabilities that limited the ability to go outside the home, and 24 percent were
employment disabilities (Table C-19). Mental disabilities accounted for 72 percent of disabilities
tallied among five to 15 year olds, while 42 percent of disabilities tallied for 16 to 64 year olds
limited their ability to work. Physical disabilities and disabilities that restrict the ability to go
outside the home alone accounted for 59 percent of disabilities tallied among Tracy’s senior
population.

New State law (SB 812) passed in November 2010 also requires that the Housing Element
discuss the housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by federal law,
“developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that:
    ·   Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and
        physical impairments;
    ·   Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
    ·   Is likely to continue indefinitely;
    ·   Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of
        major life activity: self-care; receptive and expressive language; learning; mobility; self-
        direction; capacity for independent living; or economic self- sufficiency; and
    ·   Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
        interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of
        assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and
        coordinated.
The Census does not provide separate reporting on developmental disabilities. According to the
Harbor Regional Center that provides services for persons with developmental disabilities, the
Center serves nine Avalon residents who are developmentally disabled. Of these, four are
adults and five are minors living with their families. Overall, housing needs from this group are
not extensive.
Large Households
Large households are defined as those consisting of five or more members. These households
comprise a special need group because of the often limited supply of adequately sized and
affordable housing units in a community. To save for other basic necessities such as food,
clothing and medical care, it is common for lower income large households to reside in smaller
units, which frequently results in overcrowding. In 2000, approximately 154 households had
                                                                                              CITY of AVALON

five or more members, comprising 13 percent of all households. Of these households, 87
percent were renters and 13 percent were owner-occupied households. In 2010, the number of
large households increased to 184 but represented only 12.4 percent of all households in the
City. Among these 184 households, eight percent were owner-households and 92 percent were
renter-households.
Large family households face difficulty finding affordable, adequately sized housing. In Avalon,
40 percent of large households earned lower incomes based on the 2000 Census. Specifically,
approximately 26 percent of large households were low income compared to the citywide
average of 22 percent, and almost 30 percent of the large family renter-households were low
income compared to 13 percent of large family owner-households.
Single-Parent Households
Single-parent families, particularly female-headed families with children, often require special
consideration and assistance because of their greater need for affordable housing and
accessible day care, health care, and other supportive services. Female-headed families with
children are considered a vulnerable group because they must balance the needs of their
children with work responsibilities, often while earning limited incomes.
In 2000, an estimated 141 single-parent households with children under 18 lived in Avalon,
representing 12 percent of all households in the community. Specifically, 109 were female-
headed family households with children under 18 (nine percent of all households) and 32 were
male-headed households with children (three percent of all households). In 2010, the number
of single-parent households with children increased to 158, but its proportional share of all
households decreased to 10.7 percent. Specifically, 103 were female-headed households with
children.
Female-headed families have a higher incidence of poverty when compared to all households.
The 2010 Census data does not contain income data. In 2000, among all female-headed
households with children, 21 percent were living below the poverty level. In contrast, only five
percent of two-parent families with children were living below the poverty level.
Residents Living in Poverty
Families, particularly female-headed families, are disproportionately affected by poverty. The
2010 Census data does not contain income data. In 2000, ten percent of the City’s total
residents (327 persons) were living in poverty. Approximately 21 percent of female-headed
families with children, however, had incomes below the poverty level.
Homeless
According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), a person is
considered homeless if he/she is not imprisoned and:
     ·   Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence;
                                                                                   CITY of AVALON

     ·    The primary nighttime residence is a publicly or privately operated shelter designed for
          temporary living arrangements;
     ·    The primary residence is an institution that provides a temporary residence for
          individuals that should otherwise be institutionalized; or
     ·    The primary residence is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as a
          regular sleeping accommodation.
An accurate count and description of the homeless population is difficult because of the
transient nature of the population, and because many individuals are not visibly homeless but
move around in temporary living conditions such as staying with friends. The number of
homeless persons on Catalina Island increases during the summer months.
The majority of homeless are not located within Avalon but camp out in the hills outside the
City. It has been estimated that at peak season there are over 50 individuals camping out at any
one time. One of the major factors of homelessness during the summer months is the limited
amount of summer rentals for seasonal workers. This is due to the lack of seasonal housing and
the fact that many owners rent out their homes for the summer to mainland visitors that can
pay a high rental rate than seasonal workers.
The type of homeless individuals has changed over the years. Historically homeless persons that
camp outside were young college-age adults that worked on the Island over the summer.
Increasingly, the Island’s homeless population includes families with children. There are many
sanitary and safety issues associated with the homeless camps. Periodically, the Sheriff’s
Department, in conjunction with the property owner, sweeps the camp grounds and asks
everyone to leave.
The Catalina Bible Church and the Avalon Community Church provide emergency assistance for
those in need. The Catalina Bible Church provides emergency shelter for up to two people for a
maximum of two days. In emergency situations, all the churches on the Island allow homeless
individuals to sleep on floors. The Catalina Bible Church also operates a Food Ministry, which
provides a week of food (20 to 25 lbs) for at a low cost.
The Avalon Community Church provides emergency food as well as emergency housing. The
Avalon Community Church typically accommodates up to three persons each night on a couch
or pull-out mattress at the Teen Center after the Center is closed for the day. 4 There is no limit
on the length of stay but the homeless individuals must clear out in the morning. At this time,
the Church only has capacity to accommodate homeless men. The Church tries to find other
arrangements for homeless women. The Church also has also been providing accommodation
to a previously homeless person in exchange for custodian services.

According to a representative of the Avalon Community Church, there are homeless individuals
living on semi-derelict boats.5 These individuals are a migrant population that move from
harbor to harbor along the California coast and stay in Avalon for the summer. Approximately
eight boats with homeless individuals (mostly single males) stay in the east side of the harbor
every night. Many of these people do not have money for food, only just enough to keep up
boat docking fees or fines.
The homeless population in the City consists primarily of temporary workers for the tourist
industry. The City’s primary strategy for addressing the seasonal homeless needs is to establish
temporary summer housing for the seasonal workers. The City is in discussions with the Santa
Catalina Island Company (the Company) regarding the development of seasonal employee
housing.
Seasonal Workers
Seasonal workers are defined as a special needs group in Avalon due to the community’s large
tourism industry and unique island location. Most seasonal workers in Avalon fill temporary
employment needs for tourism-related service industries such as restaurants, boat/bus tours,
retail stores and hotels. These types of jobs are typically lower paying, are often part time, and
have few benefits. In addition, the high cost of ferry tickets (approximately $50 round-trip for
commuters in 2011) and lengthy commute time (one hour or more from the Long Beach Harbor)
makes living on the Island a necessity for many workers. Due to their income levels and
temporary residency requirements, seasonal workers need affordable housing primarily for the
summer months (high season). The City is in discussions with the Company regarding the
development of seasonal employee housing.
Farm Workers
While State law also identifies farm workers as a special needs group due to the seasonal nature
of their work and low wages, no agricultural production occurs in Avalon and therefore the
housing needs of this group is not discussed in this Housing Element.
Housing Stock Characteristics
A community’s housing stock is defined as the collection of all housing units located within the
jurisdiction. The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth, type, age and condition,
tenure, vacancy rates, housing costs, and affordability are important in determining the housing
needs for the community. This section details the housing stock characteristics of Avalon to
identify how well the current housing stock meets the needs of current and future residents of
the City.

Housing Growth
Given Avalon’s status as a resort community, housing
demand and supply for local residents is impacted by the
needs of seasonal workers and out of town residents.
As shown in Table C-20, the City’s housing stock between
2000 and 1990 decreased slightly, by approximately 35
units. This loss of units does not indicate that any housing
was demolished. The loss of units occurred primarily due to
a reclassification of housing arrangements such as
houseboats (detailed later). During the same time period, the number of seasonally occupied
housing increased.
Due in part to the annexation of Pebbly Beach, the overall housing stock in Avalon increased 22
percent between 2000 and 2010. In 2000, Pebbly Beach had 168 housing units; therefore, the
413-unit increase in housing stock in Avalon was due partially to boundary adjustments and
partially to actual housing growth. New housing in the City includes the Bird Park (24 affordable
family units completed in 2002) and Beacon Street (13 affordable senior units completed in
2002) developments.

Housing Type
Table C-21 shows the mix of housing units in Avalon from 1990 to 2010. As of the writing of this
Housing Element, the 2010 Census has yet not released detailed information on housing units.
According to 2010 Department of Finance estimates, 51 percent of the housing stock is
comprised of single-family housing units and 48 percent is made up of multi-family units.
Among single-family units, approximately half are detached units. Among all multi-family
homes, the majority (61 percent) consists of smaller complexes with just two to four units.

The most significant change in Avalon’s housing stock was in the “other” housing category.
Housing identified as “other” decreased from 13 percent homes in 1990 to less than one
percent in 2010. This was primarily due to the changed definitions by the Census Bureau. For
example, in 1990, many unconventional units such as campers, trailers, and houseboats were
counted as “other” housing units. As of 2000, many of these units were either dropped as a
housing unit or reclassified as mobile homes or multi-family units (in five units+ structures). This
reclassification contributed to the increase in the proportion of multi-family structures between
1990 and 2000.
Housing Availability and Tenure
Housing tenure and vacancy rates are important indicators of the supply and cost of housing.
Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is owned or rented. As indicated in Table C-22,
approximately three-quarters of all households in Avalon in 2010 were renter-households and
26 percent were owner-households. Over the past twenty years, the proportion of renter-
households remained rather stable in the community.

Vacancies can also be an important housing indicator in that the vacancy rate influences the
cost of housing and may reflect the match between housing demand and availability. In most
communities, vacancy rates of five percent for rental housing and two percent for ownership
housing are generally considered healthy and suggest that there is a balance between the
demand and supply of housing. Due to Avalon’s unique status as a resort town, the number of
                                                                                           CITY of AVALON

vacant units is exceptionally high. In 2010, vacant units comprised approximately 35 percent of
all housing units with the vast majority of the vacant units (74 percent) used as seasonal,
recreational, or occasional use and not available to those who need it year round (Table C-23).
In 2010, excluding seasonal, recreational, or occasional housing, the homeowner vacancy rate
was 0.8 percent, while the renter vacancy rate was 5.9 percent.

Transient Rentals: Transient rentals are single-family homes, townhomes, and condominiums
that are rented to visitors on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis for a period of less than 30 days.
Transient rentals provide housing for visitors, supporting the local economy, while providing
income for property owners. The number of transient rentals differs from the 2010 Census
classification of seasonal/ occasional use housing. The Census includes housing units that are
used as second homes and are not rented out.
Currently the City requires that any single-family unit or condominium unit must first receive a
Conditional Use Permit (CUP) before being used as a transient rental. Transient rentals cannot
be rented for more than 30 consecutive days to the same occupant during the two years
preceding the CUP application. While the use and restrictions of transient rentals continues to
be debated in the community, generally the restrictions on CUP rentals work to limit the
number of housing units rented to outside visitors. As of 2011, there were 364 active transient
rentals in Avalon available for visitor lodging. The number of transient rentals in Avalon has
increased over the past ten years. In comparison, there were 278 active transient rentals in
2000. The City established a fee structure for the Transient Rental permit, which is collected as
a funding source for the Housing Trust Fund.
Housing Age and Condition
Housing age can be an important indicator of housing condition within a community. Like any
other tangible asset, housing is subject to gradual physical or technological deterioration over
time. If not properly and regularly maintained, housing can deteriorate and discourage
reinvestment, depress neighboring property values, and eventually impact the quality of life in a
neighborhood. Many federal and state programs also use the age of housing as one factor in
determining housing rehabilitation needs. Table C-24 profiles the age of existing housing units
in Avalon. Housing growth in the City significantly declined after the 1980s, reflecting the
                                                                                                    CITY of AVALON

limited land and water available for development. Approximately 11 percent of the housing
stock was built during the 1990s and another seven percent was built during the last ten years.
The accepted age standard for a housing unit requiring major rehabilitation is 30 years or older.
In 2010, 68 percent of the housing stock in the City was over 30 years old, with approximately 50
percent of the housing stock approaching 60 years or older. Typically, a large proportion of
older housing indicates that the majority of the housing in the community may be expected to
require rehabilitation or replacement to remain fit for occupancy.

Due to the generally higher housing value and higher income of homeowners in Avalon, housing
tends to be better maintained than in many other communities with a similar level of older
housing stock. However, despite having great equity in their homes, some households (elderly
households in particular) have limited incomes and may have difficulty maintaining their homes.
Additionally, with the large number of homes occupied on a seasonal basis, some needed
property maintenance may be postponed by the owners, especially in light of the current
economy condition. It is estimated that about 50 percent of the City’s residential units built in
the 1930s need substantial rehabilitation or upgrading. These units do not meet current
building codes but are grandfathered in.
In 2004, the City conducted a Survey of Residential Property Owners. A question regarding
rehabilitation and repair needs was included as part of the Survey. Of the 398 property owners
that responded to the Survey, 81 (20 percent) indicated that their homes had repair needs.

The Avalon Fire Department and the Building Department handle code enforcement issues on a
reactive basis. The Fire Department seeks the assistance of the City Planning Department when
cases are related to planning code compliance. Depending on the type of violation, the Fire
Department may direct the complaint to the Building Department Inspector or the Los Angeles
County Health Inspector. Most complaints handled by the Building Department are related to
illegal building activity such as installing new windows without a permit.
Housing Costs and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems in a community. If
housing costs are relatively high in comparison to household income, there will be a
correspondingly higher prevalence of housing cost burden and overcrowding. This section
summarizes the cost and affordability of the housing stock to Avalon residents.
Homeownership Market
The California Association of Realtors (CAR) publishes median home sales price data compiled by
DataQuick for cities and counties throughout the State. According to DataQuick, 12 homes and
14 condominiums were sold in Avalon in 2009 (Table C-26). The median sale price for a home in
Avalon during this period was $499,000, representing a 17 percent increase from the median
sale price in 2004 ($425,000). For condominiums, the median sale price was $500,000, which
represents a 20 percent increase since 2004 ($415,000). During 2010, the median price in
Avalon increased 12 percent to $559,000. However, condominium prices decreased, with a
median price of $350,000 or a 30 percent decrease compared to 2009.
Home prices in other beachside communities experienced similar trends – while the single-
family home prices have held up and are generally increasing, but condominium prices have
seem either only small increases or have actually decreased substantially as in Avalon and
Laguna Beach.

   Avalon is equally impacted by the collapse of the housing market as most communities
   throughout the nation. In July 2011, there were 12 homes listed in foreclosure sales in Avalon,
   including six homes being auctioned; four homes that are bank-owned; two homes in pre-
   foreclosure sales.6
   Rental Market
   According to local residents, City staff, and the Chamber of Commerce, finding rental housing in
   Avalon is extremely competitive. A very limited number of advertised rental units were
   available within the community’s local newspapers the Avalon Bay News and the Catalina
   Islander Newspaper. In May 2011, four classified ads showed the following:
         ·    Three-bedroom home: $2,000
         ·    Three-bedroom condo: $4,200
         ·    Two-bedroom condo: $2,200
         ·    One-bedroom unit (at duplex building): $1,500
   These listings were all for homes or condominiums for rent. Apartments are probably renting at
   lower prices although there were no listings available for review.
   In 2004, the City conducted a Survey of Renters. Included in the survey were questions
   regarding rental rates for various sizes and types of residential units in Avalon. Of the 122
   renter- households responded to the rental rate question, the majority (66 percent) resided in
   apartments, while approximately one third (27 percent) resided in single-family homes. The
   remaining six percent rented a bedroom. Rental rates for apartment units ranged from $177 to
   $2,000 with the median rental rate of $920. Rental rates were significantly higher for homes.
   Home rentals ranged from $364 to $2,300 per month with a median rental price of $1,125.

Some respondents were renting a bedroom in a home. Bedroom rentals ranged from $200 to
$750 with a median price of $600 per month.
Comparing the 2004 rents with the current listings indicates that rent levels have not decreased

Housing Affordability by Income Level
Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home in the
City with the maximum affordable housing costs for households at different income levels.
Taken together, this information can generally show who can afford what size and type of
housing and indicate the type of households most likely to experience overcrowding and
overpayment.
The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual household
income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility for federal housing assistance.
Based on this survey, the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
developed income limits that can be used to determine the maximum price that could be
affordable to households in the upper range of their respective income category. Households in
the lower end of each category can afford less by comparison than those at the upper end.
The maximum affordable home and rental prices for residents of Los Angeles County are shown
in Table C-28, which shows the maximum amount that a household can pay for housing each
month without incurring a cost burden (overpayment). This amount can be compared to
median home prices and market rents to determine what types of housing opportunities a
household can afford.

Extremely Low income Households: Extremely low income households earn 30 percent or less
of the County area median income – up to $17,950 for a one-person household and up to
$27,650 for a five-person household in 2011. Extremely low income households cannot afford
market-rate rental or ownership housing in Avalon. However, one-person household may have
rental options of renting a bedroom.
Very Low income Households: Very low income households earn between 31 percent and 50
percent of the County area median income – up to $29,900 for a one-person household and up
to $46,150 for a five-person household in 2011. Housing options in Avalon for very low income
households are also very limited. Market rents for apartments and homes and homeownership
are generally beyond the reach of these households unless incurring a cost burden and/or living
in overcrowded conditions.
Low income Households: Low income households earn between 51 percent and 80 percent of
the County’s area median income - up to $47,850 for a one-person household and up to $73,800
for a five-person household in 2011. Housing options in Avalon for low income households are
still very limited. These households may be able to afford smaller and older rental units and
homes. However, overpayment and overcrowding can be an issue.
Moderate income Households: Moderate income households earn between 81 percent and 120
percent of the County’s Area Median Income – up to $82,950 depending on household size in
2011. This group can afford some moderately sized rental unit and perhaps purchase smaller
condominium units.
Affordable Housing
State law requires that the City identify, analyze, and propose programs to preserve existing
multi-family rental units which are eligible to convert to non-low-income housing uses due to
termination of subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions during the
next ten years.
This Housing Element covers two planning periods – July 1, 2008 through December 31, 2013
and January 1, 2014 through December 31, 202. Thus, this at-risk housing analysis covers the
period from July 1, 2008 through December 31, 2023, from the beginning of the first planning
period to ten years from the beginning of the second planning period.
 Consistent with State law, this section identifies publicly assisted housing units in Avalon,
analyzes their potential to convert to market rate housing uses, and analyzes the cost to
preserve or replace those units.
Publicly Assisted Housing
As of 2010, four affordable housing projects are located in Avalon, totaling 127 affordable units
for families and seniors. Each housing development is described in detail below.
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

Eucalyptus Garden Apartments: Eucalyptus Garden Apartments includes 80 rental units of
which 24 are affordable to extremely low income households (0-30 percent AMI), and 16 units
for very low income (31-50 percent AMI) households. The remaining 40 units are market-rate
apartments. The project includes 32 studios, 32 one-bedroom units, eight two-bedroom units,
and eight three-bedroom units. The project was constructed in 1992 with Low Income Housing
Tax Credit (LIHTC) funds, Avalon Community Improvement Agency (ACIA) funds, and Rental
Housing Construction Program (RHCP) loans. The land was leased at a low rate from the Santa
Catalina Island Company (the Company). The project has an affordability restriction of 55 years
and is expected to expire in 2047.
New Tremont Apartments: The New Tremont Apartments project consists of 62 units
constructed in 1983 with assistance from the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) with a
project-based Section 8 Rental Assistance contract. CalHFA also owns the apartment project.
The Section 8 contract is due to expire on August 18, 2016. The project includes 10 one-
bedroom units, 37 two-bedroom units, and 15 three-bedroom units. Of the 62 apartment units,
50 are affordable to very low and low income households. Approximately 13 units are market-
rate units. As of December 2010, the property managers for this community reported a large
number of people on the wait list for affordable and market-rate apartments. Due to the
limited number of vacancies, this translates into a four- to six-year waiting period, depending on
the size of apartment needed.
Bird Park Apartments: Bird Park Apartments was
constructed in 2002 and includes 24 two-, three- and
four-bedroom units for very low income families. The
project was constructed with U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) Section 515 funds, LIHTC
financing, ACIA assistance, and HOME funds. Bird
Park Apartments has an affordability length of 55
years and is due to expire in 2047. While the wait list
is not long, there is very little turnover of the units
since affordable housing is limited on the Island.          Constructed in 2002 Bird Park apartments
                                                            includes 24 units for very low income families
Beacon Hill Senior Apartments: Beacon Hill Senior
Apartments was constructed in 2002 and includes 13 one-bedroom units for very low income
senior households. The project was constructed with a combination of USDA Section 515 funds,
LIHTC financing, HOME funds, ACIA funds (land purchase costs), and Federal Home Loan Back
(FHLB) funds. Beacon Hills maintains a wait list for the units. However, available vacant units
are very rare unless a tenant passes away or must move into a community facility that provides
a more comprehensive level of heath and supportive services. Affordability length is 55 years to
be expired in 2047.
                                                                                         CITY of AVALON

Preservation and Replacement Options
Of the City’s 125 affordable units, only one project, the Tremont Street Apartments, with 50
very low and low income units, is at-risk of converting to market-rate during the 2008 to 2023
period. To preserve the existing affordable housing stock, the City must either preserve the
existing assisted units or facilitate the development of new units. Depending on the
circumstances of the at-risk projects, different options may be used to preserve or replace the
units. Preservation options typically include: 1) transfer of project to non-profit ownership; 2)
provision of rental assistance to tenants using other funding sources; and 3) purchase of
affordability covenants. In terms of replacement, the most direct option is the development of
new assisted multi-family housing units. These options are described below.
Transfer of Ownership: Transferring ownership of an at-risk project to a non-profit housing
provider is generally one of the least costly ways to ensure that the at-risk units remain
affordable for the long term. However, Tremont Street Apartments is already owned by a
nonprofit agency (CHFA) and therefore, transfer of ownership is not an applicable preservation
option.
Rental Assistance: Rental subsidies using other funding sources can be used to maintain
affordability of the 50 at-risk affordable units. These rent subsidies could be structured to
mirror the federal Section 8 program. Under Section 8, HUD pays the difference between what
tenants can pay (defined as 30 percent of household income) and what HUD estimates as the
fair market rent (FMR) on the unit. In Los Angeles County, the 2010 FMRs are $1,137 for a one-
bedroom unit, $1,420 for a two-bedroom unit, and $1,907 for a three-bedroom unit. The
feasibility of this alternative is highly dependent upon the availability of reliable funding sources
necessary to make rent subsidies. As indicated in Table C-29, the total cost of subsidizing the
rents of all 50 at-risk units is estimated at $35,687 per month or $428,244 annually.

Purchase of Affordability Covenant: Another option to preserve the affordability of the at-risk
project is to provide an assistance package to the owner to maintain the project as affordable
housing. Incentives could include writing down the interest rate on the remaining loan balance,
providing a lump-sum payment, and/or supplementing the rents to market levels. The
feasibility of this option depends on whether the complex is too highly leveraged. By providing
lump sum financial assistance or ongoing subsides in rents or reduced mortgage interest rates to
the owner, the City can ensure that some or all of the units remain affordable.
Construction of Replacement Units: The construction of new low income housing units is a
means of replacing the at-risk units should they be converted to market-rate units. The cost of
developing housing depends upon a variety of factors, including density, size of the units (i.e.
square footage and number of bedrooms), location, land costs, and type of construction.
Assuming an average construction cost of $250,000 per unit (assuming a 1,000-square-foot unit,
including common space, at $250 per square foot), it would cost approximately $12,500,000,
excluding land costs, to construct 50 new assisted units. Including land costs, the total cost to
develop replacement units would be higher.
Cost Comparison: Preservation option for Tremont Street Apartments is limited to extending
the ongoing rent subsidies for the assisted units or providing a financial assistance package to
leverage the project. These options are generally less costly than the construction of
replacement housing in comparison, requires significant financial and land resources.
Resources for Preserving Affordable Units
Available public and non-profit organizations with the capacity to preserve assisted housing
developments include the City of Avalon, Santa Catalina Island Company, and various non-profit
developers active in Southern California, including Bridge Housing, Jamboree Housing, and
TELACU. Financial resources available include Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) funds,
California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) assistance, HOME funds, and Federal Home Loan Back
(FHLB) funds, and State Proposition 1C funds.
Coastal Housing Requirements
State law stipulates that local jurisdictions may not authorize the conversion or demolition of
existing residential dwelling units occupied by low and moderate income households unless
provisions for replacement housing are made. While the City of Avalon falls entirely within the
coastal zone, demolition activities in the City are not subject to this coastal housing requirement
due to the several exceptions offered by State law. Specifically:
     ·   Limited Remaining Vacant Residential Land: This requirement does not apply to the
         demolition or conversion of residential structures within the coastal area of a
         jurisdiction containing less than 50 acres of vacant, privately owned land available for

         effective buildable areas are usually just a fraction of the sites.)
     ·   Single-Family, Duplex, Triplex Units Exempted: This requirement does not apply to the
         demolition or conversion of a residential structure that contains fewer than three units.
         Given the City’s built out character, most housing construction activities have been
         small infill projects. If demolition was involved, it was primarily the removal of single-
         family units to make room for the reconstruction of equal or increased number of units.
         Removal of single-family units is not subject to the coastal housing requirements. Since
         1982, only one 11-unit multi-family housing structure was removed. The City purchased
         the property to make room for additional housing.
     ·   Construction of Coastal-Dependent Uses Exempted: The demolition or conversion of
         residential structures for purposes of providing coastal-dependent uses such as visitor-
         serving commercial, hotels, recreation facilities, boating or harbor facilities are
         exempted from the coast housing requirement. The Company is the primary land
         owner/developer on the island and much of its development is geared toward visitor-
         serving uses.
In 1996, the City purchased and demolished the deteriorating 22-unit Ida Court apartments.
Given the building’s condition, the tenants were all low and moderate incomes. The City is not
subject to the coastal housing replacement requirement due to limited vacant residential land
remaining in the community (see exemptions listed above). However, in 2002, the City assisted
in the construction of the 24-unit Bird Park, which offers affordable housing for 24 very low
income families. Since 1982, 11 scattered homes have been demolished but these have all
been rebuilt. Single-family homes in Avalon are not typically affordable to lower and moderate
income households. Demolition of scattered single-family homes is not subject to the
replacement requirement.
Furthermore major housing construction activities in the City since 1982 have been affordable
housing developments. Combined Eucalyptus Garden Apartments, Tremont Apartments,
Beacon Hill Senior Apartments, and Bird Park Apartments offer 127 units affordable to very low
and low income households. Overall, the City has a net gain of 116 affordable housing units.

C.4      HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Providing dignified and adequate housing to meet the community’s housing needs is an
important goal of the City of Avalon. Due to the employment opportunities in Avalon, the
seasonal nature of some jobs, and associated wages, housing must be affordable to persons
earning a range of income levels. This section describes the various market, governmental, and
environmental constraints on the development and improvement of housing that meets the
needs of all economic segments of the Avalon community.
Market Constraints
Market constraints significantly affect the cost of housing in Avalon, and can pose barriers to
housing production and affordability. These include the availability of land for residential
development, the demand for housing, financing and lending, construction costs, as well as the
fees charged to residential development. The following highlights the primary market factors
that affect the production of housing in Avalon.
Economic Factors
Market forces on the economy and the trickle down effects on the construction industry can act
as a barrier to housing construction and especially to affordable housing construction.
California’s housing market peaked in the summer of 2005 when a dramatic increase in the
State’s housing supply was coupled with low interest rates. The period between 2006 and 2010,
however, reflects a time of significant change as the lending market broke down and home
prices saw significant decreases. The collapse of the housing market let to a recession that is
slow in recovery. Many households face unemployment/under-employment and foreclosures.
Land and Construction Costs
As an island community, land suitable for residential development is relatively scarce. Land
ownership plays an important factor in the availability of land for future residential
development. Santa Catalina Island Conservancy (SCIC) owns the vast majority of land as a
natural preserve. The second major land owner, Santa Catalina Island Company (the Company),
owns approximately 11 percent of the Island’s total acreage, including more than 80 percent of
the developable land in and around Avalon. The Company also owns the majority of commercial
properties within Avalon.
In the past, the Company has leased land to private developers to build housing, particularly
condominium projects (e.g. Sol Vista, Fairview Terrace, and Hamilton Cove). In recent years,
however, the Company has gradually sold the underlying lots to owners of these condominium
developments. Single-family residences in Avalon are generally under private ownership.
Much of the vacant land owned by the Company is slated for resort/visitor-serving development
and housing for its employees. The Company is subject to the City’s inclusionary housing
program that requires new hotel/motel/resort development provides new affordable housing
                                                                                   CITY of AVALON
                                                C-40

CITY OF AVALON
2030 GENERAL PLAN/ LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
                                            C.       HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
for at least 50 percent of the number of peak season employees projected to be employed by
the development. As such, the Company reserves land under its ownership for employee
housing.
Remaining developable land that is not owned by the Company is scarce. Available land in or
near the downtown is already developed. The few remaining vacant parcels are situated on
hillsides. Because of topographical constraints, significant grading costs, cost of development is
substantial. Lack of land represents a constraint to non-Company initiated housing
development – housing for non-Company employees. In December 2010, according to available
listings on www.realtor.com, vacant land in the City is currently selling for between $100 and
$300 per square foot.
Housing construction costs are much higher on the Island because building materials must be
shipped in. When demolition is involved, the costs escalate because construction debris must
also be shipped off the Island. Finally, labor costs are significantly higher on the Island, because
work crews must reside on the Island while construction is in process. For publicly-funded
projects, labor costs are even higher due to prevailing wage requirements. Information
provided by a local developer indicates that the cost of constructing a single-family residential
unit is approximately $250 per square foot. For multiple-family units, construction costs are
slightly lower as developers can usually benefit from economies of scale with discounts for
materials and diffusion of equipment mobilization costs. Density bonuses for senior and
affordable housing can enhance this per-unit cost reduction for multi-family developments. A
reduction in amenities and quality of building materials could result in lower costs and sale
prices; however, high quality design and sufficient tenant amenities are necessary to maintain
minimum health and safety standards.
Availability of Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. Under the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to disclose
information on the disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and race of the
applicants. This applies to all loan applications for home purchases, improvements and
refinancing, whether financed at market rate or with government assistance.
Table C-30 summarizes the disposition of loan applications submitted to financial institutions in
2009 for home purchase, refinance, and home improvement loans in Avalon. Included is
information on loan applications that were approved and originated, approved but not accepted
by the applicant, denied, withdrawn by the applicant, or incomplete.

Home Purchase Loans: In 2009, a total of 25 Avalon households applied for conventional loans
to purchase homes. The overall loan approval rate was 60 percent and 28 percent of
applications were denied. In comparison, 68 percent of conventional home loan applications
were approved in the Los Angeles/Long Beach/Glendale Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).
Only one home purchase application was submitted in Avalon through government-backed
loans (e.g. FHA, VA) in 2009; this applicant was approved. To be eligible for such loans, residents
must meet the established income standards, maximum home values, and other requirements.
For government-backed loans, the approval rate for the Los Angeles MSA was 69 percent.
Refinance Loans: The majority of loan applications submitted by Avalon residents in 2009 were
for home refinance loans (79 applications). Nearly one-half (49 percent) of these applications
were approved, while 37 percent were denied. In the Los Angeles MSA, 61 percent of the
refinancing applications were approved.
Home Improvement Loans: Only four Avalon households applied for a home improvement loan.
Half of these applicants (50 percent) were denied and only one application (25 percent) was
approved by lenders in 2009. Most home improvement loans are second loans and therefore
more difficult to qualify for due to high income-to-debt ratios. In the Los Angeles MSA, home
improvement loan applications had a higher approval rate (53 percent) than in the City of
Avalon.
To address potential private market lending constraints and expand homeownership and home
improvement opportunities, the City of Avalon offers a Residential Rehabilitation Program to
lower and moderate income households.
Foreclosures
Nationwide, the housing market peaked between 2000 and 2005. With low interest rates,
“creative” financing (e.g., zero down, interest only, adjustable loans), and predatory lending
practices (e.g. aggressive marketing, hidden fees, negative amortization), many households
purchased homes that were well beyond their financial means. Many were led to believe that
refinancing to lower interest rates would always be available option and home prices would
continue to rise. Many households were unprepared for the expiration of short-term fixed rates
and decline in sales prices. Suddenly faced with significantly inflated mortgage payments, and
                                                                                                 CITY of AVALON

mortgage loans that are larger than the worth of the homes, short sales and foreclosure become
the only options available to many households.
Statewide, the number of foreclosures in 2010 has declined substantially from the previous
year. During the third quarter of 2010, a total of 16,189 Notices of Default (NODs) were
recorded in Los Angeles County, a decrease of over 25 percent from the third quarter of 2009. In
December 2010, 15 homes in Avalon were listed as foreclosures. These homes were listed at
various stages of foreclosure (from pre-foreclosures to auctions) and ranged in price, with some
properties listed as high as $830,000. In July 2011, there were 12 homes listed in foreclosure
sales in Avalon, including six homes being auctioned; four homes that are bank-owned; two
homes in pre-foreclosure sales.
Governmental Constraints
Aside from market factors, housing affordability is also affected by factors in the public sector.
Local policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of housing and, in particular,
the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, fees
and exactions, permit processing procedures, among other issues may constrain the
maintenance, development and improvement of housing. This section discusses potential
governmental constraints in Avalon and efforts to address them.
Land Use Controls
The Land Use Element sets forth City policies for guiding local land use development. These
policies, together with existing zoning regulations, establish the amount and distribution of land
allocated for different uses. The City is in the process of a comprehensive update to its General
Plan.
General Plan Land Use Element: The City is in the process of updating its General Plan. The Land
Use Element provides for a range of land use designations that accommodate residential uses.
These land use designations are described in Table C-31. The General Plan update renamed the
Low/Moderate designation High Density Residential – Community Housing. The Commercial
designation is also split between Commercial and Special Commercial.
                                                                                    CITY of AVALON

Local Coastal Plan: As an island community, the entire City falls within the coastal zone and is
required to prepare a Local Coastal Program. As part of the General Plan update, the City is also
updating its Local Coast Program (originally adopted and certified by the Coastal Commission in
1981). The LCP consists of the City’s Land Use Element of the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance,
Local Coastal Plan, Use of Publicly Owned Land, Affordable Housing, Annual Growth Policy, and
Condominium Conversion Regulations. The City intends to obtain certification from the Coastal
Commission, allowing the City to issue coastal development permits and bypassing Coastal
Commission review of development projects.
Annual Growth Policy: Because the natural resources of Avalon have finite limits, which are not
easily defined and may change from time to time (as is the case with water availability), the City
limits construction activity in order to minimize significant impacts to the environment. The City
established an Annual Growth Policy in 1979 which prohibits the approval of any development
applications that propose the creation of additional housing units in November and December
of any calendar year. The final two months of the year are reserved for the City Council, in
                                                                                                  CITY of AVALON

conjunction with the Planning Commission, to review the growth permitted in the preceding ten
months and review the effects and demands of such development and any additional
development on the City's natural resources. After this period of review, the City Council will
determine, by resolution, the amount and type of growth the City will permit in the succeeding
year, as well as City priorities for growth. Given the limited housing construction in Avalon in
recent years and limited capacity for additional housing, this policy has not and is not expected
to constrain housing development in the City. The Growth Policy Resolution does not establish a
limit on the number of units that can be constructed, but instead identifies the types of projects
that will be permitted based on available resources. Recent (2011 and 2012) Growth Policy
Resolutions identify the following permitted types of development:
    ·    Projects involving existing commercial and residential structures that are to be repaired,
         replaced, or remodeled.
    ·    In-fill residential projects that create five or fewer units.
    ·    Residential projects of greater than five units if the project provides the required 20
         percent inclusionary housing.
    ·    Infrastructure improvements which are consistent with the City’s Capital Improvement
         Plan.
    ·    Projects that the Planning Commission determines to have no growth inducing effects.
These types are permitted new development generally cover the typical residential
development in the City. The key factor is availability of natural resources such as water.
Inclusionary Housing: The City’s inclusionary housing program, adopted as Chapter 11 of City’s
Zoning Ordinance, applies to residential developments with five or more units and commercial
development.
    ·    Any new residential development of five or more purchasable units shall make available
         inclusionary housing units equivalent to 20 percent of the units constructed in any
         residential housing project for the exclusive year-round use of low, moderate, and
         middle income families. The mix of income categories will be determined at the time
         the project is approved.
    ·    Any new residential development of five or more rental units may make available
         inclusionary housing units equivalent to 20 percent of the units constructed in any
         residential housing project for the exclusive year-round use of low, moderate, and
         middle income families, in exchange for a direct financial contribution or other form of
         assistance. The mix of income categories will be determined at the time the project is

The inclusionary housing ordinance allows for the payment of an in-lieu fee when the number of
purchasable inclusionary units required is less than five. All units in an apartment development
are required to be made available to members of the community for a period of not less than
one month. No condominium conversions would be allowed and affordability must be
maintained for at least 35 years.
The inclusionary housing ordinance offers flexibility in the income distribution of the
inclusionary units based on project feasibility. Furthermore, the majority of the remaining
developable land is owned by the Company and slated for resort/visitor-serving uses and
employee housing. Therefore, these inclusionary housing requirements have not been the
constraining factors to housing development in Avalon.
Density Bonus: State law requires the provision of certain incentives for residential
development projects that set aside a certain portion of total units to be affordable to lower and
moderate income households. Currently, the City’s density bonus ordinance stimulates market-
rate and affordable housing as follows:
     ·   Market-Rate Density Bonus Project: Under the ordinance, any developer who can build
         more units on a lot than allowed for under the underlying zoning district while meeting
         all other development standards may obtain a use permit from the Planning
         Commission to build such units. Moreover, the units must remain as non-transient
         rental housing for at least 15 years.
     ·   Affordable Density Bonus Project: Any developer who can build more units on a lot
         than allowed for under the underlying zoning district while meeting all other
         development standards, may obtain a use permit from the Planning Commission and a
         water allocation from the City Council to build affordable units for low and moderate
         income households. The additional density may not exceed the allowed densities by
         either the greater of 50 percent or one unit per legally established parcel. Moreover,
         the bonus units must remain as non-transient rental housing for low and moderate
         income households for at least 15 years.
Current state law requires jurisdictions to provide density bonuses and development incentives
(or regulatory concessions) to all developers who propose to construct affordable housing on a
sliding scale, where the amount of density bonus and number of incentives vary according to the
amount of affordable housing units provided. The existing Avalon density bonus provisions are
not consistent with the State density bonus law. While the affordability requirements are more
flexible under the City ordinance than under State law, the City does not currently make
provisions for development incentives or regulatory concessions as required by State law. The
Housing Plan of this Housing Element includes a program to amend the City’s density bonus
provisions to ensure compliance with State law.
                                                                                    CITY of AVALON

Condominium Conversion: In certain communities, the conversion of apartments to
condominiums can be one way to increase homeownership opportunities for families.
However, since most condominiums in Avalon are not affordable to low and moderate income
households, condominium conversion represents a potential net loss of affordable units.
Therefore, Avalon has enacted a condominium conversion ordinance to preserve affordable
rental housing.
Condominium conversions require a conditional use permit prior to conversion. Prior to
approval, the Planning Commission must make findings that the conversion will not adversely
affect the supply of rental housing, especially low and moderate income housing in the City.
Relevant factors that the Commission may consider include:
    ·    Citywide vacancy rate and the vacancy rate for low and moderate income units;
    ·    Number of units being removed from the rental market by the proposed conversion;
    ·    Number, quality, and location of alternative housing available to existing tenants;
    ·    Cumulative effect of proposed conversion upon the availability of affordable housing;
         and
    ·    Effect of the proposed conversion, if any, upon the City’s tourist industry.
Should a conversion project be approved, the property owner must set aside 20 percent of the
units as affordable to low and moderate income households. Moreover, the property owner
must give tenants at least six months notice of termination of tenancy for a conversion, must
grant tenants first right of refusal for a specified period, providing proper noticing, and in some
cases provide a specified amount of relocation assistance. According to City staff, condominium
conversions are rare, especially in light of the current housing market conditions.
Residential Development Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily
through the Zoning Ordinance. The City of Avalon’s development patterns well precede its
formal incorporation in 1913. Originally founded as a tourist community, Avalon’s land use
patterns have been impacted by prior subdividers, topography, and unique constraints
associated with an island community. Its residential areas are characterized by small lots
averaging less than 1,500 square feet and occupied by vacation cottages adjacent to area
comprised originally of vacation tents. However, as development pressures increased, the City
adopted a Zoning Ordinance in 1964.
Development standards specific to each zone district are designed to protect and promote the
health, safety, and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the General
Plan. These standards also serve to preserve the character and integrity of existing
neighborhoods. Specific residential development standards are summarized in Table C-32.
Generally, development standards can limit the number of units that may be constructed on a
particular piece of property. These include density, minimum lot and unit sizes, height, and
open space requirements. Limiting the number of units that can be constructed will increase
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

  the per-unit land costs and can, all other factors being equal, result in higher development costs
  that may impact housing affordability.
  Because of historical development patterns in Avalon and present zoning regulations, most of
  the lots are now substandard in size and are considered nonconforming. Interviews with local
  developers indicated that in the past, the most difficult standard was the one-space parking
  standard. The Zoning Ordinance is unclear as to the size requirement for the parking space
  required. In the past, the City Council had been requiring a standard conventional parking space
  (eight feet by 17 feet) per unit. But with the approval of a variance, autoette (such as golf carts)
  parking spaces (six feet by ten feet) could be used as a substitute. In response to comments
  from developers, the City’s policy has changed to require one autoette space per unit in the
  downtown area. As part of the City’s Zoning Ordinance amendment to implement the updated
  General Plan, the City will clarify the parking requirements. Specifically, the City will establish
  the autoette as the minimum parking requirement citywide, thereby removing the need to
  process a variance.

Provision for a Variety of Housing Types
Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made
available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the
development of a variety of housing types for all economic segments of the population. This
includes single-family homes, multi-family housing, second units, mobile homes, and residential
care facilities. Table C-33 below summarizes the various housing types permitted within the
City’s zoning districts.

Single-Family Dwellings: A “single-family dwelling” is defined in the Zoning Ordinance as a
building designed or used exclusively for occupancy by one family and containing one dwelling
unit. Detached single-family dwellings are permitted in the LD-R, MD-R, and HD-R zones and
conditionally permitted in the SC zone. Attached single-family dwellings are permitted in the HD
zone and conditionally permitted in the LD-R, MD-R, and SC zones.
Secondary Residential Unit: In 2002, the State Legislature amended the Government Code,
requiring jurisdictions to allow by right accessory dwelling units in all residential district allowing
single-family residences. Communities can provide for appropriate development and design
guidelines of the accessory dwelling units, provided local regulations are not more stringent
than or infringe upon guidelines set forth in Section 65915 of the Government Code. The Avalon
Zoning Ordinance currently allows accessory detached units as a conditionally permitted use in
the LD-R, MD-R, and HD-R zones. The density bonus provisions also allow anyone who can add
more units to a lot to do so via a conditional use permit. However, local developers indicated
that while accessory units are a possibility in Avalon, the generally small lots would make the
building of additional units difficult. The Avalon Zoning Ordinance will be amended to address
the provision of accessory dwelling units pursuant to State law.
Multiple-Family Housing: According to the State Department of Finance, multiple-family
housing makes up approximately 48 percent of the 2010 housing stock in Avalon (Table C-21).
                                                                                         CITY of AVALON

C.        HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
Multiple-family housing is permitted within the HD-R and HD-R-CH zone districts. Conditional
use permits are required for the construction of multiple-family housing in the SC zone district.
Manufactured and Mobile Homes: Manufactured housing and mobile homes can be an
affordable housing option for low and moderate income households. According to the National
Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Act of 1974, a mobile home built after June 15,
1976 and built on a permanent foundation may be located in any residential zone where a
conventional single-family detached dwelling is permitted, subject to the same restrictions on
density and to the same property development regulations. In compliance with State law,
manufactured housing in Avalon is allowed on lots zoned for single-family residences, subject to
the same processes or requirements imposed on a conventional single-family home. Mobile
home parks are also allowed in the HD-R-CH zone.
Congregate Housing (Condominiums): “Congregate housing” is defined in the Zoning Ordinance
as a residential condominium, community apartment house, or stock cooperative project.
Congregate housing is conditionally permitted in the LD-R, MD-R, HD-R, and SC zones.
Mixed-Use Residential: Mixed use projects combine both non-residential and residential uses
on the same site. These developments can help reduce the effects of housing cost burden by
increasing density and offering opportunities for reduced vehicular trips by walking, bicycling or
taking public transportation. In Avalon, mixed-use development (residential above ground floor
retail) is currently conditionally permitted in the C (Commercial) zone. As part of the General
Plan update, the City has also included residential uses and mixed-use development as
conditionally permitted uses in the SC (Special Commercial) zone.
Residential Care Facilities: Residential care facilities licensed or supervised by a Federal, State,
or local health/welfare agency provide 24-hour non-medical care of unrelated persons who are
handicapped and in need of personal services, supervision, or assistance essential for sustaining
the activities of daily living or for the protection of the individual in a family-like environment.
Currently, no licensed residential care facilities are located in Avalon.
The Community Care Facilities Act (California Health and Safety Code) and Lanterman Disability
Services Act (California Welfare and Institution Code) require that State-licensed residential care
facilities serving six or fewer persons (including foster care) be treated as a regular residential
use and therefore permitted by right in all residential zones allowing residential uses. These
facilities cannot be subject to more stringent development standards, fees, or other standards
than the same type of housing single-family homes in the same district.
Although land prices and housing prices will likely preclude the feasibility of building a
residential care facility or converting a home to such a facility in Avalon, the City will amend the
Zoning Ordinance to permit residential care facilities for six or fewer persons by right where
residential uses are permitted. Residential care facilities serving seven or more clients will be
conditionally permitted in the HD/flats, C, and SC zones.
                                                                                         CITY of AVALON

Emergency Shelters: Senate Bill 2, enacted in October 2007, requires local governments to
identify one or more zoning categories that allow emergency shelters without discretionary
review. The statute permits the City to apply limited conditions to the approval of ministerial
permits for emergency shelters. The identified zone must have sufficient capacity to
accommodate at least one year-round shelter.
Currently, the City of Avalon’s Zoning Ordinance does not explicitly address emergency shelters.
The City will amend its Zoning Ordinance within one year of adoption of the Housing Element to
permit homeless shelters by right, without discretionary review, within the Commercial (C) and
Special Commercial (SC) zones, consistent with State law. The island is compact and most areas
are accessible by foot or bicycle. Overall, close to 27 acres of land in the City are zoned C or SC.
These zones are located at the core of the City with easy access to services. Capacity exists in
these zones for intensification (such as adding second story to single-story buildings or adding
additional buildings on surface parking areas). These zones will be more than able to
accommodate at least one emergency shelter.
The Zoning Ordinance amendment will also include specific conditions under which emergency
shelters may be permitted. The conditions will relate strictly to operation and maintenance of
the facility and will not be more stringent that like uses in the same zone. By providing clarity in
the Zoning Ordinance, the City can facilitate the development of such facilities.
Transitional and Supportive Housing: Under Housing Element law, transitional housing is defined
as buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under program
requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to
another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be
no less than six months (California Health and Safety Code Section 50675.2). Residents of
transitional housing are usually connected to supportive services designed to assist the
homeless in achieving greater economic independence and a permanent, stable living situation.
Transitional housing is a type of housing used to facilitate the movement of homeless individuals
and families to permanent housing. Transitional housing can take several forms, including group
quarters with beds, single-family homes, and multiple-family apartments and typically offers
case management and support services to return people to independent living (usually between
six and 24 months).
Supportive housing links the provision of housing and social services for the homeless, people
with disabilities, and a variety of other special needs populations. Under Housing Element law,
supportive housing is defined as housing with no limit on length of stay that is occupied by a
target population, and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive
housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his
or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community (California Health and Safety
Code 50675.14 (b)).
                                                                                      CITY of AVALON

The target population for supportive housing includes adults with low incomes having one or
more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health
conditions, or individuals eligible for services provided under the Lanterman Developmental
Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5, commencing with Section 4500, of the Welfare and
Institutions Code) and may, among other populations, include families with children, elderly
persons, young adults aging out of the foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional
settings, veterans, or homeless people (California Health and Safety Code 53260 (d)).
Currently, the Avalon Zoning Ordinance does not explicitly address transitional or supportive
housing. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to address the provision of transitional and
supportive housing. Transitional and supportive housing meeting the State definitions set forth
in Health and Safety Code Sections 50801(i) and 50675.14(a)(B)(2), respectively, would be
considered as regular housing and be permitted in zones where regular housing is permitted
and in the same manner as similar uses in the same zones.
Single Room Occupancy Units (SROs): SRO units are one-room units intended for occupancy by
a single individual. They are distinct from a studio or efficiency unit, in that a studio is a one-
room unit that must contain a kitchen and bathroom. Although SRO units are not required to
have a kitchen or bathroom, many SROs have one or the other and could be equivalent to an
efficiency unit. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance within one year of the adoption of the
Housing Element to facilitate the provision of SROs, consistent with AB 2634 (Housing for
Extremely Low Income Households) enacted in 2007. SROs will be permitted with a Conditional
Use Permit (CUP) in the HD/flats-R-CH zone. Findings will be the same as those required for all
land uses requiring a CUP.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities: Both the federal Fair Housing Amendment Act (FHAA) and
the California Fair Employment and Housing Act direct local governments to make reasonable
accommodations (i.e. modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use
regulations when such accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal
opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The City conducted an analysis of the zoning
ordinance, permitting procedures, development standards, and building codes to identify
potential constraints for housing for persons with disabilities. The City’s policies and regulations
regarding housing for persons with disabilities are described below.
     ·   Land Use Controls: Under State Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (aka
         Lanterman Act), small licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons must be
         treated as regular residential uses and permitted by right in all residential districts. State
         licensed residential care facilities serving six or fewer clients are not addressed in the
         Zoning Ordinance. The City will amend its Zoning Ordinance, within one year of
         adoption of the Housing Element, to permit small residential care facilities serving six or
         fewer persons (including adult and senior residential facilities, as well as small family
         homes) in all residential zones. Large residential care facilities serving more than six
         persons will be conditionally permitted in the HD/flats, C, and SC zones.
                                                                                       CITY of AVALON

                                                      C.          HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
           Currently, the Avalon Zoning Ordinance has no provisions for transition, supportive, or
           SRO housing – housing options that are appropriate for persons with disabilities. The
           Zoning Ordinance will be amended to address these provisions.
      ·    Definition of Family: Local governments may restrict access to housing for households
           failing to qualify as a “family” by the definition specified in the Zoning Ordinance.
           Specifically, a restrictive definition of “family” that limits the number of and
           differentiates between related and unrelated individuals living together may illegally
           limit the development and siting of group homes for persons with disabilities, but not
           for housing families that are similarly sized or situated.7 The City of Avalon Zoning
           Ordinance defines a “family” as “any number of persons living together in a room or
           rooms comprising a single dwelling unit and related by blood, marriage or adoption, or
           bearing the generic character of a family unit as a relatively permanent single
           household, including servants and other live-in employees, who reside therein as
           though members of the family. Any group of persons not related by blood, marriage or
           adoption but inhabiting a dwelling unit, shall for the purpose of this chapter be
           considered to constitute one family if a bona fide single household, including servants
           and other live-in employees, contained in such group.” This definition is inclusive and
           therefore does not serve to constrain housing for persons with disabilities.
      ·    Building Codes: The City adopts the Los Angeles County Code and Uniform Building
           Code, and amendments thereafter, as the City of Avalon Building Code. The City also
           adopts the Uniform Housing Code as the City’s Housing Code.
           No unique restrictions are in place that would constrain the development of housing for
           persons with disabilities. Government Code Section 12955.1 requires that 10 percent of
           the total dwelling units in multi-family buildings without elevators consisting of three or
           more rental units or four or more condominium units subject to the following building
           standards for persons with disabilities:
           o    The primary entry to the dwelling unit shall be on an accessible route unless
                exempted by site impracticality tests.
           o    At least one powder room or bathroom shall be located on the primary entry level
                served by an accessible route.
7
  California court cases (City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson, 1980 and City of Chula Vista v. Pagard, 1981, etc.) have
ruled an ordinance as invalid if it defines a “family” as (a) an individual; (b) two or more persons related by blood,
marriage, or adoption; or (c) a group of not more than a specific number of unrelated persons as a single
housekeeping unit. These cases have explained that defining a family in a manner that distinguishes between blood-
related and non-blood related individuals does not serve any legitimate or useful objective or purpose recognized
under the zoning and land use planning powers of a municipality, and therefore violates rights of privacy under the
California Constitution.
                                                                                                        CITY of AVALON
                                                             C-53

CITY OF AVALON
2030 GENERAL PLAN/ LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
C.       HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
         o    All rooms or spaces located on the primary entry level shall be served by an
              accessible route. Rooms and spaces located on the primary entry level and subject
              to this chapter may include but are not limited to kitchens, powder rooms,
              bathrooms, living rooms, bedrooms, or hallways.
         o    Common use areas shall be accessible.
         o    If common tenant parking is provided, accessible parking spaces is required.
         The City does not require any additional visitability standards in excess of those required
         in the building code.
    ·    Reasonable Accommodation: Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair
         Employment and Housing Act direct local governments to make reasonable
         accommodations (i.e. modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land
         use regulations when such accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled
         persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For example, it may be
         reasonable to accommodate requests from persons with disabilities to waive a setback
         requirement, lot coverage requirement, or other standard of the Zoning Ordinance to
         ensure that homes are accessible for the mobility impaired. Whether a particular
         modification is reasonable depends on the circumstances.
         The City currently has no established process in place. The City is densely built out and
         because of its topography, extensive accessibility improvements to existing individual
         homes are difficult to accomplish, if not impossible. Such requests are rare and are
         typically handled on a case-by-case basis. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to
         implement a reasonable accommodation procedure to address reasonable
         accommodation requests.
    ·    Permits and Fees: As there is no established procedure in place, no specific permits or
         fees are required for reasonable accommodation requests.
Development and Planning Fees
Residential developers are subject to a variety of fees and exactions to process permits and
provide necessary services and facilities as allowed by State law. In general, these development
fees can be a constraint to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing
because the additional cost borne by developers contributes to overall increased housing unit
cost. However, the fees are necessary to maintain adequate planning services and other public
services and facilities in the City. The City’s permit processing and development impact fee
schedule for residential development are displayed in Table C-34.
Planning fees for a typical multi-family project total approximately $3,000 per unit. For a typical
single-family residential project, developers can expect planning fees to total approximately
$2,000 per unit. These fees are minimal compared to the overall development costs in Avalon.
                                                                                    CITY of AVALON

The City does not charge any development impact fees; however, the Long Beach Unified School
District charges between $3 and $5 per square foot of development fees. School fees are
established by State law and do not constrain housing development in Avalon as they are not
unique to Avalon.

On- and Off-Site Improvements
The City of Avalon is densely developed, with approximately 2,300 housing units and numerous
businesses (hotels, restaurants, and retails) occupying only two square miles of land. The City’s
Zoning Ordinance has not established specific off-site improvement requirements. Only limited
infill and redevelopment opportunities exist for individual property owners; on- and off-site
improvements required would be limited as sidewalks, curbs and gutters, and water/sewer
connections are most likely already in place. The major vacant and underutilized sites in the City
of Avalon are almost all owned by the Company. In its Development Master Plan, the Company
has identified specific on- and off-site requirements for each specific site. The Company will be
responsible for making such improvements.
Building Codes and Enforcement
In addition to land use controls, local building codes also affect the cost of housing. The City
currently implements the 2010 California Building Codes, which are based on the International
Building Codes. The California Building Codes establish standards and requires inspections at
various stages of construction to ensure code compliance and minimum health and safety
standards. Although these standards may increase housing production costs, these standards
are mandated by the State of California and are intended to provide structurally sound, safe,
and energy-efficient housing. No local amendments were made to the 2010 Building Codes.
Local Permits and Processing Times
The processing time needed to obtain development permits and required approvals is
commonly cited by the development community as a prime contributor to the high cost of
housing. Depending on the magnitude and complexity of the development proposal, the time
that elapses from application submittal to project approval may vary considerably. Factors that
can affect the length of development review on a proposed project include: completeness of the
development application submittal; responsiveness of developers to staff comments and
requests for information; and projects that are not exempt from the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA), require rezoning or general plan amendment, or are subject to a public
hearing before the Planning Commission or City Council.
Certainty and consistency in permit processing procedures and reasonable processing times is
important to ensure that the development review/approval process does not discourage
developers of housing or add excessive costs (including carrying costs on property) that would
make the project economically infeasible. The City is committed to maintaining comparatively
short processing times. The City’s development permit requirements are summarized in Table
C-35.

   Site Plan Review: The purpose of a site plan review is to determine and control the physical
   layout, design or use of a lot or parcel of land, buildings or structures. Site plans are reviewed by
   City staff for conformance with the Zoning Ordinance and require a hearing before the Planning
   Commission. The following characteristics are taken into account when considering site plan
   approval:
        ·    Every use, development of land and application of development standards shall take
             place in compliance with all applicable provisions of this title.
        ·    Every use, development of land and application of development standards shall be
             considered on the basis of the suitability of the site for the particular use or
             development in-tended, and the total development, including the application of
             prescribed development standards, shall be so arranged as to avoid traffic congestion,
             insure the protection of public health, safety and general welfare, prevent adverse
             effects on neighboring property and shall be in general accord with all elements of the
             General Plan.
        ·    Every use, development of land, application of development standards shall be
             considered on the basis of suitable and functional development design, but is not
             intended that such approval be interpreted to require a particular style or type of
             architecture.

These considerations are primarily related to site layout issues. City staff works with the
application to address City concerns. Any decision made by the Planning Commission can be
appealed before the City Council.
Conditional Use Permit: Certain residential uses require the approval of a Conditional Use
Permit (CUP). The purpose of the CUP is to ensure that a particular use will not jeopardize,
adversely affect, endanger or otherwise constitute a menace to the public health, safety or
general welfare, or be materially detrimental to the property of other persons located in the
vicinity of such use. Applications for a CUP require a public hearing before the Planning
Commission. Residents must be notified of the public hearing at least 10 days prior to the date
of the hearing. Approval of a CUP is based on the following findings:
     ·   The proposed conditional use shall conform with and carry out the certified Land Use
         Plan for the area.
     ·   The nature, condition, and development of adjacent uses, buildings and structures shall
         be considered and no proposed conditional use shall be permitted where such use will
         adversely affect or be materially detrimental to said adjacent uses, buildings and
         structures.
     ·   The site for a proposed conditional use shall be adequate in size and shape to
         accommodate the yards, walls, fences, parking and loading facilities, landscaping and
         other development features prescribed in this chapter or as required as a condition in
         order to integrate said use with the uses in the neighborhood.
     ·   The site for a proposed conditional use shall be served by highways and streets
         adequate in width and improved as necessary to carry the kind and quantity of traffic
         such use would generate.
     ·   The proposed conditional use shall be consistent with and carry out the purpose and
         intent of the underlying zone.
In recommending the approval of a CUP, the Planning Commission can also impose a variety of
conditions that are deemed necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
Such conditions may include:
     ·   Special yards, open spaces and buffer areas.
     ·   Fences and walls.
     ·   Parking facilities, including vehicular ingress and egress and the surfacing of parking area
         and driveways to specified standards.
     ·   Street and highway dedications and improvements including sidewalks, curbs and
         gutters.
     ·   Water supply and fire protection.
     ·   Landscaping and maintenance of ground.
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

         on or before a specified date.
     ·   A detailed site plan.
     ·   Such other conditions as will make possible the development of the proposed
         conditional use in an orderly and efficient manner and in general accord with all
         elements of the General Plan and the intent and purpose of this chapter.
Conditions for approval primarily relate to consistency with the General Plan and the underlying
zoning requirements. These requirements are objective and primarily performance based.
Decisions made by the Planning Commission on an application for a CUP can be appealed before
the City Council.
Coastal Development Permit: Coastal Development Procedures are established to in-sure that
all public and private development in the City of Avalon is consistent with the City's certified
Local Coastal Program. Coastal development permits are required for any development on
tidelands or submerged lands, or public trust lands which require a permit from the Coastal
Commission. The issuance of a coastal development permit requires a public hearing.
Avalon has obtained authority from the Coastal Commission to locally issue Coastal
Development Permits for most areas within the City, significantly reducing the time associated
with multiple hearings before the Coastal Commission. As a result, residential projects typically
can receive all the necessary approvals within three months. However, as part of the General
Plan update, the City will be amending its Local Coastal Program and obtain authority for issuing
Coastal Development Permits for the annexed Pebbly Beach area.
State Tax Policies and Regulations
Proposition 13: Proposition 13 is a voter initiative that limits increases in property taxes except
when there is a transfer of ownership. This initiative may have increased the cost of housing by
forcing local governments to pass on more of the costs of housing development to new
homeowners.
Federal and State Environmental Protection Regulations: Federal and State regulations require
environmental review of proposed discretionary projects (e.g., subdivision maps, use permits,
etc.). Costs, resulting from fees charged by local government and private consultants needed to
complete the environmental analysis and from delays caused by the mandated public review
periods, are also added to the cost of housing and passed on to the consumer. However, the
presence of these regulations helps preserve the environment and ensure environmental quality
for Avalon residents.

2030 GENERAL PLAN/ LOCAL COASTAL PLAN
C.        HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
As a coastal community, Avalon has a variety of environmental and infrastructure issues which
affect the feasibility of developing new housing. These include natural features off the
community’s landscape as well as the capacity to provide water and wastewater treatment. The
following describes the most pertinent constraints to housing development.
Environmental Constraints
As an island community comprised primarily of hilly areas, Avalon is subject to variety of
environmental constraints. Geologic hazards such as the potential of flooding, earthquakes, and
landslides in the hilly areas warrant attention to sensitive design and construction standards,
adding to the costs of construction. Furthermore, approximately 40 percent of the Canyon floor
is subject to flooding in the event of a “100-year” storm.
The quality of life offered by Avalon is the primary attraction to many residents. However, the
compactness of this tiny community also amplifies the air, water, and noise impacts associated
with increased population. An excessive population of vehicles has caused congestion on the
City’s narrow streets, and noise and air pollution.
Viewsheds, coastline access, open space, and unique
recreational opportunities are among Avalon’s
special natural attributes. Development must
respect these resources and seek to preserve the
environmental quality of this community. Building
masses and height limits must ensure that these
qualities are preserved and equal access to these
amenities is afforded.
Wastewater Treatment
Avalon’s sewer and storm water facilities capacities are temporarily interrelated when initial
flows of storm water are diverted to the sewer system and Avalon Wastewater Treatment
Facility (AWTF). Treating storm water at AWTF maintains Avalon Harbor water quality during
storm events. Low-flow storm water system operations divert 9,600 gallons of initial storm
water to AWTF during a storm event. The Low-flow system has up to 230,400 gallons per day of
diversion capacity.
The sewer system’s actual engineered capacity and current capacity utilization is not known;
however, basic estimates indicate the main 12-inch sewer line at Crescent Avenue and flowing
to AWTF maybe approaching capacity. Avalon does not have a sewer master plan. The City has
and is making continual repairs and improvements to the sewer system to correspond to the
capacity of the AWTF. When opportunities exist, such as the recent upgrade of the Catherine
Lift Station, facilities are designed to provide contingent capacity and potentially address
anticipated storm water and future development capacity requirements. Remaining capacity of
the sewer and storm water systems, absent master plans, are analyzed during the development
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

review and approval process to assure new development provides acceptable sewer and storm
water solutions.
Water Availability
Water Resources: Water availability is perhaps the most critical issue limiting residential and
commercial development. Fresh water for drinking is supplied by Southern California Edison
and saltwater is used for sanitary purposes and fire protection. Avalon has a limited alluvial
groundwater supply and thus obtains most of its present needs through local reservoirs.
Catalina Island and Avalon have a safe yield allocation of 600 acre-feet per year (af/yr) of fresh
water from two sources. The primary source is groundwater that is pumped and stored in
reservoirs for distribution. The secondary source is desalinization of saltwater, and is primarily
used for water allocations for new development. Groundwater resources are less expensive but
are limited to 515 af/yr to maintain the resource. Desalination’s current safe yield allocation is
85 af/yr, but can be expanded by an additional 139 af/yr to a total of 224 af/yr if approved for
allocation. However, desalinization is expensive.
Avalon's current average yearly freshwater demand is 477 af/yr. Avalon and the balance of
Catalina Island have a current average yearly freshwater demand of 505 af/yr. The 505 af/yr of
current demand is nearly equivalent to the 515 af/yr of annual safe-yield groundwater
resources, and 95 af/yr less than current freshwater allocation capacity. The 95 af/yr of excess
freshwater allocation is approximately 19 percent of current demand. When full, groundwater
storage capacity equals approximately two years of current demand, to cover extended
droughts or temporary disruptions to groundwater resources.
In assessing the availability of water for future development, a potential increase of 565
permanent dwellings/rooms and 352 visitor dwellings/rooms was assumed. This level of
potential development would result in a significant potential increase in freshwater demand of
an estimated 234 - 241 af/yr, or a 39 to 42 percent increase of the current freshwater allocation
capacity. If approved as safe-yield allocation capacity, the potential operational capacity of the
current desalinization facility could supply up to 138 af/yr of additional freshwater. However,
there would still be a shortfall of 95-112 af/yr of freshwater demand from potential future
development and day-visitor growth that would require creation of new additional freshwater
supply to add to the safe-yield allocation capacity.
The significant demand for additional freshwater from desalinizatian could potentially provide
improved cost structure for desalinization. However, desalinization requires energy and current
energy costs in Avalon are high, and additional desalinization capacity may require additional
storage capacity. The feasibility of additional freshwater conservation approaches could be
explored such as reclaimed water capacity to provide water suitable for landscaping or
groundwater aquifer enhancement, or composting toilets in areas not served by saltwater, etc.
Water Rationing and Impact on Development: Because water is such a limited resource on
Catalina Island, the Southern California Edison has fresh water allocation policies which govern
                                                                                    CITY of AVALON

the issuance of new water permits and water rationing in periods of drought. The Islands
Freshwater Rationing Plan provides a four-phase water rationing plan, triggered by usable
surface water in the Middle Ranch Reservoir. Rationing commences when the Reservoir has less
than 600 acre feet of water supplies. In addition, residential developments requiring more than
10 acre feet annually of water are also required to develop their own fresh water resource plan.
In October 2003, the desalinization plant began operation. This new facility supplies water for
sanitary purposes, releasing water capacity for potable use and reducing the potential frequency
for the need to evoke the water rationing plan. Given the limited water supply, developers must
receive water allocations from the Southern California Edison (SCE) prior to receiving City
approval of new development. Recognizing the importance of affordable housing, SCE reserves
water supply allocation for low and moderate income housing. In January 2011, SCE lifted Phase
1 water rationing that had been in effect since December 2007. As of February 2011, the Middle
Ranch Reservoir was at 1,018 acre feet and the water level was one foot below the spillway.

C.5      HOUSING RESOURCES
The extent of housing needs in a community often exceeds the resources available. The City of
Avalon must pull together limited resources and use them efficiently in order to address the
current and projected housing needs of its residents. This section analyses the resources
available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing in Avalon. This
analysis includes an evaluation of the availability of land resources for future housing
development, the City’s ability to satisfy its share of the region’s future housing needs, the
financial resources available to support housing activities, and the administrative resources
available to assist in implementing the City’s housing programs and policies.
Future Housing Needs
Future housing need refers to the share of the regional housing need that has been allocated to
the City. The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) supplies a
regional housing goal number to the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG).
SCAG is then mandated to allocate the housing goal to city and county jurisdictions in the
region. In allocating the region’s future housing needs to jurisdictions, SCAG is required to take
the following factors into consideration pursuant to Section 65584 of the State Government
Code:
    ·    Market demand for housing;
    ·    Employment opportunities;
    ·    Availability of suitable sites and public facilities;
    ·    Commuting patterns;
    ·    Type and tenure of housing;
    ·    Loss of units in assisted housing developments;
    ·    Over-concentration of lower income households; and
    ·    Geological and topographical constraints.
The RHNA allocates to each city and county a “fair share” of the region’s projected housing
needs by household income group. The major goal of the RHNA is to assure a fair distribution of
housing among cities and counties within the Southern California region, so that every
community provides an opportunity for a mix of housing affordable to all economic segments.
The housing allocation targets are not building requirements, but goals for each community to
accommodate through appropriate planning policies and land use regulations. Allocation
targets are intended to assure that adequate sites and zoning are made available to address
anticipated housing demand during the planning period and that market forces are not inhibited
in addressing the housing needs of all economic segments of a community.
Regional Housing Needs Allocations

2021. For the 2008-2013 Housing Element planning period, the SCAG Regional Council adopted

        Notes:
        1. Pursuant to AB 2634, local jurisdictions are also required to project the housing needs of
            extremely low income households (0-30% AMI). In estimating the number of extremely low
            income households, a jurisdiction can use 50% of the very low income allocation or apportion the
            very low income figure based on Census data. As shown in Table C-12, extremely low income
            households constitute 41.7% of the very low income group. Therefore, the City’s RHNA of very
            low income units can be split between 41.7% extremely low and 58.3% very low income units.
        2. Total numbers may not add up due to rounding; however, the number of housing units required
            at each income level is fixed.
            Source: SCAG, 2008-2013 RHNA (2008) and 2014-2021 RHNA (2011)
Progress toward 2008-2013 RHNA
The 2008-2013 RHNA uses January 1, 2006 as the baseline for growth. Jurisdictions may count
toward the RHNA any new units built or issued certificates of occupancy since January 1, 2006.
Since January 2006, 26 housing units have been constructed at Bird Park Canyon. Of these 26
units, ten are inclusionary affordable units available for purchase, with two units set aside for
low income households and eight units set aside for moderate or middle income households.
The remaining 16 units (four one-bedroom units, six two-bedroom units, and six three-bedroom
units) were purchased by the Company to be used as employee housing. According to the
following rent information provided by the Company, these units are available to employees at
moderate income level:
     ·    One-Bedroom: $1,250 - $1,300
     ·    Two-Bedroom: $1,600 - $1,750
     ·    Three-Bedroom: $1,800 - $2,000
As previously shown in Table C-28 (Housing Affordability Matrix), these rent levels are
affordable to moderate income households (adjusted for household size based on unit size).
                                                                                                  CITY of AVALON

  Furthermore, the employee-tenants are given a $200 reduction in monthly rent if they use
  electric instead of gas-powered golf carts.
  After taking into account the units already completed, the City has a remaining RHNA of 122

  Availability of Sites for Housing
  This section describes the sites available for housing and Figure C-4 illustrates the location of the
  sites identified.
  Company-Owned Properties
  The Company is the primary land owner in Avalon. As part of this Housing Element update, the
  Company was consulted regarding development potential in the City. All sites identified below
  are all considered near-term projects by the Company.
  Bird Park Canyon: The Bird Park Canyon site (zoned Low
  Density Residential) is an approximately 10.8-acre area
  located west of Avalon Canyon Road. The Canyon is long
  and narrow with only 10 percent of the site has slopes
  less than 10 percent (six acres). The Canyon hillsides are
  generally 30 to 50 percent slope. The original Bird Park
  facility on this site was extensive but today, only a few
  structures remain. The Company has plan to put some
  housing on portions of this site, but the Bird Park
  gateway buildings, aviary, small cage, and winter house            24-unit Bird Park Apartments
  would be retained.
  The Company estimates that a total of 114 housing units can be accommodated on this site
  (including the 24-unit Bird Park Apartments and the recently completed 26 units at Bird Park
  Canyon). Specifically, in 2002, the Bird Park Apartments, consisting of 24 two-, three- and four-
  bedroom units for very low income families, was completed. In 2011, 26 additional units have
                                                                                              CITY of AVALON

been completed at Bird Park Canyon, including 10 inclusionary affordable housing units (two low
income and eight moderate/middle income units) and 16 Company employee housing units at
moderate income level. Therefore, the remaining Bird Park Canyon site has a capacity for an
additional 64 family units, according to the Company’s Development Master Plan.
Tremont Street: The Tremont Street area is currently developed with the 62-unit New Tremont
Apartments, the 37-unit Old Tremont Apartments, four duplex units, two triplex units, and two
four-plex bachelor units. The Company has a plan to put additional low and moderate income
employee housing on the currently vacant portions of the site. The Company estimates up to
165 units (96 one-bedroom and 69 two-bedroom units) can be accommodated at 40 units per
acre.
Tremont Street Apartments and Tremont Villas
Another piece of property owned by the Company at the Tremont location adjacent to the
Tremont Apartments is approximately 4.87 acres and largely undeveloped (located between
Tremont Street and Country Club Drive). As part of the General Plan update, this property will
be redesignated as High Density Residential at 40 units per acre.
                                                                                CITY of AVALON

Area Between Tremont Street and Country Club Drive
Atwater Block (Parker Court): Atwater Block is adjacent to the City core Island Plaza Block.
Currently, Atwater Block is developed with a variety of residential units, commercial uses, and
surface parking. Specifically, the Company owns the 27-unit Westbrook Apartments for
seasonal employees. Westbrook Apartments consists of 26 studio/single-room occupancy units
and one two-bedroom unit in single-story structures on four parcels totaling 5,750 square feet.
Parker Court is a dirt parking lot of approximately 15,000 square feet behind Westbrook
Apartments. One option is to construct housing units above a new parking structure; another
option is to relocate parking to other areas of the City. This site will support 20 units plus ten
density bonus units based on City policy for a total of 30 units. Therefore a net three units
would result on this property.
Country Club Canyon: This approximately 14-acre site is located north and adjacent to County
Club Road and is also bordered by East Whittley Avenue, Las Lomas Avenue and Camino Del
                                                                                     CITY of AVALON

Monte. The site is currently undeveloped. The site is zone Low Density and will support up to
140 units. The City anticipates 50 units to be feasible within the time frames of this Housing
Element.
Non-Company Properties
Metropole: This site is located next to the old City
Hall. This hilly site of approximately 7400 sq. ft. is
currently vacant. The site is designated for
Commercial (C) under the existing General Plan and
Special Commercial (SC) under the proposed General
Plan. Under the C designation, a mixed use
development is required to accommodate
residential units. However, the proposed SC
designation allows for stand-alone residential use.
This site can accommodate approximately ten units         Metropole Site
(with density bonus units) at a maximum density of 40 units per acre.
E. Whittley: This 5500-square foot site is located on E. Whittley, the nearest cross street is
Whittley. The site currently has a four-unit apartment building and a single-family cottage. The
site is zoned High Density and will support up to 10 units (a net increase of five units).

                                       Figure C-4: Selected Sites
Adequacy of Sites for Meeting RHNAs
State law requires that jurisdictions demonstrate in the Housing Element that the land inventory
is adequate to accommodate that jurisdiction’s share of the regional growth. The City is
committed to identifying sites at appropriate densities as required by law. The State, through
AB 2348, has established “default” density standards for local jurisdictions. State law assumes
that a density standard of 20 units per acre for suburban jurisdictions, such as Avalon, is
adequate to facilitate the production of housing affordable to lower income households.
However, Avalon is unique in that much of the developable land is owned by the Company.
Therefore, in estimating future residential development potential, the Company is consulted
and realistic capacity based on the Company’s master development plan is included in the
Housing Element.
Under the existing and proposed General Plan, Zoning, and the Company Development Master
Plan, the City has adequate sites that are designated at appropriate densities to accommodate
the remaining 2008-2013 RHNA of 122 units and the new 2014-2021 RHNA of 80 units (Table C-
40). When the proposed General Plan is adopted (adoption by the Summer of 2013), increased
capacity is available for residential development.

 Availability of Wastewater Treatment and Water Supply
 The City continues to make improvements to its wastewater treatment facilities and through the
 development review process, will ensure adequate treatment facilities are available to serve the
 new development.
 Water supply is an ongoing issue in Avalon. Based on a potential increase of 565 permanent
 dwellings/rooms and 352 visitor dwellings/rooms, the City estimate its water demand would
 exceed its current capacity by 39 to 42 percent. The City has a remaining RHNA of 122 units for
 the 2008-2013 planning period and a new RHNA of only 80 units for the 2014-2021 RHNA
 planning period. These two RHNA allocations are not cumulative. Given the current economic
 condition, no significant residential development is expected to occur in the near future. As the
 2008-2013 RHNA will expire on December 31, 2013, at the most the City is expected to
 accommodate 80 units through October 31, 2021. This level of residential development
 represents only 14 percent of the projected growth used to assess water supply and demand
 issues, and below the City’s current capacity. Therefore, adequate water should be available to
 accommodate the City’s RHNA during the two Housing Element cycles.
                                                                                       CITY of AVALON

Financial Resources
Housing Trust Fund
In 2004, the City Council approved the creation of a Housing Trust Fund reserved for the
production of affordable housing. Funding for the Housing Trust Fund comes from a number of
sources. Since 2004, the City Council has instituted a five percent Transient Occupancy Tax
(TOT) for affordable housing, which was deposited into the Housing Trust Fund. Locally
generated funding such as the TOT is not subject to the same State or federal income limits, and
therefore may be used more flexibly to address community housing needs. The City also
provides an in-lieu fee option for its inclusionary housing program. These fees also get
deposited into the Housing Trust Fund.
As of June 30, 2011, however, the Housing Trust Fund has a zero balance. This fund was funded
in the past by diverting a portion of the TOT. The fund was not funded in the 2010-2011 or the
2011-2012 budget.
Redevelopment Set-Aside Funds
Pursuant to AB1X26 and a subsequent California Superior Court decision on December 29, 2011,
the Avalon Community Improvement Agency (ACIA) was dissolved as of February 1, 2012. The
City has access to approximately $4 million of its housing set-aside funds. The City of Avalon has
established the Avalon Housing Authority as the Successor Agency to the former ACIA.
Proposition 1C Funds
Proposition 1C is a $2.85 billion housing bond passed by California voters in November 2006 as
part of the Governor’s Strategic Growth Plan to provide housing and infrastructure investment.
Programs funded with Proposition 1C funds include: 1) Multi-Family Housing; 2) Supportive
Housing; 3) Downpayment Assistance (through CalHFA); 4) CalHome; 5) Building Equity &
Growth in Neighborhoods (BEGIN); 6) Self-Help Construction Management; 7) Farmworker
Housing; 8) Migrant Farmworker Housing; 9) Emergency Housing Assistance; 10) Transit-
Oriented Development Implementation Program; 11) Infill Incentives Grant; 12) Affordable
Housing Innovation Fund; and 13) Housing-Related Parks. Today, most of these funds have
exhausted. However, some funding remains and the State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) periodically releases Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) to
invite applications for funding from local jurisdictions and housing developers/providers.
Housing Choice Voucher Assistance (Section 8)
The Housing Choice Voucher Program (formerly known as Section 8) is a federal program that
provides rental assistance to very low income persons in need of affordable housing. The
Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) offers a voucher that pays the difference between the
payment standard and what a tenant can afford to pay (e.g., 30 percent of their income). The
voucher allows a tenant to choose housing that may cost above the payment standard, with the
tenant paying the extra cost.

Administrative Resources
The following agencies and organizations can assist the City of Avalon in implementing the
housing programs and activities contained in this Housing Element, including preserving
affordable units that are at risk of converting to market-rate housing.
Avalon Planning and Building Department
The Planning and Building Department facilitates the orderly physical and economic
development of the City consistent with adopted General Plan policies, including the Housing
Element policies. The Department accomplishes this by administering advance planning, current
planning, building permitting, and building inspection programs in compliance with local, state,
and federal requirements. The Building Division provides reasonable controls for construction
and occupancy of buildings and structures throughout the City through the enforcement of all
building-related municipal ordinances.
Non-Profit Housing Developers
Due to the high cost of housing development, many communities have found that partnerships
with non-profit housing developers are an effective tool for creating affordable housing units. In
Avalon, several affordable housing developments have been made possible through close
coordination and partnership with non-profit housing developers. Nonprofits active in Southern
California include Bridge Housing, Jamboree Housing, and TELACU.
Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Energy-related housing costs can directly impact the affordability of housing. While state
building code standards contain mandatory energy efficiency requirements for new
development, the City and utility providers are also important resources to encourage and
facilitate energy conservation and to help residents minimize energy-related expenses.
City Programs and Initiatives
Title 24 Compliance: The Warren-Alquist Act requires that all new buildings in California meet
the energy efficiency standards contained in Title 24, Part 6 of the California Code of
Regulations. All new residential construction must comply with the standards in effect on the
date a building permit application is made (not when the building permit is issued). The
California Energy Commission adopted new standards as mandated by the California Energy and
Reliability Act of 2000, which were incorporated into model building codes adopted by each
local agency.
Avalon enforces Title 24 as the primary means for ensuring that new residential construction
incorporates the latest in energy efficient technologies. Under Title 24, developers can comply
with such regulations by either: 1) adopting a prescriptive package whereby each component of
the proposed building must meet a prescribed minimum energy requirement; or 2) adopting a
performance method which evaluates the building as a whole, rather than individual
                                                                                   CITY of AVALON

components, to determine whether energy conservation targets are achievable. In addition,
both approaches require certain mandatory energy conservation technologies.
Solar Community Initiative: Officially adopted by the City Council in 2003, Catalina's Vision 2020
Plan was created to outline a vision of what the City and its residents hoped their community
would look like in the year 2020. This Vision Plan includes an exceptionally ambitious solar
community initiative.
Other Initiatives: In addition to the solar initiative, the Vision 2020 Plan also seeks to recycle
landfill waste as ethanol, reduce traffic, convert to zero-emission electric vehicles, create an
energy efficient desalination plant for the island's water supply to help recycle liquid waste into
irrigation water and process solid waste in the sewage system into hydrogen and other fuels
using bacterial fuel cells.
Utility Providers Programs
Southern California Edison participates in the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE)
program, which offers income-qualified customers a discount of 20 percent or more on their
monthly electric bill. The Residential Multifamily Energy Efficiency Rebate Program offers
property owners and managers incentives on a broad list of energy efficiency improvements in
lighting, HVAC, insulation, and window categories. These improvements are to be used to
retrofit existing multi-family properties of two or more units. Edison also operates the Energy
Management Assistance (EMA) program, which helps income-qualified households conserve
energy and reduce their electricity costs. Southern California Edison pays all the costs of
purchasing and installing energy-efficient appliances and equipment, which are free to eligible
customers. Services include weatherization, energy efficient lighting and cooling, and
refrigerator replacement. And, finally, Edison has an Energy Assistance Fund (EAF), also known
as the Rate Relief Assistance Program, in place designed to help low-income customers pay their
electric bills. A maximum of $150 is available to income-qualified customers once every 12-
month period.
Additionally, the Southern California Gas Company offers various rebate programs for energy-
efficient appliances to its customers. The Comprehensive Mobile Home Program provides
qualifying mobile home customers with no-cost energy conservation evaluations, installations of
low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators, and gas energy efficiency improvements, such as
duct test and seal of HVAC systems. The Designed for Comfort program provides energy
efficiency design assistance, training, and incentives for housing authorities, owners of multi-
family affordable and supportive housing projects (which offer homes to persons with special
needs).

C.6     REVIEW OF PAST ACCOMPLISHMENTS
State law (California Government Code Section 65588(a)) requires each jurisdiction to review its
housing element as frequently as appropriate and evaluate:
    •   The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the
        attainment of the state housing goal;
    •   The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community’s housing
        goals and objectives; and
    •   The progress in implementation of the housing element.
The evaluation provides valuable information on the extent to which programs have been
successful in achieving stated objectives and addressing local needs, and to which these
programs continue to be relevant to addressing current and future housing needs in Avalon. The
evaluation provides the basis for recommending modifications to policies and programs and the
establishment of new objectives in the 2008-2013 Housing Element.
This section summarizes the City’s accomplishments in implementing the 2000 Housing Element
and housing programs set forth the 2008-2013 planning period. A program-by-program review
and a summary of quantifiable accomplishments for each planning period are included in Table
C-41 through Table C-44 on the following pages.

Comments Received

residents spoke on housing related issues:
    1.  The City’s occupancy code should meet fire code to avoid overcrowding conditions.
    2.  Multi-family housing development should ensure adequate ingress/egress.
    3.  The City should not seek to reduce residential parking requirements.
    4.  The City should clarify its policy regarding shipping containers as permanent structures.
    5.  The City should clarify its policy on tree heights in relation to building heights.
The City clarified that the Housing Element does not propose to reduce the number of parking
spaces required. The current Zoning Ordinance does not specify whether conventional versus
autoette parking space should be provided. In practice, the City has been approving projects to
