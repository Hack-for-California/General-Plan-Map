Goals and Policies
The Roadway Network, Thoroughfares and Transportation Routes
Goal T-1:       To create and maintain a roadway network that will ensure the safe
                and efficient movement of people and goods throughout the city.
     Policies
     T-1.1      Street design. Street design and access standards shall provide for
                safe and efficient movement of goods and people. Restrictive
                traffic control measures (such as channelization, street closures,
                and prohibition of some traffic movements) shall be used where
                appropriate to promote traffic safety and efficient traffic
                operation.
     T-1.2      Level of service standard. The City shall endeavor to maintain a
                minimum Level of Service “D”, as defined by the 2000 Highway
                Capacity Manual or subsequent revisions, on all streets and
                intersections within the city. To identify the potential impacts of
                new development on traffic service levels, the City shall require
                the preparation of traffic impact analyses at the sole expense of
                the developer for developments determined to be large enough to
                have potentially significant traffic impacts. This standards does
                not apply to freeways which are governed by the standards
                established by Caltrans.
     T-1.3      Hierarchy of streets. The City shall implement a hierarchical street
                system in which each street serves a specific, primary function
                and is sensitive to the context of the land uses served. The
                hierarchy of streets shall be based on the existing one square mile
                backbone grid system of streets along section lines and the
                traditional circulation pattern established in the City’s
                downtown. Development of residential neighborhoods within
                the backbone grid may employ a more circuitous street pattern

CIRCULATION
                  with cul-de-sacs, traffic circles, roundabouts and other traffic
                  calming features to help reduce traffic speeds.
            T-1.4 City standards for streets. Streets shall be dedicated, widened,
                  extended, and constructed based on the roadway
                  classifications/definitions and street sections provided in the
                  City’s roadway improvement standards and Street Master Plan
                  (see implementation measure T-2). Dedication and
                  improvements of full rights-of-way shall not be required in
                  existing developed areas where the City determines that such
                  improvements are either infeasible or undesirable. Other
                  deviations from these standards shall be permitted upon a
                  determination by the City Engineer that safe and adequate public
                  access and circulation are preserved by such deviations.
            T-1.5 Neighborhood streets.    Neighborhood streets shall be designed,
                  where feasible, to discourage unsafe traffic speeds.
            T-1.6 South County Corridor. The City shall promote efforts of Stanislaus
                  County, StanCOG and other stakeholders in the development of
                  the South County Corridor to connect W. Main Avenue to
                  Interstate 5. The City’s preference for the alignment of the South
                  County Corridor is shown on the Circulation Plan (Figure II-4 of
                  Chapter II. Land Use/Circulation Diagrams And Standards).
                  However, the final alignment should be decided through a
                  cooperative effort among stakeholders, and informed by a
                  comprehensive feasibility study that assesses at least the
                  following::
                   •   The appropriate right-of-way width and location;
                   •   Environmental and regulatory constraints, especially as they
                       relate to agricultural and biological resources;
                   •   The need for, and economic/environmental feasibility of,
                       constructing a second bridge over the San Joaquin River;
                   •   An estimate of relevant costs; and
                   •   An analysis of alternatives;
            T-1.7 Sperry Avenue By-Pass.       The City shall establish a roadway
                  connection between Sperry Avenue and East Las Palmas to divert
                  east-west through traffic from the downtown area.
            T-1.8 Streets outside the downtown.     The primary purpose of streets
                  outside the downtown is the movement of vehicles and goods;
                  parking shall be a secondary and subordinate use only. If travel
                  demands dictate, on-street parking may be removed on streets

       through residential areas is avoided.
T-1.10 Funding of traffic improvements. The City shall ensure through a
       combination of traffic impact fees and other funding mechanisms
       that new development fully mitigates its impact on traffic
       facilities by paying its share of the costs of circulation
       improvements. New development shall pay a proportional share
       of costs of required improvements necessitated by the new
       development.
T-1.11  Private streets discouraged.    The City shall discourage the
        development of private streets in new residential projects.
        Where private streets are allowed, they shall be constructed to
        City street standards.
T-1.12 Traffic calming encouraged. Traffic calming techniques, including
       roundabouts, traffic circles, ‘chokers’ and chicanes, shall be
       considered as an alternative to traditional intersection controls.
       Where cul-de-sacs are employed, consideration should be given
       to establishing connections between the cul-de-sac and other
       streets, parks, bicycle paths and pedestrian trails.
T-1.13 New interchange. The City shall investigate the construction of a
       new interchange at Interstate 5 north of Sperry Avenue in the
       vicinity of Zacharias Road.
T-1.14 Protection of Neighborhoods. The City shall ensure to the extent
       feasible that pedestrian, bicycle, and automobile connections are

     Policies
     T-6.1     Removal of on-street parking. If future growth in traffic volumes
               necessitates removal of on-street parking places to provide
               additional traffic lanes, the City shall ensure that the lost on-
               street spaces are replaced with an equal number of off-street
               spaces within the same vicinity, when feasible. Parking lots
               contiguous to downtown streets should not be sited at
               intersections but rather sited in mid-block locations.

                 organized approach to addressing inter-jurisdictional issues that are not solely
                 under the purview of the City of Patterson. This does not imply that the City is
                 superior or subordinate to other agencies, organizations, or groups. Rather, it

and standards to protect people and property from such hazards.                       sustainable practices.
Goals and Policies
Geologic Hazards
Goal HS-1 To prevent loss of life, injury, and property
                damage due to geologic and seismic hazards.
     Policies
     HS-1.1 Geotechnical reports.                 The City shall require the
                preparation of geotechnical reports and impose appropriate
                mitigation measures to ensure, within the limits of technical
                and economic feasibility, that new structures are able to
                withstand the effects of seismic activity, including
                liquefaction, slope instability, expansive soils or other
                geologic hazards.
     HS-1.2 Seismic resistant utilities.                 Underground utilities,
                particularly water and natural gas mains, shall be designed
                to withstand seismic forces in accordance with state
                requirements.
Flood Hazard
Goal HS-2 To prevent loss of life, injury, and property
                damage due to flooding.

     HS-2.1 Flood control management.                    The City shall prepare
                and adopt flood management plans and practices aimed at
                protecting life and property from the harmful effects of
                flooding. As part of this effort, the City shall establish criteria
                for:
                 a.  Evaluating whether new development should be
                     located in flood hazard zones;
                       CITY of PATTERSON ~ General Plan
                                       HS-3
FETY
             b. Identifying construction methods or other methods to
                  minimize damage if new development is located in
                  flood hazard zones, and
             c. Maintaining the structural and operational integrity of
                  essential public facilities during flooding.
     HS-2.2 Location of essential facilities. The City shall
            ensure that new essential public facilities are located
            outside of flood hazard zones whenever feasible, including

            facilities if located within flood hazard zones.
     HS-2.3 Cooperation with others. The City shall establish and
            maintain cooperative working relationships among public
            agencies with responsibility for flood protection.
     HS-2.4 FIRM Program. The City shall continue to participate in
            the National Flood Insurance Program. To this end, the City
            shall ensure that its regulations are in full compliance with
            standards adopted by the Federal Emergency Management
            Agency.
     HS-2.5 Flood protection for residences.                 New residential
            development, including mobile homes, shall be constructed
            so that the lowest floor is at least 12 inches above the 100-
            year flood level.
     HS-2.6 Flood            protection         for       non-residential
            development. Non-residential             development shall be
            anchored and flood-proofed to prevent damage from the
            100-year flood or, alternatively, elevated to at least 12
            inches above the 100-year flood level.
     HS-2.7 Compliance.          Existing development shall comply with
            policies HS-2.2. and HS-2.3 when improvements are made
            that cost at least 50 percent of the estimated current market
            value of the structure before the improvements.
     HS-2.8 Provision of storm drains.                Construction of storm
            drainage improvements shall be required, as appropriate, to

       development with the potential to increase flooding impacts
       on adjoining or downstream properties shall be prohibited.
HS-2.11     Priority for flood control improvements.             The
       City’s first priority in preventing risks to life and property
       resulting from flooding shall be to designate appropriate
       land uses in areas subject to flooding. Only when this land
       use-based approach is not sufficient to reduce hazards to
       life and property to acceptable levels will the City support
       the construction of new flood control projects.
HS-2.12     Buildable site. Parcels shall not be created upon
       which the presence of easements, floodplain, marsh or
       riparian habitat, or other features would leave insufficient
       land to build and operate structures. This policy shall not
       apply to open space lots specifically created for dedication
       to the City or another appropriate party for habitat
       protection, flood control, drainage, or wetland maintenance.
HS-2.13     Bridge construction.         New and modified bridge
       structures shall not cause an increase in water surface
       elevations of the 100-year floodplain exceeding one foot,
       unless analysis clearly indicates that the physical and/or
       economic use of upstream or downstream property will not
       be adversely affected.
HS-2.14     Runoff control. The City shall require all new urban
       development projects to incorporate runoff control
       measures to minimize peak flows of runoff and/or assist in
       financing or otherwise implementing comprehensive
       drainage plans. All such control measures shall consider
       potential affects to adjacent property owners.
HS-2.15     Central Valley Flood Protection Plan. The
       City shall continue to work to achieve consistency between
       the General Plan and applicable flood management
       practices with the provisions of the Central Valley Flood
       Protection Plan.

Noise
Goal HS-5 To protect city residents from the harmful and
            undesirable effects of excessive noise.
  Policies
  HS-5.1 Noise levels resulting from non-transportation
            sources. New development of noise-sensitive uses shall
            not be allowed where the noise level due to non-
            transportation noise sources will exceed the noise level
            standards of Table HS-1, as measured immediately within
            the property line of the new development, unless effective
            noise mitigation measures have been incorporated into the
            development design to achieve the standards specified in
            Table HS-1.
  HS-5.2 Noise levels resulting from non-transportation
            noise sources. Noise levels resulting from non-
            transportation noise sources shall be mitigated so as not to
            exceed the noise level standards of Table HS-1 as
            measured immediately within the property line of lands
            designated for noise-sensitive uses. This policy does not

     Each of the noise levels specified above shall be lowered by five dBA for simple tone noises,
     noises consisting primarily of speech or music, or for recurring impulsive noises. These noise
     level standards do not apply to residential units established in conjunction with industrial or
     commercial uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings).
     HS-5.3 Acoustical analysis required. Where proposed non-
                   residential land uses are likely to produce noise levels
                   exceeding the performance standards of Table HS-1 at
                   existing or planned noise-sensitive uses, an acoustical
                   analysis shall be required as part of the environmental
                   review process so that noise mitigation may be included in
                   the project design. (Requirements for the content of an
                   acoustical analysis are identified in Table HS-2.) (Note: For
                   the purposes of these noise policies, transportation noise
                   sources are defined as traffic on public roadways, railroad
                   line operations and aircraft in flight. Control of noise from
                   these sources is preempted by Federal and State
                   regulations. Other noise sources are presumed to be
                   subject to local regulations, such as a noise control
                   ordinance.)

     compare those levels to the adopted policies of the Noise
     Element.
  e. Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with
     the adopted policies and standards of the noise section of the
     General Plan. Where the noise source in question consists of
     intermittent single events, the report must address the effects
     of maximum noise levels in sleeping rooms in terms of
     possible sleep disturbance.
  f. Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation
     measures have been implemented.
  g. Describe a post-project assessment program which could be
     used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation
     measures.
HS-5.4 Noise standards.         The feasibility of proposed projects
        with respect to existing and future transportation noise
        levels shall be evaluated by comparison to Figure HS-1.
HS-5.5 Noise sensitive land uses.              New development of
        noise-sensitive land uses shall not be permitted in areas
        exposed to existing or projected levels of noise from
        transportation noise sources which exceed the levels
        specified in Table HS-3, unless the project design includes
        effective mitigation measures to reduce noise in outdoor
        activity areas and interior spaces to the levels specified in
        Table HS-1.
HS-5.6 Transportation noise sources and mitigation.
        Noise created by new transportation noise sources,
        including roadway improvement projects, shall be mitigated
        so as not to exceed the levels specified in Table HS-1 at
        outdoor activity areas or interior spaces of existing noise-
        sensitive land uses in either the incorporated or
        unincorporated areas.

                 a. Installation of grade separations at crossings where
                    feasible;
                 b. Improvements to warning devices at existing highway-
                    rail crossings;
                 c. Installation of additional warning signage;
                 d. Improvements to traffic signaling at intersections
                    adjacent to crossings, such as traffic preemption;
                 e. Installation of median separation to prevent vehicles
                    from driving around railroad crossing gates;
                 f. Where soundwalls, landscaping, buildings would be
                    installed near crossings, maintaining the visibility of
                    warning devices and approaching trains;
                 g. Prohibition of parking within 100 feet of crossings to
                    improve the visibility of warning devises and
                    approaching trains;
                 h. Installation of pedestrian-specific warning devices and
                    channelization;
                 i. Construction of pull-out lanes for buses and vehicles
                    transporting hazardous materials;
                 j. Installation of vandal-resistant fencing or walls to limit
                    the access of pedestrians onto the right-of-way;
                 k. Elimination of driveways near crossings;
                 l. Increased enforcement of traffic laws at crossings;
                 m. Rail safety awareness to educate the public about the
                    hazards of highway-rail grade crossings;

Appendix HS-1- Noise
The Noise Environment
There are several potentially significant primary sources of community noise within
Patterson. These sources include traffic on major roadways and highways, railroad
operations, and agricultural and industrial activities.
A community noise survey was conducted to document existing background (ambient)
noise levels at four representative locations within the City. The monitoring site locations
were located in both residential and commercial areas of the City. Noise measurements
were conducted concurrently at the sites, beginning at midnight on March 25, 2010. The
monitoring sites are shown in Figure HS-4.
Noise measurements were conducted continuously for a 24-hour period using Larson-
Davis Laboratories Model 820 sound level analyzers equipped with Bruel & Kjaer (B&K)
Type 4176 ½ inch microphones. The equipment was calibrated with a B&K Type 4230
acoustic calibrator to ensure the accuracy of the measurements and complies with
applicable standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for Type 1
sound level meters. Microphones were located on tripods at approximately five feet
above the ground.
Site 1 was located at a self storage facility on North 1st Street between M Street and
Olive Avenue. The site is a commercial area with mixed residential uses to the west and
agriculture and rural residential uses to the east. The microphone was located
approximately 150 feet east of State Route 33 (SR-33) and approximately 230 feet west
of North 1st Street. The California Northern Railroad (CFNR) track is located
approximately 80 feet to the west, and lies between SR-33 and the site. Measured
hourly maximum noise levels ranged from 61-91 dBA during the sample period, and
were likely caused by passing vehicles and trains. Background (L90) noise levels ranged
from about 50-55 dBA during the morning and afternoon commute hours to about 45-50
dBA during the middle of the afternoon, evening and night time hours. The measured
DNL was 62.4 dB.
Site 2 was located at a City water storage facility approximately 475 feet northwest of the
intersection of Orange Avenue and Locust Avenue. There are commercial uses located
to the west of the site, and agricultural uses to the north, east and south. There are a few
existing single-family homes located to the south of the monitoring site. Measured hourly
maximum noise levels ranged from 55-86 dBA during the sample period and were likely
caused by passing vehicles and trains. Background (L90) noise levels were relatively
constant throughout the sample period, and ranged from 53-55 dBA. The predominant
background noise source measured at Site 2 was exhaust fans from the Sierra Pacific
facility. The measured DNL was 62.1 dB.
Site 3 was located at a City fire station at 1950 Keystone Pacific Parkway. The
microphone was located approximately 325 feet east of Park Center Drive and
approximately 350 feet south of Keystone Pacific Parkway. The site is surrounded by
existing commercial uses and open land. There are existing single-family homes located
approximately 1,500 feet east of the monitoring site. Measured hourly maximum noise
levels ranged from 55-80 dBA during the sample period and were likely caused by
passing trucks. Background (L90) noise levels ranged from below 40 dBA during the late
                            CITY of PATTERSON ~ General Plan
                                           HS-26

night and early morning hours to about 47 dBA during the morning commute hours. The
measured DNL was 55.4 dB.
Site 4 was located in a vacant lot on Peach Blossom Lane between Plumeria Drive and
Garden Patch Way. The meter was located in a residential area surrounded by single-
family homes. Measured hourly maximum noise levels ranged from 48-73 dBA during
the sample period and were likely caused by passing vehicles. Background (L90) noise
levels ranged from below 40 dBA during the late night and early morning hours to about
47 dBA late afternoon and early evening hours. The measured DNL was 50.6 dB.
Stationary Noise Sources
Major existing stationary noise sources within the City of Patterson include the central
core commercial/industrial area along SR-33, the CFNR tracks and the CVS Pharmacy
and Kohls distribution centers on the west side of town. There are also various smaller
sources located within the Study Area.
Central Core Commercial/Industrial Area. This commercial/industrial area represents
the area east of SR-33 extending from approximately Las Palmas Avenue to Orange
Avenue. This area includes Patterson Vegetable, Sierra Pacific, Trinidad Benham,
Traina Foods, George Lowry Petroleum, and other agricultural- and industrial- related
facilities. Noise levels generated within this area were measured at multiple short-term
locations on March 25-26, 2010, as noted in Figure HS-4.
Table HS-4 documents the measured noise levels and locations of the short-term
monitoring sites. Noise levels varied widely throughout the area, with the loudest areas
being to the north along Las Palmas Avenue in the vicinity of Patterson Vegetable, as
well as in the southern portion along 2nd Street near Trinidad Benham. The closest
residential uses are the Las Palmas trailer park to the east. Noise measurements were
obtained at two locations within the trailer park (Enrique Way/El Camino Drive and
Shirlinda Way/Pasa Felix Drive).            Noise levels at these locations ranged from
approximately 46-52 dBA.

CVS Pharmacy Distribution Center. CVS Pharmacy operates a distribution center
southwest of the intersection of Keystone Pacific Parkway and Park Center Drive. Noise
sources include trucks entering and exiting the facility, rooftop fans, occasional outdoor
forklift movements, and back-up warning beepers. Short term noise measurements were
obtained at a distance of approximately 500 feet from the east side of the facility as
noted in Figure HS-4. Measured noise levels at that site ranged from 42-45 dBA. Long
term monitoring Site 3 was also located east of the distribution center, and background
noise levels measured for the 24-hour period ranged from approximately 33-48 dBA.
Truck traffic along Keystone Pacific Parkway and Rogers Road was observed to
represent a greater noise source than activities at the distribution center.
Kohl’s Distribution Center. Kohl’s Department Store operates a distribution center along
the north side of Keystone Pacific Parkway, approximately 1,300 feet northeast of the
CVS Pharmacy Distribution Center. Noise sources include trucks entering and exiting
the facility, occasional fork lift movements, and back-up warning beepers. Short term
noise measurements were obtained at a distance of approximately 800 feet from the
south side of the facility as noted in Figure HS-4. Facility-related noise levels at that site
ranged from approximately 44-46 dBA. As was the case with the CVS Pharmacy
distribution center, activities related to the Kohl’s facility were often inaudible above other
ambient noise sources, namely roadway vehicle traffic. Truck traffic along Keystone
Pacific Parkway and Rogers Road was observed to represent a greater noise source
than activities at the distribution center.
Various Commercial/Industrial-related Industries.            Observations on March 25, 2010
indicated that there are a number of commercial/industrial-related uses located north of
Las Palmas Avenue generally between North 1st Street and SR-33. There are existing
residential uses along the east side of North 1st Street in close proximity. Noise levels
were measured in front of a residence along North 1st Street at a distance of
approximately 60 feet from Peck & Hiller Concrete, and noise levels ranged from
approximately 53-61 dBA. Noise sources included welding, cutting, and grinding
activities, and truck movements. Additionally, noise measurements were obtained near
Designed Mobile Systems, a manufacturer of modular buildings, located west of SR-33
and north of Poppy Avenue. Noise levels were obtained at a nearby residence at 349
Poppy Avenue, and were measured to be in the range of 49-51 dBA. Noise sources
included forklift movements and back-up warning beepers. Short-term noise monitoring
sites are noted in Figure HS-4.
Roadways
Automobile traffic on roadways is one of the primary sources of noise within the Study
Area. The eastern portion of the Study Area is most affected by noise generated by
State Route 33, with the existing baseline ranging from 67-69 dB. Additional roadways
within the eastern portion of the Study Area which generate significant levels of noise
consist of Walnut, Sycamore, and Eucalyptus Avenues; however, these roadways do not
generate baseline noise levels in excess of 56 dB.

                                             HS-28

Within the western portion of the Study Area, a substantial amount of vehicular noise is
generated by Interstate-5. Approximately 25,000 vehicles per day travel the I-5 corridor
through the Study Area, with approximately 25 percent of these vehicles classified as
heavy-duty or lighter trucks. Additional roadways within the western portion of the Study
Area expected to generate moderate noise levels are Sperry Avenue, Baldwin Road, and
Ward Avenue. These roads are rural or transitional connector streets that may have
occasionally fast-moving traffic, but are not heavily-traveled at night, causing only
moderate levels of noise during the day. It is estimated that noise levels beyond about 65
feet of the centerline of Sperry Avenue are below 60 dBA.
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model
(FHWA-RD-77-108) was used to develop DNL contours for I-5, SR-33, and major local
roadways. The FHWA Model is an analytical method favored by most state and local
agencies, including Caltrans, for highway traffic noise prediction. The FHWA Model is
based upon reference energy emission levels for automobiles, medium trucks (2 axles)
and heavy trucks (3 or more axles), with consideration given to vehicle volume, speed,
roadway configuration, distance to the receiver, and the acoustical characteristics of the
site. The FHWA Model was developed to predict hourly Leq values for free-flowing traffic
conditions, and is generally considered to be accurate to within ±1.5 dB. To determine
DNL values, it is necessary to estimate the day/night distribution of traffic so that an
hourly equivalent traffic volume may be calculated. The FHWA Model assumes a clear
view of traffic with no shielding at the receiver location.
Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes and speeds used for noise modeling were provided
by TJKM Transportation Consultants, the project traffic engineers. The day/night
distribution of traffic was estimated by BBA based upon studies along similar roadways.
The percentage of trucks on I-5 and SR-33 were obtained from Caltrans. The percentage
of trucks on major local streets was estimated by BBA based upon studies along similar
roadways. It was assumed that Rogers Road north of Sperry Avenue is a truck route
with higher percentages of trucks than other major local streets. Appendix 5.8
summarizes the noise modeling assumptions used to calculate traffic noise exposure for
existing conditions along I-5, SR-33 and major local streets.
Table HS-5 summarizes calculated noise exposure at typical building setbacks and the
distances to the DNL 60 and 65 dB contours for existing traffic conditions. Figure HS-5
shows the roadways where distances to DNL contours were calculated for existing traffic
conditions. The streets are color coded to indicate the approximate distances to the 60
dB DNL contours. Traffic noise exposure information is generalized for flat terrain and
the absence of acoustical shielding or reflections that may be caused by site-specific
conditions.

Railroads
The California Northern Railroad (CFNR) currently operates freight trains over the
Westside Branch of the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) through Patterson between Tracy
and Los Banos.          According to the Federal Railroad Administration rail crossing
inventory (01/01/96), an average of six trains per day pass through Patterson. It should
be noted that this figure includes switching movements at local industries, and that,
based upon field observations, this may be a high estimate for current operations over
the line. Freight trains may occur at any time during the day or night. The current
maximum train speed through Patterson is 25 mph.
There are approximately 20 public or private roadway grade crossings within the Study
Area. Train engineers are required to sound the warning horn when approaching within
approximately 1,000 feet of a grade crossing. Train noise levels are therefore higher at
locations near grade crossings. Due the number of grade crossings within the Study
Area, warning horns are used frequently as trains pass through Patterson.
Noise levels produced by a northbound freight train with two locomotives and 15 cars
were recorded by Brown-Buntin Associates, Inc. (BBA) near the M Street grade crossing
on March 25, 2010. At a distance of 100 feet from the track, the measured maximum
(Lmax) and Sound Exposure Level (SEL) values were 103.3 and 109.8 dBA, respectively.
The SEL is a measure of total sound energy produced by a noise event, normalized to a
reference duration of one second. The SEL is not actually heard but is the noise metric
used for the calculation of cumulative noise exposure as defined by the DNL. Noise
levels produced by passing trains are variable, depending upon speed, length of train,
condition of equipment and tracks, perceived safety conflicts of individual train crews and
other variables.
Railroad noise exposure within the City of Patterson was calculated based upon the
above-described operations data and noise level data for freight train movements
recorded by BBA for numerous studies along the UPRR and other railroads in theCentral
Valley. At a distance of 100 feet from the center of the track, typical freight train pass-
bys near a grade crossing have been shown to produce average SEL values of 106.3
dBA. At distances greater than 1,000 feet from a grade crossing, typical freight train
pass-bys have been shown to produce average SEL values of 102.1 dBA at 100 feet
from the tracks.
It was assumed for the calculations that freight train operations may occur at any time of
the day or night. Within 1,000 feet of a grade crossing, the calculated distance to the 60
dB DNL contour for current railroad activity is 575 feet from the center of the tracks. At
distances greater than 1,000 feet from a grade crossing, the calculated distance to the
60 dB DNL contour is 288 feet from the center of the tracks. Calculated distances are
generalized and do not take into consideration site-specific conditions such as acoustic
shielding or reflections caused by nearby buildings.
Aircraft Noise
The Patterson Airport and former Crow’s Landing Airfield Facility (CLAF) are located
within or affecting the Study Area. Only the Patterson Airport is still active. The
Patterson Airport is a private airport consisting of a single 2,500 foot-long runway.
According to FAA records, there are 12 aircraft based at the airport and an average of 33
aircraft operations per day. However, no aircraft operations were observed during field
                            CITY of PATTERSON ~ General Plan
                                         HS-32

studies and aircraft were not observed on the airfield. If aircraft operations do occur,
they are sporadic and do not generate significant noise exposure as defined by the
CNEL noise metric. However, such operations would be distinctly audible in the vicinity
of the airport.
Crows Landing Airfield is currently not in use. However, Stanislaus County has proposed
that it be reopened as a general aviation airport as part of the Stanislaus County public
airport system. According to the January 2009 draft of the Crows Landing Airport Land
Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP), the airport would reopen with a single 5,300 foot-long
runway with approximately 4,000 annual aircraft operations.             In the “ultimate”
configuration (20 years+), the airfield would have two parallel runways 6,300 feet long
and 200,000 annual operations. Operations would be mostly single and twin engine
propeller or turboprop aircraft and helicopters, with approximately 10% business jet
operations. The airport design aircraft for the ultimate development of the airport is the
Gulfstream III business jet.
Noise-Sensitive Land Uses
Noise-sensitive land uses are generally considered to include those uses that would
result in noise exposure that could cause health-related risks to individuals. Places
where quiet is essential are also considered noise-sensitive uses. Residential dwellings
are of primary concern because of the potential for increased and prolonged exposure of
individuals to both interior and exterior noise levels. Other land uses such as parks,
historic sites, cemeteries, and recreation areas are also considered sensitive to
increases in exterior noise levels. School classrooms, places of assembly, hotels,
libraries, and other places where low interior noise levels are essential are also
considered noise-sensitive land uses.

Introduction
Article 10.6, Section 65580 – 65589.8, Chapter 3 of Division 1 of Title 7 of
the Government Code sets forth the legal requirements of the Housing
Element and encourages the provision of affordable and decent housing in
all communities to meet Statewide goals. Specifically, Section 65580
states the element shall consist of “ . . . an identification and analysis of
existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies,
quantified objectives, financial resources and scheduled programs for the
preservation, improvement, and development of housing." The Housing
Element must also contain a five-year housing plan with quantified
objectives for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the
Housing Element.
The City’s Housing Element was last updated in 2004 and published
separately. The following is a summary of the goals, policies, objectives
and implementation measures.
Goals, Objectives, Policies and Programs
Goal 1.         It is the Goal of the City of Patterson to assist
                in increasing the availability of permanent
                housing for all community residents.
     Objective 1-1: Continue to seek financial assistance by applying for
                     Federal, State, and other appropriate funding
                     sources for eligible activities in addressing affordable
                     housing needs.
     Policy 1-1-1:      Continue to apply to HUD and State HCD for grant
                        funds that may be used for housing-related
                        programs.
     Program:           The City shall actively coordinate with the State
                        HCD and HUD staff to ensure that it will be eligible
                        and among the first jurisdictions to apply for all
                        existing and new funding sources. This will include
                        attendance at HCD and HUD sponsored training
                        and conferences, frequent monitoring of HCD and
                        HUD web sites for updates on available funding and
                        regular contact with HCD and HUD field
                        representatives.

LAND US
CITY of PATTERSON General Plan
             LU-2
                                                                           LAND USE
Introduction
When considering the seven topics, or elements that a general plan is
required to cover (land use, circulation, housing, conservation, open
space, noise and safety), the issue of land use is probably of greatest
interest to the public. The Land Use Element determines the locations
within the city and its planning area where residential, commercial,
industrial, public, and open space land uses may occur at present and
in the future. The Land Use Element also works with the other parts of
the plan to determine the location, rate and timing of new growth and
development.
Expansion Areas
The Land Use Diagram (Figure II-3) designates areas surrounding the
City for additional urban development. To aid in the consideration of
issues affecting the outward expansion of the City, land within the
General Plan area has been divided into five loosely defined
expansion areas as shown on Figure LU-1. Each expansion area is
described in general terms below, along with the relevant issues to be
addressed in the development of each.
Northern Expansion Area
The Northwest Expansion Area is the area generally west of Highway
33, east of the Delta Mendota Canal and north of the Patterson
Business Park, and consists of land designated for Low Density
Residential and industrial development. Issues to be addressed in the
development of this expansion area include:
        Land use compatibility issues between the high school site and
         surrounding industrial operations;
        Safety issues relating to access to the high school site from the
         south side of Zacharias Road;
        The appropriate alignment and roadway configuration for the
         South County Corridor;
        Land use compatibility issues between existing businesses in
         the West Patterson Business Park and future Low Density
         Residential development;
        The timing and location of a future interchange with Interstate
         5 in the vicinity of Zacharias Road;
        Potential flooding impacts associated with Del Puerto Creek;
        The integration of roadway, bicycle and pedestrian circulation
         systems with existing neighborhoods to the south.
East Side Expansion Area
The East Side Expansion Area is the area generally east of Sycamore
Avenue, west of Elm Avenue, south of Lemon Avenue and north of the
                     CITY of PATTERSON General Plan
                                    LU-3

Patterson Irrigation Canal, and consists of land designated for Low
Density Residential development. Issues to be addressed in the
development of this expansion area include:
       The integration of roadway, bicycle and pedestrian circulation
        systems with existing neighborhoods to the west;
       The treatment of development along Las Palmas Avenue and
        the mitigation of potential noise impacts from roadway noise
        on adjacent Low Density Residential development;
       The appropriate alignment and roadway configuration for the
        South County Corridor.
Southern Expansion Area
The Southern Expansion Area generally includes land east of the
Delta Mendota Canal, north of Marshal Road, west of Highway 33 and
south of the current City limits. This area consists of land designated
for Low Density Residential and Estate Residential development
within. Issues to be addressed in the development of this expansion
area include:
       The integration of roadway, pedestrian, bicycle and pedestrian
        circulation systems with existing neighborhoods to the north,
        especially in light of the status of the existing irrigation canal;
       The treatment of development along Ward Avenue, Baldwin
        Road and State Route 33 and the mitigation of potential noise
        impacts from roadway noise on adjacent Low Density
        Residential development;
       Development of          a community college and supporting
        ‘educational center south of the Patterson Sports Park;
       Establishment of         a permanent buffer between urban
        development within the City and agricultural lands to the south;
       Development restrictions associated with the Airport Land Use
        Plan for the Crows Landing Airfield.
The Canals Expansion Area
The Canals Expansion Area lies between the Delta Mendota Canal
and the California Aqueduct north of Sperry Avenue and north of
Zacharias Road designated for commercial and light industrial
development. Issues to be addressed in the development of this
expansion area include:
       Circulation and       access,    especially    for   deliveries  and
        employees;
       The timing and location of a future interchange in the vicinity of
        Interstate 5 and Zacharias Road;
                   CITY of PATTERSON General Plan
                                    LU-4

                                                                         LAND USE
        The amount, and location of, commercial development
         established near the future interchange;
        Visual impacts from Interstate 5;
        Traffic impacts on the Sperry Avenue/I-5 interchange;
        Potential flooding impacts associated with Del Puerto Creek.
The Foothills Expansion Area
The Foothills Expansion Area consists of land west of Interstate 5
between Del Puerto Canyon Road and Interstate 5 north of Sperry
Avenue designated for Mixed Use Hillside and Highway Serving
Commercial development. Issues to be addressed in the development
of this expansion area include:
        Potential visual impacts as viewed from Interstate 5 and the
         remainder of the City;
        The mitigation of impacts to habitat for a federally endangered
         species;
        Connecting development of this area with the remainder of the
         City for motor vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists;
        The extension of infrastructure necessary to serve the area;
        Hillside development to address grading, slope stability and
         visual impacts;
        The timing of development in relation to the remainder of the
         City and necessary infrastructure improvements.
Areas Subject To Flooding
Government Code Section 65302 requires the Land Use Element to
identify areas subject to flooding. Figure LU-2 identifies areas subject
to flooding in accordance with the Federal Emergency Management
Agency’s (FEMA) 1989 Flood Insurance Study for Stanislaus County.
Standards for the Intensity of Development
Government Code section 65302 states that a General Plan must
specify allowable uses for each land use district that are specific
enough to provide guidance for making findings of consistency where
necessary. The standards for the intensity of development are
provided in Chapter II-Land Use Circulation Diagram and Standards
under the heading Standards for the Intensity of Development.

                        embodied in the Patterson General Plan is based on the
                        premise that the outward urban expansion of the City will
                        occur through the incremental annexation and development
                        of “complete” neighborhoods, incorporating the following
                        characteristics:
                        a. A mix of housing products and densities serving the
                            broadest range of households, incomes and ages;
                        b. A neighborhood center containing higher density
                            residential       development,       retail,     restaurants,
                            entertainment, office, and public uses within a short
                            walk or bicycle ride of surrounding residences;
                        c. Parks, schools and other public/quasi-public uses within
                            a short walk or bicycle ride;
                        d. A complete and interconnected system of mobility
                            consisting of roadways, bicycle and pedestrian paths,
                            and transit stops;
                        e. Short blocks with a substantial tree canopy shading the
                            street and sidewalk;
                        f. Connectivity to surrounding neighborhoods, regional
                            retail centers and employment;
                        g. A sense of personal safety;
                        h. Elements that foster the sustainable use of scarce or
                            non-renewable resources.
                        i. Mixed-use development in which complementary uses
                            are placed on a single building site one above the other
                            (vertically) or in close proximity (horizontally).
               LU-1.2        Residential expansion areas.                To achieve the
                     objectives described in Policy LU-1.1, the General Plan applies
                     the Low Density Residential designation to areas
                     contemplated for new, residential development outside the
                     current (2010) City limits. In such instances Low Density
                     Residential designation is considered a “holding” category
                     which will apply until such time as a general plan amendment

design, and quality of development in a manner that protects, preserves,        sustainable practices.
and promotes important biological, agricultural, and water resources.
Important biological resources in the Patterson planning area include
foraging habitat and movement corridors for endangered wildlife species,
riparian habitats along creeks, and other natural systems as they relate to
both local and regional ecosystems.
The City’s Open Space Plan, as required by Government Code Section
65563 is addressed by the following goals, policies and implementation
measures:
Goals
NR-2 Agricultural Resources
NR-3 Open Space and Sensitive Habitats
Policies
NR-2.1 through NR-2.11
NR-3.1 through NR-3.10
Implementation Measures
NR-3, NR-4, NR-5, NR-9
The preservation of Native American historical, cultural, and sacred sites is
addressed by policies PR-6.1 through PR-6.5 and implementation
measure PR-8 of the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Element.
Patterson also lies in the heart of one of the most productive agricultural
regions in the United States. In addition to their important role in the
production of food and fiber, agricultural lands also provide habitat for
endangered species, open space, and flood protection, as well as an
important visual resource. Policies of this Element seek to preserve
productive agricultural soils locally and in the region.
Recognizing that clean water is vital to sustain Patterson’s economy and
overall quality of life, this Element also provides policies aimed at the
protection of surface and groundwater resources.
In response to State and federal mandates aimed at curbing the emission
of greenhouse gases which contribute to climate change, policies and
programs relating to air quality and climate change are provided in the Air
Resources and Climate Change element.

            habitats. Preserve significant trees. Conform the site
            along natural land forms, avoid excessive grading and
            disturbance of vegetation and soils, and mimic the
            site’s natural drainage patterns. Where possible,
            concentrate development on portions of the site with
            less permeable soils, and preserve areas that can
            promote infiltration. To the extent possible, limit overall
            coverage of paving and roofs by designing compact
            structures, narrower and shorter streets and sidewalks,
            smaller parking lots, and indoor or underground
            parking. Where possible, detain and retain runoff
            throughout the site. Use drainage design elements
            such as depressed landscape areas, vegetated buffers,
            and bioretention facilities (consisting of a shallow
            surface reservoir, a layer of imported planting medium,
            and a gravel underlayer with perforated pipe
            underdrains) as amenities and focal points within the
            site and landscape design.
        b. Use Pervious Surfaces. In new buildings and major
            retrofits, evaluate the technical and economic feasibility
            of green roofs. Identify where permeable pavements,
            such as crushed aggregate, turf block, unit pavers,
            pervious concrete, or pervious asphalt could be
            substituted for impervious concrete or asphalt paving.
        c. Disperse Runoff to Adjacent Pervious Areas. Where
            possible, direct roof downspouts across pervious
            areas. A maximum 2:1 ratio between impervious and
            pervious surfaces is recommended. Receiving pervious
            areas should be relatively flat, and soils should be
            amended as needed to promote infiltration. Similarly,
            parking areas should be designed so that runoff can
            sheet flow to landscaped areas. Where feasible, use
            curb cuts or no curbs to allow runoff to flow to
            vegetated areas.
        d. Direct runoff to bioretention facilities, flow-through
            planters, dry wells, or cisterns. On densely developed
            sites, and where runoff from impervious roofs and
            paved areas cannot be dispersed to landscaping,
            consider directing runoff to facilities designed to detain
            and treat runoff before letting it seep away slowly. Dry
            wells or infiltration basins may be used if soils are
            sufficiently permeable and geotechnical considerations
            allow. Bioretention facilities can be a suitable option for
            many sites.

Appendix NR –Requirements for Biological Resources
For projects with the potential to adversely impact vernal pool habitat, require the
following:
BIO-1      Pre-construction surveys shall be conducted prior project related activities that
           may impact wetland areas. If these areas will be impacted by project
           activities, CDFG will request adequate measures to offset impacts to wetland
           resources. Early consultation with CDFG is recommended to determine
           adequate protocol, as project modification and/or mitigation measures may be
           necessary and will require agency approval.
For projects with the potential to adversely impact Riparian Habitat, require the following:
BIO-2      Pre-Construction Surveys and Agency Coordination. Pre-construction surveys
           shall be conducted prior to project related activities that may impact the
           riparian resources in the project area (including in the vicinity of Del Puerto
           Creek and Salado Creek, the Elfers Road irrigation pond, and the unnamed
           drainages west of I-5) in order to identify significant impacts. If riparian areas
           and regulated habitats will be impacted by project activities, USACE permits
           and a Streambed Alteration Agreement from CDFG will be required. Early
           consultation with the USACE and CDFG is recommended to determine
           adequate protocols, as project modification and/or mitigation measures may
           be necessary and will require agency approval.
           Furthermore, if construction activities would result in impacts to special-status
           species, mitigation measures for that species described in the policies and
           programs of the General Plan shall be implemented. If surveys indicate that
           impacts would result to a special-status species not previously identified or for
           which mitigation measures are not described in the policies and programs of
           the General Plan, avoidance and minimization measures to reduce project
           impacts to less than significant levels shall be determined through
           coordination with the City of Patterson, CDFG, and USFWS
           For projects with the potential to adversely impact Elderberry Longhorn
           Beetles (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) or their habitat, require the
           following:
For projects with the potential to adversely impact elderberry longhorn beetle habitat,
require the following:
BIO-3      Surveys. The project alignment and immediately adjacent area shall be
           surveyed and mapped for the presence of the valley elderberry longhorn
           beetle and its elderberry host species plant by a qualified biologist. Mitigation
           is not required for plants with no stems measuring 1 inch or greater in
           diameter at ground level, and surveys are valid for a period of 2 years.

                                          NR-20

BIO-4 Avoidance. Avoid and protect elderberry shrubs whenever possible. If
      suitable habitat for the beetle occurs on the project site, these areas shall be
      designated as avoidance areas that will be protected from disturbance during
      the construction of the project. Any beetle habitat that cannot be avoided shall
      be considered impacted and appropriate mitigation shall be implemented as
      described below:
      Core avoidance areas include all areas within 20 ft of the dripline of any
      elderberry plant with a stem measuring 1 inch or greater in diameter at ground
      level. Such core areas shall not be disturbed during construction. Buffer
      avoidance areas include all the area within 100 ft of any elderberry plant with a
      stem measuring 1 inch or greater at ground level.
       a. Temporary construction fencing shall be constructed to provide a
           minimum setback of at least 20 ft from the dripline of each potential host
           elderberry plant.
       b. A tailgate education program on the valley elderberry longhorn beetleshall
           be given to each construction worker and all personnel working within the
           project area to avoid adverse effects on the beetle.
       c. Signs shall be placed every 50 ft along the edge of the exclusion fence to
           help identify the area as a protected area for the valley elderberry
           longhorn beetle for the duration of the project.
       d. The protected area shall be restored if any damage to the area occurs
           during the project construction period and maintained as a natural area.
BIO-5 Elderberry plants shall be transplanted to a mitigation area if they cannot be
      avoided by the proposed project. All elderberry plants with one or more stems
      measuring 1 inch or greater in diameter at ground level shall be transplanted
      to a mitigation area. The following guidelines shall be followed:
       a. A qualified biologist shall monitor the project and mitigation sites for the
           duration of the transplanting to ensure no unauthorized take or loss of
           individuals occurs.
       b. Elderberry plants shall be transplanted after shrubs have lost their leaves
           and are dormant, usually from November through the first 2 weeks in
           February.
       c. Transplanting shall be conducted according to standard procedures set
           forth by the USFWS. This includes planting additional seedlings or
           cuttings at various ratios for plants removed for translocating.
       d. A mitigation area set aside for translocated plants shall provide habitat for
           the beetle in perpetuity. The mitigation area shall provide at least 1800 ft2
           for each transplanted elderberry shrub and follow USFWS guidelines for
           other associated native plants to be planted within the area. This
           mitigation area shall be weeded by mechanical means (no herbicides)
           once a year.

                                       NR-21
           e. The mitigation area shall be monitored for the general condition of the
               mitigation area, the condition of the elderberry plants, and the associated
               native plants, for a period of 10 consecutive years with surveys and
               reports every year, or for 15 years of monitoring with surveys and reports
               on years 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15. Reports shall be provided to the
               USFWS.
For projects with the potential to adversely impact California Tiger Salamanders (CTS)
(Ambystoma californiense) or their habitat, require the following:
BIO-6     Conduct pre-construction surveys for California tiger salamander. To assure
          that CTS are not disturbed by construction activities, a qualified herpetologist
          shall conduct pre-construction surveys for projects within the Foothill
          Expansion Area. The survey shall be conducted in accordance with the
          October 2003 Interim Guidance on Site Assessment and Field Surveys for
          Determining Presence or a Negative Finding of the California Tiger
          Salamander, jointly prepared by the USFWS and the CDFG. The 1st step of
          the survey shall consist of a CTS site assessment that determines the
          presence or absence of suitable breeding habitat or suitable aestivation
          habitat within 1.24 mi of a suitable breeding habitat, even if it occurs off site. A
          report of the CTS site assessment shall then be provided to the USFWS and
          CDFG, who would then provide recommendations as to the appropriateness
          of further surveys. If the CTS site assessment determines the project does not
          provide potential breeding habitat of suitable aestivation habitat within 1.24 mi
          of a potential breeding site then no further mitigation measures would be
          required. If, however, potential breeding and/or aestivation habitat is present
          within the proposed project footprint, the project could either assume CTS
          presence and implement Mitigation Measures BIO-7 and BIO-8, or conduct
          field surveys to determine whether or not CTS occur on the project site.
          Conducting site-specific surveys to demonstrate CTS absence generally
          requires 2 years of surveys.
BIO-7     Provide Compensatory Habitat Mitigation. If CTS presence is assumed, or if
          protocol-level surveys document presence anywhere on the project site,
          mitigation for habitat loss in consultation with the USFWS and CDFG will be
          required. This compensation may be achieved through purchase of credits for
          the appropriate acreage of aestivation and dispersal habitat at an approved off
          -site mitigation bank or by acquiring, preserving, and managing suitable
          upland habitat in or adjacent to areas currently supporting CTS.
BIO-8     Implement Avoidance and Minimization Measures. If CTS presence is
          assumed, or if protocol-level surveys document presence anywhere on the
          project site, the project shall implement the following avoidance and
          minimization measures. The project shall also consult with the USFWS and
          CDFG to determine if additional site-specific measures are required to protect
                           CITY of PATTERSON ~ General Plan
                                          NR-22
          CTS from take during construction activities.
           a. The limits of work shall be flagged prior to the start of construction.
           b. Exclusion fencing shall be constructed around the entire footprint of the
               project area, immediately outside the flagged limits of work, to exclude
               CTS from construction areas.
           c. An on-site construction personnel education program shall be conducted
               by a qualified biologist to educate workers on CTS recognition, the
               potential for occurrence of CTS in the project area, measures to avoid
               take, and penalties for take. A protocol shall be developed and followed
               in the event that a CTS is encountered inside the exclusion fencing during
               project construction. This protocol shall include the following elements:
                     i. All work that could result in direct injury, disturbance, or
                        harassment of the individual animal must immediately cease;
                    ii. The foreman shall be immediately notified;
                   iii. The foreman shall immediately notify an appropriate project
                        representative, who in turn shall immediately notify the USFWS
                        and CDFG; and
                   iv. A qualified biologist approved by the USFWS to handle the
                        individual salamander shall be contacted to remove the individual
                        to a safe location nearby.
           d. During construction, dedicated construction personnel shall conduct daily
               checks of the exclusion fencing to ensure that it is functioning correctly
               (e.g., without any gaps through which CTS might enter the work area),
               and to maintain the fencing as needed. Prior to the start of work each
               day, these personnel shall also inspect trenches and pits that were left
               open overnight.
For projects with the potential to adversely impact California Red-legged Frogs (CRLF)
(Rana aurora draytonii) or their habitat, require the following:
BIO-9     Conduct pre-construction surveys for California red-legged frog. To assure
          that CRLF are not disturbed by construction activities, a qualified herpetologist
          shall conduct pre-construction surveys for projects occurring within 1000 ft of
          Del Puerto creek west of I-5. The survey periods and schedule shall be
          conducted in accordance with the Revised guidance on site assessments and
          field surveys for the California red-legged frog (USFWS 2005)
BIO-10    Provide Compensatory Habitat Mitigation. If CRLF presence is documented on
          the project site, mitigation for habitat loss in consultation with the USFWS shall
          be required. This compensation may be achieved through purchase of credits
          for the appropriate acreage habitat at an approved off-site mitigation bank or
          by acquiring, preserving, and managing suitable habitat in areas currently
          supporting CRLF.

                                           NR-23
BIO-11     Implement Avoidance and Minimization Measures. If CRLF are found to be
           present anywhere on the project site, the project shall consult with the USFWS
           to develop appropriate avoidance and minimization measures to protect CRLF
           from take during construction activities.
            a. The limits of work shall be flagged prior to the start of construction.
            b. Exclusion fencing shall be constructed around the entire footprint of the
                 project area, immediately outside the flagged limits of work, to exclude
                 CRLF from construction areas.
            c. An on-site construction personnel education program shall be conducted
                 by a qualified biologist to educate workers on CRLF recognition, the
                 potential for occurrence of CRLF in the project area, measures to avoid
                 take, and penalties for take. A protocol shall be developed and followed
                 in the event that a CRLF is encountered inside the exclusion fencing
                 during project construction. This protocol shall include the following
                 elements:
                       i. All work that could result in direct injury, disturbance, or
                          harassment of the individual animal must immediately cease;
                      ii. The foreman shall be immediately notified;
                     iii. The foreman shall immediately notify an appropriate project
                          representative, who in turn shall immediately notify the USFWS;
                          and
                     iv. A qualified biologist approved by the USFWS to handle the
                          individual frogs shall be contacted to remove the individual to a
                          safe location nearby.
            d. During construction, dedicated construction personnel shall conduct daily
                 checks of the exclusion fencing to ensure that it is functioning correctly
                 (e.g., without any gaps through which CRLF might enter the work area)
                 and to maintain the fencing as needed. Prior to the start of work each
                 day, these personnel shall also inspect trenches and pits that were left
                 open overnight.
            e. Prior to commencement of work on the project site, but after construction
                 of the exclusion fencing, a pre-construction survey shall be conducted by
                 a qualified biologist in the work area adjacent to potential red-legged frog
                 habitat. If any red-legged frogs are found within the work area, the
                 USFWS shall be contacted, and if approved by the USFWS, the qualified
                 biologist shall remove the individual to a safe location nearby.
For projects with the potential to adversely impact Swainson’s Hawks (Buteo swainsoni)
or their habitat, require the following:
BIO-12     Conduct pre-construction surveys for Swainson’s Hawks. In order to assure
           that nesting Swainson’s hawks will not be disturbed by construction in the
           project area, a qualified ornithologist shall conduct pre-construction surveys as
           described in the CDFG’s Staff Report Regarding Mitigation for Impacts to
                              CITY of PATTERSON ~ General Plan
                                             NR-24

           Swainson’s Hawks (Buteo swainsoni) in the Central Valley of California
           (CDFG 1994, Appendix D). Survey Period I occurs from 1 January to 20
           March, Period II from 20 March to 5 April, Period III from 5 April to 20 April,
           Period IV from 21 April to 10 June (surveys not recommended during this
           period), and Period V from 10 June to 30 July. Three surveys shall be
           completed in at least each of the 2 survey periods immediately prior to a
           project’s initiation but are recommended during periods II, III, and V. If a nest
           site is found, consultation with CDFG shall be required.
BIO-13     Removal of nest trees. Nest trees along the proposed project shall not be
           removed unless avoidance measures are determined to be infeasible. If a
           nest tree must be removed, a Management Authorization (including conditions
           to offset the loss of the nest tree) must be obtained from the CDFG. The
           Management Authorization shall specify the tree removal period, generally
           between 1 October and 1 February. If construction or other project-related
           activities that may cause nest abandonment or forced fledging are necessary
           within the specified buffer zone, monitoring of the nest site (funded by the
           applicant) by a qualified biologist shall be required to determine if the nest is
           abandoned. If the nest is abandoned, and if the nestlings are still alive, the
           applicant shall fund the recovery and hacking (controlled release of captive
           reared young) of the nestling(s).
BIO-14     Compensate for loss of foraging habitat. Loss of foraging habitat for
           Swainson’s Hawks shall be mitigated by providing Habitat Management (HM)
           lands as described in the CDFG’s Staff Report Regarding Mitigation for
           Impacts to Swainson’s Hawks (Buteo swainsoni) in the Central Valley of
           California (CDFG 1994, Appendix D) because the site is known foraging
           habitat for Swainson’s Hawks. The final acreage of HM lands to be provided
           on site shall depend on the distance between the proposed project area and
           the nearest active nest site (CDFG 1994), as determined by nest surveys
           conducted in the spring prior to project implementation. The acreage of HM
           lands provided shall be derived from the recommendations included in the
           1994 CDFG staff report (Appendix D). The ratios of mitigation for loss of
           Swainson’s hawk foraging habitat is 1:1 (mitigation: impact) for projects within
           1 mi of an active nest, 0.75:1 for projects within 5 mi but greater than 1 mi of
           an active nest, 0.5:1 for projects within 10 mi but greater than 5 mi of an active
           nest.
For projects with the potential to adversely impact San Joaquin Kit Fox (Vulpes macrotis
mutica) or their habitat, require the following:
BIO-15     Conduct focused surveys for San Joaquin kit fox. Protocol-level surveys for
           SJKF shall be performed for future projects covered by the General Plan
           occurring in the Foothill Expansion Area containing grassland habitat. The
           survey shall be conducted in accordance with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
           Service San Joaquin Kit Fox Survey Protocol for the Northern Range (USFWS
                              CITY of PATTERSON ~ General Plan

       1999) or follow an approach coordinated with the USFWS or CDFG. An
       evaluation of the site that describes the project, its size, the habitats it would
       impact, known SJKF occurrences within 10 mi of the project, an evaluation of
       the project site’s suitability as SJKF habitat, and an analysis of the project’s
       adverse effects on SJKF shall be submitted to USFWS. If the evaluation
       determines that the project will not impact SJKF and the USFWS concurs,
       then implementation measure BIO-15 would not be required. Such a
       determination is unlikely given recent CNDDB records in the area. If, however,
       it is judged on the basis of the evaluation that potential SJKF habitat is present
       within a proposed project footprint, that project could either assume SJKF
       presence and implement Mitigation Measures BIO-16 and BIO-17 or conduct
       field surveys to determine whether or not SJKF occur on the project site.
BIO-16 Preserve off-site habitat for San Joaquin kit fox. To mitigate potential
       permanent impacts to habitat from project construction, the project proponent
       shall acquire habitat occupied by SJKF. Conversion of these habitats for
       residential purposes shall be mitigated for in one of the following manner:
        a. Fee title purchase and/or dedication of a permanent conservation
              easement of land in the higher quality kit fox habitat (under 1000 ft in
              elevation) west of I-5 within Stanislaus County at a ratio of 2:1 (2 acres
              protected for each acre developed). Lands shall be dedicated prior to
              grading activities on the property; or,
        b. Payment of an in-lieu fee of $2000 per developed acre, to be held by the
              County, the Center for Natural Lands Management, the California Wildlife
              Foundation, the CDFG, or other entity approved by the USFWS, for the
              ultimate purpose of establishing a permanent movement corridor in
              western Stanislaus County below 1000 ft elevation and west of I-5,
              pursuant to the existing recovery planning goals for kit fox in the County.
              Fees shall be paid prior to grading of the site. When these funds are
              ultimately applied for mitigation purposes, should the actual cost of setting
              aside and protecting lands under this provision be less than the $2000 per
              developed acre, then the unused portion of the funds shall be reimbursed
              to the original payee, less reasonable administrative costs for the account
              holder. Lands selected for conservation shall be approved by the
              USFWS.
BIO-17 Implement Avoidance and Minimization Measures. Future projects covered by
       the General Plan occurring west of the Delta Mendota canal shall comply with
       the 1999 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Standardized Recommendations for
       Protection of the San Joaquin kit fox Prior to or During Ground Disturbance.
       These recommendations include the following:
        a. Pre-construction surveys shall be conducted no less than 14 days and no
              more than 30 days prior to the beginning of ground disturbance and/or
                           CITY of PATTERSON ~ General Plan
                                         NR-26

               construction activities for any project activity likely to impact the SJKF.
               Pre-construction survey reports shall be provided to the USFWS within 5
               days of completing surveys. If construction is phased, pre-construction
               surveys shall be conducted for each phase according to the timing and
               schedule stated above.
           b.  An employee education program shall be conducted.
           c.  Project-related vehicles shall observe a 20-mph speed limit in the project
               area, except on county roads and state and federal highways; this is
               particularly important at night when kit foxes are most active.
           d.  To the extent practicable, nighttime construction shall be minimized.
           e.  Off-road traffic outside of designated project areas shall be prohibited.
           f.  To prevent inadvertent entrapment of kit foxes or other animals during the
               construction phases of the projects, all excavated, steep-walled holes or
               trenches more than 2 ft deep shall be covered at the close of each
               working day by plywood or similar materials or equipped with one or more
               escape ramps constructed of earth fill or wooden planks. Before such
               holes or trenches are filled, they shall be thoroughly inspected for trapped
               animals.
           g.  All construction pipes, culverts, or similar structures with a diameter of 4
               inches or greater that are stored at a construction site for one or more
               overnight periods shall be thoroughly inspected for kit foxes before the
               pipe is subsequently buried, capped, or otherwise used or moved in
               anyway. If a kit fox is discovered inside a pipe, that section of pipe shall
               not be moved until the USFWS has been consulted. If necessary, and
               under the direct supervision of a qualified biologist, the pipe may be
               moved once to remove it from the path of construction activity.
           h.  All food-related trash items such as wrappers, cans, bottles, and food
               scraps shall be disposed of in a closed container and removed at least
               once a week from a construction or project site.
For projects with the potential to adversely impact Southwest Pond Turtles (Actinemys
marmorata) or their habitat, require the following:
BIO-18    Conduct focused presence/absence surveys for southwestern pond turtle. A
          qualified biologist shall conduct focused surveys for southwestern pond turtle
          in the area of the proposed project crossings at Del Puerto Creek. Focused
          surveys shall consist of a minimum of 4 daytime surveys, to be completed
          between 1 April and 1 June. If southwestern pond turtles are detected in or
          adjacent to the proposed project, nesting surveys shall be conducted, as
          detailed in implementation measure BIO-19.
BIO-19    Conduct focused surveys for southwestern pond turtle nesting. Focused
          surveys for evidence of southwestern pond turtle nesting shall be conducted
          by a qualified biologist if southwestern pond turtles are detected or assumed
          present in or adjacent to the proposed project and if suitable nesting habitat
          exists within 1300 ft of occupied habitat in an area where project-related
                            CITY of PATTERSON ~ General Plan
                                           NR-27
           ground disturbance will occur. The qualified biologist shall make the
           determination of what constitutes suitable nesting habitat. Surveys shall entail
           searching for evidence of pond turtle nesting, including remnant eggshell
           fragments, which may be found on the ground following nest depredation.
BIO-20     Monitoring and avoidance and minimization measures. A qualified biologist
           with demonstrated expertise with southwestern pond turtles shall monitor
           construction activities where pond turtles are present or assumed present.
           This person shall be approved by the CDFG prior to the onset of ground-
           disturbing activities. This biologist shall be referred to as the authorized
           biologist hereafter. The authorized biologist shall be present during all
           activities immediately adjacent to or within habitat that supports populations of
           southwestern pond turtles.
           Prior to the onset of construction activities the project proponent shall provide
           all personnel who will be present on work areas within or adjacent to the
           proposed project with the following information:
            a. A detailed description of the southwestern pond turtle including color
                 photographs
            b. The protective measures being implemented to conserve the
                 southwestern pond turtle and other species during construction activities
                 associated with the proposed project
            c. A point of contact if southwestern pond turtles are observed
            d. If the installation of fencing is deemed necessary by the authorized
                 biologist, one clearance survey for southwestern pond turtles shall be
                 conducted at the time of the fence installation. Additionally, focused
                 surveys as described under mitigation measure BIO-19 shall be
                 conducted prior to the initiation of construction each day.
BIO-21     Relocation of nests and individuals from construction zones. To mitigate
           potential impacts and permanent habitat losses resulting from project
           construction, the authorized biologist shall coordinate with CDFG to identify
           adjacent suitable habitat and relocate pond turtles and/or their nests.
For projects with the potential to adversely impact Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia)
or their habitat, require the following:
BIO-22     Implement CDFG protocol for burrowing owls. In conformance with federal
           and State regulations regarding the protection of raptors, a habitat
           assessment in accordance with California Burrowing Owl Consortium’s
           (CBOC) 1993 Burrowing Owl Survey Protocol and Mitigation Guidelines
           (Appendix F) shall be completed prior to the start of construction. Burrowing
           owl habitat within the proposed project and within a 500-ft buffer zone shall be
           assessed (“Assessment Area”). If the habitat assessment concludes that the
           Assessment Area lacks suitable burrowing owl habitat, no additional action is
                             CITY of PATTERSON ~ General Plan
                                            NR-28

       required. However, if suitable habitat is located on the Assessment Area, all
       ground squirrel colonies shall be mapped at an appropriate scale, and the
       mitigation measures covered in the CDFG protocol for burrowing owls shall be
       implemented:
        a. In conformance with federal and state regulations regarding the protection
            of raptors, a pre-construction survey for burrowing owls, in conformance
            with CDFG guidelines, shall be completed no more than 30 days prior to
            the start of construction within suitable habitat at the project site(s) and
            buffer zone(s). Three additional protocol-level surveys shall also be
            completed per CDFG guidelines prior to construction.
        b. Occupied burrows shall not be disturbed during the nesting season (1
            February through 31 August) unless a qualified biologist approved by
            CDFG verifies through non-invasive methods that either the birds have
            not begun egg-laying and incubation or that juveniles from the occupied
            burrows are foraging independently and are capable of independent
            survival. Eviction outside the nesting season may be permitted pending
            evaluation of eviction plans and receipt of formal written approval from the
            CDFG authorizing the eviction.
        c. A 250-ft buffer, within which no new activity shall be permissible, shall be
            maintained between project activities and nesting burrowing owls during
            the nesting season. This protected area shall remain in effect until 31
            August or at the CDFG’s discretion, and based upon monitoring evidence,
            until the young owls are foraging independently.
        d. If accidental take (disturbance, injury, or death of owls) occurs, the CDFG
            shall be notified immediately.
BIO-23 Compensate for loss of burrowing owl habitat. If surveys determine that
       burrowing owls occupy the site and avoiding development of occupied areas is
       not feasible, then habitat compensation on off-site mitigation lands shall be
       implemented based on the CBOC (1993) guidelines. HM lands comprising
       existing burrowing owl foraging and breeding habitat shall be acquired and
       preserved. An area of 6.5 acres (the amount of land found to be necessary to
       sustain a pair or individual owl) shall be secured for each pair of owls, or
       individual in the case of an odd number of birds. As part of an agreement with
       the CDFG, the project applicant shall secure the performance of its mitigation
       duties by providing the CDFG with security in the form of funds that would:
        a. Allow for the acquisition and/or preservation of 6.5 acres of HM lands;
        b. Provide initial protection and enhancement activities on the HM lands,
            potentially including, but not limited to, such measures as fencing, trash
            clean-up, artificial burrow creation, grazing or mowing, and any habitat
            restoration deemed necessary by CDFG;
        c. Establish an endowment for the long-term management of the HM lands,
            and;
                         CITY of PATTERSON ~ General Plan
                                       NR-29

           d. Reimburse the CDFG for reasonable expenses incurred as a result of the
                approval and implementation of this agreement.
For projects with the potential to adversely impact Nesting Avians, require the following:
BIO-24    Avoidance. To the extent practicable, construction shall be scheduled to avoid
          the nesting season, which extends from January through August.
BIO-25    To the extent construction cannot be scheduled to avoid the nesting season,
          conduct pre-construction surveys and monitoring for breeding birds. A
          qualified ornithologist shall conduct pre-construction surveys for nesting birds
          if construction and removal activities are scheduled to occur during the
          breeding season. Surveys shall be conducted in areas within 500 ft of
          construction activities. If breeding birds with active nests are found, a
          biological monitor shall establish a 500-ft buffer around the nest, and no
          activities shall be allowed within the buffer until the young have fledged from
          the nest, the nest fails or an ornithologist in cooperation with CDFG
          determines avoidance is possible by other means. The biological monitorshall
          conduct regular monitoring of the nest. If an active raptor nest is found close
          enough to the construction area to be disturbed by these activities, the
          ornithologist, in consultation with the CDFG, shall determine the extent of a
          construction-free buffer zone to be established around the nest.
For projects with the potential to adversely impact Nesting Raptors, require the following:
BIO-26    Avoid nesting season for raptors. To the extent practicable, construction shall
          be scheduled to avoid the nesting season for raptor species, which extends
          from 1 January through 31 August.-
BIO-27     If it is not possible to schedule construction between August and January,
           then pre-construction surveys for nesting raptors shall be conducted by a
           qualified ornithologist or wildlife biologist to ensure that no raptor nests shall
           be disturbed during Project implementation. A pre-construction survey shall
           be conducted no more than 14 days prior to the initiation of
           demolition/construction activities during the early part of the breeding season
           (January through April) and no more than 30 days prior to the initiation of
           these activities during the late part of the breeding season (May through
           August). During this survey, the qualified person shall inspect all trees and
           suitable structures in, and immediately adjacent to, the impact areas for
           raptor nests. If an active raptor nest is found close enough to the construction
           area to be disturbed by these activities, the ornithologist, in consultation with
           the CDFG, shall determine the extent of a construction-free buffer zone to be
           established around the nest.

                                          NR-30
For projects with the potential to adversely impact Special Status Plants, require the
          following:
BIO-28    Conduct Protocol-Level Surveys for Annual and Herbaceous Perennial
          species
BIO-29    Conduct focused protocol-level surveys in areas where suitable habitat is
          present. Before any ground disturbance has occurred, focused, protocol-level
          surveys for the above-named species shall be conducted by a qualified plant
          ecologist at all areas of ground disturbance. CNPS standards for conducting
          protocol-level surveys for special-status plants indicate that surveys must be
          accomplished in a floristic manner. Generally, floristic, protocol-level surveys
          require between 3 to 4 visits by a qualified plant ecologist during the growing
          season and blooming period for the species to identify all potential associate
          species and be reasonably certain the presence of an ephemeral, annual plant
          population may be detected. These surveys must be accomplished during a
          year of at least normal rainfall (timing and amount) to be reasonably certain
          the plant species are not remaining dormant in the seed bank (or not
          producing above-ground tissue, in the case of herbaceous perennials) due to
          unfavorable climactic conditions. Any populations found during surveys shall
          be fully described, mapped, and a CNDDB Field Survey Form or written
          equivalent shall be prepared for any special-status populations found to occur
          within the specific project footprint.
          If none of the special-status plant species are located within the project
          footprint after completion of protocol-level field surveys conducted during a
          year of average rainfall amount and timing, then no further mitigation
          measures are necessary. If populations of the plants are found then the
          remaining implementation measures NR-43 through NR-46 must be
          implemented.
BIO-30    Avoid direct and indirect impacts to any populations of special-status plant
          species found during surveys through project re-design. In consultation with a
          plant ecologist, the project shall be redesigned, constructed, and operated in
          such a way as to avoid direct and indirect impacts to the special-status plant
          population, if practicable. If complete avoidance of direct and indirect impacts
          to individuals is infeasible, the project proponent shall implement mitigation
          measureBIO-31 below. Populations of special-status plant species located
          within temporary construction areas shall be fenced or flagged for avoidance
          prior to construction.
BIO-31    Minimize indirect effects. Reduce indirect impacts to the species by the
          creation of a buffer zone during and after construction. Prior to site grading,
          any populations shall be identified by a qualified plant ecologist. A buffer zone
          shall be established around these areas and they shall be of sufficient size to
          eliminate potential disturbance to the plants from human activity and any other
                           CITY of PATTERSON ~ General Plan
                                          NR-31
       potential sources of disturbance. Temporary fences shall be constructed
       between any populations and project activities.
       The size of the buffer depends on the proposed use of the immediately
       adjacent lands and includes consideration of the plant’s ecological
       requirements (i.e., sunlight, moisture, shade tolerance, edaphic physical and
       chemical characteristics) that are identified by a qualified plant ecologist
       based on the growth requirements of the species. Public access to the area
       shall be restricted after the construction phase of the project as well.
BIO-32 Restore impacted habitat on-site. To mitigate impacts to habitat capable of
       supporting the above-named species, prior to any ground disturbance, a
       qualified restoration ecologist shall conduct a feasibility analysis to identify
       restoration opportunities within impacted areas. The feasibility analysis shall
       include background literature review, consultation with responsible agencies
       familiar with restoration of this habitat type, and an initial investigation of
       existing site conditions such as soils, hydrology, topography, and aspect. If
       restoration is deemed feasible, habitat shall be restored 1:1 (habitat restored:
       habitat impacted). A restoration and monitoring plan (RMP) shall be
       developed for the project and shall include the description of impacted habitat
       functions, values, and acreage; mitigation ratio; mitigation goal; location of
       mitigation area and existing condition; site manipulation/ preparation required;
       planting plan; maintenance plan; monitoring plan and detailed performance
       and final success criteria. Should restoration not be feasible, or should the
       restoration sites not meet performance criteria detailed within the time allotted
       within the RMP,
BIO-33 Preserve off-site habitat/management of existing populations. In the case that
       project re-design to completely avoid all direct and indirect impacts to
       populations located during surveys is not feasible, existing offsite habitat that
       is not already part of the public lands shall be preserved in perpetuity at a 1:1
       mitigation ratio (one acre preserved for each acre impacted) to mitigate
       impacts to habitat capable of supporting special-status species.              The
       preserved habitat shall be of similar habitat quality to the impacted areas in
       terms of soil features, extent of disturbance, vegetation structure, and
       dominant species composition, as determined by a qualified plant ecologist.
       The project proponent shall work with CDFG to identify appropriate nearby
       mitigation lands and ensure their permanent protection through an appropriate
       CDFG-approved mechanism, such as a conservation easement or fee title
       purchase. A conservation easement could be held by CDFG or an approved
       land management entity and shall be recorded within a time frame agreed
       upon by CDFG.
       Alternatively, if currently held private lands supporting the same vegetation
       types are not available within relatively close proximity to the impact locations,
                         CITY of PATTERSON ~ General Plan
                                       NR-32

       the project proponent shall seek a suitable funding mechanism involving an
       endowment or similar trust to fund activities on public lands that currently
       support known populations of the affected species that are under threat from
       factors such as noxious weed infestations or vandalism. The goal is to fund
       the long-term management of these species through implementation of
       specific management measures including such items as additional fencing,
       public education, grazing management, and so forth to the satisfaction of the
       public land managers.
BIO-34 A no-disturbance area of 100 feet shall be established from the high water
       mark, or outside edge of existing riparian vegetation,    whichever is greater,
       along Del Puerto Creek and existing        wetland and vernal pool habitats.
       Pedestrian and bicycle paths may be established within the no-disturbance
       area so long as such efforts do not conflict with the objective of protecting and
       enhancing existing riparian, wetland and vernal pool resources.
