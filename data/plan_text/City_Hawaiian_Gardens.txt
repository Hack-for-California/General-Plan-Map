                 1. Introduction
                                                                                  Section 1
The City of Hawaiian Gardens is dedicated to continually strive for new
opportunities and a flourishing quality of life for its residents. From its early
history of a Gabrielino Indian settlement, to the current setting, Hawaiian
Gardens has matured into a prominent and prosperous community.
Although the community has achieved many accomplishments, it
continually evolves and therefore must set its future course. That is what
this General Plan is intended to do.
The City of Hawaiian Gardens is a general law city, and was incorporated in
April 1964. Located in the Greater Los Angeles area, the City encompasses
0.9 square miles, bound by the City of Long Beach to the west and south,
the City of Lakewood to the north, and the City of Cypress to the east.
On May 14, 2002, the City Council adopted the official mission statement
for the community. The purpose of the mission statement is to create a
strong relationship between the residents, businesses, and employees. The
Mission Statement was endorsed by the Mayor and City Council:
         “Residents and the businesses are the most important
         people to enter the office; in person, by mail, or by
         telephone. Residents and the businesses are not dependent
         upon us; on the contrary, we are dependent upon them.
         Residents and the businesses are not an interruption of our
         work; they are the purpose of it….our work begins and ends
         with the residents and the businesses of Hawaiian Gardens,
         California, and is measured by how well we serve them.”
The City fosters and encourages its relationship with the community; one
key way in doing this is through the assessment of the community’s needs
and desires. The General Plan Update process provides an appropriate
mechanism to evaluate existing conditions in the community, and affirm a
desired future. The community has garnered several achievements, through
the expansion of amenities and useful facilities, to the development of
recreational programs and opportunities for residents. The General Plan
recognizes the progress and achievements the community has accomplished
thus far. The plan will build from this foundation by presenting a vision for
the community and supporting the vision with a comprehensive strategy to
achieve its vision.

  WHAT IS A GENERAL PLAN?
  A General Plan is a long-range planning document that addresses the key
  factors for a well-functioning community. According to Government Code
  Section 65300, every city and county in the State must adopt a
  comprehensive, long term general plan. The General Plan is a community’s
  vision of its shared future. It provides the blueprint for development
  throughout the community and addresses all aspects of development,
  including housing, traffic, natural resources, open space, safety, land uses,
  and public facilities. These policies are then translated into implementation
  tools, such as land use standards, rehabilitation programs, beautification
  plans, and others. Under State law, a city’s general plan must include a
  statement of the City’s development policies, and must include diagrams
  and text establishing goals, principles, standards, and plan proposals.
  In addition to providing a framework for a community’s development, a
  General Plan serves to inform residents, business owners, and stakeholders
  of the community planning process, and provides a forum for direct public
  participation. Government Code Section 65302 requires that a General Plan
  have seven specific elements addressed in a city’s general plan. These
  include land use, circulation, housing, open space, conservation, noise, and
  safety.
  In addition to the required elements, the City of Hawaiian Gardens has
  identified four additional elements that relate to the development and
  character of the community. These include the Economic Development
  Element, Air Quality Element, Capital Improvement Element, and
  Community Design Element.
  Land Use
  The Land Use Element identifies the proposed distribution and intensity of
  the uses of the land for different types of uses, including housing,
  commercial retail, industrial, open space, public facilities, and others.
  Circulation
  The Circulation Element identifies the location of existing and proposed
  major roads, transportation routes, and other local public utilities.
  Housing
  The Housing Element identifies and analyzes existing and projected
  housing needs and includes a statement of goals and policies, and scheduled
  programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing.

                                                                             1 – Introduction
Open Space
The Open Space Element is the plan for long-range development and
preservation of open space land. This land may include land for outdoor
recreation, public health, and safety.
Conservation
The Conservation Element addresses the identification, conservation, and
use of natural resources. This element may consider issues of flood control
and water and air pollution.
Noise
The Noise Element identifies and evaluates noise levels in the city,
particularly from roadways, industrial plants, and other major noise
sources, and helps to protect uses in the community that are sensitive to
noise impacts.
Safety
The Safety Element establishes policies and programs to protect the
community from risks associated with seismic, geologic, flood and fire.
Economic Development
The economic character of the community plays a vital role in the success
and prosperity of a local area. The Economic Development Element includes
goals and policies to guide physical development while retaining a sound
economic base and identifying potential for new market opportunities. In
addition, a fiscal analysis component will provide for a stable annual City
Budget.
Air Quality
Consideration of air pollution and its damaging effects is a necessary
component of public safety and welfare. The Air Quality Element examines
relevant conditions, land use and development patterns to establish policies
and programs related to air quality.
Capital Improvements
Capital improvements are the framework that supports development of a
city. The Capital Improvements Element identifies necessary improvements
and provides policy direction for short-term programs.

  Community Design
  The Community Design Element includes policies and programs that relate
  to the aesthetic environment of the community and provide a sense of place.
  The element provides goals and recommendations for specific areas of the
  community, including public realm, private realm, and residential areas.
  GENERAL PLAN UPDATE BACKGROUND
  The last comprehensive update to the City of Hawaiian Gardens General
  Plan was completed in 1994. An update is therefore needed because the
  current General Plan has outdated information, projections and policy
  direction. While many of the goals in the current General Plan have been
  accomplished, such as City Beautification and traffic improvements, more
  needs to be done in order to make Hawaiian Gardens an even better place to
  live, work, and play. The update will help the community guide future
  development for the next 10-15 years.
  The current General Plan (1994) includes several components, such as the
  mandated elements as required by State law; goals and policies relative to
  topic areas—such as land use, circulation, housing, economic development,
  open space, and others—and discussions on existing conditions throughout
  the community.
  PLANNING AREA
  The planning area refers to the area that is encompassed by the General
  Plan. The Hawaiian Gardens General Plan covers the extent of the City’s
  corporate boundaries, with the exception of public easements that are
  located within the City.

                                                                             1 – Introduction
COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION
The Hawaiian Gardens General Plan Update process commenced in April
2007. From the initiation of the process, the City had identified community
outreach and participation as a continuous priority. Through several
forums, the General Plan update process provided an opportunity for
residents and community members to engage in discussions that ranged
from identifying current issues in the community, selecting a unifying
vision, or explaining how current development projects relate to the general
plan.
The General Plan team began its community outreach program with
interviews with City staff. This uncovered an initial understanding of
significant issues in the community. Following early meetings, stakeholders
in the community were interviewed to gain further perspective on current
issues and opportunities facing the community. The outreach program is
further described as follows.
Meetings with City Staff
The kickoff meetings with City Staff revealed the first opportunity to
discuss existing conditions in the City, potential issues, and items for
inclusion in the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan. These initial meetings also
provided the General Plan team with clarity as to the City’s expectations
and the protocol for the update process. The General Plan team also
conducted a field survey and tour of the City with City staff and the Mayor
to obtain further knowledge and perspective of issues and conditions
within the community related to major General Plan themes.
Stakeholder Interviews
Over a period of two days, the General Plan team held intimate interviews
with community members in an effort to receive open and straightforward
input from various stakeholders. The City identified a group of stakeholders
that included elected officials, residents, and business representatives.
Selected interviewees included City Council members, Planning
Commissioners, Public Safety Commissioners, and Parks and Recreation
Commissioners. Department Directors for various City Agencies were
interviewed also, in focused discussions related to the community. Other
business representatives that conduct business daily within the City were
included as well.
Interview topics included current issues of concern, recent important
events in the community, and the current general plan content. Several
ideas were mentioned during the interviews, related to relations with local
media, City image, and interest for recreational amenities.

  Community Meetings
  The first workshops introducing the General Plan Update process to the
  community were held in June, 2007. The workshops provided an overview
  of the General Plan and the update process. The workshops served to gain
  feedback related to the community’s issues, in order to provide the
  framework for the update process. Workshop attendees participated in a
  collaborative discussion regarding direction and focus of the general plan.
  Additional workshops were later held in the Summer of 2008, presenting
  the Draft General Plan to the community and gathering feedback and
  comments on the plan.
  General Plan Advisory Committee
  A General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC) was appointed by the City
  Council to work with the General Plan team throughout the update
  process. The GPAC helped formulate the community vision and guiding
  principles, as well as relevant goals and policies for inclusion in the general
  plan. The GPAC reviewed materials and drafts of general plan components,
  and provided feedback and guidance on the development of the plan.
  Several GPAC meetings took place throughout the update process.
  Joint City Council and Planning Commission Study
  Sessions
  The joint meetings provided an opportunity to discuss progress and receive
  feedback from both the Council and Commission. Joint sessions were held
  at major milestones in the update process, with the first session on August
  21, 2007. The first session provided an opportunity to engage the Council
  and the Commission, as well as the public in general, on the issues
  uncovered during the initial outreach and data gathering phases.
  Circulation, housing, and economic development topics were discussed at
  the first meeting.

                                                                             Commission,      GPAC      and
                                                                             general public were invited to
                                                                             a study session for a
                                                                             presentation     of    existing
                                                                             conditions and findings on
                                                                             August 21, 2007.
The City also initiated additional forms of outreach, including newsletter
mailings, public notices, and a website. Newsletters were mailed to
households to keep them informed and up-to-date on the progress of the
update process. Newsletters also served as invitations to upcoming
community meetings. A website dedicated to the General Plan Update was
also developed. The website featured general plan overview information and
a calendar to mark the community meetings, GPAC meetings, and other
significant dates. The website also made easily available downloadable draft
reports, documents, and maps.

  ORGANIZATION OF THE GENERAL PLAN
  A General Plan is made up of text describing goals and policies, principles,
  implementation measures, and relevant maps and diagrams. Also of
  importance in a General Plan is the identification of issues that contribute
  to the goals, policies and implementation measures.
  An issue is an important unsettled community matter that is identified in
  the General Plan for the purpose of dealing with the plan’s policies, plan
  proposals, and implementation programs.
  A goal is a general direction-setter. It is an ideal end related to public
  health, safety, or general welfare. A goal is broad and is intended to be a
  general expression of community values.
  A policy is a specific statement that guides decision-making. Each policy
  directly relates to, and supports, a particular overall goal. It demonstrates
  the commitment of decision-makers to a course of action.
  An implementation measure is an action, procedure, program, or technique
  that carries out general plan policy. Each policy should have one or more
  corresponding implementation measures that will apply the policy to short-
  term actions.
  A diagram is a graphic expression of a general plan’s development policies,
  particularly its plan proposals. Examples of diagrams in this plan include
  distribution of land uses, circulation routes, urban design principles,
  geologic and other hazards, to mention a few.
  The Hawaiian Gardens General Plan contains 11 elements grouped into five
  major sections: Community Development, Housing, Infrastructure,
  Community Resources, and Public Safety.
  The Community Development Section (Section 2) contains the Land Use,
  Economic Development, and Community Design Elements. Statutory
  requirements mandate the Housing Element be updated every five years.
  For this purpose, the Housing Element is organized into a separate section
  (Section 3).
  The Infrastructure Section (Section 4) contains the Circulation and Capital
  Improvement Program Elements. The Community Resources Section
  (Section 5) contains the Conservation, Open Space and Recreation, and Air

COMMUNITY OVERVIEW
Regional Setting
The City of Hawaiian Gardens is located in Los Angeles County, generally
in the southeast area of the greater Los Angeles Metropolitan Area. The City
of Long Beach lies directly to the west and south, along with the City of
Lakewood to the north, and the Orange County City of Cypress to the east.
Hawaiian Gardens is regionally accessible from Interstate 605 (San Gabriel
River Freeway), which is located to the immediate west of the City. Also,
the Carson Street off ramp is located at the western entrance to the City.
The City is also regionally accessible from the Interstate 405 (Long Beach
Freeway) located to the south, and Highway 91 to the north.
Hawaiian Gardens is amongst the gateway cities of the southeast area of
Los Angeles County. Considered an industrial powerhouse, this southeast
sub-region of the County provides one out of every seven jobs in Southern
California. The City of Hawaiian Gardens is the smallest jurisdiction in the
County of Los Angeles, encompassing a total of 0.9 square miles.
Historical Context
From its early days as dairy farms and wooded marsh, to the present-day
bustling and lively community, Hawaiian Gardens has continually evolved
with character and spirit. Several historical factors influenced the shape,
size, and immediate development of the City, originating with the purchase
and subdivision of land for the exploration of oil.
It is widely believed that the colorful name of the City originated from a
small juice stand in the City’s early history. In the 1920’s, a trail followed
Coyote Creek and travelers going north or south on horseback rode it
frequently. A shack near the corner of present-day Norwalk Boulevard and
Carson Street was built as a “pit stop” for those travelers. The stand was
merely a bamboo frame covered with palm leaves, with two detached
covered outhouses out back. The stand was called Hawaiian Gardens, and
the name soon became synonymous with the area.
Around the turn of the 20th century, Frederick “Sheep” Smith owned
approximately 360 acres in the proximity of present day Norwalk Boulevard
and Carson Street. This land was largely subdivided during the “oil rush”.

                             However, by the late 1920s, Hawaiian Gardens was still sparsely populated
                             and considered a predominant agricultural area.
A farm truck is turning
north on Pioneer Boulevard
from 215th Street during the
late 1930s.
                             Frequent subdivisions and the post-war building boom continued to attract
                             a growing population to the region. It was determined that Hawaiian
                             Gardens would attempt incorporation into its own city. However, in the
                             early 1950s, Artesia attempted to annex the area of Hawaiian Gardens. The
                             response by Hawaiian Gardens residents was a steadfast move to
                             incorporate as a city. The first attempt at incorporation included everything
                             in its boundaries from the El Dorado Park land to the west, to the Orange
                             County line to the east. A last minute withdrawal, by the owners of the land
                             at El Dorado Park, prevented the first successful attempt at incorporation.
                             Shortly thereafter, the City of Long Beach also tried to annex the Hawaiian
                             Gardens area within its boundaries.
                             A second attempt to incorporate the City was made a year later, this time
                             obstructed by residents north of Carson Street. Tirelessly, Lee Ware and
                             Jack Leaf began a petition for signatures in support of incorporation. With
                             voter support, on April 9, 1964, Hawaiian Gardens became a city. At this
                             time, the area was less than a half square mile in size and the smallest city in
                             California.
                             At the time of City incorporation, the newly formed City Council moved
                             actively to initiate several changes. The Artesia, Bloomfield, and Carmenita
                             School Districts formed into ABC School District. Practically all streets
                             were still dirt roads, except Carson Street and Norwalk and Pioneer
                             Boulevards were paved. The Council prioritized paving so that before the
                             City was five years old, nearly all streets within the City were paved.
         10                                                                                   January 2010
                                                                              1 – Introduction
Flooding had also been a major issue, which led to the reconstruction of the
storm drainage system in the 1960s.
Another issue the City embarked upon was providing amenities and
recreation opportunities. The City Council appointed the first Parks and
Recreation Commission in 1965. The commission immediately began the
planning and development of youth programs, a teen post, and parkland,
including Lee Ware Park. The community center and other facilities
followed soon thereafter. The dedication and services of several citizens and
organizations sprung communal activity to life and provided a strong
foundation for a growing and evolving community.

COMMUNITY PROFILE
The community has seen substantial growth in population over recent
years. Total population in the City grew from 14,779 in 2000, to 15,922 in
2007. This represents an increase of 1,143 in approximately seven years, or a
7.7 percent increase. The number of households has also increased, from
3,507 total households in 2000, to 3,595 in 2007, an increase of 88
households. In 1990, persons per household (PPH) was 4.00, which then
gradually increased to 4.21 in 2000, and in 2007, the persons per household
was 4.43, for a total increase of 10.7 percent between 1990 and 2007 (Figure
1-1).
Between 1990 and 2007, the total population in Hawaiian Gardens
increased 16.7 percent. Compared to Los Angeles County overall, the
County experienced a similar 16.6 percent growth during the same period.
However, the person per household rate is significantly higher in Hawaiian
Gardens, compared to Los Angeles County. The 2007 persons per household
ratio in Hawaiian Gardens is 4.43, an increase of 5.2 percent since 2000;
whereas the Los Angeles County persons per household ratio is 3.00 in
2007, which represents an increase of 0.7 percent since 2000.

   In 2000, 36.8 percent of total population was under the age of 18; 29.5
   percent of the population was between the ages of 18 to 34; 27.6 percent of
   the population was between the ages of 35 to 64; and 6.2 percent of the
   population was ages 65 and older. The predominant age group in 2000 was
   the under 18 years of age population, which increased from 35.5 percent in
   1990.
   The average household income for Hawaiian Gardens also increased
   between 1990 and 2000. In 2006 dollars, the average household income
   increased from $53,377 in 1990, to $55,363 in 2000. Median income however,
   decreased from $48,394 in 1990, to $43,701 in 2000 (in 2006 dollars). The
   change in median income is comparable to Los Angeles County overall,
   which also decreased in median income from $57,339 in 1990, to $53,441 in
   2000 (in 2006 dollars).
   Racial and ethnic composition in the City’s population experienced little
   change between 1990 and 2000. In 1990, the largest ethnic category was
   Hispanic, which made up 66.6 percent of the population. The second largest
   group was White, comprising 19.8 percent of the population. 4.2 percent of
   the population was Black, 8.9 percent was Asian or Pacific Islander, and 0.5
   percent were classified as “Other”. :In 2000, Hispanic continued to be the
   largest classification, comprising 73.5 percent of the population. The largest
   change between 1990 and 2000 was the decrease of the White classification,
   from 19.8 percent in 1990 to 10.8 percent in 2000. The Black classification
   remained the same in 2000 as in 1990, at 4.2 percent of the population.

      Based on historical trends it is likely that the City of Hawaiian Gardens will
      experience growth in population, along with increases in households,
      employment, and persons per households (PPH). The Southern California
      Association of Government’s (SCAG) Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)
      growth forecasts indicate that the total population in 2003 was 15,633, and
      is estimated to reach a total of 17,509 persons by the year 2035, a projected
      increase of 1,876 persons. For the General Plan horizon, at the year 2020, it
      is estimated that the total population will be approximately 17,000.
      Households are expected to similarly increase, from a total of 3,566
      households in 2003, to a projected total of 4,107 households in 2035, an
      increase of 541 households. An interesting trend to note however is that
      although the persons per households (PPH) ratio has experienced an
      increase in recent several years, the ratio is actually expected to decrease. In
      2003 there were 4.38 persons per household. Based on SCAG RTP growth
      forecasts, persons per household begin to decrease between the years 2005
      and 2010. In 2005, there were 4.41 persons per household, and in 2010 this
      ratio drops to 4.39. It is predicted to continually decline through the year
      2035, reaching 4.26 persons per household. The table below (Table 1-1)
      includes demographic projections for the City of Hawaiian Gardens, and
      also compares the City to regional growth forecasts.

   COMMUNITY VISION
   The General Plan characteristically describes existing conditions in the
   community and provides guidance for its future. The plan establishes an
   organization for long-range planning and provides directive actions for
   implementation. The 1994 Hawaiian Gardens General Plan, although
   comprehensive, does not provide an overall direction or vision for the
   community’s future development. An overarching vision that is supported
   by the various elements in the General Plan is essential in providing a
   framework for the plan’s direction. The community vision is intended to be
   a statement that reflects the community’s values and that is supported by
   the general plan’s objectives.
   Throughout the course of extensive outreach and discussions with the
   community, the priorities and issues of significance were revealed and
   helped formulate a true vision of the community.
           “The City of Hawaiian Gardens will strive to maximize
           opportunities for the development and continued
           revitalization of a balanced community, by providing a safe,
           stable, and pleasant living environment for existing and
           future residents.
           New developments and future changes should display
           Hawaiian Gardens in a positive way to enhance the
           community’s reputation and character. Hawaiian Gardens
           will remain dedicated to promoting local businesses, and
           encourage vitality as it addresses beautification and quality
           of life.”
   In support of this vision statement, the community defined guiding
   principles that embody the community’s values and will guide all decisions
   made in implementing this General Plan. The guiding principles address
   major themes in the community that can be applied to the respective
   elements in the general plan, including land use, neighborhood, economic
   development, city image, recreation, public safety, and circulation.

         accommodate the travel needs of the City
        Provide a balance between economic development, regional
         mobility, and the preservation of residential neighborhoods and
         community facilities
        Ensure the efficient and safety of vehicular and non-motorized
         traffic on the City Streets
These guiding principles define a direct course for the general plan and
overall community. The Hawaiian Gardens General Plan horizon is the year
2020. Specifically, the general plan policy foundation is based upon the
goals and direction the community will strive to achieve by the year 2020.

   HAWAIIAN GARDENS AS A LIVEABLE CITY
   The fundamental ideas as part of the community’s vision and guiding
   principles aim to improve the livability of Hawaiian Gardens. Although
   Hawaiian Gardens is almost entirely built out, opportunities for change and
   improvement still exist through redevelopment endeavors, beautification
   programs, and new development. According to the Southern California
   Association of Governments (SCAG), the idea of creating and maintaining a
   livable community embodies the following eight elements:
        Design
            Streets, buildings and public spaces should be designed to human
            scale so that pedestrian access is ensured. Urban design should be
            used to enhance safety, prosperity and beauty, while preserving
            links to natural, cultural and architectural history.
        Center Focus
            A community is strengthened by an economically healthy town
            center or downtown combining commercial, cultural, civic and
            recreational uses. The center should be linked to both local and
            regional public transportation systems. Residential neighborhoods
            also benefit from an appropriately-scaled center focus that
            enhances neighborhood identity and character.
        Public Spaces
            Livable communities require open spaces that serve the entire
            community in the form of parks, squares, and greens. Boulevards,
            streets, and paths should also be designed to encourage their use
            throughout the day and into the night, making them safe and more
            of a community asset.
        Balance Transportation
            The transportation system should balance pedestrian, transit, and
            auto access to reduce the dependence on autos and provide secure,
            convenient and affordable mobility for all citizens. Compact land
            use patterns improve access to jobs, recreation, shopping and
            community services for all ages and incomes. Streets, pedestrian
            and bike paths are linked in a system of fully-connected and
            interesting routes to all destinations.
20                                                                January 2010

                                                                              1 – Introduction
      Diversity
         Livable communities contain a mix of housing and employment
         opportunities for citizens from all ages, ethnicities, and incomes.
         Civic facilities and services reflect the needs of residents.
     Environmental Sustainability
         Livable communities conserve resources, and help improve air
         quality so as not to jeopardize the quality of life of future
         generations. Energy conservation is encouraged by the design and
         placement of buildings, shading, and landscaping.
     Public Safety
         Livable communities are places where streets, buildings, and public
         spaces are designed to human scale so that pedestrian safety is
         ensured. Safer neighborhoods improve the quality of life, add to the
         attractiveness of a community, and create a sense of identity and
         place.
     Full Community Participation
         Livable communities come from the full participation of residents,
         neighborhood organizations, and the business community.
         Information and education about planning, land use and
         transportation issues and policies are readily available to promote
         involvement in decision-making.
Hawaiian Gardens residents have a vision of safety, revitalization of the
community, and a high quality of life. The guiding principles that will help
implement that vision are intended to foster safe and appealing
neighborhoods, provide dynamic commercial centers, celebrate the various
achievements of Hawaiian Gardens, and encourage healthy and active open
spaces for the residents that they serve. These principles will help Hawaiian
Gardens achieve its vision of a more livable community.

   RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
   The following plans and programs are plans, programs, and ordinances that
   must be considered in association with the General Plan when making
   development decisions.
   Federal Plans and Programs
   National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
   In an effort to improve the quality of water resources nationwide, the
   Federal government authorized the State Regional Water Quality Control
   Board and its regional offices, such as the Los Angeles Regional Water
   Quality Control Board to set up programs to implement National Pollutant
   Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) goals. Under the NPDES
   Stormwater Permit issued to the County of Los Angeles and to the City of
   Hawaiian Gardens as co-permittee, most new development projects in the
   City are required to incorporate measures to minimize pollutant levels in
   stormwater runoff. Compliance is required at the time construction permits
   are issued, as well as over the long term through periodic inspections.
   National Flood Insurance Program
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency administers the National
   Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP provides federal flood
   insurance subsidies and federally financed loans for eligible property
   owners in flood-prone areas. The City of Hawaiian Gardens participates in
   the NFIP to provide assistance to properties, both residential and
   commercial, which are within the 100-year floodplain, provided structures
   are elevated one foot above the 100-year floodplain.
   Clean Water Act
   Congress passed the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of
   1972 and the Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1977 to provide for the restoration
   and maintenance of the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the
   nation’s lakes, streams, and coastal waters. Primary authority for the
   implementation and enforcement of the CWA (33 U.S.C. 1251) now rests
   with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and, to a lesser
   extent, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In addition to the measures
   authorized before 1972, the CWA implements a variety of programs,
   including: federal effluent limitations and state water quality standards;
   permits for the discharge of pollutants and dredged and fill materials into
   navigable waters; and enforcement mechanisms. Section 404 of the CWA is
   the principal federal program that regulates activities affecting the integrity
   of wetlands. The Clean Water Act affects the policies in the Conservation
   Element of the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan.

California State Plans and Programs
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by the
state legislature in 1970 in response to a public mandate for thorough
environmental analysis of projects impacting the environment. The
provisions of the law and environmental review procedure are described in
the CEQA Law and Guidelines. CEQA in the instrument for ensuring that
environmental impacts of local development projects are appropriately
assessed and mitigated, and if not fully mitigated, ensuring that project
benefits to the community are substantial. The Department of Community
Services reviews projects for conformance with CEQA. This General Plan
was the subject of environmental analysis through the preparation of an
Environmental Impact Report (EIR), which analyzed and documented the
potential impacts of the General Plan’s policies and implementation
programs on the community’s environment.
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
California’s 1990 Seismic Hazards Mapping Act requires the State Geologist
to compile maps identifying and describing seismic hazard zones
throughout California. Guidelines prepared by the State Mining and
Geology Board identify the new hazard responsibilities of state and local
agencies in the review of development within seismic hazard zones
throughout California. Development on a site that has been designated as a
seismic hazard zone requires a geotechnical report, and local agency
consideration of the policies and criteria established by the Mining and
Geology Board. Over the years, the program has expanded to include
mapping of seismic-related hazards such as liquefaction- and slide-prone
areas. The Safety Element discusses seismic hazards associated with faults
and those identified on state seismic hazard maps.
Regional and County Level Plans and Programs
SCAG Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) undertakes
regional planning for the six-county SCAG region of Los Angeles, Orange,
Riverside, San Bernardino, Imperial, and Ventura counties. SCAG’s efforts
focus on developing regional strategies to minimize traffic congestion,
protect environmental quality, and provide adequate housing. The Regional
Comprehensive Plan and Guide sets forth broad goals intended to be
implemented by participating local and regional jurisdictions and the South
Coast Air Quality Management District. SCAG has adopted companion
documents to the Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide, most notable
the Regional Transportation Plan (see below).
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                              23

   Congestion Management Plan
   The Congestion Management Plan (CMP) is a program adopted by the
   state legislature and approved by voters in 1990 through Proposition 111. As
   a new approach to addressing congestion concerns, the CMP was created
   for the following purposes:
           To link land use, transportation, and air quality decisions
           To develop a partnership among transportation decision-makers on
            devising appropriate transportation solutions that include all
            modes of travel
           To propose transportation projects that are eligible to compete for
            state gas tax funds
   The CMP addresses mobility issues and localized traffic concerns for Los
   Angeles County and the Gateways Cities sub-region, including the City of
   Hawaiian Gardens. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
   Authority (Metro) is responsible for preparing the County’s CMP. Metro is
   required by state law to monitor local implementation of CMP elements.
   Local jurisdictions are required to monitor arterial congestion levels,
   monitor transit services along certain corridors, and implement an adopted
   trip reduction ordinance and land use analysis program.
   Regional Transportation Plan
   The Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) is a component of the Regional
   Comprehensive Plan and Guide prepared by SCAG to address regional
   issues, goals, objectives, and policies for the Southern California region into
   the early part of the 21st century. The RTP, which SCAG periodically
   updates to address changing conditions in the Southland, has been
   developed with active participation from local agencies throughout the
   region, elected officials, the business community, community groups,
   private institutions, and private citizens. The RTP sets broad goals for the
   region, and provides strategies to reduce problems related to congestion and
   mobility.
   In recognition of the close relationship between the traffic and air quality
   issues, the assumptions, goals, and programs contained in the Plan parallel
   those used to prepare the Air Quality Management Plan.
   Air Quality Management Plan
    The federal Clean Air Act requires preparation of plans to improve air
   quality in any region designated as a nonattainment area. The Air Quality
   Management Plan (AQMP) prepared by the South Coast Air Quality
   Management District, first adopted in 1994 and updated on a three-year
   cycle, contains policies and measures designed to achieve federal and state
   air quality standards within the South Coast Air Basin. The assumptions
   and programs in the AQMP draw directly from regional goals, objectives,
   and assumptions in SCAG’s Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide. The
24                                                                  January 2010

                                                                               1 – Introduction
AQMP is a comprehensive strategy to achieve clean air goals for the entire
South Coast Air Basin, which includes the City of Hawaiian Gardens.
City Level Plans and Programs
Hawaiian Gardens Zoning Ordinance
The Zoning Ordinance is the governing land use law for the City, and to the
degree practical, implements the goals, policies, and expectations of the
Hawaiian Gardens Land Use Plan. The Zoning Ordinance establishes land
use regulations for the City, allowable intensity of use, and development
standards for all land uses allowed in the City. There are a total of 15 zones
and four overlays, consisting of residential, commercial, industrial, and
public land uses. The Zoning Ordinance was last updated in March, 2006
and will be further updated as a result of adopting this General Plan.
Redevelopment Plan
State law authorizes cities to form redevelopment agencies and adopt
redevelopment plans as a tool to reduce blight and promote community
renewal. The Redevelopment Plan for the Hawaiian Gardens
Redevelopment Agency was adopted on November 27, 1973. The
redevelopment plan identifies Project Area No. 1, which includes the entire
corporate boundaries of the City of Hawaiian Gardens. The Redevelopment
Plan identifies the following actions in order to eliminate blight and
revitalize the community:
        Acquisition of certain real property;
        Demolition or removal of certain buildings and improvements;
        Relocation assistance to displaced residential and non-residential
         occupants;
        Installation, construction, or reconstruction of streets, utilities,
         landscaping, and other on-site and offsite improvements;
        Disposition of property for uses in accordance with the plan;
        Redevelopment of land by private enterprises or public agencies for
         uses in accordance with the plan;
        Providing for open space, recreational or other public land uses.
Specific Plans
There are currently two adopted specific plan areas within the City; a
specific plan area is located south of Carson Street and east of Hawaiian
Avenue, on Canada Drive; and the other specific plan area is located east of
Norwalk Boulevard and north of 214th Street, Schultze Drive.
Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan
The City of Hawaiian Gardens Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan includes
resources and information to assist the City in reducing risk and preventing
loss from future natural hazard events. The plan was adopted on August 24,
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                 25

   2004. The action items address multi-hazard issues, as well as activities
   from earthquake, flooding, and windstorms. The goals of the plan are to
   protect life and property, public awareness, balanced natural systems,
   encourage communication and leadership in the implementation of the
   plan, and strengthen emergency facilities and services.
   Hawaiian Gardens Emergency Operations Plan
   The Hawaiian Gardens Emergency Operations Plan was adopted in March,
   2003. The plan provides a strategy for the City’s planned response to
   extraordinary emergency situations associated with natural disasters,
   technological incidents, and national security emergencies. The focus of the
   plan is on operations to address potential large-scale disasters, which can
   generate unique situations requiring unusual emergency response. The goals
   of the Emergency Operations Plan are to provide effective life safety
   measures and reduce property loss, provide for the rapid resumption of
   impacted businesses and community services, and provide accurate
   documentation and records required for cost recovery efforts.
   The City has adopted the Standardized Emergency Management System
   (SEMS) for managing response to multi-agency and multi-jurisdiction
   emergencies and to facilitate communications and coordination between all
   levels of the system and among all responding agencies. Title 19 of the
   California Code of Regulations establishes the standard response structure
   and basic protocols to be used in emergency response and recovery. Fully
   activated, the SEMS consists of five levels: field response, local government,
   operational areas (countywide), OES Mutual Aid Regions, and state
   government.

Land Use Element
INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element designates the location and extent of the uses of land
within the City for housing, business, industry, open space, recreation,
public buildings and grounds, and other categories of public and private
uses of land. The Land Use Element serves as a guide to use and
development of land in the City of Hawaiian Gardens. In addition, the land
use element includes standards of population density (the number of
housing units allowed per acre) and building intensity (the allowed square
footage of nonresidential uses).
The Land Use Element functions as a guide to decision makers, City staff,
planners, and the general public as to the established ultimate land use
pattern at “build out” of the Land Use Plan. The Land Use Element is the
foundation for decision making and policies related to development within
the City. The element provides the long-range framework for day-to-day
actions. Its primary implementation tool is the City’s Zoning Code and
Zoning Map.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Land Use Element is a mandatory component of a general plan.
According to State law, the Land Use Element must be consistent with all
other General Plan elements. Several issues, goals, and policies discussed in
one element may coincide with those related to other elements in the
General Plan. However, this is an exemplary approach to ensuring that the
community’s issues and needs are addressed through implementation
strategies and actions.
The Land Use Element has the broadest scope of all elements because of its
pivotal role in tying together all matters and issues related to the
development of the community. Essentially, the Land Use Element and in
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                    29

                             turn, the Land Use Plan, are often referred to during the development
                             review process. The Land Use Element relates to the setting and framework
                             of the circulation system, and ensures that public facilities and basic
                             infrastructure have the capacity to serve all areas of the community. The
                             Land Use Element also identifies and mandates the preservation of open
                             space and natural resources. The Land Use Element also accounts for the
                             existing housing stock of the community and potential future needs,
                             affirming the residential development pattern. The Land Use Element, along
                             with the other 10 elements in the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan, provides
                             the long range context for development decisions and actions.
Single family residences are
the predominant housing type
in Hawaiian Gardens.

LAND USE CONTEXT
The community’s early history stems back to a foundation as a primarily
agricultural settlement. Around the turn of the twentieth century, the area
was largely unsettled, aside from a few scattered farms. During the early
1900’s, an attempt to relieve a water shortage revealed oil instead, causing a
surge of interest in the area. Before long, land was being bought up in order
to quickly subdivide large lots to sell off. It was eventually realized that
there was no oil under Hawaiian Gardens; however, the newly subdivided
land attracted several farmers and new families to the area.
Into the 1930’s Hawaiian Gardens continued to prosper as a small rural
community of mostly dairy farms. Early developmental constraints revealed
severe flooding, lack of a dependable potable water supply, and seismic
hazards. However, external factors continued to influence a rapid growth
rate, including the Great Depression and the post-war population boom.
Development within the community reacted to these changes with tract
homes quickly springing up south of Carson Street. These historical
subdivisions influenced the layout of land in the community, even to
present day. The first zoning map was recorded in August, 1971, which
looks strikingly similar to the current land use plan of the City.
The highly urbanized framework of Hawaiian Gardens indicates that
current land use distribution will continue to reflect historical land use
patterns. Currently, the City is made up of residential, commercial,
industrial, and public and quasi-public land uses. Residential land uses
account for nearly 60 percent of the total land area in the community, and
the second largest land use, commercial, makes up over 23 percent of land
area (Table 2-1). All public facilities, when consolidated, make up almost 14
percent of the land use distribution.

   The regional setting of the community is also predominantly urban,
   surrounded on all sides by existing, incorporated cities.
   LAND USE PATTERNS
   Because the major arterials, Carson Street and Norwalk Boulevard,
   perpendicularly intersect at the general center of Hawaiian Gardens, they
   serve as axes, dividing the layout of the land into quadrants. In conformance
   with this organization, all commercial and industrial uses are located along
   these axes. The City’s traditional “Downtown” is located on Norwalk
   Boulevard just north of Carson Street. As other newer commercial shopping
   centers developed over the years this older area has declined in importance.
   Commercial uses within Hawaiian Gardens range from automotive related,
   car wash, and service-related uses, to restaurants, shops, major commercial
   shopping centers, and regional entertainment features, such as the
   Hawaiian Gardens Casino and Bingo Club. The City’s industrial area is
   concentrated in an industrial park located at the northern edge of the City,
   west of Norwalk Boulevard.
   The residential neighborhoods in Hawaiian Gardens offer diverse housing
   opportunities and alternative options to that of the single family detached
   home. The southwest quadrant of the community contains a concentration
   of duplexes and single-family detached homes on very small lots. This
   subdivision pattern dates back prior to incorporation of the City; upon
   initial urbanization, this area was part of Los Angeles County. The
   southeast quadrant offers primarily duplexes, or two-family residences, in
   addition to multi-family options, including apartments, town homes, and
   condominiums. The two mobile home parks in the community, Lakewood
   Estates Mobile Home Park and Bloomfield Mobile Home Park, are also
   located in the southeast area.
   The northwest portion of the community includes various interspersed
   residential land uses. This area includes Low Density, Medium Density,
   Intermediate Density, and High Density residential land use designations.
   There are two large high-density multi-family complexes in this area; the
   Creekside Condominiums located on Norwalk Boulevard, north of 214th
   Street, and another apartment complex located on Centralia Avenue, east of
   Pioneer Boulevard. In addition, Fire Station No. 34, operated by the Los
   Angeles County Fire Department, and the U.S. Post Office, are located along
   Norwalk Boulevard within this quadrant of the City
   Finally, the northeast portion of Hawaiian Gardens features the
   community’s lowest-density residential land uses. The lowest density area
   is located north and south of 213th Street, east of Norwalk Boulevard. This
   area is being preserved as Very Low Density, with lots that average 10,000
   square feet in lot size. One of the City’s two specific plan areas is also
   located in the community’s northeast area on Schultze Drive. In addition,
   there are several churches located throughout Hawaiian Gardens that are
   typically located in residential neighborhoods.

   LAND USE ISSUES
   There are several notable land use trends that exist within the City. The
   Land Use Element contains goals and policies to address current issues in
   Hawaiian Gardens:
         The southwest and southeast quadrants characteristically contain
          many narrow, 25-foot wide single family residential lots that are
          uncommon in the remainder of the City. Due to the narrow width of
          the lots, building setbacks and open space amenities, such as front
          yard space and landscaping, are extremely limited. Since almost all
          of these small lots are within the Medium Density land use
          category, which allows the development of duplexes, the General
          Plan will need to address the development of these small lots in a
          manner that protects the existing character of the neighborhood
          and ensures quality development with associated open space
          amenities.
         The Code Enforcement Department handles a high number of
          property maintenance cases. A field survey of neighborhoods
          indicates that several residences lack proper maintenance and have
          front yards that appear unkempt. This may include aging and
          poorly maintained frontages, cars parked on front lawn areas, and
          dilapidated fencing.
         Another code enforcement issue is the prevalence of illegal garage
          conversions. Single family homes that include garages are often
          converted into an additional living space, such as a bedroom or den.
          This problem is unfortunately related to other issues common in the
          community, like overcrowding and vehicle parking spilling onto the
          street, causing the lack of available surface street parking, in turn,
          making the residential circulation network increasingly narrow.
         Many commercial uses are undistinguished, which are uses that do
          not serve a large retail base. The consolidation of small lots into
          larger development sites should be a priority for this area. Without
          the City’s assistance in land assembly, this area will likely not
          achieve its full development potential and may continue to decline.
         Except for the larger shopping centers along Carson Street,
          commercial properties tend to be small and relatively shallow. Land
          assembly to accommodate larger projects is difficult for small
          developers, which hampers larger, more substantial and sustainable
          development. These areas would benefit from additional
          commercial land, where appropriate, along Carson Street and
          Norwalk Boulevard south of Carson Street. General Plan policies
          and programs should support the consolidation of small lots so that
          larger development areas can be assembled and more substantial
          commercial development can take place.
36                                                               January 2010

                                                                               2 – Community Development
       Other smaller strip commercial centers are located on Norwalk
        Boulevard, along with what has become known as the “Downtown
        District”, located on Norwalk Boulevard between Carson and 214th
        Streets. The City has designated this area for intense rehabilitation
        and has implemented a façade improvement program to help
        improve the physical appearance of the district. A streetscape
        enhancement program is also planned, including the
        undergrounding of overhead electrical lines. Providing the right
        mixture of land uses in this area will be critical to its success as a
        pedestrian-oriented commercial district.
       The Downtown District should be identified and preserved as an
        effective pedestrian environment. In order to achieve this, it will be
        necessary to ensure that the types of commercial uses allowed to
        locate there are appropriate and contribute to a pleasant pedestrian
        experience. Uses such as automobile repair and offices that do not
        contribute to the desired retail commercial and pedestrian
        character of the area should not be allowed. Shops fronting on
        Norwalk Boulevard should be retail in nature with merchandise
        display windows that invite shoppers into the store for a closer
        look. Restaurants are also the types of uses that should be
        encouraged and assisted.
       Almost all of the older developments in the Downtown District lack
        sufficient parking. Parking areas should be encouraged to the rear of
        buildings, in order to improve customer parking and preserve the
        walkability of the area.
LAND USE OPPORTUNITIES
Although the Land Use Plan remains consistent with historical land use
patterns, the General Plan Update provides an opportunity for including
essential additions to the City’s development policy. In addition to crafting
goals, policies, and implementing actions, the Land Use Element and Plan
also contains the following:
       Update of existing land use conditions in Hawaiian Gardens;
       Update of development and buildout projections to the General
        Plan horizon, year 2020. Projections for population, residential, and
        non-residential development have been updated for the year 2020;
       The establishment of density ranges for residential land uses, which
        include Very Low Density, Low Density, Medium Density,
        Intermediate Density, High Density, and Mobile Home Park
        residential land use designations;
       The establishment of building intensities for all non-residential
        (commercial, industrial, and institutional) land use categories;

           Establishment of guiding principles which direct the Land Use
            Element goals, policies, and implementing actions;
           Expansion of some commercial areas along Carson Street and
            Norwalk Boulevard in order to create deeper commercial
            development areas to accommodate more efficient development in
            the future.
           The creation of a new residential land use category, Very Low
            Density Residential (4 DU/Acre), in order to preserve the City’s
            only remaining estate residential lots; and
           The establishment of a Downtown Commercial district and
            subsequent development standards and regulations to encourage
            revitalization of the City’s downtown area and facilitate the
            formation of a pedestrian-friendly district.
   The City of Hawaiian Gardens is approximately 99 percent built out, and as
   such, the Land Use Plan focuses on preserving residential neighborhoods,
   guiding the remaining development and redevelopment opportunities, and
   encouraging the revitalization of focus areas.
   GUIDING PRINCIPLES
   In support of the General Plan vision statement, the Land Use Element
   guiding principles embody the community’s values and will guide all
   decisions made pursuant to this General Plan. Due to the interconnected
   nature of the Land Use Element’s subject, guiding principles that support
   neighborhood and community image topics have been included, that are
   also featured in the Housing and Community Design Elements, respectively.
   Land Use Guiding Principles
           Collaborate with applicants and developers to provide high quality development
            projects
           Ensure compatibility between residential and nonresidential land uses to create
            harmonious living environments
           Ensure continued economic development through the provision of adequate sites
            for commercial and industrial development
   Neighborhood Guiding Principles (Housing)
           Preserve and enhance the community’s quality of life by fostering safe and
            appealing neighborhoods

                                                                            2 – Community Development
        Provide a variety of housing options

        Promote Hawaiian Gardens as a safe, friendly and diverse community
        Celebrate the community’s achievements
        Ensure a high quality visual environment
These guiding principles together are concise ideas for focus of the Land
Use Element and will help shape future land use and development decisions
in Hawaiian Gardens.

   LAND USE PLAN
   Interpreting the Plan
   The General Plan identifies specific categories of land use. Whether it is
   residential, commercial, industrial, open space, public facilities, or other
   types of uses, each lot within the City is assigned a specific land use
   designation. Land use designations may specify density and/or intensity of
   development for each site. Density, which commonly refers to the number of
   residential dwelling units in a given land area, is often used as an
   interpretation for residential land development capacity. The standard
   format to describe residential density is dwelling units per acre (DUs/Acre),
   which is used as a measurement of population and development capacity for
   each area. This represents the number of dwelling units or development
   capacity per acre. Each residential designation also includes an allowable
   range in density that is applied to each site. The lower end of the density
   range describes the least (minimum) amount of development required, and
   the higher end of the density range represents the maximum number of
   allowable units. In addition to the residential land use density ranges, the
   zoning code provides further standards for required minimum lot size and
   allowable uses.
44                                                                 January 2010

Alternatively, building intensity is used to describe development capacity
for commercial, industrial, and other nonresidential uses. The standard
commonly used for building intensity is floor area ratio (FAR). This
describes the gross floor area permitted on a site divided by the total net
area of the site. An FAR is typically applied on a parcel by parcel basis; that
is, the intensity (permitted floor area) is calculated specific to the area
(square feet) of a particular site.

General Plan Land Use Designations
Residential Land Uses
Residential land uses include all the areas dedicated to housing the
residents of Hawaiian Gardens. Other related uses may be permitted, as
further determined by the Zoning Code. Hawaiian Gardens features a
diverse housing stock, providing low density estate lots, high density
apartments and multi-family housing, and various types of single family
detached homes and duplexes.
Very Low Density Residential (Density Range: 1 – 4 DUs/Acre)
The Very Low Density Residential designation is a new category in the
Land Use Plan. The purpose of this designation is to preserve the City’s only
remaining large, estate residential lots. Lots within this designation are
typically an average of 10,000 square feet.
Permitted uses in this category are single family residences, accessory
dwelling units, small community care and day care facilities, cultural and
educational facilities, recreational uses, and public facilities. Permitted uses
are subject to consistency with zoning code requirements.
Low Density Residential (Density Range: 4.1 – 8.4 DUs/Acre)
The Low Density Residential designation allows for relatively large single-
family residential lots. Typically, residential lots average approximately
5,000 square feet, and contain one dwelling unit per lot. Allowable uses
include single-family dwellings, in addition to:
        Accessory dwelling units
        Small community care and day care facilities
        Cultural and educational facilities
        Recreational uses
        Public facilities
Uses permitted are subject to consistency with zoning code requirements.
Medium Density Residential (Density Range: 8.5 – 17.0 DUs/Acre)
Areas in the Medium Density Residential designation are single-family uses
and duplexes. Medium Density Residential is most prevalent in the
southwest portion of the city, with 25-foot lot frontages as standard.
Allowable uses in this designation include single-family homes, duplexes,
multi-family developments, and public park facilities. Other use permitted,
subject to consistency with zoning code requirements, include:
        Ancillary uses and accessory dwelling units
        Small community care and day care facilities
        Cultural and educational facilities
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                            49

           Recreational uses
           Public facilities
   Intermediate Density Residential (Density Range: 17.1 – 19.0 DUs/Acre)
   The Intermediate Density Residential land use designation is classified by
   multi-family residences, including town homes, condominiums, and other
   multi-family residential uses. Densities within this land use category allow
   up to 19 dwelling units per net acre. Additional uses permitted consistent
   with zoning code requirements include:
           Ancillary uses and accessory dwelling units
           Small community care and day care facilities
           Cultural and educational facilities
           Recreational uses
           Public facilities
   High Density Residential (24.0 DUs/Acre)
   High Density Residential land uses are also intended for multi-family
   residences, including town homes, apartments, and condominiums.
   Densities within this land use category allow between 17.1 and 24 dwelling
   units per net acre. The locations of high density land uses are in close
   proximity to commercial areas, for increased accessibility and convenience.
   Additional uses permitted consistent with zoning code requirements
   include:
           Ancillary uses and accessory dwelling units
           Small community care and day care facilities
           Cultural and educational facilities
           Recreational uses
           Public facilities
   Mobile Home Park
   The Mobile Home Park land use designation allows for mobile home living
   areas, not to exceed 21 dwelling units per net acre. There are two existing
   mobile home parks within Hawaiian Gardens, which serve an alternative
   housing type offered in the City. Additional uses permitted consistent with
   zoning code requirements include:
           Ancillary uses and accessory dwelling units
           Small community care and day care facilities
           Cultural and educational facilities
           Recreational uses
           Public facilities

                                                                                2 – Community Development
Nonresidential Land Uses
Nonresidential land uses include all categories of land use other than
residential throughout Hawaiian Gardens, including commercial, industrial,
open space, institutional uses, and public facilities.
General Commercial (0.5 FAR)
General Commercial land uses are classified by a broad range of commercial
services and uses, including retail sales, service-related uses, entertainment,
community service organizations, and professional offices. All General
Commercial areas are located along the City’s major arterial corridors,
Carson Street and Norwalk Boulevard. The maximum floor area ratio
allowable for General Commercial land uses is 0.5. The maximum allowable
building intensity is also supported by the zoning code, which establishes
maximum site coverage of 70 percent. Additional uses permitted in the
General Commercial designation that are consistent with the zoning code
include:
        Inns and boarding houses
        Institutional uses and public facilities
        Emergency shelters
        Health services
        Social service facilities
        Mixed-use development, on a minimum lot size of 1 acre.
The City has recognized that the City’s population will continue to grow in
the future, resulting in the impending need for diverse housing
opportunities in the community. In order to address this need, mixed-use
development will be encouraged in the City. In order to be classified as
mixed-use, development should include the following components:
        A combination of two or more significant land uses as part of a
         single or contiguous site;
        Significant functional and physical integration of project
         components; and
        Development in conformance with a coherent plan.
There are considerable benefits to mixed-use development, including
increasing housing options within the community, reducing auto
dependency, and creating a sense of place.
Light Industrial (0.5 FAR)
There is currently one industrial park, located in the northwest corner of
the City. The Light Industrial land use designation includes light intensive
industrial uses, which are not likely to have adverse effects upon each other
or upon adjacent commercial and residential land uses. Additional uses
permitted in the Light Industrial designation that are consistent with the
zoning code include:

           Social service facilities
           General offices
           Parking lot, garage, or structure
   Public and Quasi-Public Land Uses
   Civic
   The Civic land use designation includes public land uses, such as the City
   Administration Complex (City Hall), the Library and future Public Safety
   Center site, and other miscellaneous public sites.
   Park
   The Park land use designation includes the designated public park space
   within the City. The three existing parks—Pioneer Park, Clarkdale Park,
   and Lee Ware Park—include the Park designation. Any future additional
   park space would also be classified as a Park land use.
   Elementary School
   The Elementary School land use designation includes the City’s two
   elementary schools, Venn W. Ferguson Elementary School and Hawaiian
   Elementary School. The schools are within the ABC Unified School District,
   which operates and maintains each facility and associated functions.
   Junior High School
   The Junior High School land use designation includes Pharis F. Fedde
   Junior High School, located in the northwest corner of the City. Fedde
   Junior High School serves students at the seventh and eighth grade levels
   within the ABC Unified School District.
   Institutional
   The Institutional Land Use Designation includes the Fire Station and Post
   Office, both quasi-public land uses. The Institutional category replaces the
   previous Land Use Plan’s Fire and Post Office designations, and combines
   the uses under one land use designation.
   Hospital
   The Hospital land use designation includes the Tri-City Regional Medical
   Center, located near the Pioneer Boulevard and 215th Street intersection.
   The hospital provides inpatient and outpatient services, and contains a total
   of 137 beds.
52                                                               January 2010

                                                                                2 – Community Development
Assembly
The Assembly land use designation includes assembly service facilities
typically used for religious worship and activities, and maintained and
operated by an organization or religious body.
Overlays and Policy Areas
Artesia Norwalk Storm Drain
The Artesia Norwalk Storm Drain is located west of—and runs parallel
to—Norwalk Boulevard. The drain traverses almost the entire City,
generally approximately 100 feet in width, and extending slightly below the
northern City boundary, directly adjacent to the fire station. Currently, the
entire drain is a concrete lined channel.
Coyote Creek
The Coyote Creek channel flows northeast to southwest, located along the
eastern edge of the City. The entire length of the channel that flows through
the City is concrete lined. A proposed future regional bike trail will also run
along the western bank of the channel.
Downtown Policy Area
The Downtown Policy Area is a new component of the Land Use Plan, for
the City’s traditional downtown area located along Norwalk Boulevard
north of Carson Street, between 214th Street to the north and Tilbury Street
to the south. This commercial area is established in order to preserve the
City’s pedestrian-scale commercial and to develop this specific area of the
City for small-scale retail businesses, specialty shops, personal service uses,
and restaurants that support resident’s needs and also cater to a broader
subregional market.
The City has prioritized the revitalization and beautification of the
Downtown District to allow for the preservation of the area’s unique design
form and quality, encouragement of high quality development projects, and
the rejuvenation of the Downtown pedestrian atmosphere through the
installation of new streetscape and public realm elements.
The Downtown Policy Area is intended to accommodate a variety of retail
uses within a well-designed environment with a strong pedestrian-oriented
character. The maximum floor area ratio allowed for Downtown land uses is
0.5 FAR. In order to promote a pedestrian atmosphere, development
standards should require that new buildings be constructed adjacent to the
sidewalk for convenient pedestrian access. Goals and policies established in
the Land Use and Community Design Elements are intended to support
specific development standards and design criteria established in the
zoning code.

   Specific Plan Area
   Specific Plan Areas outlined in the Land Use Map are areas with an adopted
   specific plan, subject to development standards and design criteria of the
   approved specific plan for the area. The Specific Plan Areas are located at 1)
   Canada Drive at Hawaiian Avenue, south of Carson Street, and 2) Schultze
   Drive, at 214th Street, north of Carson Street.
   Casino Overlay
   The Casino Overlay includes the parcels located on Carson Street, between
   Pioneer Avenue and Juan Avenue. The Hawaiian Gardens Casino currently
   operates their 57,513 square foot facility at this location. The Casino Overlay
   is intended to allow for a gaming use, operating as a card club or casino
   with accessory uses provided for the convenience of the patrons.
   Bingo Overlay
   The Bingo Overlay is located along Norwalk Boulevard, south of Carson
   Street and north of 221st Street. The purpose of the Bingo Overlay is to
   permit the relocation and expansion of the proposed Bingo Club at this site.
   The overlay permits the operation of bingo facilities at the location, and is
   consistent with the Bingo Club Overlay Zone in the zoning code.
   Study Areas
   The Study Area on the Land Use Map includes two parcels located at
   Farlow Street, north Carson Street. The Study Area is currently
   inaccessible, with no direct access from any side. Future development of
   this area would require direct access; therefore the area is primarily suitable
   for a comprehensive development project that consolidates existing lots.
   Land uses that may be considered appropriate for this area include low-
   density residential or general commercial. The City may entertain
   development proposals with either or both of these land uses with approval
   of a specific development plan, General Plan amendment, and subsequent
   amendment of the Zoning Map.

   LAND USE FOCUS AREAS
   In accordance with the General Plan vision and goals and policies presented
   in the Land Use Element, specific areas in the City have been identified as
   areas of focus for revitalization and rehabilitation. Through the
   implementation of this plan, the City will strive to attract quality
   development in the following areas (Exhibit 2-2):
   1.  Downtown District
   This area is located along Norwalk Boulevard, between Tilbury Street to the
   south and 214th Street to the north. The Downtown District is made up of
   commercial uses, specifically small and local serving businesses. The area is
   part of the City’s Norwalk Boulevard Façade Renovation Program, which
   includes a façade improvement concept and streetscape enhancements.
   In order to create a dynamic downtown atmosphere, specialty businesses
   that attract residents and visitors—such as coffee shops, restaurants, and
   boutiques—should be located here. In addition, sufficient parking to meet
   the demands of existing and potential businesses should also be considered.
   The General Plan Update includes policies focused on the revitalization of
   the Downtown District, and has also expanded the commercial area to
   provide larger and varying lot sizes, in order to be viable and attractive to
   diverse new business opportunities.
   2. South Norwalk Boulevard Corridor
   The South Norwalk Boulevard Corridor lies between 221st Street and the
   City border to the south. The corridor is commercially designated and
   covers approximately 12 acres. There are several underutilized and blighted
   parcels, and businesses located in small and indistinct strip centers. The
   existing subdivision pattern makes it difficult to assemble development
   areas adequate to support economically viable commercial uses. This area
   should be of focus in order to attract new larger developments through
   parcel consolidation. Emphasis should be placed on attracting commercial
   development that is compatible with adjoining residential land uses; the
   incorporation of a consistent landscape theme on street frontages and
   within the public right-of-way; consistent design and signage treatment;
   and the provision of safe and adequate parking areas.
   3. Study Area
   This area consists of two parcels located at the eastern end of Farlow Street.
   In the 1994 General Plan, this area was part of a larger area intended for
   recycling or major development, specifically new single family residential
   homes. One parcel is currently landlocked, and therefore cannot be
   developed individually, without public access. This area is designated as a
   Study Area in the Land Use Map, in order to provide a comprehensive
   development that will include public access. The area will respond to future
56                                                                 January 2010

                                                                            2 – Community Development
development demands, with a possibility of either residential or commercial
development.
4. Southwest Portion
This area is made up of residences on the southwest portion of the City,
generally south of 221st Street and west of Ibex Road. This area has a high
concentration of substandard housing, blighted conditions, code violations,
and is characterized by a subdivision pattern that makes parcel assembly
difficult. Redevelopment and revitalization in this area will focus on
substandard housing, the provision of adequate improvements with new

    LAND USE PLAN REVISIONS
    This section details specific revisions made to the Land Use Plan as
    proposed in the comprehensive General Plan Update. Revisions were made
    to the 1994 Hawaiian Gardens Land Use Plan in consideration of various
    factors such as the community’s changing needs, a desire to facilitate
    economic revitalization, and a need to accommodate future potential
    residents and visitors. Table 2-3 identifies revisions to the plan.

Economic Development
Element
INTRODUCTION
The Economic Development Element provides guidance to meet the needs
of Hawaiian Gardens residents and workers and improve the community’s
economic vitality and quality of life. The Economic Development Element
addresses job creation and retention, means toward economic prosperity,
stabilization of the local tax base, and job diversification. A balanced,
healthy economy is essential for a community’s well-being. Influencing and
investing in the process of economic development allows a community to
determine its future direction and guide appropriate types of development
according to its own values. The element also addresses economic
development challenges and opportunities that currently face the City, and
contains goals and policies to address these challenges, provide for
economic viability, and a stable economic character of the community.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Economic Development Element is an optional General Plan element,
according to Government Code Section 35303. The Economic Development
Element must be consistent with the other elements of a General Plan. The
City of Hawaiian Gardens believes that economic development is a
significant topic related to the physical development of the City. The
Economic Development Element is closely related to the Land Use,
Circulation, and Housing Elements. The Land Use Element must be able to
provide for sufficient business and retail area to serve as the community’s
commercial base. The Circulation Element must efficiently provide for the
movement of goods and services throughout the City, as well as
accessibility to businesses. Finally, the Housing Element is essential in

   and maintaining a sufficient housing stock in the City.
   RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS

   Commerce. The Chamber is a member-driven, non-profit association of
   business professionals and civic-minded residents committed to improving

   Chamber of Commerce is to help create and sustain successful business
   ventures that will benefit the economic vitality of the entire Cerritos region.
   The Cerritos Regional Chamber also plays a critical role in Economic

   sales of Agency-owned properties. The Agency operates as its own legal
   entity from the City.
   Norwalk Boulevard Façade Renovation Program
   The Redevelopment Agency established the Norwalk Boulevard Façade
   Renovation Program in order to improve existing storefronts in the
   Downtown District and create a more pedestrian-friendly character for the
   area. The program includes financial assistance to property owners and
   business tenants who are willing to participate in the façade upgrade.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT
Hawaiian Gardens is located in the southeastern region of Los Angeles
County, also known as the Gateway Cities. The Gateway Cities cover
approximately 203 square miles and make up approximately five percent of
the land use in Los Angeles County. In 2007, more than 1.7 million people
lived and worked in the Gateway Cities region. As part of this greater area,
Hawaiian Gardens plays a significant role in the regional economy.
Historically, the Gateway Cities region has been the hub of the
manufacturing industry in the Los Angeles region. Prior to 1989, aerospace
and defense related industries dominated the economy; however the 1990s
saw a downturn in this economic sector. Employment patterns today in the
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                      67

   Gateway Cities region are similar to California overall; manufacturing,
   service jobs, and retail trade are the three leading sectors of the regional
   economy.
   The Gateway Cities Council of Governments has the following economic
   development goals for the region, by the year 2020:
          More employment
          Higher levels of education
          Improved infrastructure
          Improved planning and decision making processes
          Effective land uses
   These goals will be achieved through an action plan, which includes:
   sustainable development, use of information technology and
   communications, international trade, entrepreneurial development,
   tourism, and cooperation and collaboration.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
Demographic Profile
The total population in Hawaiian Gardens was 14,779 in 2000, according to
the U.S. Census. Data obtained by the California Department of Finance
estimates that the City’s total population in 2007 totals 15,922, which
represents a 2,283 increase between 1990 and 2007, or 16.7 percent.
Compared to Los Angeles County overall, the County experienced a similar
16.6 percent growth during the same period, indicating that population
growth experienced in Hawaiian Gardens is comparable to the region
overall. The 2007 persons per household average in Hawaiian Gardens was
4.43, an increase of 5.2 percent since 2000; whereas Los Angeles County
persons per household is 3.00 in 2007. This represents an increase in
persons per household in the City of 0.7 percent since 2000.
The overall population in Hawaiian Gardens tends to be very young. In
1990, the under 18 category made up 35.5 percent of the City’s total
population in 1990, and made up 36.8 percent of the population in 2000.
This is a higher concentration of the under 18 population compared to Los
Angeles County (28 percent in 2000). In 2000, the median age in Hawaiian
Gardens was 25.4 years old.
In 2000, Hawaiian Gardens’ average household income was $55,363, an
increase of $2,186 from 1990 (in 2006 dollars). The 2000 median household
income in Hawaiian Gardens was $43,701, down from $48,394 in 1990
(2006 dollars).
Economic Profile
Employment and Wage Growth Trends
Between 2001 and 2005, the City experienced a 7.7 percent growth in
employment with a 2005 total of 3,248. Similarly, during that time
employment per capita increased, from 0.16 in 2001, to 0.21 in 2005.
Although this is an affirmative increase, it is still substantially lower than
the overall region, when compared to Los Angeles County’s 0.40
employment per capita ratio in 2005.
In 2005, the largest employment category was “Other”, which includes the
Hawaiian Gardens Casino (Figure 2-2). The second largest employment
category was healthcare and social assistance, making up 12 percent of all
employment within the City. This is perhaps largely due to the private
regional hospital that serves surrounding communities, Tri-City Regional
Medical Center, which is located within the City. Other large employment
categories include retail trade (10%) local government (8%).

Taxable Retail Sales
The ratio of taxable retail sales per capita in Hawaiian Gardens is a
reasonable indicator of two major aspects of a community’s economic
position: fiscal strength, and local availability of retail goods and services. In
2005, the economic sub-area taxable retail sales totaled $8.8 billion.
Compared to surrounding communities—including Long Beach, Los
Alamitos, Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Cypress, La Palma, and Lakewood—
Hawaiian Gardens captured less than one percent of all taxable sales, with a
total of $3,382 per capita. Long Beach and Cerritos had the highest
percentages of taxable sales for the sub-area, with 41 percent and 25 percent
respectively. The retail groups that generated the most retail transactions
per capita for Long Beach included eating and drinking places, and building
materials. The retail groups with the highest retail transactions for Cerritos

                                                    include several different retailers, eateries, and services. These areas provide
                                                    a wider selection of retail tenants, allowing them to capture a greater
                                                    portion of the regional demand. In Hawaiian Gardens, the commercial areas
                                                    in the City are primarily occupied by local serving businesses, such as

                                                    Additionally, given the small area of the City, it is not anticipated that
                                                    external visitors would come to Hawaiian Gardens for similar goods and

   ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES
   Currently, there is substantial economic development and commercial
   rejuvenation activity taking place within the City. However, the City does
   face challenges, which are necessary to address for future development. The
   current demographic and economic profiles suggest that the City must
   address the following challenges:
          The Downtown District is located along Norwalk Boulevard, bound
           to the north by 215th Street and to the south by Carson Street. The
           Downtown area is designated commercial, made up primarily of
           strip commercial, local serving retail uses, and mom and pop stores,
           which are primarily service-related. The Downtown is traversed by
           Norwalk Boulevard, a large arterial street. Characteristically,
           downtown corridors are special areas established within a
           community that creates a visual and sensory impact for visitors. In
           order for the Downtown District to effectively establish a sense of
           place, there should be a cohesive design that integrates building
           design, street furniture, street trees, and other pedestrian amenities
           that create a walkable and appealing environment. The Downtown
           District is the ideal area to create a focused plan such as the
           Norwalk Boulevard Façade Renovation Program. In addition to a
           streetscape concept, a component of the program includes street
           furniture, lighting, and enhanced street paving in order to create a
           lively and pedestrian-friendly atmosphere.
          There is very little undeveloped land in the City, which consists of
           small, scattered infill parcels. This minimizes the opportunity for
           attracting larger retail uses. The City should encourage commercial
           lot consolidation and rezone some land adjacent to existing
           commercial zones along Carson Street and Norwalk Boulevard in
           order to provide larger development sites for potential investors or
           large retailer uses.
          Several of the City’s commercial retail uses are in aging and
           dispersed shopping centers. There are commercial areas within the
           City that appear blighted and rundown. Several areas feature a high
           concentration of unattractive land uses, such as auto repair related
           uses, light manufacturing, and empty parcels. The City should
           identify the areas necessary to eliminate blight and focus on
           economic development strategies to revitalize these areas.
74                                                                 January 2010

                                                                               2 – Community Development
        Commercial uses located along the eastern portion of Carson Street,
         on the south side are dominated by automotive and auto-repair
         businesses. These businesses occupy the streetscape, eliminating
         the opportunity to create an enhanced retail environment. This area
         would especially serve the community well, considering it is a
         significant commuter arterial corridor in the region and has easy
         access from the San Gabriel River freeway (I-605).
        The community has a largely low-skilled workforce and lower
         household median income.
        Many nonconforming land uses exist throughout the City. An
         amortization period would benefit the community because this
         would allow the prospect for new, conforming development that
         also contributes to public improvements and an increased tax base.
        The South Norwalk Boulevard corridor serves as a prominent
         gateway into the community. Currently, there is an abundance of
         strip commercial centers and indistinct small businesses. The
         corridor presents a poor visual image of the City and would benefit
         from commercial revitalization.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES
The City of Hawaiian Gardens is aware of the economic development
challenges that face the community. Several economic development
opportunities that are currently available are due to programs and actions
that the City and Redevelopment Agency are pursuing.
        Construction has begun as part of the Norwalk Boulevard Façade
         Renovation Program for the Downtown District. The program is
         providing street improvements and renovation of businesses
         located along several city blocks. The program will create a cohesive
         and updated design concept for the district.
        The City is in the process of installing entry monument signs at
         major gateways in the community. Entry monument signs define
         the primary entrances to Hawaiian Gardens and welcome visitors.
         Four signs are planned, located at each end of Carson Street and
         Norwalk Boulevard.
        Hawaiian Gardens has several new projects developing that will be
         beneficial to the economic base of the community. A new hotel, the
         La Quinta Inn, has recently been approved on Carson Street. Both
         the Bingo Club and Hawaiian Gardens Casino are being revitalized.
         The Bingo Club will open on the former Home Base site, along
         Norwalk Boulevard. The Hawaiian Gardens Casino is currently
         planning to renovate and expand its facilities, providing a
         permanent structure with full site improvements.

           Hawaiian Gardens provides a diverse mix of cultures and
            backgrounds of its residents.
           Hawaiian Gardens is conveniently located near a major freeway
            (Interstate-605), central to the Gateway Cities region, and in close
            proximity to the Port of Long Beach.
           There are individual sites along the City’s major commercial
            corridors that are underdeveloped or vacant that can be identified
            and studied for potential revitalization. The City can also focus
            efforts on developing and expanding neighborhood commercial
            retail opportunities that focus on local services, to continue to
            support the growing residential population.
           Labor training would not only benefit residents by providing them
            with local opportunities for skill development, but it could also
            potentially strengthen the City’s labor force.
           A public relations campaign would serve as a productive method of
            attracting attention and potential retailers to the community and
            could dispel some of the negative publicity that the City sometimes
            receives.
           Community art programs would enhance public spaces, making
            them more attractive to residents and visitors.
           As part of the existing commercial rehabilitation program, the City
            should consider including commercial interior improvements for
            participants, which could potentially generate increased interest in
            businesses requesting financial assistance from the Hawaiian
            Gardens Redevelopment Agency.
   GUIDING PRINCIPLES
   The guiding principles for the Economic Development Element support the
   community’s vision for the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan. The principles
   will also provide direction for the City in economic development planning
   in Hawaiian Gardens.
           Encourage a diversified mix of commercial businesses that enrich the community
            and provide a variety of shopping opportunities
           Develop a vibrant pedestrian-oriented Downtown area that serves residents and
            visitors
           Encourage the continued revitalization of the commercial base of the City

Community Design
Element
INTRODUCTION
Urban design is an integral component of a community’s quality of life. It
contributes to a community image of the city, also portrayed outside the
city to visitors. The design of public spaces—including essential
transportation corridors, public spaces, residential neighborhoods,
commercial activity centers, industrial parks, and the downtown—is
integral in forming a community’s visual identity. A city that conveys
consideration for design of the built environment and open space not only
uplifts residents, but also attracts visitors. The city becomes more than just
a situation of everyday function; it defines its own sense of place.
The General Plan Guidelines, provided by the California Office of Planning
and Research, describe a community design element as providing
“additional direction, beyond that of the land use element, to the planning
area’s development pattern, structure, and sense of place.” During the initial
community outreach phase of the General Plan Update, residents and
meeting attendees provided valuable feedback regarding the impression of
the community’s image, design of public spaces, and positive and negative
qualities of the urban design of the community. This feedback has been used
to form goals and policies that will serve as the foundation and direction for
community design in Hawaiian Gardens.
The Community Design Element discusses the community’s built form,
which shapes its visual identity and overall design quality. The community
design discussion serves to create and define a sense of place for Hawaiian
Gardens, as well as improve the quality of life for residents and visitors.
Community design comprises different scales of a community, from
individual neighborhoods to the overall cityscape. The Community Design

   Element includes goals and policies for the public realm—including
   streetscape, landscaping, and the Downtown District—and on a smaller
   scale, site design, private nonresidential development, and buffering of
   sensitive land uses.
   The City of Hawaiian Gardens has a rich cultural past. Early settlements of
   the area can be traced back to the Tongva Native Americans, or the
   Gabrielino Indians as they are also referred to. Prior to the City’s
   incorporation, the area prospered as an agricultural settlement, with vast
   lands of dairy farms and rural wooded marsh. Subsequent subdivisions in
   the region transformed the area into a thriving community complete with
   residences and a commercial and industrial base. Due in part to the rapid
   subdivision of land, portions of Hawaiian Gardens succumbed to blight and
   decay. Today, the built form of Hawaiian Gardens must be preserved and
   enhanced in order to overturn the effects of extensive subdivisions and
   commercial strip malls, and rejuvenate the community to help it become a
   more livable, visually-stimulating place. The consideration of design will be
   a priority for future development in Hawaiian Gardens.
   RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
   The Community Design Element is an optional element according to State
   law; however it must still be consistent with other elements in the General
   Plan. The element is one of 11 elements in the Hawaiian Gardens General
   Plan. It contains goals and policies that are related to the Land Use,
   Circulation, and Open Space Elements.
   The Community Design Element relates to the Land Use Element because it
   contains goals and policies to create superior built environments while
   preserving existing land uses. The element relates to the Circulation
   Element by providing guidance for achieving an attractive streetscape
   environment. The element also relates to the Open Space Element by
   establishing goals and policies intended to provide and maintain an
   abundant landscape environment in the community.

                                                                                 2 – Community Development
EXISTING CONDITIONS
This section describes the current framework for the City’s built
environment, including neighborhoods, districts, gateways, paths, and
public spaces.
Neighborhoods
South of Carson Street and west of Norwalk Boulevard
This area is characterized by the predominance of medium density, single
family residential units. Many lots in this part of the City are very narrow,
with an average width of 25 feet. Because of the space constraints, many lots
often have limited features outside of the building footprint, which might
otherwise include ample side yard setbacks and front yard landscaping.
Most lots also exhibit a lack of variation in front façades, with garages
occupying the majority of the street frontage. This diminishes the
residential character of a neighborhood because the main portion of the
residence is hidden behind the blank façade of the garage.
South of Carson Street and east of Norwalk Boulevard
This area also includes mostly medium density, single family residences.
Additionally, there are two mobile home parks, one south of Carson Street,
and the other located east of the Coyote Creek channel, on the
southernmost edge of the City. There are also multi-family residential areas,
both high density and intermediate density. Past development of multi-
family projects has resulted in minimum amenities, such as landscaping, and
common and private open space. General plan policies will need to address
this issue to ensure that future development provides sufficient open space.
North of Carson Street
This general area also contains a mixture of medium density, single family
residences, high density residential land uses, and the only low density
neighborhoods in the City. These neighborhoods are characterized by larger
lots, several of which are an average of 10,000 square feet in size. Because
these low density neighborhoods offer diverse housing options, they should
be preserved.
Districts
Districts are the sections of the City that have a certain identifiable
character due to building architecture, neighborhood design, streetscape,
land use, etc. A district is defined as an integral part of a larger urban area,
with common characteristics that make it unique from other areas of the
community. Distinguishing features may include building type, use, activity,
inhabitants, and/or topography. Aside from residential neighborhoods
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                       81

   previously mentioned, the City’s principal districts include commercial and
   industrial districts.
   Downtown Norwalk Boulevard
   Hawaiian Gardens’ Downtown is located along Norwalk Boulevard, bound
   to the north by 215th Street and to the south by Tilbury Street, north of
   Carson Street. The downtown area is designated commercial, made up
   primarily of strip commercial and local serving retail uses. The General Plan
   should maintain the Downtown character through policies and guidelines
   that support a pedestrian-oriented district.
   Industrial Park
   The City’s only industrial area is located in the northern portion of the City,
   bound by Centralia Street to the north, and the Artesia Norwalk Storm
   Drain to the south. The industrial park totals 14.36 acres. The Centralia
   Business Park, which contains units for light manufacturing and assembly
   operations, is situated here, as well as mini storage warehouse facilities. The
   industrial park serves as a significant employment center, and should
   therefore be preserved.
   South Norwalk Boulevard Corridor
   Norwalk Boulevard, south of Carson Street, is characterized by commercial
   land uses. The area is primarily made up of aging strip malls and “mom and
   pop” shops. The Bingo Club, which is currently located at 11831 Carson
   Street, will relocated to the former Home Base site (on the east side of
   Norwalk Boulevard, between Carson Street and 221st Street). The site, a
   total of 6.4 contiguous acres, is the largest site in the south Norwalk
   Boulevard corridor.
   Another new project planned for the South Norwalk Boulevard corridor is a
   service station, to be located at the northeast corner of Norwalk Boulevard
   and Woodson Street. The South Norwalk Boulevard Corridor serves as the
   southern gateway into Hawaiian Gardens and should be revitalized to serve
   as a major commercial corridor. Design elements such as streetscape and
   façade improvements, and the undergrounding of overhead utilities will
   help revitalize the corridor.
   Gateways
   Gateways serve as the major entry points of the community. They define the
   community’s boundaries and welcome residents and visitors to the city. In
   Hawaiian Gardens, there are four major entry points located at each end of
   the community’s arterial roads, Carson Street and Norwalk Boulevard.
   Carson Street gateways are located at the west and east ends of the City.
   Much of the vehicular traffic served along this corridor is from commuters
   driving to and from the 605 freeway onramp, located just outside the City’s
   west boundary.

                                                                                 2 – Community Development
Norwalk Boulevard gateways are located at the north and south ends of
Norwalk Boulevard, at the City’s boundaries. The City of Lakewood is
located to the south, and the City of Long Beach is located to the north.
The City is currently in the process of designing and installing entry signs at
the four gateway points. The monument signs will include the City seal, and
one of the four entry monuments is also planned to include a water feature.

                                                        Gardens on the eastern side of
                                                        Carson Street.
Paths
Paths are corridors that move users (vehicles, pedestrians, etc) from one
point to another. The paths identified in Hawaiian Gardens are considered
primary paths because they are the major arterial streets that contain high
volume traffic. The visual image that major paths present to travelers as
they move through the community can provide a powerful experience and
leave lasting impressions.
Carson Street
This is the City’s major east-west corridor, which extends from one edge of
the City to the other. It is also a major regional corridor, which often serves
commuter traffic as well. Therefore, the visual image presented by Carson
Street is very important to the City’s image as a whole. Much of the
commercial land uses within the City are located on Carson Street,
including the Hawaiian Gardens Casino, a regional attraction.

   Norwalk Boulevard
   This arterial street runs north-south and is the only other major corridor in
   the City. Norwalk Boulevard does not carry the volume of traffic that
   Carson Street does, but it is none the less an important street in the
   community. Norwalk Boulevard contains the remainder of the commercial
   land uses in the City, including the Downtown District.
   Public Spaces
   Public spaces are communal areas that are used for recreation and leisure.
   They create a sense of association with the community through use of the
   space. Public spaces can take the form of courtyards, plazas, pathways,
   parks and open space. Public spaces in Hawaiian Gardens include
   community parks, the C. Robert Lee Activity Center, civic center courtyard,
   and multi-purpose playing fields.
   Within residential neighborhoods, there are also several corner lots that
   serve as green spaces. These green spaces are beneficial throughout
   residential areas because they breakup the uniformity of homes, especially
   in dense areas, where open space is at premium.

 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Healthy Communities
Environmental and key quality of life factors are becoming a greater concern
for local jurisdictions in comprehensive planning processes. Local
governments are looking towards alternatives to unmanaged growth and
wasteful lifestyles. It is therefore necessary to consider programs and
practices that manage land use efficiently and responsibly, which can
ultimately achieve pleasant neighborhoods, a healthy and diverse economy,
and a high quality of life.
Healthy communities seek to improve the quality of life of residents by
improving the places to live, work, and play in. The intent of the healthy
communities principles in to enhance the community’s quality of life
through improved access of essential services to a wider range of
population. Healthy communities embody the following general principles:
        Promote Diversity of Use
         A healthy city should have a wide mix of uses that function in a
         cohesive fashion to establish a diverse and lively environment to
         work, live, and play. By offering people a wide variety of reasons to
         visit and stay in the city throughout the day and evening, cities can
         attract more people frequently and for a longer period of time. The
         mix of uses should include office, residential, and entertainment, as
         well as retail and restaurants.
        Encourage Compactness
         Compactness in commercial areas can promote pedestrian activity,
         developing a concentration of activity that is easily accessible by
         foot. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to consider current
         underutilized and vacant infill parcels, especially at high visibility
         locations, in order to maximize the opportunity for activity and fill
         the gaps in the urban fabric. Additional infill incentives may be
         programs and financial assistance from the City’s Redevelopment
         Agency.
        Foster Intensity of Development
         Appropriate densities and building intensities are necessary
         considerations in community design because it is essential that
         buildings relate to the street and surrounding character, and set
         standards for the quality of street-level spaces. In order to increase
         the efficiency of land use in the creation of healthy and vibrant
         areas, infill development should also be scale appropriately.
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                      85

          Provide for Accessibility
           Providing elements to support transportation alternatives should
           be priority. Although vehicular access, roadways, and parking
           should be efficient, opportunities for pedestrians, bicyclists, and
           transit are necessary to revitalize streets.
          Create Functional Linkages
           In order to further encourage pedestrian activity, downtown and
           activity centers that are concentrated in commercial areas should be
           connected to surrounding neighborhoods by an integrated street
           network defined by distinctive streetscape treatments, open space,
           and active street-level uses.
          Build a Positive Identity
           A City requires a positive image as a desirable and interesting place
           to encourage people to visit and interact. Marketing and promotion
           are an integral part of forming the City’s identity. Community
           events, festivals, and mailings should be consistent in uplifting the
           community identity.
   Healthy communities offer choices: where to live, where to shop and dine,
   where to play, and how to get around. Healthy neighborhoods that work
   well have the following community elements:
          A center or focal point for community activities.
          Edges, or geographic and cultural boundaries.
          A wide mix of uses—residential, commercial and retail, recreation,
           schools, civic, and cultural—and building types that can change use
           over time.
          A well-connected network of safe streets and transportation
           alternatives.
          Places to play, gather, rest and reflect, and connect to natural
           systems.
       Incorporating goals and policies with these community elements and
       design considerations can foster healthy and engaging communities and
       improve its quality of life.

                                                                               2 – Community Development
COMMUNITY DESIGN ISSUES
During the community outreach process for the General Plan update,
residents identified several issues related to community design qualities of
the City.
        Hawaiian Gardens has several constraints that impede the ability to
         change the land use pattern of the City, which has been determined
         from its early beginning. The City is almost entirely built out, in
         addition to being completed bound on all sides by other
         incorporated cities. There are only three community and
         neighborhood parks in Hawaiian Gardens: Pioneer Park, Clarkdale
         Park, and Lee Ware Park. The opportunity to use school fields as
         additional park and recreation space has helped alleviate the
         relatively small number of parks; however, residents have expressed
         their desire for more park and open space.
        Residents admire the landscape design surrounding the Hawaiian
         Gardens Casino: rich and luscious landscaping surrounded by a
         palm tree pattern that evokes opulence. Landscaping patterns such
         as this should be extended in public spaces and corridors
         throughout the City.
        Prominent arterial corridors like Carson Street and Norwalk
         Boulevard are increased areas of visibility and accessible to
         commuters, residents, and visitors. Therefore, these corridors are on
         display and serve as an ideal opportunity to enhance utilization and
         walkability through a comprehensive design plan.
        Hawaiian Gardens residents want a stronger community identity.
         The identity should capitalize off the community’s festive name,
         and the diversity in ethnicities and cultures of its residents.
        The community may often portray a negative image to visitors,
         based on its past reputation, spots that may appear blighted, gang
         activity and graffiti. Goals, policies, and programs in the General
         Plan must work toward changing the community’s image, not just
         of external visitors, but amongst residents as well. Residents
         already take great pride in their community; it is now a matter of
         using that as an opportunity to make further strides in
         improvements.
        The Downtown District, located on Norwalk Boulevard, north of
         Carson Street, lacks special qualities and uniqueness that define a
         typical downtown area. The Downtown would benefit from
         human-scale accents and urban design elements that make the
         district pedestrian-friendly.
        There is an infiltration of automobile repair and automotive-related
         land uses along Carson Street. In addition to other service-related
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                     87

      and non-descriptive uses, this area along Carson Street appears
      uninviting and is not pedestrian-oriented.
     There are several residential neighborhoods throughout the City
      that are located adjacent to commercial uses, or uses of higher
      intensity. Special consideration should be given to the transitions
      between these residential neighborhoods and the higher intensity
      uses by creating buffers between each use.
     There are a number of single family homes on extremely narrow
      lots. Because of size constraints, the facades on these homes are
      indistinguishable, with a garage dominating the view from the
      street.
     Part of the image the community portrays includes the upkeep and
      maintenance of individual properties. The Code Enforcement
      Department is very active; therefore, the General Plan must
      establish policies to support these efforts.
     Public art should be displayed throughout the community, which
      blends with the community fiber, existing buildings and elements.
88                                                         January 2010

                                                                                  2 – Community Development
GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The guiding principles help support the overall vision for Hawaiian
Gardens. The guiding principles for the Community Design Element relate
to community image and identity, which is the judgment of Hawaiian
Gardens’ visual identity, as perceived by its residents. The guiding
principles for the Community Design Element are to:
        Promote Hawaiian Gardens as a safe, friendly, and diverse community
        Celebrate the community’s achievements
        Ensure a high quality visual environment
The integration of design elements and urban form will improve the visual
quality, sustainability, and identity of Hawaiian Gardens’ public spaces,
including parks, plazas, the Downtown District, and the Civic Center. The
consideration of community design will help Hawaiian Gardens’ become a
healthy, vibrant, and diverse community.

                 unless it is a part of an overall comprehensive design
                 scheme, such as the Norwalk Boulevard Façade Renovation
                 Program.
       DES-6.2   Encourage signage at human scale, proportional to the store
                 front, and visible to pedestrians and passers-by.
       DES-6.3   Signs should blend well into the building façade and overall
                 surroundings, to serve as an extension of the building’s
                 design scheme, not an afterthought.
       DES-6.4   Consider adopting special sign standards for the
                 Downtown area.
   Land Use Interface
   Goal DES-7:   Preserve the character of residential land uses from
                 encroachment by more intensive commercial and
                 industrial uses.

       DES-7.1   Provide harmonious interfaces between land uses by using
                 natural and attractive buffers such as landscaping and
                 fencing.
       DES-7.2   For areas where commercial uses back or front onto
                 residential neighborhoods, each elevation of the site and
                 building(s) should be designed at the same level of detail as
                 the front of the site or building.

    DES-7.3     Require the separation or buffering of residential areas from
                businesses that produce noise, odors, high traffic volumes,
                light or glare, and parking through the use of architectural
                elements, setbacks, landscaping, or other techniques.
    DES-7.4     Screening of loading and services areas should be provided,
                specifically in areas where commercial uses back onto
                residential neighborhoods.
Multi-Family Residential
Goal DES-8:     Preserve the low-density residential character of the
                neighborhood through the appropriate design of multi-
                family development.
Policies:
    DES-8.1     Multi-family developments should preserve the existing
                character of the neighborhood through appropriate
                building placement and orientation.
    DES-8.2     Provide variations in building form and architectural
                massing for new developments.

                for multi-family residential land uses.
    DES-8.4     Require adequate open space for private and common use
                throughout the multi-family development.
Single Family Residential
Goal DES-9:     Provide a variation of street-facing facades.
Policies:
    DES-9.1     Minimize the dominance of garages on residential street
                frontages.
    DES-9.2     Emphasize the entry character of residences through
                architectural features such as porches, bays, and building
                massing.
    DES-9.3     Develop and implement minimum landscape requirements
                for single family residential land uses.

   COMMUNITY DESIGN PLAN
   The Urban Design Plan contains design recommendations at a citywide
   scale for public and private realms: the streetscape, Downtown District,
   multi-family housing, land use interface, and commercial areas.
   Streetscape
   The public realm of the community consists of areas that are primarily
   within the public right-of-way that is visible from the street. The entire
   system of streets, sidewalks, landscaping, and open space used to circulate
   throughout the City is referred to as streetscape. Elements that make up
   streetscape design include landscaping, street furniture and fixtures, and
   public art.
   Landscaping
   Landscaping is vital to the beautification of public areas. It is the primary
   component that provides relief in dense and highly-urbanized areas, offers
   public open space, and enriches the color of the community. Landscaping
   can be featured in medians, parkways, and planters.
   Hawaiian Gardens has several planted medians on the arterial streets
   Carson Street and Norwalk Boulevard. Planted, or landscaped, medians
   provide a simple and effective way of beautifying large circulation corridors,
   adding open space and relief to the area. When a cohesive landscape and
   beautification theme is applied to the major arterial corridors in the City, it
   helps distinguish between the hierarchy of streets. Therefore, beautification
   measures that serve to make the public realm more attractive also serve the
   purpose of identifying the local arterial system.
   Street trees are especially significant to a streetscape, as they define and
   frame a public space or corridor, adding rhythm and visual interest. Street
   trees are typically the first impression of a boulevard or corridor because of
   the trees’ prominence and stature. Regular grooming and maintenance is
   imperative. Additional landscaping, shrubs, and groundcover can also
   accentuate an area and add beauty.
   Street trees are perhaps the most simple and straightforward urban design
   measure. Trees are established as visually stimulating, can be used to denote
   and display details throughout the community, and can unify and
   distinguish public spaces. Moreover, trees are imperative in creating healthy
   and distinctive communities.
   In Hawaiian Gardens, a tree palette should highlight palm trees as central
   to the landscaping theme. Palm trees already exist throughout the
   community, and add a sense of luxury, rhythm and definition that enhance
   pathways.

Street Furnishings
Street furniture and fixtures are additional amenities that humanize areas,
making areas feel inviting and comfortable. Street furniture is designed for
pedestrians and users of the space, but can serve as more than just function;
it adds character and influences the perception of a street or public space.
Street furniture includes benches, streetlamps, trash receptacles, bus
shelters, drinking fountains, specialty signage, and shade structures.
Street furnishings create a unified visual appearance for any space,
particularly spaces and boulevards designed for pedestrian activity, or for
spaces near transit stops, parks and open spaces, and other attractions. For
additional safety and comfort for pedestrians and users, street furnishings
should be sited on sidewalks adjacent to the curb, where they can act as a
barrier to vehicular traffic.
Public Art
Public art simply refers to artistic works that are created for public spaces
or areas accessible to the public. Public art can enrich the sensory and visual
experience of a place. It is able to enhance the public image, add beauty to a
space, and create a visual statement. Public art can be abstract,
representational, or historical, telling a story of the community’s local
history and culture.
A form of public art is also enriched architecture of buildings and its
integration into the public space. Local history and cultural pieces can also
serve as a communal activity, produced through the involvement from
members of the community. Other examples of public art include
sculptures, murals, landscaping and organic works, water features,
memorabilia, site specific features, and enhanced or unique paving.
Incorporating public art into streetscape design can create a visually
interesting environment. It can be used as a focal point to draw attention to
a specific space, framing the context and character of its surroundings. It
can also be used to terminate a vista, present a human scale, or make a space
more elaborate.
Downtown District
A downtown is typically a prominent area within a community, making a
visual statement and having a unique character all its own. It represents the
identity and collective values of the community as a whole, socially and
economically. In order to be truly engaging, a downtown must attract
visitors. Visitors are drawn to spaces where they feel safe and comfortable.
In addition, visitors are drawn to spaces that are visually pleasing and
exciting. Part of the composition significant to a downtown area is
displaying a human character or scale. Visitors are more inclined to stroll
around city blocks that include window displays, unique signage,
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                      95

   architectural details and building massing, urban furniture, and all the other
   elements that cater to the visitor’s comfort.
   Hawaiian Gardens’ Downtown District has existing opportunities that can
   be used to further enhance the area. The location of the district is central to
   the entire community, making it accessible to all residents and visitors.
   Also, the area already has a significant amount of activity, although the
   majority is from vehicular traffic. Hawaiian Gardens’ Downtown is also
   made up of three blocks in a pedestrian-friendly street grid, conducive to
   frequent use and walkability. The City is committed to creating a pleasant
   environment that is safe and convenient for all users.
   Currently however, the Hawaiian Gardens Downtown District lacks
   pedestrian-friendly qualities. The Downtown is composed of strip centers,
   uses that do not cater to frequent shoppers and visitors, and the Norwalk
   Boulevard corridor is typically heavy in vehicular traffic, detracting from
   ease of use for pedestrians. According to City staff, there is also currently a
   lack of convenient parking in the Downtown area.
   The Redevelopment Agency has established the Norwalk Boulevard Façade
   Renovation Program in order to improve existing storefronts in the
   Downtown District. The program includes financial assistance to property
   owners and business tenants who are willing to participate in the façade
   upgrade. Improvements included as part of the program are:
           Exterior façade improvements;
           Replacement and repair of front entry doors and front windows;
           New awnings and canopies;
           Replacement of nonconforming signs with conforming signs;
           Handicap accessibility modifications;
           Site improvements, including fencing, slurry sealing, landscaping,
            and lighting;
           Exterior painting, including side and rear elevations of the building;
           Any other improvements deemed by the Community Development
            Director to increase the attractiveness of the building.
   As part of the program, the City has been in the process of designing and
   planning a cohesive design scheme for the Downtown District (Figure 2-4).
   Schematic renderings have been developed and include a contemporary
   theme that includes walkway overhangs, signage, enlarged storefronts,
   building massing, and a varying roof line. The façade renovation has begun
   between the blocks of 214th and 215th Streets, on the east side of Norwalk
   Boulevard.

Single Family Housing
Goals provided in the Community Design Element intended for single
family detached residences recommend the use of architectural details and
enhanced entry patterns to improve the facades and visual appearance of
neighborhoods.
Architectural Treatments
Enhanced exterior architecture is recommended on all sides, particularly
those visible in the public realm. Long, unarticulated walls and facades
dominated by garages are discouraged. Design details such as building
massing, varied textures, openings, stepbacks and offsets, and accents
should be used.
Enhanced Entry Patterns
Enhanced entry patterns are encouraged to break up the displays of garages.
The primary entry and windows should be the dominant elements of the
façade. Primary entries should also display a clear, connecting path the
driveway or public sidewalk. The use of architectural detailing should make
the entry prominent, instead of the garage.
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                  97

   Multi-Family Housing
   Multi-family housing should preserve the integrity and existing character of
   residential neighborhoods through the scale of the building, style of the
   building, and the open space and landscaping that softens the surroundings.
   Scale
   Scale includes the height and dimension of the building. One-story and two-
   story compact single family residences and other multi-family buildings are
   the predominant surroundings in residential neighborhoods where multi-
   family development is planned. Therefore, new multi-family residences
   should preserve the existing low-rise proportions of surrounding buildings,
   and maintain the rhythm of the neighborhood. This can be achieved through
   building massing, such as providing cut-outs in the building façade,
   providing various window and entry types, and changing the roof line.
   Building Style
   The style of the building should also be conscious of preserving the
   character of the existing neighborhood. High-quality building architecture
   should be articulated on all sides of the development, not only the façade.
   Open Space and Landscaping
   Sufficient open space and landscaping should be provided for each
   development. Communal and central open space provides relief and
   amenities to residents. Private outdoor areas are also necessary with each
   dwelling unit. Finally, landscaping should link the common areas of the
   development, within yard setbacks and courtyard areas.
   Land Use Interface
   Land use interface refers to the boundary area between adjacent land uses.
   There are several residential land uses, for instance, that are adjacent to
   commercial uses, in which case, it is imperative that treatments in these
   areas are carefully considered, as it adds definition and character to the area.
   Typical treatments for land use interface areas are setbacks and landscape
   buffers. These treatments protect sensitive land uses, such as single-family
   residences, from more intensive uses, by creating a visual barrier,
   maintaining yard privacy for homes, and reducing harsh visual impacts from
   parking lots, commercial lighting, and frequent vehicular traffic in parking
   lots.
   Commercial Areas
   Commercial areas within the City lie along the major arterial streets,
   Carson Street and Norwalk Boulevard. Commercial uses vary in size and
   type. There are several large commercial shopping centers, like those along
98                                                                  January 2010

                                                                              2 – Community Development
the Norwalk / Carson intersection, smaller strip centers, like those in the
Downtown area and along the south Norwalk Boulevard corridor, and
sporadic individual storefronts as well.
For commercial areas, building form and massing serve as exemplary tools
to avoid monotonous streetscapes and provide diverse frontages. Human
scale elements should be encouraged, in order to reduce bulk and encourage
pedestrian-oriented spaces, and also reduce the volume of larger commercial
uses, such as anchor stores. Human scale elements that provide visual
interest include awnings, window storefronts, trellises, and arcades.
Siting should also consider aesthetics and ease of use for visitors. The
orientation of the building, parking and pedestrian areas can have a strong
visual effect. A mass of parking from the street view is generally
discouraged; instead, parking should be as concealed as much as possible,
located toward the rear or side of the building.
Commercial areas should also provide safe and well-defined pedestrian
connections internal to the site. Pedestrian connections should be provided
for the following locations: from buildings to parking areas, from buildings
to the adjoining streets, and among buildings on the same site.
Commercial Signs
Signs are an important component of the appearance of a building’s façade
and contribute to the overall visual character of the City. For this purpose,
careful design consideration should be used for commercial signs. These
design guidelines serve as recommendations to assure high quality signs.
These guidelines supplement the City’s Sign regulations in the zoning code,
which must be adhered to. Signs should reflect the following design
principles:
        Compatibility with its surroundings;
        Use of appropriate materials;
        Proportion to building and façade; and
        Integration with building design.
In commercial and retail districts, such as the Downtown District, features
that complement a building’s façade are encouraged as supplemental
materials that create a human-scale, attractive to pedestrians and visitors.
Awning signs, wall-mounted or hanging signs, or window signs are
desirable options.
In commercial shopping centers, freestanding signs are a common form of
displaying tenant information close to curbside for attention-grabbing.
Monument signs, however, are a better alternative. Monument signs are
often incorporated with landscaping and add definition to an area.

Circulation Element
INTRODUCTION
The Circulation Element presents an evaluation of the existing and future
planned circulation system in the City of Hawaiian Gardens. It addresses
existing traffic conditions, the impacts of future traffic growth, planned
physical improvements, and additional improvements to accommodate
growth. The Circulation Element also addresses issues related to mobility
and transportation in the City of Hawaiian Gardens, and presents goals and
policies to address those issues and guide circulation planning.
The City of Hawaiian Gardens Circulation Element is and will continue to
be the primary resource for transportation and circulation decisions in the
City of Hawaiian Gardens. The Los Angeles County Congestion
Management Program (LA CMP) guides transportation decisions
countywide.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Circulation Element guides continued development and improvements
of the transportation system in Hawaiian Gardens. According to state law,
the Circulation Element must be consistent with all other elements of a
General Plan. The Circulation Element directly correlates to the Land Use
Element by supporting areas of existing and future development. The
physical location of the network of streets also directly impacts air quality
and noise levels, and open space areas. The efficiency of the community’s
transportation network can also impact economic development because it
is needed to accommodate the movement of goods and services, and
accommodate the traffic flow of vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles.
SETTING AND EXISTING CIRCULATION SYSTEM
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan        105

    The City of Hawaiian Gardens is a small city in southeast Los Angeles
    County and is one of the Gateway Cities. The City is surrounded on the
    south and east sides by the City of Long Beach, with the City of Lakewood
    to the north, and the City of Cypress on the east. Many of the arterial
    roadways through the City of Hawaiian Gardens extend beyond the city
    boundaries into neighboring cities. Circulation issues and travel patterns,
    likewise, extend beyond the Hawaiian Gardens city limits. The land use
    decisions and traffic patterns in these other jurisdictions have the potential
    to affect the quality of traffic flow and mobility in the City of Hawaiian
    Gardens, and conversely, traffic conditions and decisions made by the City
    of Hawaiian Gardens can affect its neighbors. Impacts to the City’s
    circulation system resulting from land use decisions and circulation system
    improvements in adjacent jurisdictions were considered during the course
    of this analysis.
    Regional Access
    The regional setting of the City of Hawaiian Gardens is presented in Exhibit
    4-1.
    The City of Hawaiian Gardens is well served by regional freeways. The San
    Gabriel River Freeway (I-605) provides for north-south regional circulation
    just outside of Hawaiian Gardens’ jurisdiction. On and off-ramp
    connections at Carson Street enhance local commercial development
    potential. Other major transportation corridors of significant importance to
    the City are the San Diego Freeway (I-405), a north-south route located
    south of Hawaiian Gardens; and the Artesia Freeway (SR 91), an east-west
    route located three miles north of the City.
    Pioneer Boulevard and Norwalk Boulevard are north-south arterials that
    extend through and beyond the boundaries of the City of Hawaiian
    Gardens. The east-west arterial that extends through and beyond the city
    limits is Carson Street which has full interchange with I-605.

Local Access
The City of Hawaiian Gardens circulation needs are served by a traditional
grid system of north-south and east-west arterials, with approximately ½-
mile spacing, and signals at each arterial intersection. Smaller collector and
neighborhood streets connect neighborhoods and commercial land uses to
the arterial street system. A number of arterial roadways in Hawaiian
Gardens extend through the Cities of Lakewood and Long Beach in the
north-south direction.
Hawaiian Gardens has one primary area where well-established destination
activity centers generate substantial traffic demands, both local and
regional. The Hawaiian Gardens Casino is located on the northwest side of
the City along Carson Street. This area is well served by the local street
system as well as the regional freeway system. Infrastructure improvements
have been made, as necessary, to accommodate peak traffic flows in the
area.
Los Angeles County Congestion Management Program
(LACMP)
I-605 is the only route in or near Hawaiian Gardens designated in the Los
Angeles County Congestion Management Program (LACMP). There are no
intersections in Hawaiian Gardens designated as CMP monitoring
intersections.
Roadway Functional Classification System
The City of Hawaiian Gardens circulation system consists of a network of
local neighborhoods streets providing access to the arterial street system,
which in turn provide access to the regional freeway system. This network
serves two distinct and equally important functions: it provides access to
adjacent land uses, and it facilitates the movement of persons and goods to
and from, within and through the City. The design and operation of each
street is determined by the importance placed on each of these functions.
Streets that have a mobility and/or regional access function will have more
lanes, higher speed limits and fewer driveways. Where access to properties
is required, streets will have fewer lanes, lower speeds, on-street parking,
and more frequent driveways to serve abutting properties.
To define the intended uses of roadways, many jurisdictions, including
Hawaiian Gardens, use a functional classification system. The system
provides a logical framework for the design and operation of the roadway
system and helps residents and elected officials identify preferred
characteristics of each street. In the General Plan, the City of Hawaiian
Gardens uses a functional classification system that references and is
consistent with the standards followed by the Los Angeles County Road
Department, (now part of the Department of Public Works). The following
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan         109

    street classifications are currently identified in the Circulation Element of
    the City’s General Plan.
            Majors: interregional roads conveying traffic between communities,
             subdivisions, and other urban centers. Efficient movement is the
             primary function of Major roads (100-foot minimum right-of-way).
            Secondaries: conduct and distribute traffic between streets of lower
             order in the streets hierarchy and high order streets or major
             activity centers (80-foot minimum right-of-way).
            Collectors: consist of all other non-local dedicated public streets.
             They are primarily intended to provide for direct public access to
             neighborhoods and to carry traffic to secondary and major streets
             (60-foot minimum right-of-way).
            Locals: consist of all other dedicated public streets.
    In Hawaiian Gardens, the roadways designated as “Major” arterials
    currently provide two through lanes in each direction, with a center divider,
    and bike lanes, parking lanes, or right-turn auxiliary lanes. Secondary
    arterials provide two through lanes in each direction, either without a
    center divider (undivided) and with bike or parking lanes, or with a center
    divider (divided) and without bike or parking lanes. Collector streets have
    one through travel lane in each direction.
    Table 4-1 and Exhibit 4-2 indicate the existing functional classification for
    the roadway segments in the City of Hawaiian Gardens, the total number of
    lanes for each roadway segment, and whether a center divider is provided.

Public Transportation Services
The City of Hawaiian Gardens is well served by public transit systems. The
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA),
the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) and Long Beach
Transit (LBT), all operate routes that extend into or through the City of
Hawaiian Gardens. LACMTA buses provide a connection to Metrolink
service in Fullerton. LBT buses provide connections to the Metro Green
Line in Norwalk and the Metro Blue Line in Long Beach.
A brief description of each of the transit services in the City of Hawaiian
Gardens is provided below:

    City of Hawaiian Gardens Dial-A-Ride
    Hawaiian Gardens Dial-A-Ride is a senior (age 55 or older) and
    handicapped ridership program offered free to City residents. The program
    operates Monday through Friday from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. Service areas
    include Hawaiian Gardens, Lakewood, Long Beach, Downey, Bellflower,
    Norwalk, Paramount, Artesia, Cerritos, Los Alamitos, Cypress, and Buena
    Park.
    Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
    Bicycle lanes and bicycle routes are provided on a few of roadways within
    the City of Hawaiian Gardens. The bike system is intended to provide
    bicyclists with connections between neighborhoods, parks, schools, and
    other neighborhood and recreational facilities. The bicycle lanes and
    bicycle routes in Hawaiian Gardens are illustrated in Exhibit 4-3.
    Bicycle lanes and bicycle routes are classified as follows:
          Class I – Off-Road Paved Bike Path: A completely separated bi-
             directional right-of-way designated for bicycles.
          Class II – On-Road Striped Bike Lane: A striped lane for one-way
             bike travel on a roadway.
          Class III – On-Road Bike Route (signage only): Streets designed as
             preferred routes through high demand corridors.
    Most city bikeways are Class II and Class III. In addition to the City’s on-
    street bike system, the Coyote Creek Bikeway provides a regional trail
    system for avid bicycle enthusiasts.
    The Coyote Creek Bikeway is a Class I bike path in Los Angeles County
    that runs adjacent to the Coyote Creek flood control channel for
    approximately 9.5 miles. The path begins in Santa Fe Springs on the North
    fork of the Coyote Creek and extends south into Long Beach where it joins
    the San Gabriel River bicycle path at the trail bridge just South of Willow
    Street/Katella Avenue. The path passes through the southeast part of the
    City and path access is provided near the intersection of Carson Street and
    Bloomfield Avenue.
    The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) Commuter
    Strategic Bikeways Plan (CSBP) calls for extension of the Coyote Creek
    Bikeway from Walker Street in La Palma to Imperial Highway and Beach
    Boulevard in La Habra. Currently the Cities of La Habra and La Mirada are
    working to establish the northern section of this bikeway from Rosecrans
    Avenue to Imperial Highway. The City of Hawaiian Gardens does not
    currently have a formal Bicycle Master Plan.

Sidewalks are provided on all arterial roadways and on the vast majority of
residential streets. The City of Hawaiian Gardens circulation system has
been designed to ensure that adequate facilities are provided for pedestrian
circulation, especially in the vicinity of schools, parks, major retail facilities,
and other locations with high levels of pedestrian activity. The City of
Hawaiian Gardens does not currently have a formal Pedestrian Master Plan.

Truck Routes
The City of Hawaiian Gardens has designated the following roadways as
truck routes to provide for the regulated movement of trucks through the
City:
    x    Carson Street from the west city limits to the east city limits
    x    Norwalk Boulevard from Carson Street to the south city limits
The designation of truck routes is intended to route truck traffic to those
streets where they would cause the least amount of neighborhood intrusion
and where noise and other impacts would not be considered nuisances.
Roadways providing access to the freeways are the most likely candidates
for truck route designation. The designated truck routes in Hawaiian
Gardens are illustrated in Exhibit 4-4. The designation of truck routes does
not prevent trucks from using other roads or streets to make deliveries or
for other reasons as defined in the Motor Vehicle Code of the State of
California.

ANALYSIS OF EXISTING OPERATING CONDITIONS
Level of Service Definition for Intersections
Intersections are analyzed using the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) as
specified by the Los Angeles CMP. The HCM methodology estimates the
average delay (in average seconds per vehicle) for each of the movements
through the intersection, depending on a number of factors, including
number of lanes, volume of traffic, signal timing. Just as with the ICU
methodology, the HCM delay forecast translates to a Level of Service (LOS)
designation, ranging from LOS “A” to LOS “F”. The descriptions of
operating conditions for each LOS are very similar to the LOS descriptions
for the ICU methodology. A summary description of each LOS for the HCM
signalized intersection methodology, and the corresponding delay,
expressed in seconds per vehicle, is provided in Table 4-2:

    Peak Hour Intersection Analysis
    Thirteen intersections were selected for analysis of existing traffic
    conditions as well as future traffic conditions that would be anticipated
    when General Plan land uses would be built out. The selection of the
    thirteen intersections was based on which intersections are currently
    carrying high peak hour volumes, such as those near activity centers and
    freeway interchanges, as well as those near vacant or underutilized parcels
    where development could occur and traffic growth might be anticipated.
    The thirteen intersections selected for analysis are:
         1.  Carson Street/Violeta Avenue
         2.  Carson Street/Juan Avenue
         3.  Carson Street/Town Center Drive
         4.  Carson Street/Norwalk Boulevard
         5.  Carson Street/Claretta Avenue

             (219th Street)
         11. Norwalk Boulevard /221st Street
         12. Norwalk Boulevard /223rd Street
         13. Norwalk Boulevard /256th Street
    Existing lane configurations and traffic control at the study intersections
    are shown on Exhibit 4-5. Morning and evening peak hour traffic counts
    were conducted at the thirteen intersections in June 2007, and are depicted
    on Exhibit 4-6. The peak hours are the highest volume hour within the
    morning peak period (7:00 - 9:00 AM) and the evening peak period (4:00 -
    7:00 PM). Copies of the traffic count data sheets are provided in Appendix
    A of the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan Technical Background Report:
    Volume III. The Highway Capacity Software (HCS+), version 5.2 was used
    for this analysis. The signalized intersection LOS is based on average delay
    per peak hour vehicle. The results of the HCS+ intersection analysis for
    Existing Conditions are summarized in Table 4-3. Intersection analysis
    worksheets for existing conditions are provided in Appendix B of the

intersection will be discussed in the following section.
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan         131

    ANALYSIS OF BUILD-OUT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
    Analysis of projected traffic conditions at build-out of the City was
    conducted to determine whether or not the City’s circulation system can
    accommodate the future traffic demands of the City’s land use plan. Build-
    out of the City is assumed to be 20 years from current conditions (2007). If
    roadway or intersection deficiencies are projected to occur as a result of
    build-out of General Plan land uses, then improvements needed to
    accommodate future traffic volumes will be identified.
    Methodology
    The methodology for evaluating future traffic volumes on the roadway
    segments and at intersections in Hawaiian Gardens is based on the
    following major premises:
    1.   The Circulation Element must be consistent with all other Elements of
         the General Plan, especially the Land Use Element, such that there is a
         good balance between the transportation capacity to be provided and
         the travel demand to be generated by the build-out land uses.
    2. The effects of increased traffic in Hawaiian Gardens due to growth and
         development in neighboring communities must be taken into
         consideration. While “through” traffic is not encouraged, its presence
         must be recognized so that the Circulation Element can be responsive.
    3. The City’s current circulation system is built out to its designated
         capacities, and is assumed to be the Build-out network for the Build-out
         analysis. If improvements to the roadway system or intersections are
         needed to accommodate General Plan Build-out, these will be
         recommended as mitigation measures.
    A multi-step process was used, based on the following premises:
           The rate of traffic growth in Hawaiian Gardens is based on the
             general traffic volume growth factors listed in the Guidelines for
             CMP Transportation Impact Analysis in the 2004 Los Angeles
             County Congestion Management Program (LACMP).
           A growth rate of 0.7% per year was used to factor existing traffic
             volumes from 2007 to the planning horizon year.
           The traffic for development in Hawaiian Gardens on vacant or
             underdeveloped parcels was estimated and added to the
             background future traffic volumes. Further details are presented in
             the following paragraphs.
132                                                                January 2010

                                                                              4 – Infrastructure
Future Land Use Trip Generation
While the City of Hawaiian Gardens is generally fully developed, some
parcels are still vacant, or are underdeveloped and have the potential for
further development. The Land Use Element of the General Plan quantifies
the potential development on these vacant or underutilized parcels. The
remaining potential development on these parcels of interest in Hawaiian
Gardens is estimated to consist of approximately 494 medium density
residential dwelling units on vacant or underutilized parcels.
The proposed Hawaiian Gardens Casino expansion project will also add
significant impacts on the City’s future roadway network. As proposed, the
Hawaiian Gardens Casino Expansion Project would consist of expanding
the number of gaming tables from 169 tables to 285 tables with a 230-seat
restaurant, a 23,100 square-foot multi-purpose facility and 2,300 square feet
of retail space. The potential traffic impacts of the proposed project are
based on the traffic study conducted by Katz, Okitsu & Associates in 2006.
The number of trips that would be generated by the potential development
was calculated, and is summarized in Appendix C of the General Plan
Technical Background Report: Volume III. A summary, indicating the daily,
morning peak hourly and evening peak hourly traffic volumes is presented
as Table 4-4.

Build-out Daily Traffic Conditions
The City’s Build-out circulation system is assumed to be the same network
in place today. Intersection LOS was determined for the build-out year
using the same methodology as that used for the analysis of existing
conditions. The results are presented in Table 4-5. Intersection analysis
worksheets for build-out conditions are provided in Appendix B of the
General Plan Technical Background Report: Volume III.

Review of Table 4-5 indicates that all intersections would continue to
operate at LOS D or better under build-out conditions, with the exception
of the following two intersections:
       Carson Street and Norwalk Boulevard (LOS “E” in the AM Peak
         Hour and LOS “F” in the PM Peak Hour)
       Carson Street and Violeta Avenue ( LOS “F” in the PM Peak Hour)
Recommended Improvements to Mitigate Impacts
Since the acceptable threshold for LOS is D, these two intersections are
considered to be impacted. In order to achieve the acceptable LOS
threshold of D, the segment of Carson Street east of Norwalk Boulevard
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan       137

       would need to be widened to six lanes. Traffic volumes will increase
       gradually over time, so widening would not be an immediate action the City
       would need to take. Rather, the City would need to monitor traffic growth,
       and be prepared to act when the levels of congestion are reached when
       widening becomes essential. To the extent that future development
       contributes to the need for widening, a fair-share contribution to the cost of
       the widening can be made a condition of approval for future developments.
       The second intersection, Carson Street and Violeta Avenue, serves as the
       main entrance to the Hawaiian Gardens Casino. In addition to widening to
       six lanes on Carson Street, traffic control system improvements to help
       expedite access to and from the freeway should be implemented. With
       these measures, traffic operating conditions at this intersection can be
       maintained to acceptable levels.
       A summary of the build-out delay and LOS values with the recommended
       mitigation measures are presented in Table 4-6. Intersection analysis

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommended Roadway Classifications
Build-out of the City entails the potential development of 494 new dwelling
units and proposed Hawaiian Gardens Casino Expansion. The potential
development is estimated to generate over 15,000 new daily trips, with
approximately 500 new trips in the morning peak hour, and approximately
1000 trips in the evening peak hour.
With build-out of the City, increased traffic volumes will occur throughout
the City, with deficient conditions (Level of Service “E” or “F”) forecasted at
two study intersections. It is recommended that the City of Hawaiian
Gardens modify its roadway functional classification system to
accommodate the future circulations needs.
As pointed out in the Existing Setting section of this report, the City of
Hawaiian Gardens General Plan contains the following street
classifications:
       Major: 100 feet of right-of-way
       Secondary: 80 feet of right-of-way
       Connector: 60 feet of right-of-way
The proposed modifications on roadway functional classification system are
as follows:
        Major Arterial – 6-lane
        Major Arterial – 4-lane
        Secondary Arterial with center divider (four lanes)
        Secondary Arterial without center divider (four lanes)
        Local Street
The reason for this recommendation is to accommodate traffic volume levels
in the future that will likely require the addition of lanes on some roadway
segments. The City’s current classification system does not have a roadway
classification that reflects a right-of-way width greater than 100 feet. Major
Arterials with 100 feet of right-of-way are intended to be four-lane facilities.
However, some Major Arterial roadway segments in the City of Hawaiian
Gardens, specifically some sections of Carson Street, need to be upgraded to
six lanes, three lanes in each direction. In other cities in the region, the six
travel lanes have been accommodated within the 100-foot right-of-way by
narrowing lanes and/or eliminating parking or bike lanes.
It is proposed that a “Major with six lanes” category be added to the City’s
classification system, and assigned to Carson Street west of Norwalk
Boulevard. This category would have a right-of-way width of 108 feet.
Assigning this designation to this segment of Carson Street would make it
possible for the City to preserve or acquire additional right-of-way as
development or re-development takes place along these arterials. With
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan         139

    additional right-of-way, the City can achieve desirable design standards
    with appropriate lane widths, center dividers, and appropriate curb lane
    treatment.
    Major Arterials
    Major Arterials would be four-lane or six-lane divided facilities that would
    carry the highest levels of traffic volumes in the City, mostly in excess of
    40,000 to 50,000 vehicles per day (vpd). Major arterials carry a large volume
    of intra-regional through traffic destined to and from major activity centers
    in the City, and to and from the freeway system. Frequent access to
    abutting land uses is discouraged.
         x   The right-of-way width for a 6-lane Major Arterial would be 108
             feet. The LOS E capacity of a 6-lane Major would be 53,000 vpd.
         x   The right-of-way for a 4-lane Major Arterial would be 100 feet. The
             LOS E daily capacity of a 4-lane Major would remain at 40,400 vpd.
    Secondary Arterials
    Secondary arterials would be four-lane divided or undivided facilities
    usually capable of carrying up to 30,000 to 36,000 vehicles per day without
    serious traffic delays. They are designed to carry traffic between Major
    Arterials or to lesser thoroughfares and have right-of-way widths of 80 feet
    with 64 feet of roadway width curb- to-curb. The major difference between
    divided and undivided Secondary Arterials would be that the vehicle-
    carrying capacity for a divided facility would be higher than for an
    undivided facility. Most of the roadways designated as Secondary roadways
    in the City of Hawaiian Gardens have been improved to provide some form
    of center roadway divider for left-turn channelization. Adoption of this
    recommended classification will simply acknowledge the difference
    between the divided and undivided Secondary facilities in the City.
         x   The Secondary Divided Arterial would have two travel lanes in each
             direction, and a center roadway divider to provide separate
             channelization for left-turning vehicles. The daily LOS E capacity of
             a Secondary Divided Arterial would be approximately 36,000 vpd.
         x   The Secondary Undivided Arterial would have two travel lanes in
             each direction, and no center divider. Parking lanes or bike lanes
             would typically be provided. The daily LOS E capacity of
             Secondary Undivided Arterial would be 30,000 vpd.
    Secondary Arterials are better suited than Major Arterials to serve adjacent
    land uses, and to carry traffic between adjacent neighborhoods, distributing
    traffic between local streets and Major Arterials. Side street access and
    driveways to individual properties are more frequent.

                                                                                    4 – Infrastructure
Local Streets
Local streets would be comprised of Collector and Residential streets.
Collector streets are normally two lanes and are intended to collect and
route local traffic to the higher classification roads. A collector street
typically has a roadway width of 40 feet within 60 feet of right-of-way.
Residential streets constitute a major part of the road network in the City
of Hawaiian Gardens. They would have a right-of-way between 50 and 60
feet, with two travel lanes, parking lanes, sidewalk and parkway. The
intent of the residential street system is simply to carry residential traffic
from the neighborhoods to the higher classification street system.
With this revised classification system, some changes to the current
roadway designations are recommended. The recommended functional
classifications for the roadways in Hawaiian Gardens are illustrated in
Exhibit 4-8. The following summarizes roadway segments for which
changes in classification are recommended:

CIRCULATION ISSUES
The following issues relate to circulation and mobility in Hawaiian
Gardens:
     Carson Street links the community to the Cities of Long Beach to
        the west, and Cypress to the east and provides the community with
        exposure to regional commuters and visitors. Because of this, the
        street establishes a strong visual image (positive and negative) for
        the City. A specific issue mentioned for Carson Street concerns
        aesthetics and beautification of the corridor. Decorative elements
        and urban design features, such as City entry signs, a consistent
        sign scheme, and additional landscaping, would vitalize the setting
        and are currently being developed by the City.
     The 605 freeway off-ramp directly west of the City on Carson Street
        provides good accessibility to the City. Most major commercial
        centers in the City, including the Hawaiian Gardens Casino, are all
        located along Carson Street. Due to high traffic volumes on the
        street, signal light synchronization and other traffic solutions
        would also be beneficial. According to City officials, signal lights
        were synchronized by the County several years ago; however,
        comments were received indicating additional work is necessary. A
        street widening program was also mentioned to help improve traffic
        conditions.
     According to City staff, several residential streets are also too
        narrow for proper circulation. Specific streets include Hawaiian
        Ave, Clareta Ave, and Vern Ave. Surface street parking along both
        sides of the street adds to the problem, and many times, as
        discussed at the community meetings, there is only sufficient room
        for one lane of cars to pass. Additionally, most uses in this area are
        multi-family and designated Intermediate Density, which is
        overburdening the capacity of the streets.       Some limited street
        widening may be possible; however, in most cased the only way to
        widen the street is to eliminate the adjacent sidewalk, which is not
        an acceptable solution.
     Specific areas in the City, such as alleys and the backs of
        commercial buildings, are a safety concern. There is a higher
        potential of danger in these areas due to limited visibility and sparse
        lighting. When necessary, the City encourages property owners to
        install adequate lighting on the backs of buildings.
     The City should also identify and prioritize improvements for
        specific areas, such as alleys. The alleys are widely used for
        vehicular access to residential and commercial lots. Because of the
        high utilization, they need repairs, such as pavement resurfacing
        and improved lighting.
City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan         147

       Clareta Street should be extended, in order to provide access to Carson
        Street from the residential neighborhoods in the southeast portion of
        the City.
       The pedestrian bridge over the channel connecting to Long Beach
        should be kept open.
       One-way streets are a problem. They should be converted to two-way
        streets.
       A community transit system should be created for residents. There is a
        senior transit system currently.
       The new extension of 226th Street in the southwest corner of the City is
        a popular place for drag racing. Speed humps should be considered as a
        solution.
       221st Street should be extended over the Artesia Wash to provide for
        improved circulation and direct access across the Artesia Wash.
        Currently, because 221st does not provide a direct route, traffic is
        diverted to Civic Center Drive to the north, and 223rd Street to the
        south.
    GUIDING PRINCIPLES
    The Circulation Element guiding principles will provide direction for the
    City in the planning and management of the circulation network in
    Hawaiian Gardens.
          Maintain and enhance an efficient circulation system to accommodate the travel
            needs of the City
          Provide a balance between economic development, regional mobility, and the
            preservation of residential neighborhoods and community facilities.
          Ensure the efficiency and safety of vehicular and non-motorized traffic on the
            City Streets

GOALS AND POLICIES
Goals and policies of the Circulation Element will help maintain an efficient
circulation system within Hawaiian Gardens.
Reduce the effects of regional traffic on the community
Goal CIR-1:      To provide a safe and efficient regionally-oriented
                 transportation system designed to channel non-local
                 traffic and trucks onto the major arterial street system
                 and discourage encroachment into community areas or
                 residential neighborhoods.
Policies:
    CIR-1.1      Use the Circulation Element to guide detailed planning and
                 implementation of the city's roadway system.
    CIR-1.2      Adopt street cross-section standards and ensure all new
                 and upgraded roadway facilities are constructed or
                 upgraded to meet City standards where feasible.
    CIR-1.3      Provide adequate capacity on the Major Arterials, to
                 encourage through traffic to stay on the major street
                 system, and to discourage diversion onto the secondary and
                 residential street system.
    CIR-1.4      Evaluate the City’s truck routes, to ensure that movement
                 of truck traffic is accommodated by and confined to the
                 designated streets to the greatest extent possible.
    CIR-1.5      Implement traffic signal coordination to enhance traffic
                 flow, and reduce delay at signalized intersections.
    CIR-1.6      Improve access to and from freeway ramp facilities, and to
                 facilitate truck movements.
Goal CIR-2:      Provide and maintain a secondary network of arterial
                 streets and local streets to accommodate the internal
                 circulation needs of the City’s businesses and residents.
Policies:
    CIR-2.1      Make arterial or intersection improvements where
                 necessary to accommodate traffic demand that would
                 otherwise divert to secondary and local streets.
    CIR-2.2      Enforce speed restrictions throughout the City, especially
                 on local streets.

                signalized intersections.
        CIR-3.3 Identify and, where feasible, remove distracting signage,
                and sight-distance barriers.
        CIR-3.4 Update and enforce a defensible city-wide speed limit
                program.
    Goal CIR-4: Through street design and evaluation, promote the
                safety of bicyclists and pedestrians on the public street
    Policies:
        CIR-4.1 Identify and address bicycle and pedestrian safety hazards,
                including mid-block crossings, missing or deficient
                sidewalks or bike lanes, and unsafe intersections.
        CIR-4.2 In cooperation with the School District, implement and
                maintain a “Recommended Safe Routes to School” guide for
                parents.

                                                                           4 – Infrastructure
Transportation Demand Management/Transportation
System Management
Transportation Demand Management
Goal CIR-5:    Reduce traffic demand through TDM measures, such as
               ridesharing programs, rideshare support services,
               shuttle services, bicycle and pedestrian system
               improvements, information dissemination, and other
               trip reduction measures.
Policies:
    CIR-5.1    Implement land use and employment strategies to reduce
               the need for travel.
    CIR-5.2    Promote ridesharing through publicity and provision of
               information to the public.
    CIR-5.3    Encourage new development to incorporate design features
               which facilitate transit service and encourage transit
               ridership such as bus pullout areas, covered bus stop
               facilities, efficient pedestrian paths through projects to
               transit stops, and incorporation of pedestrian walkways
               that pass through subdivision boundary walls.
    CIR-5.4    Encourage mixed-use projects to provide an internal system
               of pedestrian and bicycle amenities, linking site uses and
               providing linkages to surrounding uses.
    CIR-5.5    Encourage a mix of uses within a project designed to
               maximize internal trip making, maximize the use of
               parking facilities, and to promote a shift from auto use to
               pedestrian and bicycle modes of travel.
    CIR-5.6    Encourage the provision of additional regional public
               transportation services and support facilities, including
               park-and-ride lots near the freeway interchanges and
               within village centers.
    CIR-5.7    Investigate and encourage innovative transportation
               solutions to serve the community.

    Transportation System Management
    Goal CIR-6:    Using Transportation System Management strategies,
                   improve the flow of traffic on City streets through
                   means other than adding roadway capacity.
    Policies:
        CIR-6.1    Require proper spacing and interconnect traffic signals
                   where feasible to maximize the smooth progression of
                   traffic flows and to minimize delay and stop and go
                   conditions.
        CIR-6.2    Discourage the provision of on-street (curbside) parking to
                   minimize traffic conflicts and increase the traffic carrying
                   capacity of the roadway system.
        CIR-6.3    Evaluate the use of protected-permissive left-turn phasing
                   at appropriate intersections, to reduce vehicle delay during
                   off-peak periods.
        CIR-6.4    Promote the consolidation of parking and related
                   circulation facilities, where appropriate, to minimize the
                   number of ingress and egress points onto arterials.
    Goal CIR 7:    Strive to achieve a public transportation system which
                   serves the needs of the community, is accessible to all,
                   and is a viable alternative to the single occupant vehicle.
    Policies:
        CIR-7.1    Participate in local and regional transit system/commuter
                   rail/transportation demand management planning and
                   implementation activities.
        CIR-7.2    Promote an increase in the use of public transit and para-
                   transit services.
        CIR-7.3    Review new developments to include accommodations for
                   TDM programs, including public transportation and
                   parking management.
        CIR-7.4    Encourage the construction of bus shelters and bus
                   turnouts/bays at key stops as appropriate.

Capital Improvements
Element
INTRODUCTION
Capital improvements are an essential component of the development and
ongoing maintenance of a balanced, stable community. Capital
improvements include major infrastructure projects, such as improvements
to roads, drainage facilities, sewer and water lines, transit lines, and other
public facilities.
The Capital Improvement Element coordinates community planning,
financial capacity and physical development. The Capital Improvement
Element is a separate plan from the City’s short-term Capital Improvement
Program (CIP). The CIP is developed annually for short-term projections of
capital improvements needs and upcoming projects. The short-term
program includes both a program outlining the proposed improvements,
and a corresponding capital improvement budget that includes an
estimated breakdown of cost for each improvement by upcoming fiscal year.
The CIP details year by year requirements and is typically established by an
intensive work program of the major City departments.
The City of Hawaiian Gardens updates its short-term CIP consistently. The
Capital Improvement Element, on the other hand, discusses long term
improvements needed to adequately support the General Plan. As a result of
the goals and objectives of the General Plan, it will be necessary to
implement certain capital improvements over the next 20 years. The Capital
Improvement Element and Program are coordinated, so that the plans are
consistent with each other.

    RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
    The Capital Improvement Element is related to the other Hawaiian Gardens
    General Plan elements because it must be consistent with every element in
    the General Plan. Capital improvements are not only the foundation for the
    everyday function of the City, but also serve the fundamental existing and
    future needs of residents, workers, and visitors of Hawaiian Gardens. It is
    necessary to plan for capital improvements in order to ensure that the City
    has an up-to-date reflection of the improvements needed throughout the
    community, funding mechanisms, and a timely schedule to carry out each
    project.
    CURRENT GENERAL PLAN IMPROVEMENTS
    The 1994 Capital Improvements Element contains several improvements
    that the City had planned. The following matrix (Table 4-8) contains a brief
    description of the proposed improvements, and the current status of the
    improvements as identified by City staff.
    Because of the long-range and large scale nature of capital improvements,
    several projects outlined in the 1994 Capital Improvements Element are
    currently underway. For instance, the pavement management program is an
    ongoing program that provides for regularly scheduled road maintenance.
    Other improvements—such as undergrounding overhead utilities and
    constructing landscape medians—are part of other comprehensive plans
    like the Norwalk Boulevard Façade Renovation Program that also includes
    streetscape improvements.

PROPOSED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS
The City has prepared a Draft Capital Improvements Program for Fiscal
Year 2007-08 through 2013-14. The program lists future improvements that
will help attain goals and policies in the General Plan. The following
projects are included in the proposed CIP:
Parks
      Fedde Middle School Sports Complex - Construct sports complex
        at Fedde Middle School, which includes new track and stadium,
        baseball diamond, basketball and tennis courts, and additional
        parking.
Public Facilities
      Library and Community Safety Center - Design and construction of
        tenant improvements for the new library and community safety
        center within existing building located on Carson Street.
      C. Robert Lee Activity Center Improvements - Construction of a
        second-floor addition above the weight room of the C. Robert Lee
        Activity Center.
      Parking Improvements (C. Robert Lee Center) - Provide additional
        parking for the C. Robert Lee Activity Center by removing existing
        tennis courts and covered walkway.
      City Hall Expansion - Additional office space and conference room.
        The City Hall Expansion includes multipurpose center addition to
        the C. Robert Lee Center, and an addition to the Senior Center, to
        house city recreational programs.
Safe Route to School
      Safe Route to School Program - Installation of flashing red beacons,
        speed humps, high visibility signs and access ramps for both
        Ferguson Elementary School and Hawaiian Elementary School. The
        program is 90 percent funded by a state grant program designed to
        improve the safety of children traveling to and from school, and
        encourage walking and bicycling.
Streets
      Annual Street Maintenance Program - A city-wide street
        maintenance program that includes pavement rehabilitation.
        Streets are identified and updated through the Pavement
        Management Assessment.
City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan        157

         Carson Streetscape Improvements - Aesthetic improvements to
           sidewalks, median islands, landscaping, irrigation and street
           furniture on Carson Street. The improvements will extend along
           Carson Street.
         Dead-end Street Project (Phase II) - Connect the west terminus of
           226th Street to Pioneer Boulevard to provide improved traffic
           circulation and aesthetic improvements.
          Monument Signs – Install four monument signs at the major
           gateways to Hawaiian Gardens, which includes Norwalk Boulevard
           at the northern and southern gateways, and Carson Street, at the
           western and eastern gateways.
         Bloomfield Avenue Median and Overlay - Construction of a
           rubberized asphalt overlay and landscape median in conjunction
           with the utility undergrounding project. The project will extend
           from Carson Street to the south, up to the city limit in the north.
         Claretta Avenue Extension - Connection of the north terminus of
           Claretta Avenue to Carson Street, intended to provide improved
           circulation by channelizing traffic and reducing the occurrence of
           conflicting turning movements. Also provides aesthetic
           improvements.
         Norwalk Boulevard Streetscape - This project is the companion to
           the Carson Streetscape Project, and includes the installation of
           decorative sidewalks, curb ramps, concrete intersections, street
           trees, and street furniture to improve the aesthetic appearance of
           the street. Provision for the future undergrounding of utilities is
           also an integral element. The project extends from the city limit to
           the south, to the city limit to the north.
         Norwalk Boulevard Overlay - Construction of an asphalt overlay,
           from 211th Street to 226th Street, to extend the life of the pavement
           structure on Norwalk Boulevard.
    Utilities
         Bloomfield Avenue Electrical Undergrounding - Replace
           dilapidated wood pole-mounted electrical services with
           underground electrical services. It is located along Bloomfield
           Avenue from the south City limits to the north City limits.
         Bloomfield Avenue Storm Drain - Extend a new storm drain from
           the Coyote Creek channel to Bloomfield Avenue to mitigate storm
           flooding. The project location is Woodson Street from the Coyote
           Creek channel to Bloomfield Avenue, and a portion of Bloomfield
           Avenue north of Woodson Street. This is necessary to reduce
           ponding during flood events.
158                                                                 January 2010

                                                                               4 – Infrastructure
      Norwalk Boulevard Electrical Undergrounding - Replace
         dilapidated wood pole-mounted utilities with underground utilities
         on Norwalk Boulevard, through both north of Carson Street and
         south of Carson Street.
RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS
In order to support buildout projections as part of the Hawaiian Gardens
General Plan, additional improvements should be incorporated in addition
to the proposed City capital improvements.
Circulation Network
Buildout analysis of the circulation system concludes that two
intersections, 1) Carson Street and Norwalk Boulevard and 2) Carson Street
and Violeta Avenue, would not continue to operate below the acceptable
level of service (LOS) threshold “D”. The Carson Street and Norwalk
Boulevard intersection is projected to operate at LOS “F” in the PM Peak
Hour, and the Carson Street and Violeta Avenue intersection is projected to
operate at LOS “E” in the AM Peak Hour and LOS “F” in the PM Peak Hour.
Since the acceptable threshold for LOS is “D”, these two intersections are
considered to be impacted. In order to achieve the acceptable LOS threshold
of “D”, the segment of Carson Street west of Norwalk Boulevard would need
to be widened to six lanes. Traffic volumes will increase gradually over time,
so widening would not be an immediate action the City would need to take.
Rather, the City would need to monitor traffic growth, and be prepared to
act when the levels of congestion are reached when widening becomes
essential. To the extent that future development contributes to the need for
widening, a fair-share contribution to the cost of the widening can be made
a condition of approval for future developments.
In addition to widening to six lanes, traffic control system improvements to
help expedite access to and from the freeway should be implemented. These
improvements are part of a regional program—the Carson Street Traffic
Synchronization Program—that Los Angeles County Public Works is
administering. Traffic signal synchronization on Carson Street is scheduled
to be completed mid-2008. With these measures, traffic operating
conditions at this intersection can be maintained to acceptable levels.
Parks/Other Facilities
The Land Use and Open Space/Recreation Elements recommend that,
during the next 20 years, the City add new parkland and other open space
improvements. A potential park is recommended in the vicinity south of
Carson Street, between Verne and Hawaiian Avenues. Another potential
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan         159

    park location is in the southeast portion of the City, east of Norwalk
    Boulevard and north of Woodson Street.
    Fire Station
    The Land Use Element identified that a new fire station is urgently needed
    for the community. The exact location should be determined at a later date,
    however, it should be located near the existing fire station, as to not impact
    emergency personnel response time. This fire station is intended to replace
    the existing, outdated facility located at Norwalk Boulevard and 213th
    Street. The existing facility does not meet current Los Angeles County Fire
    Department Station Standards for size and facilities.

                                                                                4 – Infrastructure
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS BUDGET
The estimated total budget of the recently adopted 7-Year Capital
Improvement Program is $73,864,500 for fiscal years 2007/08 through
2013/14. The distribution of the CIP budget is proposed, as follows:
                   Project Type            Budget Amount  Percentage
           Parks                            $ 16,613,000       22.5%
           Public Facilities                $ 6,558,000         8.9%
           Safe Schools                     $   287,000         0.4%
           Street Improvements              $ 17,069,000       23.1%
           Utility/Infrastructure           $ 28,837,500       39.0%
           Downtown Beautification          $ 4,500,000          6.1%
           Total                            $ 73,864,500       100%
           Source: City of Hawaiian Gardens
The CIP allocates the most funding for utility/infrastructure improvements
(39 percent) and park improvements (22.5 percent. Although the total
budget for the 7-year CIP is $73,864,500, approximately $42,050,000
remains without a funding source.
Funding sources for the 7-year CIP include:
        Proposition A and Proposition C – Two and one-half cent sales tax
         measures to finance a countywide transit development program.
         The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
         (MTA) is responsible for administering the program and
         establishing guidelines. 25 percent of the Proposition A tax
         revenues and 20 percent of the Proposition C tax revenues are
         earmarked for the Local Returns Programs to be used by cities and
         the County of Los Angeles in developing and/or improving local
         public transit, paratransit and related transportation infrastructure.
        Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) – Federal funds
         received by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
         (HUD) for the purpose of benefiting low and moderate income
         areas and disabled residents.
        Gasoline Tax – Revenue from gasoline tax funds apportioned under
         the State Streets and Highways Code. Expenditures may be for any
         street related purpose on the City’s system of streets, including
         maintenance.
        General Fund – The fund designation used to account for financial
         resources applicable to the general governmental operations of the
         City of Hawaiian Gardens.
        MTA Grant – State and Federal Funding awarded to the City
         through the MTA “Call for Projects” including the Regional
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan            161

             Bikeway and Pedestrian Improvements, Major Improvements to
             Rail and Arterial Highways, Traffic Signal Synchronization, Bus
             Speed Improvements, Bus Capital Projects, Shuttle and Vanpool
             projects, and scenic beautification projects.
            Redevelopment Agency Funds – A fund established by a property
             tax increment above the established base year amount to fund
             public and private development projects that target the removal of
             blight within the project area.
            Safe Route to School Program – Administered by Caltrans, this
             program provides State and Federal for projects that protect the
             safety of school children traveling to and from school.
            State Proposition 42 - $127 million for transfer to the State
             Controller for apportionment to cities by formula, to be used for
             local street maintenance, rehabilitation, reconstruction, and storm
             damage repair. Funding is derived from the State Transportation
             Congestion Improvement Act passed in 2002. State law requires
             sales and use taxes on motor fuels to be used for public
             transportation, City and County road repairs and improvements.
            Bond 1B – Special bond funds approved by the voters for street
             resurfacing – 2 year funding.
            Los Angeles County Park Bond
            California Park Bond – Funds for flood and park improvements
             throughout California.
            General Obligation Bond – In 2006, the City Redevelopment
             Agency issued a tax allocation bond program consisting of Series A
             bonds of $7,730,000 and Series B bonds of $4,775,000.
            SB 821 – In 2005, the State refunded the Transportation and
             Development Act Article 3, issuing annual funding for bicycle and
             pedestrian funding. The City gets about $8,000 per year. The City
             uses these funds for sidewalk and ADA ramp upgrades at the street
             corners. Funds can also be used for bike lane striping and bikeway
             facilities.
    CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ISSUES
    Issues related to capital improvements in the City include:
            The City should ensure adequate funding sources are provided for
             proposed capital improvements. Projects should proceed on a
             schedule, as City funds permit.

Conservation Element
INTRODUCTION
Conservation refers to the management of natural resources to prevent
waste, destruction, or neglect. The Conservation Element addresses the
requirements of Government Code Section 65302 (d). The Conservation
Element focuses on the protection and sustainability of natural resources,
including water resources, biological resources and wildlife, soils, and
energy. The Conservation Element also addresses solid waste in the City,
and the provision for programs and policies related to managing renewable
and nonrenewable resources. Hawaiian Gardens is almost entirely built out;
however, it is still necessary to address natural resources that are significant
components of the community, and their preservation and resourceful
utilization. Development and population growth are constant in the
community, therefore, the careful management of natural resources is
essential.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
As mandated by State law, the Conservation Element must be consistent
with all other elements of a General Plan. The content and discussion in the
Conservation Element is similar to that of the Land Use, Open
Space/Recreation, Safety Elements, and others in the General Plan, that
identify natural resources and open space. However, all elements in a
General Plan are interrelated to an extent. Goals and policies in the
Conservation Element address energy efficiency, conservation and
preservation of natural resources, and recycling opportunities available in
the City, which overlap with policies and programs created in other General
Plan Elements. The overall scope of the Conservation Element is directed at
restoration and protection of the quality of the City’s physical environment,
natural and manmade, through conserving natural water courses, soils, and
plant life.
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan          167

    RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
    Related plans and programs include policy at the federal, state, and local
    levels that apply to the topic resources in the Conservation Element.
    Federal Clean Water Act
    Congress passed the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of
    1972 and the Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1977 to provide for the restoration
    and maintenance of the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the
    nation’s lakes, streams, and coastal waters. The CWA implements several
    programs, including federal effluent limitations and State water quality
    standards, the discharge of pollutants and dredged and fill materials into
    navigable waters, and enforcement programs.
    California Environmental Quality Act
    The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is the primary
    instrument for ensuring that environmental impacts of local development
    projects are appropriately assessed and negative impacts mitigated, and if
    not fully mitigated, ensuring that project benefits to the community are
    substantial enough to override any potential impacts.
    National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
    The City of Hawaiian Gardens is under the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles
    Regional Water Quality Control Board (LARWQCB), which implements
    the NPDES permit for the Los Angeles area. The NPDES permit is a
    requirement of the Clean Water Act, and under the permit, jurisdictions
    must implement measures to reduce urban runoff during all phases of
    development and building operation. Requirements include incorporating
    Best Management Practices to reduce runoff from construction and existing
    developed sites, reporting violations to the LARWQCB, and public
    education regarding the negative water quality impacts from urban runoff.
    Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32)
    In September 2006, the California Governor signed into law AB 32, which
    formally commits the state to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990
    levels by the year 2020, through an enforceable statewide emissions cap. It
    is the responsibility of local jurisdictions to now address their General
    Plan’s impact on global warming, and consider ways to reduce greenhouse
    gas emissions. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) will begin
    enforcing limits on emissions in 2012. The law also requires CARB to
    institute a mandatory emissions reporting and tracking system to monitor
    and enforce compliance with emissions limits.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
Water Resources
The importance of water as a resource must be approached in terms of its
quality and quantity, sources of supply, uses and demands, and the
potential for its destruction, as well as its sustainability. Additional
information on the water supply infrastructure system is provided in the
Capital Improvement Element (Section 4).
Supply
Water service in Hawaiian Gardens is provided by the Golden State Water
Company (formerly the Southern California Water Company) Region II
Central District – Central Basin East Artesia System. The Central District –
Central Basin East Artesia System serves approximately 19,600 customers in
the communities of Artesia, Norwalk, Hawaiian Gardens, and portions of
Cerritos, South Gate, and Lakewood. The City of Hawaiian Gardens lies
within the Golden State Water Company Artesia System and Customer
Service Area (Artesia CSA).
Water sources in the area include a blend of groundwater pumped from the
Central Groundwater Basin and imported water from the Colorado River
and the Bay Delta in Northern California (40 percent imported and
purchased water, 60 percent water pumped from ground wells). The
Golden State Water Company has two external connections: one with
Cerritos that has a Metropolitan Water District (MWD) connection, and
another Orange County connection with an MWD connection. The Golden
State Water Company has no immediate concern with the availability of
water supply because it has entitlement of groundwater resources in the
Central Groundwater Basin, with supplemental imported water available
from MWD. The Golden State Water Company also leases additional water
rights from other entities that no longer pump groundwater but have
entitlements, in order to meet the increases in water demand from its
service area. The water company is currently working on the construction
of new wells, pumping plants, water mains, new wells, pumping plants,
water mains, and other improvements, including replacement wells for
older wells.
The City of Hawaiian Gardens is supplied by four active wells, including
Centralia 3 and 4, Juan and Halbrite. The Centralia and Juan wells pump to
reservoirs and are then re-pumped to the system. The southern portion of
the Artesia System is a relatively new system (most of it was constructed in
the 1950’s and 1960’s) and, consequently, it has relatively few main leaks.
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan         169

            Demand
            The City of Hawaiian Gardens comprises approximately 36 percent of the
            Artesia System. Table 5-1 shows historic and projected water demands for
            the Artesia CSA overall, and the City of Hawaiian Gardens specifically.

            Water Quality
            The Federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 and its 1986 amendments are
            intended to ensure the quality of our water supplies. The federal
            government, through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), sets
            standards and monitoring requirements for water utilities. California,
            through its Environmental Protection Agency, has the option of adopting
            the federal standards or setting more stringent ones.
            Testing of domestic water is performed by the Golden State Water
            Company for various constituents, substances, and physical agents, which
            the federal or state government has determined allowable maximum
            contaminant levels (MCL). Testing frequency is determined by the state,
            and varies depending on the source (ground or surface water), and prior
            test results. Presently, the Golden State Water Company is required to
            perform water quality testing according to the following schedule:
                    Organic chemicals – Once every three years (if prior testing resulted
                     in non-detectable measurements);
                    Inorganic chemicals and general minerals – Once every three years
                     in groundwater, and once per year in surface water;
                    General physical conditions – Once every three years; and
                    Radioactivity – Once every four years.
170                                                                              January 2010

                                                                               5 – Community Resources
Golden State Water Company also performs weekly tests for residual
chlorine, pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria, and odor and clarity. In
addition to these constituents, the company also monitors for 42 additional
organic chemicals for which the state and EPA have not yet set standards.
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, Waste Management
Division, monitors the quality of storm water runoff from various locations.
Wastewater
The local sewer lines in the City are maintained by the Los Angeles County
Department of Public Works, Consolidated Sewer Maintenance District
(CSMD). The Los Angeles County Sanitation District provides sewage
treatment for wastewater from Hawaiian Gardens. The Los Angeles
Sanitation District’s Wastewater Treatment Division operates 10 water
reclamation plants and one ocean discharge facility (Joint Water Pollution
Control Plant). Wastewater from Hawaiian Gardens is conveyed to the
Long Beach Water Reclamation Plant.
Biological Resources
Hawaiian Gardens is located in a highly urbanized and dense area. The City
itself is almost entirely developed, with the exception of a few vacant infill
parcels throughout the community.
There are no expansive open space areas, natural features or sensitive
natural plant communities, or riparian habitats for which to consider
conservation. The Coyote Creek Channel traverses the eastern portion of
the City. However, this regional channel is concrete-lined and the natural
Coyote Creek channel has been disturbed. Open space areas in the City
consist of community parks, school playfields, grassy and landscaped lots in
residential areas, and landscaping included in parkways, medians, private
sites, and residential yards. Typical vegetation in the City includes non-
native and ornamental plant species for landscaping, including palm trees,
eucalyptus trees, and shrubs.
As California grows, communities are increasing the demand for limited
resources and generating more waste. It is becoming vital and necessary to
maintain an active role in efficiently managing our limited natural resources,
reducing waste, and preventing pollution. Sustainable landscaping uses
practices that preserve limited and costly natural resources, reduce waste
generation, and help prevent air, water, and soil pollution. The goal of
sustainable landscaping is to minimize environmental impacts. Sustainable
landscaping features healthier, longer-lived plants that rely less on chemical
pesticides and fertilizers, minimize water use, and reduce waste generation
and disposal. They also require less maintenance and help alleviate
groundwater and air pollution concerns.
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan        171

    Sustainable landscaping consists of attractive drought-tolerant plants,
    shrubs, and trees that reduce maintenance costs, require less water, and
    help protect the environment. Drought-tolerant plants can include trees,
    shrubs, ground cover, vines, and beautiful accents1. The Conservation
    Element of the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan should contain goals and
    policies encouraging the use of drought-tolerant and sustainable
    landscaping in the community.
    Historic and Cultural Resources
    Historic and cultural resources are symbols of past civilizations. They can
    provide a sense of place, history and pride for residents of an area. The Los
    Angeles basin has a rich cultural history that dates back to the early
    settlements by Native Americans. The Gabrielino Indians, also known as
    the Tongva, occupied an extensive region in the area, stretching from the
    San Gabriel Mountains to the coast, including the land now occupied by
    Hawaiian Gardens. The Tongva (or Gabrielinos) were the people who
    canoed out to greet Spanish explorer Juan Rodriquez Cabrillo upon his
    arrival off the shores of Santa Catalina and San Pedro in 1542. Their original
    name having been lost to cultural assimilation into Spanish and Mexican
    culture, they came to be called Gabrielinos because of their close association
    with the Mission San Gabriel. They once inhabited all of Los Angeles
    County and northern parts of Orange County. There were an estimated
    5,000 Tongva in the region when the first Spanish settlers arrived in 1781.
    There are 31 known sites believed to have been Tongva villages, each having
    had as many as 400 to 500 huts. Hereditary chieftains who wielded almost
    total authority over the community led the villages.
    The tribe had a large village known as Puvunga, in the area that is now Long
    Beach. Native Americans that lived in that village often went to the area
    that is now Hawaiian Gardens to hunt.
    The National Register of Historic Places is the Nation's official list of
    cultural resources worthy of preservation. The National Register is
    administered by the National Park Service, which is part of the U.S.
    Department of the Interior. Authorized under the National Historic
    Preservation Act of 1966, the National Register is part of a national program
    to coordinate and support public and private efforts to identify, evaluate,
    and protect our historic and archeological resources. Properties listed in the
    Register include districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that are
    significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and
    culture. There are no cultural sites and resources in Hawaiian Gardens
    designated by the National Register. Additionally, there are no locally-
    designated historic sites or resources.

Solid waste
Solid waste disposal services for the City are provided by Consolidated
Disposal Services. Waste from the City is taken to the Bel Art Transfer
Station in Long Beach, with final disposal at Chiquita Canyon Disposal
Facility; a 592-acre facility located in Valencia, north of Los Angeles
County.
Currently, the City contributes approximately 15,713 tons of waste annually.
Approximately 23 percent of waste is recycled through the City’s programs.
Commercial land uses are the largest producer of disposable waste,
generating approximately 6,404 tons of waste and 2,823 tons of recyclable
materials annually (in 2006, Table 5-2). Industrial uses are the lowest
generators of disposable waste and recyclable materials. This may be in part
because industrial land use is a smaller land use category compared to
residential and commercial land uses in Hawaiian Gardens.

AB 939, the California Waste Management Act of 1989, requires local
jurisdictions to prepare, adopt, and implement source reduction and
recycling plans in order to make substantial decreases in the volume of
waste materials going to landfills, and to reach landfill diversion goals of 50
percent. To meet these goals, it is necessary for Hawaiian Gardens to
promote the reduction of solid waste and the stream of waste going to
landfills. In response to this, the City of Hawaiian Gardens has prepared
and adopted an ordinance related to recycling and diversion of construction
and demolition waste.
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan          173

    Recycling
    The City of Hawaiian Gardens has an active recycling program, which
    includes a curbside recycling program, drop-off areas, and providing public
    education materials.
    The curbside recycling program includes picking up recyclable materials,
    but does not include green waste. Recycling materials can include paper,
    plastics, glass, and metal items. There is also one drop-off site located in the
    City, where residents can bring recyclable materials to dispose of. The City
    also provides solid waste disposal services for bulk and special items. The
    service operates bi-monthly, at different sites throughout the City. The
    program targets different neighborhoods in the City each time and
    advertises the opportunity for residents to dispose of bulk items. Large
    disposal containers are provided. This helps eliminate bulk and unnecessary
    items within public areas that are commonly abandoned in yards, vacant
    lots, and other areas.
    The City actively promotes recycling and has provided educational and
    informational pamphlets and flyers on the benefits of recycling. Goals and
    policies in the Conservation Element will serve as a base for the City’s
    active promotion of recycling.
    Energy Resources
    Energy issues impact a wide range of daily activities. All traditional energy
    supply consumed by land uses in the City are imported. There are no wells
    producing oil or natural gas, generating stations, or refineries and
    processing facilities within the City. Natural gas is imported by the
    Southern California Gas Company from its interstate system. Electrical
    energy is accessed by transmission and distribution lines from substations
    owned by Southern California Edison Company.
    Energy Conservation
    Energy is consumed in Hawaiian Gardens through a variety of uses, and
    serves different purposes. Energy is needed for transportation, residential
    and nonresidential heating and cooling, water heating, and lighting. Energy
    conservation is important in preserving non-renewable energy resources to
    ensure that these resources are available to future generations. There are
    numerous benefits associated with energy conservation, such as improved
    air quality, reduction of energy costs, waste stream reduction and water
    conservation. The Conservation Element will contain policies that
    encourage energy conservation, including energy efficiency and public
    education on energy conservation.

                                                                                 5 – Community Resources
A significant component of energy conservation is energy efficiency in the
design of structures within the City. The concept of “green building”
encourages the design, construction, renovation, reuse, or operation of
buildings that enhance resource efficiency, therefore making the building
sustainable. There are several useful and proactive measures for residences
and also nonresidential land uses that owners can take in order to make
their structures more energy efficient.
For residences, homeowners can install high performance windows. These
windows employ advanced technology such as proactive coatings and
improved frame assemblies to trap heat in during winter and keep heat out
during hot seasons. The windows also block damaging ultraviolet sunlight
that can fade carpets and furnishings. Along with improved windows,
ensuring effective insulation is provided for walls, floors, and interior spaces
of a home stabilize temperatures indoors and improve comfort. Installing
effective heating and cooling systems also reduce energy consumption.
ENERGY STAR appliances and fixtures, such as light bulbs, ventilation
fans, refrigerators, washing machines, and other typical household
appliances use less energy, and are easy to find in stores. For yard areas,
using landscape irrigation with low-drip systems, and drought-tolerant
landscaping can reduce wasteful water consumption.
There are also energy conservation methods for nonresidential land uses,
such as commercial and industrial. Operating facilities with tankless water
heating systems, low-flush toilets, and flow-reducing water faucets reduces
water consumption and energy use. For onsite landscaping, native soils and
mature trees should be preserved. This helps prevent soil erosion, maintains
sources of natural cooling, diverts additional waste from landfills, and
preserves nature. Recycling job site and construction waste also helps
divert waste from landfills. Typically, construction and demolition waste
accounts for 21 percent of the statewide waste stream. These materials are
renewable resources which can very easily be recycled.
Energy Efficiency Programs
Local energy efficiency programs are often provided by local utility
purveyors to offer incentives for energy conservation and efficiency. The Gas
Company offers programs and incentives, such as rebates, to their customer
service area. For residences, the 2008 Home Energy Efficiency Rebate
Program offers cash rebates on qualifying energy-efficiency upgrades or
improvements made to single family homes, condominiums, or attached
residential units (maximum of four.)
For nonresidential uses, the Gas Company offers energy efficiency
programs, rebates, and incentives. Rebates are provided for energy efficient
gas appliances and improvements.
The Gas Company also offers energy efficiency programs for large
commercial/industrial businesses. The program provides incentives of up to
$1,000,000 per eligible customer, per year, helps fund energy projects that
save more than 200,000 therms per year, and encourages eligible large
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan        175

    nonresidential customers (such as large industrial, commercial and chain
    account customers) to move forward with comprehensive energy efficiency
    projects and process improvements.
    Global Warming
    The passing of recent legislation has brought the consideration of global
    warming, climate change, and the greenhouse effect to the local level. Local
    agencies approving large projects, including general plans, are required to
    address the issue of global warming and demonstrate what measures will be
    taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
    The greenhouse effect is caused by naturally occurring gases that are
    dispersed in the atmosphere trapping solar heat. Sunlight passes through
    the atmosphere and the incoming solar radiation is radiated from the earth’s
    surface as heat energy. Greenhouse gases (GHG)—such as carbon dioxide,
    methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and others—trapping the
    energy then warm the earth. This effect is analogous to the glass panels of
    greenhouse trapping sunlight energy and warming the interior of the
    structure. Increasing concentrations of these gases therefore, on a large
    scale, are causing a rise in global temperature. This is referred to as global
    warming.
    The human impact and role are contributing GHG at an unprecedented
    rate. GHG are increasing due to four major human activities:
         1.   Combustion of fossil fuels – Carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced
              when gasoline is burned in automobiles, and when coal and natural
              gas are burned to heat and provide electricity to homes and
              businesses.
         2. Deforestation – When vegetation is cleared, burned, or left to decay,
              carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. Vegetation also
              absorbs carbon dioxide. Once vegetation is cleared out, less carbon
              dioxide will be absorbed from the atmosphere.
         3. Decomposition of organic matter – The decay of organic landfill
              waste releases both carbon dioxide and methane into the air.
              Methane is much more potent as a GHG than carbon dioxide.
         4. Livestock – Animals also contribute GHG by releasing methane
              into the air2.

In Hawaiian Gardens, GHG emissions are regulated by the South Coast Air
Quality Management District, in addition to State and federal agencies.
Agencies impose regulations to reduce emissions from both stationary and
mobile sources. These actions have led to a substantial improvement in air
quality in the South Coast Air Basin, and presumably, a concurrent effect on
greenhouse gas emissions. As new requirements, regulations, and
legislations are imposed, further reductions are anticipated.
The City of Hawaiian Gardens is a predominantly built out city and General
Plan projections do not envision substantive increases in nonresidential
square footage and development. The issue of GHG emissions increase from
growth and development are not expected to be a significant concern.
However, the City still produces emissions from stationary and mobile
sources, such as transportation, electricity, and residential and
nonresidential energy uses. The City can address emission reductions
through the encouragement of transportation alternatives, energy
conservation and reduction, and energy-efficient appliances and resources
in new residential development. The Conservation Element will contain
goals, policies, and implementing actions to support the local reduction of
GHG emissions.

    CONSERVATION CONSIDERATIONS
    Green Building
    Green building encourages the design, construction, renovation, reuse, or
    operation of buildings that enhance resource efficiency, therefore making
    the building sustainable. Green building includes design and construction
    strategies that significantly reduce or eliminate the negative environmental
    impacts of a development. There are several benefits of green building,
    including more efficient and cost efficient use of building resources,
    significant energy and operational savings, reduced stormwater impacts and
    air pollution impacts. There are four fundamental objectives of green
    building:
            Conserve natural resources
            Use energy wisely
            Improve indoor air quality
            Plan for livable communities
    Conserve Natural Resources
    The new construction process typically generates a large amount of waste.
    Building strategies can help protect natural resources by using durable
    materials and recycle-content products that divert waste from landfills.
    Additionally, development and landscaping that is designed to use water
    efficiently can conserve water and be cost-efficient.
    Use Energy Wisely
    Generation and use of energy are major contributors to global climate
    change. Demand for energy is also expected to increase due to the state’s
    projected population growth. Improving energy efficiency and using
    renewable energy resources will be significant factors in reducing overall
    energy consumption.
    Improve Indoor Air Quality
    Common sources of indoor air pollution are contaminants found in building
    materials. Common paints, adhesives, floor finishes, and sealants often
    contain and emit unhealthy volatile organic compounds (VOCs). New
    development should ensure that indoor materials are safe and low emitting.
    Plan for Livable Communities
    For local municipalities, green building can provide many economic
    benefits. Development designed to reduce dependence on cars can help
    alleviate traffic congestion, which can in turn improve local business
    productivity. Infill projects can help revitalize older areas and allow public
    funds to be used for existing services. Investing in pedestrian and bicycle
178                                                                 January 2010

                                                                              5 – Community Resources
friendly neighborhoods can also provide transportation alternatives, aiding
in traffic congestion and ambient air quality3.
There are several available strategies to incorporate green building into
community development, such as the development of design guidelines,
standards and regulations as part of the zoning code, or development
incentives in the form of parking reduction and reduced development
application fees. Additional incentives are often also provided by major
public utility purveyors, such as electricity and gas providers.
The Southern California Gas Company—a utility company that currently
serves Hawaiian Gardens—already promotes energy efficiency for its
customers by providing rebates, training, and other incentives. The
programs provided by the Gas Company are for homes and businesses.
The City should identify potential methods to incorporate green building
into new development public and private projects. The City should also
collaborate with public utility purveyors in order to provide Hawaiian
Gardens residents with energy reduction incentives.
CONSERVATION ISSUES
Based on existing conditions, conservation issues that face Hawaiian
Gardens include the following:
         Water conservation is a relevant issue to the entire Southern
          California region. In an effort to conserve water, the City should
          encourage the use of drought-tolerant landscaping throughout the
          community.
         Hawaiian Gardens is highly urbanized and dense, with a shortfall of
          open space and natural resources. The City should preserve and
          maintain open space within the community and look for
          opportunities for new open space where practical.
          The City should encourage energy efficiency throughout the
          community. The City should provide educational materials to
          residents to inform them of energy efficiency and conservation
          opportunities available.
         In order reduce solid waste, the City should continue to provide
          recycling programs to residents, in addition to educational and
          promotional materials on the benefits of recycling and
          opportunities available to recycle in the community.

            Palm trees in Hawaiian Gardens add definition to the public realm
             and act as landmarks. The City should preserve palm trees where
             possible.

Open Space/Recreation
Element
INTRODUCTION
The City of Hawaiian Gardens recognizes that open space and recreational
amenities are significant factors in the community’s quality of life. Open
space is a vital and integral component that greatly contributes to a
community’s well-being. Open space can be any area that provides relief
through passive and active natural and recreational areas. Government
Code Section 65302(e) requires a local government to prepare a local open
space plan. Open space land is considered any parcel or area of land or
water that is essentially unimproved and devoted to open-space use,
including open space for the preservation of natural resources, managed
production of resources, outdoor recreation, public health and safety, and
the protection of special places, features, and objects.
Several key issues will continue to have an impact on the City’s ability to
maintain and expand recreation facilities and services in the future. Infill
development in the City is expected to continue, and increased population
will require a full range of services, including those related to parks and
recreation. Although the City is highly urbanized, opportunities lie in
existing systems and bikeways to provide residents with more open spaces
and recreational opportunities.
The Open Space/Recreation Element guides the comprehensive and long-
range preservation and conservation of open space land. In its discussion,
the element includes recreational facilities, which similarly contribute
activity space. The Open Space Element includes goals and policies, which
were formulated with the consideration of open space and recreation issues
in the community. The goals, which are broad statements of the City’s
desires, are comprised of statements of purpose and direction. The policies
are intended to serve as guidelines for planning and maintaining
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan         183

    recreational facilities and enhancing the natural amenities of Hawaiian
    Gardens.
    RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
    The Open Space Element must be consistent with all other elements in the
    Hawaiian Gardens General Plan. Essentially, all elements of a General Plan
    are interrelated to an extent. This provides a solid foundation for the
    implementation program to achieve the community’s goals and policies in
    the General Plan. The Open Space/Recreation Element most directly relates
    to the Land Use Element.
    The Land Use Element provides a planned land use pattern that includes
    the following land uses: residential, commercial, industrial, public/quasi-
    public, open space, and miscellaneous uses. The specific Park designation is
    applied to parkland in the community that is intended for park and
    recreational use. The Land Use Element allows for the planning and
    maintenance of sufficient parkland and open space in Hawaiian Gardens.
    The Land Use Element reflects the proposed land use pattern in Hawaiian
    Gardens. Reflecting the nature of a typical community, areas that
    experience additional development and population growth will also likely
    experience associated pressure and demand on existing services and
    facilities. Existing facilities therefore will be more intensively utilized,
    making new or expanded facilities necessary for the community.
    Development must adhere to the Land Use Plan, allowing the City to
    monitor where additional residential development is occurring in order to
    determine when additional facilities will need to be accommodated the
    demand of the community.
    The Open Space/Recreation Element is also related to the Community
    Design Element. The Community Design Element discusses the visual
    quality of the built environment in Hawaiian Gardens. The Community
    Design Element also includes policies and recommendations for areas in the
    public realm that includes streetscape and open space provided with
    private development.
    PARK CLASSIFICATIONS
    Open space and park classifications categorize the various types of open
    space, parkland, and recreational space available to Hawaiian Gardens
    residents.
184                                                               January 2010

                                                                             5 – Community Resources
Large Urban Park
Large urban parks serve broad purposes and reach an extended service area.
Large urban parks are often concentrated areas of open space with active
and passive park area, focused on meeting recreational needs as well as
preserving unique landscapes and open spaces.
Community Park
Community parks are large areas offering an array of amenities and of
diverse environmental quality. Community parks may include areas suited
for intense recreation facilities, such as athletic complexes and swimming
pools.
Neighborhood Park
Neighborhood parks or playgrounds include areas for intense recreational
activities, such as field games, crafts, playground equipment, skating and
picnicking areas, and other specialized functions, like skating ramps or
wading pools.
Mini-Park
Mini-parks address limited or unique recreational needs. They often serve a
concentrated or unique population and serve a smaller service area than the
larger parks. Mini-parks offer limited active amenities, and are typically
passive open space. In Hawaiian Gardens, mini-parks are often corner
grassy lots that provide open space relief.
Joint-Use Facility
Public schools and easements also provide the opportunity for open space
and recreational area. Schools are under the jurisdiction of the ABC Unified

    EXISTING FACILITIES
    Hawaiian Gardens has open space and recreational areas available within
    and around the community. Located immediately outside City boundaries, a
    regional park and community park offer various amenities in addition to
    passive open space. Neighborhood parks, recreation centers, and joint-use
    facilities offer active space and recreational opportunities.
    The City relies upon regional facilities for meeting many of the needs of
    residents that cannot be met within Hawaiian Gardens. Due to the intensity
    of development within the City, it would be unreasonable to provide
    regional recreational facilities within the City’s corporate boundaries
    without displacing a substantial number of residents. For this reason, the
    City will continue to look to nearby cities and areas for regional recreational
    facilities. In addition to the existing regional parks and golf courses in the
    surrounding areas, there are several opportunities for recreation in the
    surrounding cities of Long Beach, Cerritos, Lakewood, and Los Alamitos, in
    addition to trails facilities developed along the San Gabriel , Rio Hondo, and
    Los Angeles Rivers.
    Large Urban Parks
    El Dorado East Regional Park
    The El Dorado Regional Park is located at 7550 East Spring Street in the

    Gardens, and lies between the San Gabriel River to the west, and the
    Interstate 605 freeway to the east. The park totals 400.8 acres, and includes
    amenities such as picnic areas and shelters, barbeque grills, children’s
    playgrounds, a youth campground pavilion, a model aircraft flying area, a
    model sailboat area, and two stocked fishing lakes. The park features park
    ranger supervision and also has over four miles of paved bicycle trails.
    Additional amenities include the nature center and a separate 18-hole golf
    course.
    Community Parks
    Community parks are large areas offering an array of amenities and of
    diverse environmental quality. Community parks may include areas suited
    for intense recreation facilities, such as athletic complexes and swimming
    pools.

Aside from public parks, there are several lots located throughout the
community that serve as passive open space. Over time, the City has
acquired individual lots in primarily residential areas. Many of these passive
areas can be found on corner lots, even including pedestrian walkways or
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan         187

    decorative fencing. Although these passive areas are not designated as park
    space, they provide relief and greenery to residential neighborhoods.

RECREATION PROGRAMS
The City provides a variety of recreational and extracurricular activities for
the community. Through the Human Services Department, the City
maintains an active schedule of activities and programs at all of the
recreational facilities, senior centers, and even some parks. Programs
include adult, senior citizens, special events, youth, and educational.
Adult programs include seasonal sports such as men’s basketball league,
soccer league, and softball league, and women’s soccer league. Other
amenities provided for adults include aerobics classes and a weightlifting
room at the C. Robert Lee Activity Center.
Youth programs include boxing, folklorico, salsa and hip hop dance classes,
and karate. There are also teen center and youth center at the C. Robert Lee
Activity Center that offer additional learning programs and recreational
activities. Games rooms are provided at Clarkdale Park, C. Robert Lee
Activity Center, and Lee Ware Recreational Center. Several facilities also
have a computer lab available.
Park counts obtained from City staff reveal that the existing facilities are
extremely popular and widely used by the community. Existing facilities for
which the counts were obtained include the C. Robert Lee Activity Center,
Lee Ware Park, Clarkdale Park, Fedde Junior High School fields, and
Ferguson Elementary School fields (Table 5-4). From January to August of
2007, the total number of participants at various events for all facilities
totaled 54,160, an average of 6,770 participants per month. The C. Robert
Lee Activity Center had the highest amount of visitors and participants,
24,560, as it is the largest facility in the community and features the most
programs. The Fedde field was also used frequently, with a total of 12,000
participants. This is perhaps due to the various adult and youth leagues
hosted by the City throughout the year.

    OPEN SPACE/RECREATION ISSUES
    The record of community issues in this section provides the basis for the
    development of goals and policies for the Open Space/Recreation Element.
          Based on current park standards, the City is lacking a substantial
           amount of parkland for City residents. In order to meet the demand
           of new development and future population, the City must identify
           areas for potential additional park space.
          Hawaiian Gardens has no open space areas for the preservation of
           natural resources. The only areas within the City that are
           considered open space are landscaping areas found along setbacks,
           medians, parkways, and other public rights-of-way.
          There are limited opportunities to acquire new land for park and
           recreation space. The City is almost entirely built out, with only a
           few scattered vacant lots available for infill development.
          In 2000, over 35 percent of the Hawaiian Gardens population was
           under 18. This segment of the population presents a high demand
           for active park space and recreational facilities and services. This
           presents a greater challenge to the City in meeting the demand and
           needs of the population for park and recreation space.
          Demand for existing facilities is high, and current facilities are very
           popular among residents. The City must ensure that existing
           facilities are properly maintained from wear and tear, and also
           available to all residents.
          Prior to the recent update of the City’s zoning code (2006),
           residential and nonresidential development projects rarely provided
           sufficient open space and landscaping onsite. New development
           projects have improved, however, the City must ensure that there
           are sufficient landscape and open space areas within the built
           environment.
          In order to enhance the community’s image, as part of the
           community’s open space, streetscape landscaping should center on
           palm trees as a theme. Palm trees accentuate an area and provide
           rhythm and scale to public spaces.
          A large portion of the community’s existing park and recreation
           land is provided through joint use agreements with other public
           agencies, such as the ABC Unified School District. The City should
           maintain ongoing coordination with public agencies in maintaining
           existing facilities and recognizing opportunities for new facilities.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The guiding principles in the Open Space/Recreation Element will support
the community’s vision for the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan. The
principles will also provide direction for the City in the planning and
management of open space, park, and recreation resources in Hawaiian
Gardens.
        Provide well-rounded recreational opportunities for residents
        Maintain and improve existing parks, open spaces, and recreational facilities
        Encourage healthy and active lifestyles
GOALS AND POLICIES
Goals and policies in the Open Space/Recreation Element will ensure that
Hawaiian Gardens parkland and recreation facilities are preserved and
maintained. The goals and policies will guide the City in park and
recreation planning.
Goal OS-1:        Enhance and improve existing parks and recreational
                  facilities that continue to meet the needs of the
                  community.
Policies:
    OS-1.1        Protect and preserve open space wherever possible.
    OS-1.2        Ensure that parks and recreational resources are accessible
                  and safe for all users.
    OS-1.3        Provide for the redesign, reconfiguration, and replacement
                  of existing spaces and facilities that may be aging and worn.
Goal OS-2:        Provide and promote new recreational opportunities,
                  facilities, and programs in the community.
Policies:
    OS-2.1        Provide sufficient and diverse recreational programs to
                  meet the needs of all residents.
    OS-2.2        Conduct ongoing needs assessment and evaluation of
                  demands for recreational activities and public meeting
                  facilities, and modify programs where necessary to meet the
                  community’s requirements.
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan             195

        OS-2.3 Promote and encourage participation in recreational
               programs from residents.
        OS-2.4 Require that new residential development provide
               recreational facilities or useable open space onsite and that
               those areas are preserved as open space in perpetuity; or
               contribute fees to the public development of additional
               facilities to offset additional demands generated by its
               resident population.
    Goal OS-3: Establish attractive visual environments along major
               public thoroughfares.
    Policies:
        OS-3.1 Provide the consistent use of street trees to identify City
               streets, residential neighborhoods, commercial districts,
               and entry points into the city, blending in with the
               character and species of existing trees.
        OS-3.2 Develop a comprehensive program to improve the City’s
               streetscape environment, prioritizing major commercial
               arterial streets.
        OS-3.3 Develop a Citywide landscape theme within public rights-
               of-way using palm trees as the primary focus.
        OS-3.4 Require that all new development projects install sufficient
               landscaping. The landscape treatment along street
               frontages should especially be well landscaped.
        OS-3.5 Provide an effective irrigation system for proper care of
               landscaping within the public right-of-way.
        OS-3.6 Establish a consistent street lighting program throughout
               the City in order to promote increased visibility and

OPEN SPACE PLAN
Park Standards
Park standards are generally adopted by a City to ensure a reasonable
amount of park space is being provided for the community, and by which to
assess and measure the city’s needs and demands as new projects are
presented and the community’s population changes. Typical standards are
derived from the Recreation, Park, and Open Space Standards and
Guidelines, published by the National Recreation and Park Association
(NRPA). The standards recommend a total of 6.25 – 10.5 acres of parkland
per 1,000 residents. The NRPA Standards also recommend establishing a
classification system for park and facility types.
Communities often adhere to Quimby Act park dedication standards or
locally tailored standards unique to the community. Pursuant to
Government Code Section 66477, local governments may create and enact
ordinance requiring developers to set aside land, donate conservation
easements, or pay fees for park improvements. Fees and land dedications are
based upon the residential density of new developments, and are
proportionate to the amount necessary to provide three acres of park space
per 1,000 residents, unless the amount of existing neighborhood and
community park area exceeds this amount, in which the City may adopt a
higher standard not to exceed five acres per 1,000 residents. Fees paid in lieu
of parkland dedication are earmarked specifically to develop new parks, or
rehabilitate existing neighborhood or community parks or recreational
facilities.
The City of Hawaiian Gardens has not adopted a park dedication ordinance
for the development of new park space. However, the City requires a
Growth Requirements Capital Fee, in which each new development pays a
fee of four percent of the building valuation of that development. The fees
are placed in the City’s General Fund and may be used for any general
government purpose, which may include park and recreational facility
development and rehabilitation if the City deems appropriate.
This General Plan establishes a parkland standard of three acres of active
parkland per 1,000 persons in Hawaiian Gardens. New development will
adhere to this standard.
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan         197

    Park Needs
    The City currently has a total of 3.3 acres of parkland that includes the
    neighborhood parks, Pioneer Park, Clarkdale Park, and Lee Ware Park.
    Including the active playfields at Fedde Junior High and Ferguson
    Elementary School, the total amount of active parkland is 23.3. Based on the
    parkland standard of three acres per 1,000 persons, Hawaiian Gardens
    currently has a ratio of 1.4 acres per 1,000 persons. If the parkland acreage
    remains constant, by the General Plan horizon year of 2020 the ratio would
    be reduced to 1.3 acres per 1,000 persons.
    With regard to park location, The NRPA also recommends a service area
    standard of ½ to ¼ mile service area radius, depending on the size of the
    park. Given the City’s total area of 0.9 square miles, in planning future
    allocation of park space, the City should consider areas that are currently
    underserved.

Air Quality Element
INTRODUCTION
The Air Quality Element of the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan serves to
establish a framework for the City’s approach to improving air quality
throughout the community, and working with neighboring public agencies
to address the prevailing issue. Just as other prevalent development topics
are major components of a General plan—namely land use, circulation,
housing, conservation, and other mandatory elements—the issue of air
quality is a significant consideration in land use planning processes.
Additionally, the Southern California region continues to be a leading area
with significant air quality problems, making the topic even more essential
for consideration. The Air Quality Element provides goals, policies, and
implementing actions that focus on improving air quality through
responsible land use planning, regional coordination, and public education.
Air quality is a growing issue that impacts the entire Los Angeles region. It
is a continuing concern to the health, safety, and welfare of communities in
the Los Angeles region. Although air quality is regional in scale, there are
steps that local governments can take towards attaining reasonable air
quality.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Air Quality Element is an optional element for inclusion in the
Hawaiian Gardens General Plan, as mandated by state law. The element,
however, must still be consistent with all other elements of the General
Plan. The Air Quality Element directly relates to the Land Use, Circulation,
and Safety Elements. The Land Use Element establishes a Land Use Plan
and contains goals, policies, and programs to provide an efficient land use
pattern. The land use pattern provides sufficient residential areas and
balanced nonresidential land uses to support the City, in an effort to
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan        201

    preserve a healthy jobs-housing balance, thus reducing vehicle trips that
    contribute to reduced air quality. The Circulation Element maintains a
    functioning circulation system, including transportation alternatives. The
    Safety Element protects the health and welfare of residents by identifying
    and minimizing natural and man-made hazards and risks to the community.
    REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
    Federal Clean Air Act
    In 1990, major amendments were made to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA)
    in an effort to increase air pollution control efforts throughout the nation.
    The purposes of the Clean Air Act include protecting and enhancing the
    quality of the nation’s air resources, initiating and accelerating a national
    research and development program to achieve the prevention and control of
    air pollution, providing technical and financial assistance to state and local
    governments for the development and execution of their air quality
    programs, and encouraging the development and operation of regional air
    quality programs. The primary objective of the Clean Air Act is to establish
    federal standards for air pollutants from stationary and mobile sources and
    to work with the states to regulate polluting emissions. The Act is designed
    to improve air quality in areas of the country which do not meet federal
    standards, and to prevent significant deterioration in areas where air quality
    exceeds those standards.
    As part of CAA requirements, EPA must identify air pollutants anticipated
    to endanger public health or welfare and to adopt nationally uniform
    ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for these pollutants.
    The CAA also requires that states develop state implementation plans
    (SIPs), which set limits on emissions to assure that air quality within the
    state will meet the NAAQS. For non-attainment areas—areas that do not
    meet national ambient air quality standards—deadlines are set for meeting
    the national standards and permits are required to construct and operate
    new or modified major stationary sources anywhere in the non-attainment
    area.
    California Clean Air Act
    The California Clean Air Act requires non-attainment areas to achieve and
    maintain the state ambient air quality standards by the earliest practical
    date. The Act also requires local air districts to develop plans for attaining
    the state ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide
    standards.
202                                                                 January 2010

                                                                                 5 – Community Resources
Regulatory Agencies
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for
establishing the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and enforcing the
federal Clean Air Act. The EPA also regulates emission sources, such as
aircraft, certain types, and locomotives.
California Air Resources Board
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is responsible for
implementation of the California Clean Air Act, meeting state requirements
of the federal Clean Air Act, and establishing state ambient air quality
standards. The agency is also responsible for setting vehicle emission
standards and fuel specifications, and regulating emissions from other
sources such as consumer products and certain types of mobile equipment.
South Coast Air Quality Management District
The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) is responsible
for monitoring air quality and planning, implementing, and enforcing
programs designed to attain and maintain state and federal ambient air
quality standards in the district. The agency is also responsible for
establishing permitting requirements and issuing permits for stationary
sources and ensuring the new, modified, or relocated stationary sources do
not create net emissions increases. The AQMD enforces air quality rules and
regulations through inspections, public education and training, and fines.
The AQMD includes all areas of Orange County, Los Angeles County,
except for the Antelope Valley, the non-desert portion of western San
Bernardino County, and western Riverside County, including the Coachella
Valley.
AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
Hawaiian Gardens, as well as the region at large, are in the South Coast Air
Basin, as part of the planning and regulatory jurisdiction of the South Coast
Air Quality Management District (AQMD). Within this area, the Federal
and California Clean Air Acts regulate pollution emissions that generally
fall into three categories: criteria air pollutants, toxic air contaminants, and
global warming and ozone-depleting gases. Additionally, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishes ambient air quality
standards for air pollutants, including:
        Ozone (O3)
        Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan           203

           Carbon Monoxide (CO)
           Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)
           Lead (Pb)
           Particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5)
    In addition to the six pollutants, the California Air Resources Board
    (CARB) has established standards for the additional pollutants (or air
    quality conditions):
           Hydrogen sulfide
           Sulfates
           Vinyl chloride
           Visibility
    Regulated air pollutants in the South Coast Air District are classified into
    three categories: criteria air pollutants, toxic air contaminants (TAC), and
    global warming and ozone depleting gases.
    Criteria air pollutants include pollutants for which federal and state
    governments have established air quality standards for outdoor or ambient
    concentrations. Criteria air pollutants include carbon monoxide, nitrogen
    dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, lead, and volatile organic
    compounds.
    REGIONAL SETTING
    The City of Hawaiian Gardens is located in the southeast area of the County
    of Los Angeles, and within the South Coast Air Basin. The Basin is a 6,600
    square mile area bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the San
    Gabriel, San Bernardino, and San Jacinto Mountains to the north and east.
    Topography and climate are significant factors in the high pollution setting
    of the region. During the summer months, a warm air mass frequently
    descends over the cool, moist marine layer produced by the interaction
    between the ocean’s surface and the lowest layer of the atmosphere. The
    warm upper layer forms a cap over the cool marine layer and inhibits the
    pollutants in the marine layer from dispersing upward. In addition, light
    winds during the summer further limit ventilation. Sunlight triggers the
    photochemical reactions that produce ozone. The region experiences more
    days of sunlight than any other major urban area in the nation except
    Phoenix. Overall, the Basin is characterized by warm summers, mild
    winters, infrequent rainfall, moderate onshore daytime breezes, and
    moderate humidity.
    All seasons in the Basin generally exhibit onshore flows during the daytime
    and offshore flows at night, after the land cools below the temperature of
    the ocean. The likelihood of strong offshore flows, including Santa Ana
    winds, is greater during the winter than the summer.
204                                                                January 2010

                                                                              5 – Community Resources
The topography and climate of Southern California combine to produce
unhealthful air quality in the Basin. Low temperature inversion, light winds,
shallow vertical mixing, and extensive sunlight, in conjunction with
topographical features such as adjacent mountain ranges that hinder
dispersion of air pollutants, combine to create degraded air quality,
especially in the inland valleys of the Basin.
LOCAL CLIMATE
According to the City’s Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan, temperatures in
the City of Hawaiian Gardens range from 57 degrees in the winter season to
75 degrees in the summer months. Temperatures however can vary over a
wide range, particularly when the Santa Ana winds blow, which brings
high temperature and low humidity. Temperatures rarely exceed the upper
80s in the summer season, or the lower 40s during the winter.
Rainfall in the City of Hawaiian Gardens averages 14 inches per year. Actual
rainfall in Southern California typically falls in large amounts during
sporadic and heavy rainstorms, rather than consistently over storms in
regular intervals. Almost all rainfall the City experiences comes from the
fringes of mid-latitude storms from late November to early April, while
summers are typically completely dry.
Winds in the Hawaiian Gardens area blow primarily from southwest to
northeast by day and from northeast to southwest at night in response to
the regional pattern of onshore flow by day and offshore flow at night.
Average wind speeds are 5 mph, reaching 8 to 10 mph in the afternoon, but
dropping to near-calm conditions at night. In the late afternoon, the winds
from the southwest are replaced by a maritime air “push” from the South
Bay around the northern side of the Palos Verdes peninsula. Strongest
onshore flow across Hawaiian Gardens in the late afternoon is, therefore,
more from west-northwest.
EXISTING AIR QUALITY
Existing levels of ambient air quality are measured by the AQMD through
air quality monitoring stations, which monitor regional air pollutants such
as ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The air
quality monitoring station near Hawaiian Gardens is the North Long Beach
station. Based on data received for 2002-2005, conditions in Hawaiian
Gardens are summarized as follows:
        Photochemical smog (ozone) levels rarely exceed standards. The 1-
         hour state standard was violated once during the 2002-2005 time
         period. Federal standards have not been exceeded during this time
         period.
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan       205

                   Levels of primary automotive (unreacted) exhaust such as carbon
                    monoxide have not exceeded their clean air standards.
                   On average, PM10 (particulate matter) levels have exceeded the
                    state 24-hour standard less than eight percent of the measured
                    days per year. The federal PM10 standard, which is three times less
                    stringent than state standards, has not been exceeded during this
                    time period. Maximum PM10 levels do not demonstrate prevailing
                    trend and fluctuate from an average of 69 μg/m3.
                   PM2.5 federal 24-hour levels rarely exceed standards. 2005 had the
                    lowest maximum-24 hour concentration on record during this time
                    period.

FUTURE AIR QUALITY
Increases in air quality emissions from stationary and mobile sources are
projected with the buildout of the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan, based
on assumptions of population growth, regional growth, and changes in the
development pattern.
AIR QUALITY ISSUES
Land Use
Air pollution emissions are produced by both stationary and mobile
sources. Stationary sources are often major contributors of degraded air
quality, particularly intensive land uses and facilities and operations that
produce odor and dust. Mobile sources refer to emissions from vehicles.
Land uses can significantly contribute to the emission of, and also reduction
of, air pollution, and in turn, associated health risks. Land use planning
must take into careful consideration the overall patterns of land uses in the
community, maintaining a balance of industry and commercial to
economically support the City, while preserving a healthy housing stock,
adequate public facilities, and good quality of life.
The stationary sources of pollutant emissions in the City of Hawaiian
Gardens include small industrial and commercial land uses such as dry
cleaners, restaurants, welding shops, auto painting and detailing shops, gas
stations, a hospital, and other similar uses. Decision makers should
consider the implications of siting stationary sources of potential pollutant
emissions close to sensitive receptors; homes, schools, hospitals, etc. Also,
consideration should be given to the segregation of land uses because this
contributes to the need for additional vehicle trips and increased mobile
source emissions from vehicles.
Air quality impacts are analyzed relative to those persons who are
particularly susceptible to health effects due to air pollution exposure.
These persons are referred to as “sensitive receptors”. Sensitive population
groups include young children, the elderly, and the acutely and chronically
ill (especially those with cardio-respiratory diseases). Residential areas are
considered to be sensitive to air pollution exposure because they may be
occupied for extended periods, and residents may also be outdoors when
exposure is the highest. Schools are also considered sensitive receptors.
Transportation and Circulation
The City of Hawaiian Gardens is comparable to the Southern California
region in general, using the automobile as the primary source of
transportation, and in turn, degrading the air quality even further.
Achieving a balance between jobs and housing allows people to choose
alternative forms of transportation, such as walking or bicycling.
 City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan         207

    Furthermore, creating safe and attractive public spaces encourages
    pedestrian travel, rather than vehicular travel, which would be especially
    effective for local trips.
    AIR QUALITY GOALS AND POLICIES
    Goals and policies as part of the Air Quality Element will establish the
    policy framework for the City in improving local air quality conditions and
    collaborating with neighboring jurisdictions and local public agencies to
    address the issue.
    Goal AQ-1:        Employ land use and circulation patterns that help
                      reduce harmful emissions.
    Policies:
        AQ-1.1        Maintain a strong economic foundation of local serving
                      businesses that are easily accessible to residents in order to
                      reduce travel distances.
        AQ-1.2        Collaborate with local and regional jurisdictions to
                      examine the feasibility of providing an interconnected
                      network of trails and linkages for bicycle and pedestrian
                      use.
        AQ-1.3        Consider limiting direct automobile access for special
                      events, in situations where alternative modes of access exist
                      and can be provided.
        AQ-1.4        Participate in cooperative programs and comply with the
                      Congestion Management Program (CMP) to maintain and
                      improve mobility.
        AQ-1.5        Encourage higher intensity development near activity

Safety Element
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the Safety Element is to identify the natural and man-made
hazards that can potentially affect public safety throughout the City. The
Safety Element helps the City to understand the risk of these hazards, and
establishes goals and policies to address these risks, in an effort to minimize
damage to life, property, and resources within the community. Hazards can
include floods, fires, earthquakes, landslides, and other hazards.
The Safety Element also addresses public safety within the community.
Public safety is a vital and integral part of a community’s quality of life.
During the General Plan Update process, community stakeholders and
members of the General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC) devised a
guiding principle for the community regarding public safety. The
community’s goal is to promote safe, walkable commercial districts and
residential neighborhoods for all residents and visitors. The City of
Hawaiian Gardens will continue to prioritize public safety in the
community through the provision of law enforcement and emergency
response services, and planning for, and minimizing risk of natural and
man-made hazards. Goals and policies included as part of the Safety
Element address these City priorities, which focus on maintaining a safe
community and improving the quality of life for residents.

    RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
    The Safety Element of the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan is related to all
    other elements in maintaining the health, safety, and welfare of residents in
    land use decisions. The Safety Element must be consistent with all other
    elements of the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan. The Safety Element
    particularly relates to the Land Use, Circulation, Air Quality, and Noise
    Elements.
    The Land Use Element contains a Land Use Plan that must be consistent
    with the goals, policies, and programs in the Safety Element. Specific
    hazards and risks identified in a local community determine the land use
    pattern. The Circulation Element maintains a functioning circulation
    system within the community, which is necessary for maintaining
    functioning and accessible emergency evacuation routes. Like the Safety
    Element, the Air Quality and Noise Element uphold the public safety of the
    community.
    LOCAL DISASTER PLANNING
    The City maintains the Hazards Mitigation Plan and the Emergency
    Operations Plan for preparation and procedures in the event of a disaster.
    Both plans have recently been updated.
    Hawaiian Gardens Hazards Mitigation Plan
    The Hawaiian Gardens Hazards Mitigation Plan was adopted in August,
    2004. The plan includes resources and information to assist City residents,
    public and private sector organizations, and others interested in
    participating in planning for natural hazards. The plan provides actions that
    may assist the City of Hawaiian Gardens in reducing risk and preventing
    loss from future natural hazard events. The action items address natural
    hazards, including earthquakes, flooding, and windstorms. The plan was a
    result of collaboration between the cities of Hawaiian Gardens, Artesia,
    Norwalk, Bellflower, Cerritos, citizens, public agencies, private sector
    participants, and regional and State organizations.
    Hawaiian Gardens Emergency Operations Plan
    The Hawaiian Gardens Emergency Operations Plan was adopted in March,
    2003. The plan provides a strategy for the City’s planned response to
    extraordinary emergency situations associated with natural disasters,
    technological incidents, and national security emergencies. The focus of the
    plan is on operations to address potential large-scale disasters, which can
    generate unique situations requiring unusual emergency response. The goals
    of the Emergency Operations Plan are to provide effective life safety
    measures and reduce property loss, provide for the rapid resumption of
214                                                               January 2010

                                                                                  6 – Public Safety
impacted businesses and community services, and provide accurate
documentation and records required for cost recovery efforts.
The City has adopted the Standardized Emergency Management System
(SEMS) for managing response to multi-agency and multi-jurisdiction
emergencies and to facilitate communications and coordination between all
levels of the system and among all responding agencies. Title 19 of the
California Code of Regulations establishes the standard response structure
and basic protocols to be used in emergency response and recovery. Fully
activated, the SEMS consists of five levels: field response, local government,
operational areas (countywide), OES Mutual Aid Regions, and state
government.
Public Safety Commission
The Hawaiian Gardens Public Safety Commission consists of five members,
appointed by the City Council. The responsibility of the commission
consists of making recommendations regarding matters related to the
design of anti-gang/drug/crime programs, and the coordination of activities
of law enforcement, schools, community-based organizations, churches,
business, and private citizens that would mobilize the community in the
prevention of crime.
In addition, the City is also collaborating with the Los Angeles County
Sheriff Department to provide a future Public Safety Center within
Hawaiian Gardens. The Public Safety Center will be located at the future
public library site. The center will serve as a localized Sheriff sub-station, as
well as a center for public information on crime prevention.
In the event of a disaster from natural or man-made hazards, the City has
devised an evacuation route plan for safe and efficient evacuation of the
City. The evacuation route plan utilizes the major circulation corridors in
the City, including Carson Street, Norwalk Boulevard, Pioneer Boulevard,
and Bloomfield Avenue (Exhibit 6-1).

EMERGENCY SERVICES
Fire Services
Fire protection services throughout the City of Hawaiian Gardens are
provided by the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Fire response is
dispatched out of Fire Station No. 34, located at 21207 South Norwalk
Boulevard. Current response times in the City average approximately three
to four minutes for all emergencies. Service levels are considered adequate.
The station is equipped with one fire truck and three personnel, including a
fire captain, engineer, and firefighter.
The Los Angeles County Fire Department provides service to over 58 cities
and unincorporated areas throughout the County. Services also include
programs and outreach efforts, including public education, fire prevention,
and safety tips, and building plan check for development review projects.
Youth programs include the Fire Explorers, a joint venture with the Boy
Scouts of America. The program is designed for young adults between the
ages of 15 and 21 who are interested in learning about careers in fire
protection services. The program’s goal is to provide the young adult with a
sense of responsibility to their neighborhood through on-going community
related activities.
Police Services
Police protection services for Hawaiian Gardens are contracted from the
Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Law enforcement officers from
the Sheriff’s Lakewood Station serve the community, located at 5130 North
Clark Avenue in the City of Lakewood. The station is currently being
expanded and modernized to provide additional capacity for office space
and short-term onsite detention facilities. The station also provides services
for the nearby communities of Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Lakewood and
Paramount. Law enforcement services in Hawaiian gardens include traffic
enforcement, crime investigation, and Special Assignment Officers. Law
enforcement officers respond to the scene of a crime or accident, interview
suspects or witnesses of incidents, write crime reports, respond to radio
calls, monitor suspicious activity, arrest criminals and collect evidence, and
respond to questions or complaints from citizens.
The Special Assignment Officers (S.A.O.) team is a group of highly trained
personnel that handle various public safety and quality of life issues for
Hawaiian Gardens. Operations include probation searches, parole searches,
search warrants, Section 8 compliance checks, and DUI checkpoints. S.A.O.
team members also actively participate in local functions and events.
Other community programs offered by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s
Department through the Lakewood Station are the Sheriff Reserve Program,
Crime Prevention Program, Volunteer Program, and Explorer Program.
City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                        219

    Sheriff Reserve Program
    The volunteer Deputy Sheriffs of Lakewood Station Reserve Company 13
    have been have been proudly serving the cities of Lakewood, Bellflower,
    Paramount, Artesia and Hawaiian Gardens since 1958. Reserve Deputies are
    professionally trained free of charge and duly sworn peace officers. In most
    cases, Reserves are assigned to the same duties as full-time Deputies. Since
    Reserve Deputies have the same powers of arrest as full-time Deputies, they
    are required by law to meet the same hiring, background, medical and
    psychological standards as full time Deputies.
    Lakewood Station’s reserve company is part of the Sheriff’s uniform reserve
    force. Uniformed Reserves perform general law enforcement duties,
    including responding to calls, traffic control and collision investigation,
    crime investigation, crime prevention, disaster response and participation
    in local and county-wide civic events.
    Volunteer Program
    The Volunteers on Patrol have various non-hazardous duties including, but
    not limited to: patrolling the community for criminal activity or safety
    hazards, residential vacation checks, business safety checks, assisting
    disabled persons, park and school safety checks, graffiti watch, handling
    requests from City/County Services, searching for missing children, and
    traffic control.
    Explorer Program
    Lakewood Station’s explorer program is a personal development, career
    exploration and community service program tailored for young adults
    between 15-21 years of age. The program’s purpose is to provide experiences
    to help young adults mature and prepare them to become responsible and
    caring adults and explore a career in law enforcement. Explorers learn
    about a law enforcement career by assisting the station and its Deputy
    Sheriffs with non-hazardous duties such as staffing the station lobby,
    writing reports, completing administrative tasks, conducting public
    fingerprinting, "Operation Kid Print" fingerprinting, performing traffic
    control and crowd assistance tasks at parades and civic events, and
    assisting with neighborhood crime notifications, search missions and
    related field operations .
    Based on crime and arrest statistics from the Lakewood Station, the number
    of crime incidents appears to have decreased from 2005 to 2006 for the
    entire service area. The service area is made up of the cities of Artesia,
    Bellflower, Hawaiian Gardens, Lakewood, and Paramount.
    In 2005, the total amount of reported crime incidents was 35,504, and in
    2006, the total amount of reported crime incidents was 32, 165. This
    represents a decrease of 3,339 incidents, or a nine percent reduction.
    Incidents include part I crimes, part II crimes, and noncriminal crimes. The
220                                                               January 2010

highest amount of crimes reported were larceny theft, followed by grand
theft auto.
Of the station service areas, Hawaiian Gardens nearly has the highest crime
rate, with only the City of Paramount higher. However, crime appears to
have decreased substantially in Hawaiian Gardens, with a crime rate (per
10,000 persons) of 404.76 in 2005, down to a crime rate of 329.24 in 2006

EXISTING CONDITIONS
Historic Seismic Background
The City of Hawaiian Gardens is located in the southeastern part of Los
Angeles County, and is an urbanized community situated on the Los
Angeles Coastal Plain. Abundant evidence of seismic activity in California is
found in 200 years of records since a strong earthquake near the Santa Ana
River in Orange County was reported in 1769. Of the thousands of
earthquakes felt in California that have occurred during the last 200 years,
three were great earthquakes over 7.75 Richter Magnitude; 13 were major
earthquakes with Magnitude 7.0 to 7.7, such as Loma Prieta-San Francisco
(1989), Arvin-Tehachapi (1952), and El Centro (1940). Over 60 were
moderate shocks, of Magnitude 6.0 to 6.9, such as Santa Barbara (1925),
Long Beach (1933), San Fernando (1971), and Whittier Narrows (1988).
About 200 earthquakes of Magnitude 4.0 to 5.9 occur within California
every 10 years.
The State of California has an area of approximately 156,000 square miles.
The Landers/Big Bear (1992), Magnitude 7.5/6.6 earthquake was felt over
60,000 square miles. Loma Prieta-San Francisco (1989), Magnitude 7.1
earthquake was felt over 54,000 square miles, the Arvin-Tehachapi (1952),
Magnitude 7.7 earthquake was felt over 160,000 square miles, and the San
Francisco (1906), Magnitude 8.3 earthquake was felt over 375,000 square

    miles. From historical seismic activity in the state, it can be concluded that
    no part of California is immune from earthquake damage.
    Geology
    Topographically, Hawaiian Gardens is located on the south-sloping Los
    Angeles Coastal Plain and is along the eastern bank of the San Gabriel
    River.
    The Los Angeles Coastal Basin is described as an alleviated lowland,
    sometimes called the coastal plain which is bound on the north by the Santa
    Monica Mountains and the Elysian, Repetto, and Puente Hills, and on the
    east and southeast by the Santa Ana Mountains and the San Joaquin Hills.
    The Lowland surface slopes gently south or seaward but it is interrupted by
    the Coyote Hills near the northeast margin by a line of elongated low hills
    and mesas to the south and west that extends from Newport Bay northwest
    to Beverly Hills, and by the Palos Verdes Peninsula at the southwest
    extremity.
    The physiographic basin is underlain by a structural depression, parts of
    which have been the sites of discontinuous deposition since Late
    Cretaceous time and of continuous subsidence and marine deposition since
    Middle Miocene time.
    Soils
    Hawaiian Gardens is covered by a blanket of medium-grained and fine-
    grained sediments. The soil varies in thickness from approximately 0 to 164
    feet, and consists of sand, silt, and clay silts which are poorly compacted.
    Medium-Grained Holocene Alluvium
    Most of the City of Hawaiian Gardens consists of this soil type. It is
    characterized as moderately well-drained, moderately sorted to well-sorted
    sand and silty sand forming alluvial plans and natural levees along streams.
    Locally it contains thin beds of well-sorted clay, silt, gravel, and occasional
    cobbles and boulders. It contains freshwater pelecypod and gastropod
    shells. It is intermediate in character and laterally extends between fine-
    and coarse-grained alluvium with which it interfingers. Generally, it
    overlies late Pleistocene alluvium and is less than 164 feet thick in this area.
    Fine-Grained Holocene Alluvium
    The central and central-southern portions of Hawaiian Gardens are of this
    type of soil. It is characterized as poorly sorted, plastic, locally
    carbonaceous sandy silt, silt, silty clay, and clay in poorly drained flood
    areas, on distal parts of alluvial fans, and in localized depressions. It
    contains occasional lenses and small channels of well-sorted sand and fine
    gravel. It contains fossils of living vertebrate species and may contain

                                                                                6 – Public Safety
freshwater pelecypod and gastropod shells. It interfingers with and grades
both laterally and upstream into medium-grained alluvium and overlies late
Pleistocene alluvium and bedrock. It is up to 164 feet thick in coastal basins.
NATURAL HAZARDS
Natural hazards in Hawaiian Gardens can include seismic hazards, and
ensuing risks associated with earthquake activity, and floods. Additional
man-made hazards can include fire, and toxic and hazardous materials.
Seismic Hazards
Seismic hazards are earthquake–related hazards that include ground
shaking, landslides, liquefaction, and surface rupture. Southern California
has an extensive history of earthquake incidents, and there are several faults
located in the region. The most recent earthquake events in Southern
California include the 1992 Northridge Earthquake, the 1994 Landers
Earthquake, the 1989 Newport Beach Earthquake, and the 1987 Whittier
Narrows Earthquake.
Hawaiian Gardens is located near the Norwalk Fault, four miles to the
northeast, and the Newport-Inglewood Fault, five miles to the southwest.
The Los Alamitos Fault is also located approximately two miles from the
City. There are no known active earthquake faults within the City.
Active Faults
A fault is a fracture along or between blocks of the earth’s crust where
either side moves relative to the other along a parallel plane to the fracture.
Active faults are considered faults that have moved in recent geologic time
and that are likely to move again in the relative near future.
Newport-Inglewood Fault
The Newport-Inglewood fault zone is a series of echelon northwest-
trending discontinuous faults indicating a through-going right-lateral
strike-slip fault at depth. The Newport-Inglewood fault zone is a nearly
vertical, right-lateral fault extending from the southern edge of the Santa
Monica Mountains southeast to the offshore area of Newport Beach. There
has been no observed ground surface displacement associated with the fault
zone. The fault zone could produce a 7.0 (or greater) magnitude earthquake
within the next 50-100 years.
Norwalk Fault
The Norwalk Fault, located approximately four miles to the northeast of
Hawaiian Gardens, strikes to the northwest and dips steeply to the
northeast. The fault may have in the past caused an earthquake event of 4.7
magnitude. The Norwalk Fault is approximately 16 miles long.
City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                         223

    Microseismic activity along the fault zone is high, and may be capable of
    generating a 6.3 magnitude earthquake.
    San Andreas Fault
    The City of Hawaiian Gardens is approximately 43 miles south of the San
    Andreas Fault zone. The San Andreas Fault extends over 600 miles from the
    Gulf of California, north toward the Cape Mendocino area, where it
    continues north along the ocean floor. The fault plain is essential vertical
    and has a right lateral strike-slip sense of movement. The fault is divided
    into segments and the southern segment is approximately 300 miles in
    length.
    Ground Shaking
    Ground shaking is the motion felt on the earth’s surface caused by seismic
    waves generated by an earthquake. Ground shaking is the primary cause of
    earthquake damage, and its strength depends on the magnitude of the
    earthquake, the type of fault, and distance from the epicenter (where the
    earthquake originates). Structures on poorly consolidated and thick soils
    will likely experience more damage than structures on consolidated soils
    and bedrock.

Liquefaction
Liquefaction-induced ground failure historically has been a major cause of
earthquake damage in southern California. During the 1971 San Fernando
and 1994 Northridge earthquakes, significant damage to roads, utility
pipelines, buildings, and other structures in the Los Angeles area was
caused by liquefaction-induced ground displacement. Localities most
susceptible to liquefaction-induced damage are underlain by loose, water-
saturated, granular sediment within 40 feet of the ground surface. These
geological and ground-water conditions exist in parts of Southern
California, most notably in some densely populated valley regions and
alluviated floodplains. In addition, the potential for strong earthquake
ground shaking is high because of the many nearby active faults. The
combination of these factors constitutes a significant seismic hazard in the
Southern California region in general.
Liquefaction is a resulting effect that occurs when ground shaking causes
loose, wet granular soils to change from a solid state to a liquid state. This
results in the loss of soil strength and the soil’s ability to support weight.
Buildings and their occupants are at risk when the ground can no longer
support the weight, causing instability or failure. Standard mitigation of
liquefaction would be to require engineering studies with new development
that uncovers the degree of liquefaction. Removal and re-compaction of
liquefaction soils would then be necessary.
According to the City’s Hazards Mitigation Plan, the soils in Hawaiian
Gardens consist primarily of medium and fine grained Holocene Alluvium.
The medium-grained Holocene Alluvium is comprised of sand and silty
sand, and contains well-sorted clay, silt, and gravel. The fine-grained
Holocene Alluvium consists of poorly sorted, plastic, locally carbonaceous
sandy silt, silt, silty clay, and clay. The soil varies from 0 to 164 feet in
thickness and is poorly compacted.
The entire City is located in a liquefaction zone, according to the California
Geological Survey (Exhibit 6-3). The liquefaction zone in fact, covers almost
the entire region located in the Los Alamitos Quadrangle because of the
shallow ground-water table and nearly universal distribution of young
sandy alluvial deposits. Local wells have water 20 to 71 feet below the
ground surface.
Landslides
Mass movements of loose rock, soil, and water-saturated and weathered
materials are major effects of earthquakes. Steep slopes commonly favor
gravitational movements, and landslides sometimes occur. No earthquake-
induced landslide zone, however, has been designated in the area. In
addition, the City of Hawaiian Gardens has relatively flat topography.

    Seiches
    Seiches, or periodic oscillations (“sloshing”) of bodies of water such as
    ponds, lakes, and bays, usually occur in moderate to great earthquakes.
    Seiches may raise and lower a water surface from a few inches to several
    feet, and may occur several thousand miles away from the earthquake
    epicenter. Seiches will not affect the City of Hawaiian Gardens due to its
    inland location and because no significant bodies of water exist within city
    limits.
    Flood Hazards
    Flooding occurs when climate, geology, and hydrology combine to create
    conditions where water flows outside its natural course. The nearest major
    waterways to Hawaiian Gardens are the San Gabriel River, located one mile
    to the west, and the Coyote Creek, traversing the City’s eastern boundary.
    The San Gabriel River is a concrete-lined channel, designed to contain a
    100-year flood event. Hawaiian Gardens is located outside the 500-year
    floodplain, which indicates that the City has less than a 0.9 percent
    probability of flooding annually (Exhibit 6-4).
    The National Flood Insurance Program identifies Hawaiian Gardens as a
    Zone B area, which means the City has minimal flood risk. Specific areas
    within the City have been identified to be at special risk when water flows
    outside its usual course:
            Wardham and 226th Street;
            Brittain and 224th Street;
            223rd Street;
            222nd Street; and
            221st Street.
    Urban Flooding
    Portions of Hawaiian Gardens are prone to urban flooding, also referred to
    as ponding. This is primarily due to debris accumulation on storm drains
    and in flood control channels and basins, over-burdened pumping stations,
    and aged drainage systems. Low-lying areas of the City are particularly
    susceptible to urban flooding. The City is below the water line and surfaced
    on sandy soil.

Dam Inundation
Dam inundation occurs when structural damage to a dam causes a flood.
Damages resulting from dam inundation can result in loss of life, damages to
infrastructure and structures. There are no dams located in Hawaiian
Gardens; however, the Prado Dam and the Whittier Narrows Dam can
potential affect the City in the event of dam failure.
Whittier Narrows Dam
Whittier Narrows Dam is an earth-filled flood control and water
conservation dam constructed and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. Construction of the dam was completed in 1957. It is located in
the City of Montebello, approximately 14 miles from the City of Hawaiian
Gardens.
In the event of dam failure, the water released from the Whittier Narrows
Dam would flow in a southerly direction toward the City of Long Beach.
The entire City of Hawaiian Gardens lies within the dam’s
floodplain/inundation path. Hawaiian Gardens is located approximately 14
downstream of the Whittier Narrows Dam. Dam failure would cause the
flood wave to reach Hawaiian Gardens approximately 21.5 hours later at a
depth of two feet, according to the Hawaiian Gardens Emergency
Operations Plan.
Prado Dam
Prado Dam is an earth-filled flood control and water conservation project
constructed and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Construction of the dam was completed in 1941. It is located on the Santa
Ana River approximately 30.5 miles upstream of the Pacific Ocean, in
Riverside County. Prado Dam provides flood control and water
conservation storage for Orange County, California. The dam is normally
empty except during or immediately after periods of significant runoff. The
dam is the downstream element of the Santa Ana River flood control
system.
The purpose of the dam is to collect runoff from the uncontrolled drainage
areas upstream along with releases from other storage facilities. The City of
Hawaiian Gardens is located approximately 27 miles downstream of the
dam.
The City of Hawaiian Gardens, excluding areas in the northwest section of
the City, lies within the dam’s inundation path (Exhibit 6-5). In the event of
dam failure, flooding would reach Hawaiian Gardens in approximately 1.5
hours, and reach three to four feet depth. Water would flow south along the
Santa Ana River inundating most of Orange County. Inundation would
affect the southeast section of Hawaiian Gardens first.

    Windstorm Hazards
    Severe windstorms can potentially cause damage to structures, trees, and
    public facilities, such as signs and utilities. Flying debris also poses a threat
    to public safety in severe conditions.
    According to the Hawaiian Gardens Hazards Mitigation Plan, most high
    wind incidents that occur in the City are the result of Santa Ana winds.
    Santa Ana winds are warm, dry winds that blow from the east or northeast
    (offshore). These winds occur below the passes and canyons of the coastal
    ranges of Southern California and the Los Angeles basin.
    MAN-MADE HAZARDS
    Toxic and Hazardous Materials
    Hazardous materials are substances that may be hazardous to humans,
    animals, or plants, and may include pesticides, herbicides, toxic metals and
    chemicals, volatile chemicals, explosives, and nuclear fuels or low-level
    radioactive wastes.
    Several local businesses generate, use, or handle hazardous materials; most
    of those uses in Hawaiian Gardens consist of auto repair shops, tire stores,
    dry cleaners, medical, schools, and other similar uses. Table 6-2, from the
    EPA Envirofacts website, includes facilities and uses located in the City
    that handle hazardous materials.

Terrorism
Terrorism is the use of fear for intimidation, usually for political goals.
Terrorism is a crime where the threat of violence is often as effective as the
commission of the violent act itself. Terrorism affects us through fear,
physical injuries, economic losses, psychological trauma, and erosion of
faith in government. It is a strategy used by individuals or groups to achieve
their political goals.
Terrorists represent an assortment of causes, increasing the wide variety of
potential targets. These areas may include public places, government offices,
religious facilities, or other financial institutions or businesses. The City
should maintain active and up-to-date emergency operations plans in
preparation for the possibility of a terrorist threat.
City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                        237

    SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
    Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
    The basis of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) is
    that proper design and effective use of the built environment can reduce the
    incidence and fear of crime. Instead of traditional approaches of securing
    personal property with locks, barriers, and bolts, CPTED promotes the
    integration of design into spatial environments in order to enhance and
    proclaim the integrity of a space, and prevent crime. Defensible spaces
    contribute to the comfort and quality of life for residents in a community.
    The four principles of CPTED are natural surveillance, natural access
    control, territorial reinforcement, and maintenance and management.
    CPTED principles can be applied in capital improvement projects, public
    space projects, and even private development.
           Natural surveillance
            Natural surveillance is the concept of keeping eyes on the street.
            Naturally, criminals do not wish to be observed; therefore,
            maintaining direct observation points on public spaces reduces the
            chance for crime. The primary aim of natural surveillance is not to
            keep intruders out of a space but rather, to keep intruders under
            observation.
           Natural Access Control
            Natural access control relies on physical elements—such as doors,
            shrubbery, and fences—to keep illegitimate persons out of a place.
            For natural access control of public spaces, properly located
            entrances, exits, fencing, landscaping and lighting can direct visitor
            traffic in ways that can decrease opportunity for criminal activity.
            Psychological barriers can act as natural access control as well.
            These barriers are not direct physical obstructions but rather,
            design elements that identify a public place as unique and special.
            This can include paving textures, landscaping, signage, and other
            streetscape design treatments that contribute to the distinctiveness
            of a place.
           Territorial Reinforcement
            Territorial reinforcement expresses ownership. Generally, people
            have a natural tendency to protect what they consider is their
            territory. Clear boundaries between public and private areas
            achieved by using physical elements such as fences, pavement
            treatments, art, signage, good maintenance and landscaping are
            ways to express ownership. This also makes it much easier to
            identify intruders.
238                                                                January 2010

                                                                              6 – Public Safety
       Maintenance and Management
        Maintenance and management is related to community image and
        sense of pride of a place. The maintenance and image of a place can
        contribute to its susceptibility to crime; generally, dilapidated and
        rundown areas are more prone to attracting unwanted activity.
        Maintenance and management is also based on the premise that a
        sense of security can be developed and reinforced by upholding the
        community’s image. The image is not only portrayed throughout the
        community, but projected outside the community as well.
Design considerations using CPTED principles can be translated using the
following strategies:
       Allow for clear sight lines,
       Provide lighting,
       Minimize concealed and isolated routes,
       Avoid entrapment,
       Reduce isolation,
       Promote land use mix,
       Use of activity generators,
       Create a sense of ownership through maintenance and
        management,
       Provide signs and information clearly, and
       Improve overall design of the built environment.
Goals and policies as part of the Safety Element support the principles of
CPTED for planning and design of public spaces in Hawaiian Gardens.
City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                       239

    SAFETY ISSUES
    Public safety issues have been uncovered based on existing conditions and
    community input. Goals and policies to guide public safety in the Hawaiian
    Gardens General Plan will be based on current issues.
           The current fire station facility, located on the northern edge of the
            City, is aging, small, and in need of repair. Expansion or relocation
            should be considered for the facility. Potential solutions that have
            been discussed at community forums include expansion over the
            adjacent Artesia Norwalk Storm Drain or relocation to another
            parcel in proximity to the current location. It will be necessary to
            consider maintaining adequate emergency response times in the
            consideration of relocation. The City should work with the Los
            Angeles County Fire Department to identify potential solutions to
            address the issue.
           Land use planning and effective site design can contribute to crime
            prevention. Design considerations such as Crime Prevention
            Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles are encouraged
            in order to develop safe and accessible public spaces. There are
            areas within Hawaiian Gardens that have been identified as danger
            or crime “hot spots”, due to factors such as inadequate lighting,
            poor sight lines, and isolation. The City should incorporate CPTED
            principles in the design of public spaces.
           Several residents acknowledge an influx of gang-related crime
            activity. There are currently citizen-led community organizations
            that are active within the City, such as the Neighborhood Watch
            Program. The City should maintain ongoing communication with
            these groups, in crime prevention activities.
            Failure of the Whittier Narrows or Prado dams would result in all
            or partial inundation of Hawaiian Gardens.
           The Los Angeles region contains the potential for seismic activities,
            which could result in potential earthquake damage, and other
            damages related to seismic events, including liquefaction and
            ground shaking.
    GUIDING PRINCIPLES
    In order to support the vision of the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan related
    to public safety, the community is committed to promote safe, walkable
    neighborhoods for all residents and visitors to benefit from.

Noise Element
INTRODUCTION
The General Plan Noise Element will identify significant sources of noise in
Hawaiian Gardens, and ways to minimize exposure and protect residents
and visitors from unhealthy or obtrusive noise levels. The element is a
statement of the City’s policies and programs regarding the relationship of
land use to environmental noise and the control of noise sources within the
community. The Noise Element provides a framework within which noise
control policies and mitigation decisions are made and implemented. It is
also intended to provide procedural guidelines and criteria for City staff, to
be used in minimizing noise conflicts in the existing setting and in new
development.
California Government Code Section 65302(f) identifies the types of
community noise to be addressed in the General Plan. The Noise Element
must identify noise sources from:
        Highways and Freeways;
        Major arterial and local streets;
        Local industrial plants; and
        Other stationary ground noise sources identified by local agencies
         as contributing to the community noise environment.
In addition, the Noise Element must recognize the guidelines established by
the Office of Noise Control in the California Department of Health Services.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Noise Element is directly related to the Land Use, Circulation, and
Housing Elements in the General Plan. Although the Noise Element must be
consistent with every element in the plan, the Noise Element must influence
decisions of land use that minimizes exposure of residents and other
City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                        243

    sensitive receptors to excessive noise. In Hawaiian Gardens, ambient noise
    is primarily influenced by the street network, including the major arterial
    roads in the community, Carson Street and Norwalk Boulevard and the 605
    Freeway. Noise exposure should thus be an important consideration in
    mitigation from existing facilities in relation to existing and planned land
    uses.
    The Land Use Element must take into consideration existing and future
    noise conditions in the community in order to ensure that incompatible
    land uses are located sufficiently away from one another. The element
    should also analyze the effects of noise on current land uses. The existing
    and forecast noise contours are used as a guide for establishing land use
    patterns that minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive
    noise.
    The Noise Element is related to the Housing Element to ensure that the
    community’s housing stock meets noise standards. This may influence the
    location and cost of housing.
    FUNDAMENTALS OF NOISE AND SOUND
    Sound is technically described in terms of loudness (amplitude), frequency
    (pitch), and time pattern. The standard unit of sound amplitude is the
    decibel (dB). Decibels are based on a logarithmic scale that describes sound
    pressure levels. The pitch of sound is related to the frequency of the
    pressure vibration. The human ear is not equally sensitive to sound at all
    frequencies; therefore, a special frequency-dependent rating scale has been
    devised to relate noise to human sensitivity. The A-weighted decibel (dBA)
    provides this compensation by discriminating against frequencies in a
    manner approximating the sensitivity of the human ear.
    The temporal nature of sound may be described in terms of its pattern of
    time and level: continuity, fluctuation, impulsiveness, intermittency.
    Noise is typically described as unwanted, excessive, and bothersome sound.
    There are several different methods to measure sound in a given period of
    time. These noise measurement methods include the Community Noise
    Equivalency Level (CNEL), the Equivalent Sound Level (Leq), and the
    Day/Night Average Sound Level (Ldn).
    Noise Measurement and Assessment
    Community Noise Equivalency Level (CNEL)
    CNEL is a noise rating scale for land use compatibility assessment. CNEL is
    a 24-hour, time-weighted annual average noise level. The CNEL reading
    represents the average of 24 hourly readings of equivalent levels (known as
    Leq) based on an A-weighted decibel. Additionally, community noise
    receptors are more sensitive to unwanted noise intrusion during the evening
244                                                                 January 2010

                                                                                   6 – Public Safety
and at night, thus, State law requires that, for planning purposes, an
artificial dB increment be added to quiet noise levels in a 24-hour noise
descriptor. Adjustments are +5 dBA for the evening, 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.,
and +10 dBA for the night, 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
Equivalent Sound Level (Leq)
Leq is the sound level corresponding to a steady-state sound level
containing the same total energy as a time-varying signal over a given
sample period. Leq is the energy average noise level during the time period
for sample. Leq can be measured for any time period, but it is typically
measured for one hour, 8 hour, and 24-hour sample periods. It is the energy
sum of all the events that occur for that time period. Leq is the basis for the
descriptors used in current standards, such as the CNEL.
Day/Night Average Sound Level (Ldn)
Ldn is a measure of the A-weighted average noise level for a given area
during a 24-hour period with a 10 dB weighting applied to night-time sound
levels, 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. The Ldn is approximately numerically equal to
the CNEL for most environmental settings. CNEL and Ldn represent daily
levels of noise exposure averaged on an annual or daily basis, while Leq
represents the equivalent energy noise exposure for a shorter time period.
SOUND PROPAGATION
Noise sources may either be a line source (e.g. a heavily traveled highway)
or a point source (e.g. a stationary engine or compressor). Highway traffic
noise on high volume roadways simulates a line source. For roadway noise,
typically for every doubling of distance from the source, the noise level is
reduced by about 3 dBA at acoustically hard locations, or areas between a
noise source and receptor that include mostly concrete, asphalt, or other
hard material.
Environmental factors, such as wind direction and speed, temperature
gradients, the characteristics of the ground (hard or soft) and the air
(relative humidity), and the presence of grass, shrubbery, and trees, often
combine to increase actual attenuation to 4.5 decibels per doubling of
distance. Thus, a noise level of 74.5 decibels at 50 feet from a highway
centerline would attenuate to 70.0 decibels at 100 feet, 65.5 decibels at 200
feet, and so forth. In an area that is relatively flat and free from barriers, the
sound resulting from a point source of noise spreads is a spherical manner
away from the source and drops by 6 decibels for each doubling of distance.
This applies to stationary noise sources and mobile sources that are
temporarily stationary, such as an idling truck or other heavy equipment
operating within a confined area (such as industrial processes). Sound
attenuation from a train resembles a line source near the railroad tracks and
a point source at distances beyond three-tenths of the train length.
City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                            245

    Increasing vehicle speed from 35 mph to 45 mph raises adjacent noise levels
    approximately 2.5 decibels. Reducing vehicle speed from 35 mph to 30 mph
    decreases adjacent noise levels by 1.5 decibels on major roadways, and 1.6
    decibels on secondary and collector roadways. Noise levels adjacent to
    roadways vary with the volume of traffic, mean vehicle speed, truck mix,
    and the road cross-section.
    Noise and Health Effects
    Noise can cause temporary physical and psychological responses in humans.
    Temporary physical reactions to passing noises range from a startle reflex to
    constriction in peripheral blood vessels, the secretion of saliva and gastric
    juices, and change in heart rate, breathing patterns, the dilation of pupils of
    the eye, visual acuity, and equilibrium. The chronic recurrence of theses
    physical reactions has been shown to aggravate headaches, fatigue, digestive
    disorders, heart disease, and circulatory and equilibrium disorders.
    Moreover, as a source of stress, noise is a casual factor is stress-related
    ailments such as ulcers, high blood pressure, and anxiety.
    Three harmful effects of noise are speech interference, the interruption of
    sleep, and hearing loss. Speech interference begins to occur at 40 to 45
    decibels and becomes severe at 60 decibels. Background noise levels affect
    performance and the learning process through distraction, reduced
    accuracy, increased fatigue, annoyance and irritability, and the inability to
    concentrate.
    Several factors determine whether or not a particular noise event will
    interfere with, or prevent, sleep. These factors include the noise level and
    characteristics, the stage of sleep, the individual’s age, and motivation to
    waken. Ill or elderly people are particularly susceptible to noise-induced
    sleep interference, which can occur when intruding noise levels exceed the
    typical 35-45 decibel background noise level in a bedroom. Sleep prevention
    can occur when intruding noise levels exceed 50 decibels.
    Hearing loss, which may begin to occur at 75 decibels, is one of the most
    harmful effects of noise on people. In many cases, exposure to very loud,
    impulsive, or sustained noise causes damage to the inner ear.
    REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
    Federal Noise Standards
    The Federal Noise Control Act of 1972 establishes a national policy to
    promote an environment for all Americans free from noise that jeopardizes
    their health and welfare. As part of the requirements of the Act, the
    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was charged with overseeing
    noise-abatement activities and coordinating its programs with those of
    other federal agencies that play an important role in noise control. The
    Noise Control Act was amended by the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 to
246                                                                 January 2010

promote the development of effective state and local noise control
programs, to provide funds for noise research, and to produce and
disseminate educational materials to the public on the harmful effects of
noise and ways to effectively control it. The Noise Control Act and the
Quiet Communities Act have not been rescinded, however, the EPA has
discontinued funding for the implementation of the Acts, in a shift of noise
control responsibility to state and local programs. As of 2002, agencies such
as the Department of Transportation, Department of Labor, and Federal
Railroad Administration have developed their own noise control programs,
with each agency setting its own criteria.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development applies noise
standards in its analysis of the acceptability of sites for federally supported
housing development. Three site classifications are defined based on the
Ldn level to which the sites are subjected (Table6-3).

                                                      Sound attenuation: to achieve 5 to 10 dB more
                                                      attenuation than standard construction.
Unacceptable              Above Ldn 75 dBA            Environmental clearance required.
                                                      Sound attenuation requires approval of Assistant
                                                      Secretary.
The current Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) procedures for
highway traffic noise analysis and abatement are included in the Code of
Federal Regulations (23 CFR Part 772). Traffic noise prediction must
comply with the methodology in the FHWA Traffic Noise Prediction Model
(TNM).
State Noise Standards
The California Department of Health Services (DHS) provides criteria and
guidelines for local governments to use when setting standards to control
and abate environmental noise.
Noise Insulation Standards, Title 25 of the California Code of Regulations
sets forth requirements for all new hotels, motels, apartment buildings, and
dwellings, except for single-family dwellings. These regulations require that
residential buildings (multi-family dwellings) be designed and constructed
that floor-ceilings and walls separating dwelling units reduce the
transmission of sound. The regulations also require that buildings be
insulated against noise from exterior sources. When the development is in
an area that has an ambient noise level of 60 dBA or more, the noise must be
reduced to 45 dBA in any habitable room. DHS has adopted guidelines for
use in assessing the compatibility of various land use types with a range of
noise levels (Table 6-4).

    Local Noise Standards
    The City of Hawaiian Gardens adopted a local noise ordinance—Chapter
    9.29 Noise Control—of the City’s Municipal Code. The purpose of the noise
    ordinance is to control necessary, excessive, and annoying sounds
    emanating from any source within the City. Enforcement of the ordinance
    ensures that adjacent properties are not exposed to excessive noise from
    stationary sources. The ordinance identifies four noise zones within the
    City. The ordinance sets forth standards for exterior noise levels, interior
    noise standards, and level of noise prohibited (Table 6-5).

               Noise Sensitive Receptors
               Land uses considered noise sensitive by the State of California include
               schools, hospitals, rest homes, and long-term care and mental health
               facilities. Some jurisdictions also consider day care centers, single family
               dwellings, mobile home parks, churches, libraries, and recreation areas,
               sensitive to noise. Moderately sensitive land uses typically include multi-
               family dwellings, transient lodging such as hotels and motels, dormitories,
               outpatient clinics, cemeteries, golf courses, country clubs, athletic clubs,
               and equestrian clubs. Relatively insensitive land uses are business,
               commercial, and professional uses. Insensitive noise receptors include
               industrial, manufacturing, utilities, agriculture, undeveloped land, parking
               lots, warehousing, liquid and solid waste facilities, salvage yards, and transit
               terminals.
               Land uses within the City of Hawaiian Gardens that are sensitive to
               intrusive noises include schools, parks, hospitals, and residences (Table 6-6

Significant Noise Sources
Noise sources include stationary and mobile sources. Stationary noise
sources in Hawaiian Gardens include air conditioner and refrigeration
units, high level radio, stereo, or television usage, power tools, lawnmowers,
appliances used in the home, and barking dogs. Mobile noise sources are
typically transportation related and include airplanes, helicopters,
automobiles, trucks, buses, and motorcycles. Short-term sources include
construction and public works projects.
Motor vehicles are a major source of continuous noise. The San Gabriel
River freeway (I-605) runs along the western boundary of the City, and
carries appreciable volumes of both truck and commuter traffic. Other
primary arterials, including Carson Street, Norwalk Boulevard and Pioneer
Boulevard also experience high average daily traffic levels.

EXISTING NOISE LEVELS
Data for this section was obtained by a Noise Measurement Survey
conducted in February 2008 by RBF Consulting.
Methodology
Locations for noise measurements were selected utilizing aerial
photographs flown by Eagle Aerial in 2007. RBF utilized the aerial
photograph to divide the City into a concentric grid pattern. The grid was
then further grouped into similar land uses and sensitive receptor locations
to determine specific Acoustical Zone Boundaries. RBF determined seven
Acoustical Zone Boundaries that would provide sufficient data to establish
an acoustical baseline for the City. RBF conducted one short-term noise
measurement (10 minutes in length) in each designated noise zone on
February 6, 2008 and February 12, 2008.
Brüel & Kjær Sound Level Meter
Noise monitoring equipment used for the ambient short-term noise survey
consisted of a Brüel & Kjær Hand-held Analyzer Type 2250 equipped with
a 4189 microphone. The monitoring equipment complies with applicable
requirements of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for Type
I (precision) sound level meters. Existing measured short-term noise levels
ranged from 51.1 dBA to 60.6 dBA. Additionally, traffic counts were
conducted for measurements in which the results relied heavily on traffic
noise.

    EXISTING NOISE CONTOURS
    Noise measurements are modeled to create a community-wide depiction of
    noise conditions. Noise measurements and modeling results collectively are
    represented by noise contour lines. Similar to the way topographic maps
    show contours indicating elevation change, the noise contours indicate
    decreasing noise levels as you move away from the noise source.

NOISE ISSUES
Issues identified by existing conditions analysis and the community,
include:
        Continued development in the City will likely increase the number
         of noise sources in the community.
        Land uses near major arterial corridors, such as Norwalk Boulevard
         and Carson Street, are exposed to high levels of noise.
        There are several transition areas between land use of higher
         intensity and noise sensitive uses, such as residential. These areas
         are compact and dense, with little to no buffer or noise mitigation.
GOALS AND POLICIES
Goal N-1:         Minimize the impact of point source noise and ambient
                  noise levels throughout the community.
Policies:
    N-1.1         Encourage compatibility of land uses to reduce and avoid
                  potential noise impacts.
    N-1.2         Review City policies and regulations to ensure community
                  noise levels are reduced to the maximum extent feasible.
    N-1.3         Monitor and minimize construction activity noise impacts
                  on residential neighborhoods.
Goal N-2:         Reduce transportation-related          noise     impacts    to
                  residential areas.
Policies:
    N-2.1         Ensure appropriate mitigation measures for reducing noise
                  impacts in residential areas.
    N-2.2         Require appropriate acoustical studies as part of new
                  development, and ensure the inclusion of noise mitigation
                  measures in the design.
    N-2.3         Use proven methods of reducing the transmission of traffic
                  noise onto adjacent noise sensitive receptors.
    N-2.4         Encourage acoustical design in new construction.

        N-2.5       Reduce transportation noise through proper design and
                    coordination of vehicle routing.
    Goal N-3:       Develop measures to control non-transportation noise
                    and similar impacts.
    Policies:
        N-3.1       Continue to enforce noise ordinance standards to mitigate
                    conflicts among neighboring land uses.
        N-3.2       Establish and maintain coordination among City agencies
                    involved in noise abatement.
        N-3.3       Ensure that City departments comply with all state and
                    federal OSHA noise standards.
    See the Implementation Program Section [Section 7] for implementing
    actions that support the Noise Element goals and policies.

                 7. Implementation Program
                                                                              Section 7
The Implementation Program will guide City elected officials and staff in
the overall effort to carry out adopted General Plan goals and policies. The
purpose of the Implementation Program is to enable the overall direction set
forth in the General Plan to be translated from general terms to specific
actions.
Each implementing action is a procedure, program, or technique that
requires City action, either alone or in collaboration with non-governmental
or quasi-governmental agencies and organizations. Some of the
implementing actions are processes or procedures the City currently
administers on a daily basis (such as the development review process),
while others identify new programs or projects. Completion of the
identified projects and actions will be subject to funding and resource
constraints.
The Implementation Program is organized in the following matrix
corresponding with the elements of the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan:
        Land Use Element
        Economic Development Element
        Community Design Element
        Circulation Element
        Capital Improvements Element
        Conservation Element
        Open Space/Recreation Element
        Air Quality Element
        Safety Element
        Noise Element
Refer to the Housing Element (Section 3) for a description of housing
programs that support the Housing Element goals and policies.
Each implementing action relates to one or more General Plan policies,
drawn from the various General Plan elements. The matrix is organized by
element, including a brief description of the overall goal, each policy, and
the related action(s). The program assigns responsibility to the
corresponding City department, public agency, or organization. For helpful
reference, for each policy, a list of other related General Plan policies are
provided, where applicable.
City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                              265

    The Implementation Program is intended for use as the basis for preparing
    the Annual Report to the City Council on the status of the City’s progress
    in implementing the General Plan, as described in Section 65400 of the
    Government Code. Many of the implementing actions may serve as
    mitigation for environmental impacts resulting from planned development
    pursuant to the Hawaiian Gardens General Plan; therefore, the annual
    report can also serve as a means of monitoring application of the mitigation
    measures as required by Public Resources Code Section 21081.6. The
    programs should be updated annually concurrent with the budget process
    and whenever the City’s General Plan is amended or updated, to ensure
    continued consistency and usefulness.

Acres, Gross: The entire acreage of a site. Most communities calculate gross
acreage to the centerline of proposed bounding streets and to the edge of
the right-of-way of existing or dedicated streets.
Acres, Net: The portion of a site that can actually be built upon. The
following generally are not included in the net acreage of a site: public or
private road rights-of-way, public open-space, and flood ways.

household with very low, low, or moderate income, based on a household’s
ability to make monthly payments necessary to obtain housing. “Affordable
to low-and moderate-income households” means that at least 20 percent of
the units in a development will be sold or rented to lower income
households, and the remaining units to either lower or moderate income
households. Housing units for lower income households must sell or rent
for a monthly cost not greater than 30 percent of 60 percent of area median
income as periodically established by HCD. Housing units for moderate
income must sell or rent for a monthly cost not greater than 30 percent of
area median income.

Aquifers generally hold sufficient water to be used as a water supply.
Architectural Control; Architectural Review: Regulations and procedures
requiring the exterior design of structures to be suitable, harmonious, and
in keeping with the general appearance, historic character, and/or style of
surrounding areas. A process used to exercise control over the design of
buildings and their settings. (See “Design Review.”)

with the general plan.
Carrying Capacity: Used in determining the potential of an area to absorb
development: (1) The level of land use, human activity, or development for a
specific area that can be accommodated permanently without an
irreversible change in the quality of air, water, land, or plant and animal
habitats. (2) The upper limits of development beyond which the quality of

    (5,000-20,000 average daily trips) street that provides circulation within
    and between neighborhoods. Collectors usually serve short trips and are
    intended for collecting trips from local streets and distributing them to the
    arterial network.
    Community Care Facility: Housing for the elderly licensed by the
    Department of Social Services within the California Health and Human
    Services Agency, typically for residents who are frail and need supervision.
    Services normally include three meals daily, housekeeping, security and

    of medicine, personal services such as assistance in grooming and bathing,
    but no nursing care. Sometimes referred to as residential care or personal
    care. (See “Congregate Care.”)
    Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): A grant program
    administered by HUD on a formula basis for entitlement communities and
    by HCD for non-entitlement jurisdictions. This grant allots money to cities
    and counties for housing rehabilitation and community development,
    including public facilities and economic development.
    Community Facilities District: Under the Mello-Roos Community
    Facilities Act of 1982 (§53311, et seq.), a legislative body may create within
    its jurisdiction a special tax district that can finance tax-exempt bonds for
    the planning, design, acquisition, construction, and/or operation of public
    facilities, as well as public services for district residents. Special taxes levied
    solely within the district are used to repay the bonds.
    Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): A 24- hour energy
    equivalent level derived from a variety of single-noise events, with
    weighting factors of 5 and 10 dBA applied to the evening (7 p.m. to 10 p.m.)
    and nighttime (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.) periods to allow for greater sensitivity to
    noise during these hours.

    recreation opportunities beyond those supplied by neighborhood parks.
    Community parks are larger in scale than neighborhood parks but smaller
    than regional parks.
    Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA): A local agency created under
    California Redevelopment Law (Health and Safety Code §33000, et. seq.), or
    a local legislative body that has been elected to exercise the powers granted
    to such an agency, for the purpose of planning, developing, re-planning,
    redesigning, clearing, reconstructing, and/ or rehabilitating all or part of a
    specified area with residential, commercial, industrial, and/or public
    (including recreational) structures and facilities. The redevelopment
    agency’s plans must be compatible with adopted community general plans.

Congestion Management Plan (CMP): A mechanism employing growth
management techniques, including traffic level of service requirements,
standards for public transit, trip reduction programs involving
transportation systems management and jobs/ housing balance strategies,
and capital improvement programming, for the purpose of controlling
and/or reducing the cumulative regional traffic impacts of development.
Consistency; Consistent with: Free from significant variation or
contradiction. The various diagrams, text, goals, policies, and programs in
the general plan must be consistent with each other, not contradictory or
preferential. California law also requires that a general plan be internally
consistent and also requires consistency between a general plan and
implementation measures such as the zoning ordinance. As a general rule,
an action program or project is consistent with the general plan if,
considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives and policies of the
general plan and not obstruct their attainment.
Cul-de-sac: A short street or alley with only a single means of ingress and
egress at one end and with a large turnaround at its other end.
Cumulative Impact: As used in CEQA, the total impact resulting from the
accumulated impacts of individual projects or programs over time.
Day-Night Average Sound Level (Ldn): The A weighted average sound
level for a given area (measured in decibels) during a 24-hour period with a
10 dB weighting applied to night-time sound levels. The Ldn is
approximately numerically equal to the CNEL for most environmental
settings.
dBA: The “A-weighted” scale for measuring sound in decibels; weighs or
reduces the effects of low and high frequencies in order to simulate human
hearing. Every increase of 10 dBA doubles the perceived loudness though the
noise is actually ten times more intense.
Decibel (dB): A unit used to express the relative intensity of a sound as it is
heard by the human ear. See Appendix C: Noise element Guidelines) for a
technical definition.
Dedication: The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for
public use, and the acceptance of land for such use by the governmental
agency having jurisdiction over the public function for which it will be
used. Dedications for roads, parks, school sites, or other public uses often
are made conditions for approval of a development by a city or county.
City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                      309

    Dedication, In lieu of: Cash payments that may be required of an owner or
    developer as a substitute for a dedication of land, usually calculated in
    dollars per lot, and referred to as in lieu fees or in lieu contributions.
    Defensible Space: (1) In firefighting and prevention, a 30-foot area of non-
    combustible surfaces separating urban and wildland areas. (2) In urban
    areas, open-spaces, entry points, and pathways configured to provide
    maximum opportunities to rightful users and/or residents to defend
    themselves against intruders and criminal activity.
    Density, Residential: The number of permanent residential dwelling units
    per acre of land. Densities specified in the general plan may be expressed in
    units per gross acre or per net developable acre. (See “Acres, Gross,” and
    “Developable Acres, Net.”)
    Density Bonus: The allocation of development rights that allows a parcel to
    accommodate additional square footage or additional residential units
    beyond the maximum for which the parcel is zoned. Under Government
    Code §65915, a housing development that provides 20 percent of its units
    for lower-income households, ten percent of its units for very-low income
    households, or 50 percent of its units for seniors is entitled to a density
    bonus and other concessions.
    Density Transfer: A way of retaining open space by concentrating
    densities—usually in compact areas adjacent to existing urbanization and
    utilities— while leaving unchanged historic, sensitive, or hazardous areas.
    In some jurisdictions, for example, developers can buy development rights
    of properties targeted for public open space and transfer the additional
    density to the base number of units permitted in the zone in which they
    propose to develop. (See “Transfer of Development Rights.”)
    Detention Dam/Basin/Pond: Dams may be classified according to the
    broad function they serve, such as storage, diversion, or detention.
    Detention dams are constructed to retard flood runoff and minimize the
    effect of sudden floods. Detention dams fall into two main types. In one
    type, the water is temporarily stored and released through an outlet
    structure at a rate that will not exceed the carrying capacity of the channel
    downstream. Often, the basins are planted with grass and used for open
    space or recreation in periods of dry weather. The other type, most often
    called a retention pond, allows for water to be held as long as possible and
    may or may not allow for the controlled release of water. In some cases, the
    water is allowed to seep into the permeable banks or gravel strata in the
    foundation. This latter type is sometimes called a waterspreading dam or
    dike because its main purpose is to recharge the underground water supply.
    Detention dams are also constructed to trap sediment. These are often
    called debris dams.

Emergency Shelter: A facility that provides immediate short-term housing
and supplemental services for the homeless. Shelters come in many sizes,
but an optimum size is considered to be 20 to 40 beds. Supplemental
services may include food, counseling, and access to other social programs.
(See “Transitional Housing.”)
Eminent Domain: The right of a public entity to acquire private property
for public use by condemnation and the payment of just compensation.

area which will be affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water,
mineral, flora, fauna, noise, and objects of historic or aesthetic significance.”
Environmental Impact Report (EIR): A report required pursuant to the
California Environmental Quality Act that assesses all the environmental
characteristics of an area, determines what effects or impacts will result if
the area is altered or disturbed by a proposed action, and identifies
alternatives or other measures to avoid or reduce those impacts. (See
“California Environmental Quality Act.”)
Exaction: A contribution or payment required as an authorized
precondition for receiving a development permit; usually refers to
mandatory dedication (or fee in lieu of dedication) requirements found in
many subdivision regulations.

    technological factors.
    Fiscal Impact Analysis: A projection of the direct public costs and revenues
    resulting from population or employment change to the local jurisdiction(s)
    in which the change is taking place. Enables local governments to evaluate
    relative fiscal merits of general plans, specific plans, or projects.
    Flood, 100-Year: The magnitude of a flood expected to occur on the average
    every 100 years, based on historical data. The 100-year flood has a 1/ 100, or
    one percent, chance of occurring in any given year.
    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): For each community, the official map
    on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated areas of
    special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to that
    community.
    Floodplain: The relatively level land area on either side of the banks of a
    stream regularly subject to flooding. That part of the floodplain subject to a
    one percent chance of flooding in any given year is designated as an “area of
    special flood hazard” by the Federal Insurance Administration.
    Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
    land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the “base flood”
    without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one

Floor Area, Gross: The sum of the horizontal areas of the several floors of a
building measured from the exterior face of exterior walls, or from the
centerline of a wall separating two buildings, but not including any space
where the floor to- ceiling height is less than six feet. Some cities exclude
specific kinds of space (e.g., elevator shafts, parking decks) from the
calculation of gross floor area.
Floor Area Ratio (FAR): The gross floor area permitted on a site divided by
the total net area of the site, expressed in decimals to one or two places. For
example, on a site with 10,000 net square feet of land area, a floor area ratio
of 1.0 will allow a maximum of 10,000 gross square feet of building floor area
to be built. On the same site, an FAR of 1.5 would allow 15,000 square feet of
floor area; an FAR of 2.0 would allow 20,000 square feet; and an FAR of 0.5
would allow only 5,000 square feet. Also commonly used in zoning, FARs
typically are applied on a parcel-by-parcel basis as opposed to an average
FAR for an entire land use or zoning district.
Freeway: A high-speed, high-capacity, limited-access road serving regional
and countywide travel. Such roads are free of tolls, as contrasted with
turnpikes or other toll roads. Freeways generally are used for long trips
between major land use generators. At Level of Service E, they carry
approximately 1,875 vehicles per lane per hour in both directions. Major
streets cross at a different grade level.
Granny Flat: See “Second Unit.”
Ground Failure: Ground movement or rupture caused by strong shaking
during an earthquake. Includes landslide, lateral spreading, liquefaction,
and subsidence.
Ground Shaking: Ground movement resulting from the transmission of
seismic waves during an earthquake.
Groundwater: Water under the earth’s surface, often confined to aquifers
capable of supplying wells and springs.
Groundwater Recharge: The natural process of infiltration and percolation
of rainwater from land areas or streams through permeable soils into water-
holding rocks that provide underground storage (aquifers).
Hazardous Material: Any substance that, because of its quantity,
concentration, or physical or chemical characteristics, poses a significant
present or potential hazard to human health and safety or to the
environment if released into the workplace or the environment. The term
includes, but is not limited to, hazardous substances and hazardous wastes.
High-Occupancy Structure: All pre-1935 buildings with over 25 occupants

    High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV): Any vehicle other than a driver-only
    automobile (e.g., a vanpool, a bus, or a car carrying two or more persons).
    Historic Preservation: The preservation of historically significant
    structures and neighborhoods in order to facilitate restoration and
    rehabilitation of the building(s) to a former condition.
    Household: All those persons, related or unrelated, ho occupy a single
    housing unit. (See “Family.”)
    Households, Number of: The count of all year-round housing units
    occupied by one or more persons. The concept of household is important
    because the formation of new households generates the demand for housing.
    Each new household formed creates the need for one additional housing
    unit or requires that one existing housing unit be shared by two
    households. Thus, household formation can continue to take place even
    without an increase in population, thereby increasing the demand for
    housing.
    Housing and Community Development, Department of (HCD): The
    state agency that has principal responsibility for assessing, planning for, and
    assisting communities to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income
    households.

    cabinet-level department of the federal government that administers
    housing and community development programs.
    Housing Authority, Local (LHA): A local housing agency established in
    state law, subject to local activation and operation. Originally intended to
    manage certain federal subsidies, but vested with broad powers to develop
    and manage other forms of affordable housing.
    Housing Unit: A house, an apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of
    rooms, or a single room that is occupied as a separate living quarters, or, if
    vacant, is intended for occupancy as a separate living quarters (2000 U.S.
    Census definition).
    Impact Fee: A fee, also called a development fee, levied on the developer of a
    project by a city, county, or other public agency as compensation for
    otherwise- unmitigated impacts the project will produce. Government
    Code §66000, et seq., specifies that development fees shall not exceed the
    estimated reasonable cost of providing the service for which the fee is
    charged. To lawfully impose a development fee, the public agency must
    verify its method of calculation and document proper restrictions on use of
    the fund. Impact/development fees may be used to pay for preparing and
    updating general plans and specific plans.
    Impacted Areas: Census tracts where more than 50 percent of the dwelling
    units house low- and very low income households.

    at a later date. Banked lands have been used for development of low and
    moderate-income housing, expansion of parks, and development of
    industrial and commercial centers. Federal rail-banking law allows
    railroads to bank unused rail corridors for future rail use while allowing
    interim use as trails.
    Landmark: (1) A building, site, object, structure, or significant tree having
    historical, architectural, social, or cultural significance and marked for

flow. Intersections still function, but short queues develop and cars may
have to wait through one cycle during short peaks.
Level of Service E: Represents traffic characterized by slow movement and
frequent (although momentary) stoppages. This type of congestion is
considered severe but is not uncommon at peak traffic hours, with frequent
stopping, long-standing queues, and blocked intersections.
Level of Service F: Describes unsatisfactory stop-and-go traffic
characterized by traffic jams and stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at
signalized intersections usually have to wait through one or more signal
change and “upstream” intersections may be blocked by the long queues.
Linkage: With respect to jobs/housing balance, a program designed to
offset the impact of employment on housing need within a community,
whereby project approval is conditioned on the provision of housing units

    Moderate-Income Household: A household with an annual income
    between the lower income eligibility limits and 120 percent of the area
    median family income adjusted by household size, usually as established by
    HUD for the Section 8 housing program. (See “Area” and “Low-Income
    Household.”)
    Modular Unit: A factory-fabricated, transportable building or major
    component designed for use by itself or for incorporation with similar units
    on site into a structure for residential, commercial, educational, or
    industrial use. Differs from mobilehomes and manufactured housing by (in
    addition to lacking an integral chassis or permanent hitch to allow future
    movement) being subject to California housing law design standards.

    Noise Contour: A line connecting points of equal noise level as measured
    on the same scale. Noise levels greater than the 60 Ldn contour (measured
    in dBA) require noise attenuation in residential development.
    Non-Attainment: The condition of not achieving a desired or required level
    of performance. Frequently used in reference to air quality. (See
    “Attainment.”)
    Non-conforming Use: A use that was valid when brought into existence,

    conforming use” is a generic term and includes (1) non conforming
    structures (by virtue of size, type of construction, location on land, or
    proximity to other structures), (2) non-conforming use of a conforming
    building, (3) non-conforming use of a non conforming building, and (4)
    non-conforming use of land. Thus, any use lawfully existing on any piece of
    property that is inconsistent with a new or amended general plan, and that
    in turn is a violation of a zoning ordinance amendment subsequently
    adopted in conformance with the general plan, will be a non-conforming
    use. Typically, non-conforming uses are permitted to continue for a
    designated period of time, subject to certain restrictions.
    Open-Space Land: Any parcel or area of land or water that is essentially
    unimproved and devoted to an open-space use for the purposes of (1) the

depend. Sustainable development meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Tax Increment: Additional tax revenues that result from increases in
property values within a redevelopment area. State law permits the tax
increment to be earmarked for redevelopment purposes but requires at least
20 percent to be used to increase and improve the community’s supply of
low- and very-low income housing.

    Traffic Model: A mathematical representation of traffic movement within
    an area or region based on observed relationships between the kind and
    intensity of development in specific areas. Many traffic models operate on
    the theory that trips are produced by persons living in residential areas and
    are attracted by various non-residential land uses. (See “Trip”)
    Transit: The conveyance of persons or goods from one place to another by
    means of a local public transportation system.
    Transit, Public: A system of regularly-scheduled buses and/or trains
    available to the public on a fee-per-ride basis. Also called mass transit.
    Transit-Dependent: Refers to persons unable to operate automobiles or
    other motorized vehicles, or those who do not own motorized vehicles.
    Transit- dependent citizens must rely on transit, paratransit, or owners of
    private vehicles for transportation. Transit-dependent citizens include the
    young, the handicapped, the elderly, the poor, and those with prior
    violations in motor vehicle laws.
    Transit-Oriented Development (TOD): Moderate- to higher-density
    development, located within easy walk of a major transit stop, generally
    with a mix of residential, employment, and shopping opportunities
    designed for pedestrians without excluding the auto. TOD can be new
    construction or redevelopment of one or more buildings whose design and
    orientation facilitate transit use. (Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Study,
    California Department of Transportation, 2002).
    Transitional Housing: Shelter provided to the homeless for an extended
    period, often as long as 18 months, and generally integrated with other
    social services and counseling programs to assist in the transition to self-
    sufficiency through the acquisition of a stable income and permanent
    housing. (See “Emergency Shelter.”)
    Transportation Demand Management (TDM): A strategy for reducing
    demand on the road system by reducing the number of vehicles using the
    roadways and/or increasing the number of persons per vehicle. TDM
    attempts to reduce the number of persons who drive alone on the roadway
    during the commute period and to increase the number in carpools,
    vanpools, buses and trains, walking, and biking. TDM can be an element of
    TSM (see below).
    Transportation Systems Management (TSM): A comprehensive strategy
    developed to address the problems caused by additional development,
    increasing trips, and a shortfall in transportation capacity.
    Transportation Systems Management focuses on more efficiently utilizing
    existing highway and transit systems rather than expanding them. TSM
    measures are characterized by their low cost and quick implementation
    time frame, such as computerized traffic signals, metered freeway ramps,
    and one-way streets.

Trees, Street: Trees strategically planted-usually in parkway strips,
medians, or along streets-to enhance the visual quality of a street.
Trip: A one-way journey that proceeds from an origin to a destination via a
single mode of transportation; the smallest unit of movement considered in
transportation studies. Each trip has one “production end,” (or origin—
often from home, but not always), and one “attraction end,” (destination).
(See “Traffic Model.”)
Trip Generation: The dynamics that account for people making trips in
automobiles or by means of public transportation. Trip generation is the
basis for estimating the level of use for a transportation system and the
impact of additional development or transportation facilities on an existing,
local transportation system. Trip generations of households are correlated
with destinations that attract household members for specific purposes.
Truck Route: A path of circulation required for all vehicles exceeding set
weight or axle limits, a truck route follows major arterials through
commercial or industrial areas and avoids sensitive areas.
Uniform Building Code (UBC): A national, standard building code that
sets forth minimum standards for construction.
Uniform Housing Code (UHC): State housing regulations governing the
condition of habitable structures with regard to health and safety standards
and providing for the conservation and rehabilitation of housing in
accordance with the Uniform Building Code (UBC).
Urban: Of, relating to, characteristic of, or constituting a city. Urban areas
are generally characterized by moderate and higher density residential
development (i.e., three or more dwelling units per acre), commercial
development, and industrial development, and the availability of public
services required for that development, specifically central water and sewer,
an extensive road network, public transit, and other such services (e.g.,
safety and emergency response). Development not providing such services
may be “non-urban” or “rural.” (See “Urban Land Use.”) CEQA defines
“urbanized area” as an area that has a population density of at least 1,000
persons per square mile (Public Resources Code §21080.14(b)).
Urban Design: The attempt to give form, in terms of both beauty and
function, to selected urban areas or to whole cities. Urban design is
concerned with the location, mass, and design of various urban components
and combines elements of urban planning, architecture, and landscape
architecture.
Urban Sprawl: Haphazard growth or outward extension of a city resulting
from uncontrolled or poorly managed development.
City of Hawaiian Gardens  General Plan                                                     327

    Utility Corridors: Rights-of-way or easements for utility lines on either
    publicly or privately owned property. (See “Right-of-Way” or “Easement”)
    Vehicle-Miles Traveled (VMT): A key measure of overall street and
    highway use. Reducing VMT is often a major objective in efforts to reduce
    vehicular congestion and achieve regional air quality goals.
    Very-Low Income Household: A household with an annual income usually
    no greater than 50 percent of the area median family income adjusted by
    household size, as determined by a survey of incomes conducted by a city or
    a county, or in the absence of such a survey, based on the latest available
    eligibility limits established by HUD for the Section 8 housing program.
    View Corridor: The line of sight - identified as to height, width, and
    distance - of an observer looking toward an object of significance to the
    community (e.g., ridgeline, river, historic building, etc.); the route that
    directs the viewers attention.
    Viewshed: The area within view from a defined observation point.
    Volume-to-Capacity Ratio: A measure of the operating capacity of a
    roadway or intersection, in terms of the number of vehicles passing through,
    divided by the number of vehicles that theoretically could pass through
    when the roadway or intersection is operating at its designed capacity.
    Abbreviated as “V/C.” At a V/C ratio of 1.0, the roadway or intersection is
    operating at capacity. If the ratio is less than 1.0, the traffic facility has
    additional capacity. Although ratios slightly greater than 1.0 are possible, it
    is more likely that the peak hour will elongate into a “peak period.” (See
    “Level of Service”)
    Water-Efficient Landscaping: Landscaping designed to minimize water
    use and maximize energy efficiency.
    Watercourse: Natural or once natural flowing (perennially or
    intermittently) water including rivers, streams, and creeks. Includes natural
    waterways that have been channelized, but does not include manmade
    channels, ditches, and underground drainage and sewage systems.
    Watershed: The total area above a given point on a watercourse that
    contributes water to its flow; the entire region drained by a waterway or
    watercourse that drains into a lake, or reservoir.
    Waterway: See “Watercourse.”
    Zero Lot Line: A detached single family unit distinguished by the location
    of one exterior wall on a side property line.

Zone, Traffic: In a mathematical traffic model the area to be studied is
divided into zones, with each zone treated as producing and attracting
trips. The production of trips by a zone is based on the number of trips to or
from work or shopping, or other trips produced per dwelling unit.
Zoning: The division of a city or county by legislative regulations into areas,
or zones, that specify allowable uses for real property and size restrictions
for buildings within these areas; a program that implements policies of the
general plan.
Zoning District: A designated section of a city or county for which
prescribed land use requirements and building and development standards
are uniform.
Zoning, Incentive: The awarding of bonus credits to a development in the
form of allowing more intensive use of land if public benefits-such as
preservation of greater than the minimum required open-space, provision
for low- and moderate-income housing, or plans for public plazas and
courts at ground level-are included in a project.

SECTION 1                                                                  INTRODUCTION
A.       INTRODUCTION
1.       Scope and Content
Government Code Section 65583 states:
         The housing element shall consist of an identification and analysis of
         existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies,
         quantified objectives, financial resources and scheduled programs for the
         preservation, improvement, and development of housing. The housing
         element shall identify adequate sites for housing, including rental housing,
         factory-built housing, and mobilehomes, and shall make adequate
         provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic segments
         of the community.
The Housing Element Law requires every city and county to prepare and adopt a
Housing Element of the community's General Plan. The Housing Element must include
four major components:
                An assessment of the Hawaiian Gardens' housing needs.
                An inventory of resources to meet needs and of the constraints
                 that impede public and private sector efforts to meet the needs.
                A statement of the City’s goals, quantified objectives and policies
                 relative to the construction, rehabilitation, conservation and
                 preservation of housing.
                An implementation program which sets forth a schedule of actions
                 which the City is undertaking or intends to undertake to implement
                 the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the Housing
                 Element.
2.       Background and Authorization
Housing elements of the general plan were first mandated by State legislation enacted in
1967. In 1977, the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
published “Housing Element Guidelines”. The “guidelines” spelled out not only the
detailed content requirements of housing elements, but also gave HCD a “review and
approval” function over this element of the general plan. In 1981, Article 10.6 of the
Government Code was enacted, which placed the guidelines into statutory language and
changed HCD’s role from “review and approval” to one of “review and comment” on local
housing elements.
This update complies with the housing element planning period from January 1, 2006
through June 30, 2014.

INTRODUCTION                                                                   SECTION 1
B.      ORGANIZATION OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
In addition to this Introduction, the Housing Element contains three Sections.
Section 2 contains a statement of the City’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies
relative to the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing.
HCD interprets this Section as requiring a city to state goals and policies for the
construction, rehabilitation, conservation and preservation of housing. Quantified
objectives are the City’s estimate of the maximum actual numbers of housing units that
can be constructed, rehabilitated, conserved and preserved during the planning period
(January 1, 2006 through June 30, 2014).
Section 3 describes the tools the City will use to continue existing and create new
program endeavors, explains who is responsible for program implementation, shows
how the Housing Element achieves consistency with General Plan elements and
describes the public participation effort. Specifically, Section 3 addresses:
               Administration of land use and development controls
               Provision of regulatory concessions and incentives
               Utilization of federal and state financing and subsidy programs
               Utilization of moneys in the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund
               Agencies and officials responsible for program actions
               Consistency of the Housing Element with other General Plan Elements
               Public participation in the development of the Housing Element
Section 4 presents the Draft Housing Program according to six categories:
               Identify actions that will be taken to make sites available to
                accommodate that portion of the city’s share of the regional
                housing need for each income level that could not be
                accommodated on sites identified in the sites inventory.
               Assist in the development of affordable housing.
               Remove governmental constraints.
               Conserve the existing stock of affordable housing.
               Promote equal housing opportunity.
               Preserve existing affordable housing at risk of conversion to
                market rate housing.

For each program category, the following is presented:
               A summary of housing needs.
               A statement of goals, policies and objectives.
               A description of action programs.
The Housing Element also contains detailed information to comply with each pertinent
section of the Government Code. A description of each Technical Appendix is given
below:
               Technical Appendix A contains all of the detailed data, statistics
                and analyses pertaining to the City's housing needs, existing and
                future.
               Technical Appendix B describes potential and actual
                governmental constraints that impede efforts at addressing
                housing needs.
               Technical Appendix C describes non-governmental constraints
                such as the cost of land and construction.
               Technical Appendix D contains the detailed information on the
                inventory of residential sites and explains how the sites
                accommodate the City’s share of regional housing needs.
               Technical Appendix E is the Housing Element Progress Report.
                This Technical Appendix assesses the progress made toward
                implementation of the prior Housing Element.

SECTION 2                                          GOALS, POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES
Government Code Section 65583 (b) requires that the Housing Element include:
         “A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies
         relative to the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development
         of housing.”
A.       GOALS AND POLICIES
HCD defines these terms as follows:
         “Goals are general statements of purpose. Housing element goals will
         indicate the general direction that the jurisdiction intends to take with
         respect to its housing problems. While reflecting local community values,
         the goals should be consistent with the legislative findings (Section
         65580) and legislative intent (Section 65581) of Article 10.6 and other
         expressions of state housing goals contained in the housing element law.
         Goals may extend beyond the time frame of a given housing element.
         Policies provide a link between housing goals and programs; they guide
         and shape actions taken to meet housing objectives.
1.       Construction Goals and Policies
                                            Goals
         Accommodate a portion of the housing needs of all income groups as
         quantified by the Regional Housing Needs Assessment.
                                           Policies
         Facilitate the construction of the maximum feasible number of housing
         units for all income groups.
         Implement the Land Use Element and Zoning Code to achieve adequate

B.       QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
Section 65583(b)(2) states:
         The quantified objectives shall establish the maximum number of
         housing units that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved over
         a five-year period.
         [emphasis added]
HCD defines quantified objectives as follows:
         Quantified objectives are the maximum actual numbers of housing units
         that the jurisdiction projects can be constructed, rehabilitated, conserved
         and preserved over a five-year time frame. In order to more realistically
         plan for the implementation of housing programs, it is useful for localities
         to establish objectives for each housing program which will be
         implemented during the time frame of the element. Objectives may
         therefore be short-term in outlook compared to community’s goals.”
         (emphasis added)

GOALS, POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES                                                 SECTION 2
The Housing Element Law states that needs may exceed resources and, therefore,
allows cities to set forth objectives less than the total housing needs. More exactly,
Section 65583(b)(2) states:
        “It is recognized that the total housing needs … may exceed available
        resources and the community’s ability to satisfy this need within the
        content of the general plan requirements outlined in article 6
        (commencing with Section 65300). Under these circumstances, the
        quantified objectives need not be identical to the total housing needs.”
This interpretation is confirmed by Opinion No. 03-104 (May 18, 2005) of the Office of
the Attorney General that states:
        “We conclude that a community may establish its maximum number of
        housing units by income category that can be constructed, rehabilitated,
        and conserved over the next five-year period below the number of
        housing units that would meet the community’s goal of achieving its share
        of the regional housing needs established pursuant to the Planning and
        Zoning Law if the community finds its available resources in the
        aggregate, including but not limited to federal and state funds for its
        housing programs, its own local funds, tax or density credits, and other
        affordable housing programs, are insufficient to meet those needs.”
        (pgs. 7 and 8)
As required by Section 65583(b), quantified objectives by income group for the 2006-
2014 program period are stated in this Section. State law defines the income groups in
terms of the percentage of the Los Angeles County median income. Chart 2-1 shows
the percentages for each income group.

Each year the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the
State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) update the
household income limits for each group.      Table 2-1 presents the income limits for four
income categories. The “above moderate” is one dollar more than the “moderate”
income category, adjusted for household size.

As explained on page 2-3, quantified objectives are the maximum actual numbers of
housing units that the City projects can be constructed, rehabilitated, conserved and
preserved during the planning period. Table 2-2 states the quantified objectives by
income group and category for the 2006-2014 planning period.

1.       Construction Objective
As previously explained, the City’s quantified construction objective can be the same,
more or less than the 145 housing unit RHNA allocation. The projection of housing units
that could be constructed between 2006 and 2014 is based on the following:
               Housing that has been constructed, is under construction, and
                approved for development. (N=17)
               Development of all vacant residential sites during the 2006-2014
                planning period. (N=25)

GOALS, POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES                                                 SECTION 2
               Development of underutilized residential sites. (N=30; 5 per year)
               Development of affordable housing units through implementation
                of the Redevelopment Agency’s Housing Plan. (N=8)
2.      Rehabilitation Objective
The rehabilitation objective of 120 housing units assumes continued funding from CDBG
and General Funds. The income distribution is based on that of lower income
homeowners residing in the City.
3.      Conservation Objective
The conservation objective refers to maintaining existing affordable housing through
measures such as rent subsidies and implementing land use controls during the
program period. The quantified objective is 167 families and seniors assisted through
the Section 8 Rental Assistance Program. The 167 quantified objective combines the
Housing Authority’s lease up rate of 127 and the 40 seniors assisted at the Hawaiian
Terrace Senior Apartments.
The income distribution is as follows:
        Extremely Low                  100 (81 current + 19 future assisted families)
        Very Low                        63 (23 current + 40 at Hawaiian Terrace Senior Apts.)
        Low                               4 (current)
The conservation objective also includes the two mobilehome parks located in the City.
Each park has Mobilehome Park land use and zoning designations, which contribute to
the conservation of this portion of the housing stock.
There are 248 mobile homes located in the Lakewood Mobile Estates and Bloomfield
Mobilehome Park. To calculate the quantified objectives, the owner and renter income
distributions of small households (2-4 persons) were used. Census 2000 indicates that
215 and 33 mobilehome householders were owners and renters, respectively. The
income distribution is noted below:
        Extremely Low                  10
        Very Low                       15
        Low                            48

SECTION 2                                        GOALS, POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES
4.       Preservation Objective
The preservation objective refers to maintaining the affordability of 211 existing
affordable family housing units. The income distribution, which is based on the income
distribution among all lower income large-family renters living in the City, is as follows:
         Extremely Low                68
         Very Low                     63
         Low                           80
[The 211 apartment units include 179 households assisted by the Section 8 rental
assistance program and another 32 households with monthly rents set at the Low
Income Housing Tax Credit levels. All households reside at the Hawaiian Gardens
apartment community.]
C.       QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES FOR EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
The quantified objectives are based on individual programs that address the existing and
future needs of extremely low income households. The programs and the corresponding
quantified objectives are listed below:
         New Construction                     2 housing units
         Housing Rehabilitation Program     14 housing units

SECTION 3                          PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER ACTIONS
A.       INTRODUCTION
Section 3 describes the tools the City will use to continue existing and create new
program endeavors, explains who is responsible for program implementation, shows
how the Housing Element achieves consistency with General Plan elements and
describes the public participation effort. Specifically, Section 3 addresses:
                Administration of land use and development controls
                Provision of regulatory concessions and incentives
                Utilization of federal and state financing and subsidy programs
                Utilization of moneys in the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund
                Agencies and officials responsible for program actions
                Consistency of the Housing Element with other General Plan Elements
                Public participation in the development of the Housing Element
B.       PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS
Section 65583(c) requires that the housing element include:
         “A program which sets forth a five-year schedule of actions the local
         government is undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the
         policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the housing element
         through the administration of land use and development controls,
         provision of regulatory concessions and incentives, and the utilization of
         appropriate federal and state financing and subsidy programs when
         available and the utilization of moneys in a Low and Moderate Income
         Housing Fund of an agency if the locality has established a
         redevelopment project area pursuant to the Community Redevelopment
         Law.” (emphasis added)
1.       Land Use and Development Controls
The City’s Zoning Code provides for a variety of housing types such as single-family and
multi-family housing as well as mobilehome parks, accessory units, emergency shelters
and SRO units. Housing unit sizes may be as small as 450 square feet. Lot sizes may
be as small as 3,750 square feet. The City’s Intermediate Density is almost 20 dwelling
units per acre and the High Density is 24 dwelling units per acre.
2.       Regulatory Concessions and Incentives
Section 18.90.090 of the Zoning Code provides regulatory concessions and incentives
through density bonuses. The City’s density bonus provisions are consistent with the
requirements of the State Density Bonus Law (SB 1818). In general, the concessions
and incentives include:
City of Hawaiian Gardens - Housing Element                                           3-1

PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER ACTIONS                                      SECTION 3
        “A reduction or modification of Zoning Code requirements, site
        development standards, or architectural design requirements that exceed
        the minimum building standards approved by the State Building
        Standards Commission, as provided in Part 25 of Division 13 of the
        Health and Safety Code.”
Concessions and incentives may include reductions and modifications to open space,
parking, setback, density, building height and off-site improvements.
3.      Use of Financing and Subsidy Programs
During the program period, the City will have housing funds through a variety of sources
including the Section 8 Rental Assistance Program, Community Development Block
Grant Program, General Fund and the Redevelopment Agency’s Housing Set-Aside
Fund.
Additional funding resources may become available, as the City submits funding
applications to local or State agencies and through the efforts of non-profit housing
developers. A brief description of actual and potential funding sources is given below
and on the next three pages.
a.      Federal Programs
1)      Section 8 Voucher Program: The City’s Housing Authority annually receives from
HUD $925,000 for purposes of providing rental assistance payments. During the six-year
period from 2008 to 2014, the Housing Authority is projected to receive $5,550,000 from
HUD to administer the program.
2)      CDBG Program: Through an agreement with the County of Los Angeles, the City
annually receives about $150,000 of Community Development Block Grant funds.
Assuming this funding continues, the City will obtain $900,000 over the remaining six
years of the planning period. Currently, these funds are used to finance the City’s
popular Housing Rehabilitation Program.
3)      Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC): This program provides for a
significant share of funding for affordable housing projects. In 2007, the Los Angeles
County share of the Statewide funding was $19.4 million, or 33% of the total annual
funding amount. Experienced private and non-profit housing developers often use this
funding source as a key piece of funding an affordable housing project. In 2007, LIHTC
funded 70 projects that produced 4,424 affordable housing units. According to the State
Tax Credit Allocation Committee, only 10 of every 32 project applications submitted
receive funding, meaning that keen competition exists for the available funding.
b.      State Programs
1)      CalHFA HELP Program: The City may be able to apply and obtain HELP funds
for purposes of contributing to the development of an affordable housing development.
Under this program, the City contracts to pay CalHFA and re-lends the monies to, for
example, a nonprofit housing group in order to make feasible the development of an
3-2                                                                          January 2010

SECTION 3                        PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER ACTIONS
affordable housing development. Attachment A explains more completely the CalHFA
HELP Program.
2)       Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Housing Program: Jointly administered by
the California Department of Mental Health and the California Housing Finance Agency
on behalf of counties, the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Housing Program offers
permanent financing and capitalized operating subsidies for the development of
permanent supportive housing, including both rental and shared housing, to serve
persons with serious mental illness and their families who are homeless or at risk of
homelessness. MHSA Housing Program funds will be allocated for the development,
acquisition, construction, and/or rehabilitation of permanent supportive housing.
According to CalHFA, California counties have committed an initial $400 million for the
programs. Applications for the program became available in August 2007. A county
mental health department can only submit applications; however, funds may be
distributed to qualified developers.
3)       Other Programs: The State has funding for a variety of housing programs. These
resources usually are one source of funding for affordable housing projects.
Experienced private and nonprofit developers frequently include State funding as one
piece of the total funding package.
As of July 1, 2006, the estimated HCD and CalHFA Proposition 46 funds (in millions)
that remained were:
         Emergency Housing Assistance Program                $62.4
         Multifamily Housing                                 $48.6
         Multifamily Housing – Supportive Housing            $59.8
         Workforce Housing Reward                            $23.0
         CalHFA Homeowner Programs                          $128.2
c.       Los Angeles County Community Development Commission
1)       CDC Funding Sources: The Los Angeles County Community Development
Commission administers several programs. The City obtains CDBG funding through the
County, not directly from HUD. Therefore, the City, as well as public service agencies
serving Hawaiian Gardens, is subject to the funding priorities established by the County
of Los Angeles.
One of the key resources for financing affordable housing is the HOME Investment
Partnerships Program, sponsored by HUD and administered by the Commission on
behalf of the County of Los Angeles.
HUD annually allocates HOME funds to the County. Approximately $5.5 million dollars
are made available annually for housing development, with 15% of these funds reserved
exclusively for use by non-profit Community Housing Development Organizations
(CHDOs).
HOME funds are awarded to proposed developments, based on proposals that are
submitted by developers and evaluated on a competitive basis. The funds are allocated

PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER ACTIONS                                        SECTION 3
only to developments in the unincorporated county areas and in 47 cities that participate
in the Commission’s Urban County Program. Hawaiian Gardens is a HOME-eligible city.
Other programs administered by the CDC include: Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC)
Program; Home Ownership Program (HOP), Southern California Home Financing
Authority (SCHFA), and Industry Housing Funds.
2)      Industry Housing Funds: Industry Housing Funds are a funding source that could
be combined with the City’s funds as well as the other funding sources described in this
part. The maximum amount available per Industry-assisted unit in an affordable rental
project is $60,000.
Only projects that lie within a 15-mile radius of the City of Industry can be funded under
the Industry Housing Fund Program. The entire City of Hawaiian Gardens is located
within the 15-mile boundary.
Proposed developments must meet the following requirements:
               Provide a minimum of four units of permanent residential housing.
               Consist of either new construction or acquisition with rehabilitation
                and must spend at least 15% of total development costs
                (excluding land) for rehabilitation. In addition, the minimum
                rehabilitation cost per unit must be at least $34,650/unit or
                $55/square foot and the rehabilitation work must include the
                replacement of at least two major building systems (e.g. new roof,
                plumbing, HVAC, electrical systems, etc.).
               Industry-assisted units are restricted to households with incomes
                at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI).
               The required term of the affordability covenant must be for at least
                55 years.
Proposers requesting funds for acquisition with rehabilitation activities are limited to
developments where pre-acquisition and rehabilitation rents for Industry-assisted units
do not meet the Industry Fund affordability requirements. Proposals must include a
financial plan showing post-rehabilitation rents reduced to those required for the Industry
Fund Program.
4.      Local Funding Sources
a.      Use of Redevelopment Agency Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund
Per State law, the Redevelopment Agency has set-aside 20% of its gross annual tax
increment into the Agency’s Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund. The purpose of
the LMI Fund is to increase, improve and preserve the City’s supply of low and
moderate-income housing. During the Housing Element planning period, the Fund is
project to have almost $12 million in deposits.
3-4                                                                             January 2010

SECTION 3                          PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER ACTIONS
Table 3-1 shows a projected fund balance of $6.9 million through FY 2009-2010. During
the balance of the planning period – four years from 2010 to 2014 – the Fund is
projected to accumulate $1,200,000+ per year, or about $5 million over four years.
Therefore, the total fund available is $11.9 million during the planning period.

              Total Estimated As Available                            $6,918,226
             Source: Table 5 of Implementation Plan for FY 2006-2007 through 2009-
             2010.
The Redevelopment Agency’s most recent Housing Implementation Plan allocated the
Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund to the following programs:
         Homebuyer Assistance                   $3,190,000
         Housing Rehabilitation                 $3,910,000
         Replacement/New Housing                $4,826,952
                                               $11,926,952
These three funding allocations will provide sufficient resources to permit the effective
implementation of each program component. The quantified objectives for each program
are based on these funding allocations. Therefore, the programs and anticipated
accomplishments are realistic and achievable during the planning period.
b.       City General Fund
The City’s General Fund annually contributes monies for the Housing Rehabilitation
Program. In the past two years, the City has contributed to this program $248,275 and
$327,698 from the General Fund. Given these past contributions, it is projected that the
General Fund would contribute $1,950,000 during the six-year planning period from
2006-2014. ($325,000 per year)

C.      RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES, GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY AND PUBLIC
        PARTICIPATION
Section 65583(c)(7) states:
        “The program shall include an identification of the agencies and officials
        responsible for the implementation of the various actions and the means
        by which consistency will be achieved with other general plan elements
        and community goals. The local government shall make a diligent effort
        to achieve public participation of all economic segments of the community

1.      Agencies and Officials Responsible for Implementation Actions
a.      Section 8 Rental Assistance – Hawaiian Gardens Housing Authority
The Hawaiian Gardens Housing Authority administers the Section 8 Rental Assistance
Payments Program. This program helps very low-income households to have monthly
rent payments within their means. The family or senior pays approximately 30% of
his/her income towards rent, and the Housing Authority pays the balance of the rent to
the property owner, who participates in the program on a voluntary basis.
Currently, the Housing Authority assists 108 families, seniors and disabled persons. The
income distribution of the assisted households is listed below:
        Extremely Low                  81 households
        Extremely Low                  23 households
        Low                             4 households
Of the assisted households, 60 are disabled and 62 are elderly.
b.      CDBG Program -- Los Angeles Community Development Commission
The CDC administers the CDBG program for the County and several incorporated cities.
The City’s Housing Division handles the day-to-day management of the Housing
Rehabilitation Program. On average, 20-25 rehabilitation loans/grants are processed
per year.
c.      Affordable Housing Development, Rehabilitation and Preservation –
        City Redevelopment Agency
The City’s Redevelopment Agency facilitates the new construction, rehabilitation and/or
preservation of affordable housing projects that support the following goals:
               Satisfy the replacement housing requirements of the Community
                Redevelopment Law as they relate to housing units, if any,
                displaced by Redevelopment Agency activities.

SECTION 3                         PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER ACTIONS
                Satisfy the inclusionary housing requirements of the Community
                 Redevelopment Law as they relate to the provision of affordable
                 housing as a percentage of any new or substantially rehabilitated
                 housing, which may be constructed within the Redevelopment
                 Project Area.
d.       Community Development Department
The Community Development Department ensures the orderly physical development of
the community by upholding the goals and policies of the City’s General Plan, including
the Housing Element. The Department oversees the following functions that relate to
implementation of the Housing Element:
         Planning Division
         Building & Safety Division
         Housing Division
General activities of the Department include:
         Administration of the City's land use regulations, including zoning, current
         and advance planning.
         Enforcement of the City’s Zoning Code and Building Codes; issuance of
         building permits, plan check services, building inspection services.
         Administration of the Section 8 Rental Assistance Program and Housing
         Rehabilitation Program.
2.       Consistency with other General Plan Elements and Community Goals
The Housing Element is being prepared concurrently with a comprehensive General
Plan Update and Zoning Code amendments. The Housing Element will be consistent
with the General Plan, as both will be adopted in January 2009. The sites inventory and
housing unit capacity are consistent with the Land Use Element (summer 2008).
3.       Public Participation of all Economic Segments of the Community
The City’s extensive public participation effort involved:
                Stakeholder Interviews
                2 Community Workshops
                City Council Public Workshop
                General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC) Public Meetings
                Interviews with Local Churches (for Housing Element)
                Interviews with Special Needs Agencies
As noted above, the City’s public participation effort included a GPAC. With respect to
income categories, the composition of the GPAC is entirely representative of the
community. The GPAC met frequently during the process of preparing the Draft Land
Use Element and Draft Housing Element.

PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER ACTIONS                                    SECTION 3
a.      GPAC and Resident Input
With regard to the Housing Element Update, the public participation effort provided the
following input:
        The City is too dense. Residential lots are too narrow.
        Several neighborhoods have homes situated on narrow and small lots.
        A large number of cars park on the street, making the neighborhood seem even
        more densely populated.
        Juan Street is a dense area.
        Monitor number of people in households.
        Absentee ownership high.
        Most of the residences in the City are tenant-occupied.
        Another senior citizen complex is needed in town.
        More low-income housing.
        There are too many illegal conversions.
        The City requires a pre-sale buyer inspection program. Escrow transactions
        cannot be completed without a City building inspection.
        There should be a priority on the Housing Code Enforcement Program
        The City should highlight a ‘House of the Month” to promote programs available
        for residences and highlight the improvements made.
        There is a waiting list for the Housing Rehabilitation Program.
b.      Role of the GPAC
During the development of the Draft Housing Element, the GPAC completed the
following tasks:
        Reviewed and discussed the housing needs assessment. The GPAC
        identified maintaining the quality of the existing housing stock as an
        important need. The GPAC also agreed that overpaying was a problem
        that significantly impacted low income families and seniors.
        Reviewed and evaluated the housing goals and policies of the prior
        Housing Element as well as possible goals and policies for the Draft
3-8                                                                        January 2010

SECTION 3                        PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER ACTIONS
         Housing Element. The GPAC ultimately agreed after workshop meetings
         on the goals and policies as contained in the Draft Housing Element.
         Reviewed and discussed existing and potential housing programs that
         could be included in the Draft Housing Element. The GPAC ultimately
         agreed after workshop meetings on the housing programs include in
         Section 4 of the Draft Housing Element. The GPAC encouraged the City
         to continue the Housing Rehabilitation Program, Code Enforcement and
         Section 8 Rental Assistance.
         The GPAC reviewed the entire Draft Housing Element at a workshop
         meeting. Ultimately, after discussion, the GPAC agreed on a Draft
         Housing Element that was subsequently transmitted to the State
         Department of Housing and Community Development.
         The GPAC will conduct one more public workshop before transmittal of
         the Draft Housing Element to the Planning Commission.
c.       Church Interviews
Survey interviews were conducted with five churches: Celebration Christian Center,
Church of Deliverance/International, Four Square Church, St. Peter Channel Catholic
Church and The Way Out Ministries. The purpose of the interviews was to gain insights
on services provided and views on housing needs including home repairs, rental
assistance, homelessness, and other related needs.
None of the churches provide direct homeless services. However, three are able to refer
homeless persons to emergency shelters and one occasionally pays for a night’s stay at
a local hotel.
Most of the churches stated that the high cost of rental housing was a problem. They
indicate that single-family rentals command a high rent, forcing individuals to live
together to pay the rent. One church observed that this situation results in overcrowded
living conditions.
Three churches mentioned special needs including the disabled and one-parent
households (as families break-up). One church indicated that few programs are available
for “those in the middle” (presumably 50-80% of the County median income).
The input of the churches provided a qualitative input on the housing needs assessment
(Technical Appendix A). In addition, the results of the church interviews were shared
with the GPAC as a basis for discussing the community’s housing needs. The interviews
helped the GPAC to identify possible goals and policies to address housing needs.
d.       Special Needs Agencies
Interviews were conducted with the Long Beach Multi Service Center and the Disabled
Resources Center. Both of these agencies are located in nearby Long Beach (1301
West 12th Street and 2750 East Spring Street). Each agency indicates that they serve
homeless persons whose last known address was located in Hawaiian Gardens.

PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER ACTIONS                                          SECTION 3
1)            Long Beach Multi Service Center: The MSC mission is to provide
comprehensive supportive services to the homeless and to promote progress towards
permanent housing, self-sufficiency, by creating a community where health, safety and
well-being are established. The MSC is operated by the City of Long Beach, Department
of Health and Human Services, with 14 co-located nonprofit agencies.
The MSC is designed to provide one-stop access to resources for individuals and
families experiencing homelessness. The MSC serves as the point of entry for
homeless services city-wide, providing a wide range of services from basic amenities of
shower, laundry, mail and message center, to street outreach, van shuttle transportation,
childcare, medical care, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, HIV/AIDS,
integrated case management and housing coordination.
2)       Disabled Resource Center: The Disabled Resource Center serves an area that
includes Long Beach, Lakewood, Hawaiian Gardens, Catalina, and Signal Hill. The
Center is one of 29 Independent Living Centers in California and it focuses on providing
tools for their clients to do things for themselves; for instance, assist in the SSI process.
They serve disabled persons of all ages and incomes. The Center indicated that it has
transitional funds to help the disabled move out of convalescent facilities or nursing
homes into permanent housing.
The input of the special needs agencies provided a qualitative input on the housing
needs assessment (Technical Appendix A) and on services provided. In addition, the
results of the interviews were shared with the GPAC as a basis for discussing the
community’s housing needs. The interviews helped the GPAC to identify possible goals
and policies to address housing needs.
e.       Summary of Public Participation Effort
The public participation effort provided input to the preparation of the Draft Housing
Element. The stakeholder interviews, resident input and GPAC input guided the
Housing Element’s focus on improving the existing housing stock and continuing code
enforcement and housing rehabilitation programs. The public recognized the challenges
to addressing affordable housing needs through new construction. However, the GPAC
supported the Redevelopment Agency’s efforts to address affordable housing needs.
Likewise, the GPAC supports the Housing Authority’s efforts to continue to assist
families, the elderly and disabled with Section 8 rental assistance.
Interviews with the local churches provide additional input on local needs. Moreover, the
interviews provide the City staff with information on the social services provided by the
churches as well as contacts for future program efforts.
The interviews of the Multi Service Center and Disabled Resources Center provided
information on the scope and nature of their services. The information will enable City
staff to refer persons in need to these agencies.

                                     CalHFA HELP Program
Unmet Affordable Housing Needs
HELP funds are intended to help local government entities address unmet affordable
housing needs as determined by each participating locality. Local government entities
must demonstrate how the local priority was established and approved. Commonly,
priorities are stated in Housing Elements, Consolidated Plans, or other documented
housing plans.
Loan Conditions and Repayment
HELP funds are available to a local government entity as an unsecured loan from
CalHFA for up to 10 years at 3.5% simple interest per annum, and carry minimal
restrictions and conditions. Repayment is backed by the general obligation of the local
government entity and is required, in full, no later than 10 years from the date a loan
agreement is executed. The local government entity shall assure and demonstrate that it
possesses full authority to enter into the loan agreement and to repay the loan under the
terms and conditions of the loan agreement.
Loan-to-Lender Format
Under this format, the local government entity contracts to repay CalHFA and re-lends or
otherwise utilizes the funds for its stated purposes. The local government entity does not
provide property or other resources as collateral.
Eligible housing activities under the program are as follows:
Multifamily Rental Housing. Rehabilitation and code enforcement programs; and
revolving loan programs to assist with site acquisition, predevelopment and construction
of projects; or financing to support the development of a specific project. (This housing
category accommodates shelters, special needs that include group homes, etc.)
Single-Family Ownership Housing. Rehabilitation and code enforcement programs,
revolving loan programs to assist with construction financing, and subordinate loan
programs for homebuyers. Please Note: The Agency’s new Residential Development
Loan Program (RDLP) provides financing for site acquisition and predevelopment
activities for infill housing; further information on this program can be found at CalHFA’s
website (www.calhfa.ca.gov). Additionally, HELP and RDLP cannot be accessed for the
same project, unless HELP is used exclusively to provide construction financing or
subordinate loans for the homebuyers of that project.

PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER ACTIONS                                     SECTION 3
HELP Program funds must be used to directly provide affordable housing units. Housing
units must be affordable for at least 10 years, with "affordable" being defined in the
context of the unmet housing needs and priorities of the locality. HELP Program funds
may not be used for technical assistance or administrative costs.
Local Government Involvement
Local government entities (e.g., city and county housing-related divisions and agencies,
and redevelopment agencies) must have a direct involvement with their programs. Local
government entity involvement can include financial contributions of Federal, State, and
local program funds, and contributions such as land write-downs, fee waivers, density
bonuses, and local agency program staffing and administration, and other similar
benefits.

A.       INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
Government Code Section 65583(c) requires that the City’s Housing Element Program:
               Identify actions that will be taken to make sites available during
                the planning period of the general plan with appropriate zoning
                and development standards and with services and facilities to
                accommodate that portion of the city’s share of the regional
                housing need for each income level that could not be
                accommodated on sites identified in the inventory.
               Assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs
                of low- and moderate-income households.
               Address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove
                governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and

PROGRAM CATEGORY #1:
ACTIONS TO MAKE SITES AVAILABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE RHNA
Section 65583(c)(1) states that the housing program must:
         “Identify actions that will be taken to make sites available during the
         planning period of the general plan with appropriate zoning and
         development standards and with services and facilities to accommodate
         that portion of the city’s … share of the regional housing need for each
         income level that could not be accommodated on sites identified in the
         inventory … without rezoning…
         “Sites shall be identified as needed to facilitate and encourage the
         development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels,
         including multifamily rental housing, factory-built housing, mobilehomes,
         housing for agricultural employees, supportive housing single-room
         occupancy units, emergency shelters, and transitional housing.”
         [emphasis added]
1.       Housing Need Summary
Through the Regional Housing Needs Assessment, SCAG has allocated a new housing
construction need to the City of 145 housing units:
         15 units for extremely low-income households
         20 units for very low-income households
         22 units for low-income households
         24 units for moderate-income households
         64 units for above moderate-income households
2.       Quantified Objectives
         22 units for lower-income housing units
         20 moderate-income housing units
         52 above moderate-income housing units
3.       Housing Programs
a.       Land Use Element Implementation
The City will implement the Land Use Element Update, which is scheduled for adoption
in June 2009. During the planning period, the City will implement the adopted residential
land use policies as contained in the Land Use Element. The Land Use Element guides
the development of 37 housing units on vacant sites, 30 housing units on mixed use
sites and 120 housing units on underutilized sites. (Nineteen housing units already have
been constructed during the planning period - 01/01/06 to 06/30/08. Four of the housing
units constructed in 2007 have, pursuant to a Development and Disposition Agreement,
a deed restriction indicating that for 45 years the property shall be designated for low
and moderate income households. The Redevelopment Agency provided a land value
write down in order to facilitate the affordability of the constructed units.)

b.       Regulatory Standards and Lot Consolidation Incentives
To facilitate and encourage lot consolidation, the City will establish a program of
incentives. The lot consolidation incentives will include one or more of the following
actions: fast tracking processing, fee waivers, financial assistance, rounding up to the
next unit when fractions are involved, Redevelopment Agency assistance to consolidate
lots, and other potential incentives.
c.       Mixed Use Incentives Program
The City will develop and implement a Mixed Use Incentives Program to encourage and
facilitate the development of housing at a minimum density of 20+ dwelling units per acre
on the mixed use sites identified in Technical Appendix D. The mixed use incentives will
include lot consolidation incentives such as density bonuses, reduced development
standards, fee deferrals, reductions or waivers; assistance through the Redevelopment
Agency in lot consolidation; and other incentives. Lot consolidation by Redevelopment
Agency is facilitated by the fact that the entire City is located within the Project Area.
d.       Zoning Code Amendments Program
The Zoning Code Amendments Program will achieve the goal of a variety of housing
types in order to implement new Housing Element Law requirements. In particular, this
Program is designed to satisfy all the requirements of SB 2, which the Governor signed
in mid-October 2007.
 1)      Emergency Shelters:      Government Code Section 65583(a)(4)(A) requires the
 City to identify –
         “… a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a
         permitted use without a conditional use permit or other discretionary
         permit. The identified zone or zones shall include sufficient capacity to
         accommodate the need for emergency shelter…. except that each local
         government shall identify a zone or zones that can accommodate at least
         one year-round emergency shelter.”
The City permits “emergency shelters” in the General Commercial (C-4) Zone. The
Zoning Code, however, does not define “emergency shelters” or establish development
standards to guide the siting of emergency shelters.
The City permits by right emergency shelters in the General Commercial (C-4) Zone.
Chapter 18.60.040 of the Zoning Code lists the uses permitted as a principal use in the
C-4 Zone and emergency shelters is included in that list. Therefore, the permit
processing of an emergency shelter in the C-4 Zone is the same as for all other
permitted use. The processing of an emergency shelter requires an administrative
approval and a site plan review and approval. The Community Development Director
can approve both the administrative and site plan approval.
The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority’s most recent count estimates 20
homeless persons in Hawaiian Gardens. There are eight vacant C-4 zoned sites located
along Carson Street and Norwalk Boulevard. The sites range in size from 7,871 to
4-6                                                                               January 2010

SECTION 4                                                               HOUSING PROGRAM
39,443 square feet. Therefore, there is sufficient capacity to accommodate 20 homeless
persons.
The City will amend the Zoning Code to add a clear definition of emergency shelters and
establish development standards. Government Code Section 65582(d) states:
          “’Emergency shelter’ has the same meaning as defined in subdivision (e)
         of Section 50801 of the Health and Safety Code.”
Health and Safety Code Section 50801(e) states:
         “’Emergency shelter’ means housing with minimal supportive services for
         homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a
         homeless person. No individual or household may be denied emergency
         shelter because of inability to pay.”

         “Emergency shelters may only be subject to those development and
         management standards that apply to residential or commercial
         development within the same zone except that a local government may
         apply written, objective standards that include all of the following:
         (i) The maximum number of beds or persons permitted to be served
         nightly by the facility.
         (ii) Off-street parking based upon demonstrated need, provided that the
         standards do not require more parking for emergency shelters than for
         other residential or commercial uses within the same zone.
         (iii) The size and location of exterior and interior onsite waiting and client
         intake areas.
         (iv) The provision of onsite management.
         (v)The proximity to other emergency shelters, provided that emergency
         shelters are not required to be more than 300 feet apart.
         (vi)The length of stay.
         (vii) Lighting.
         (viii) Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
2)       Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing: Identify in the Zoning Code that
transitional and supportive housing are considered a residential use of property. This
effort will include definitions consistent with State law, as well as development standards
for these residential uses.
HCD advises that transitional housing sites should be close to public services and
facilities, including transportation. HCD also states that development standards such as
parking requirements, fire regulations, and design standards should not impede the
efficient use of the site as transitional housing.
The Zoning Code will be amended in order to comply with all of the requirements of
Chapter 633, Statutes of 2007 (SB 2) and the Health and Safety Code by December
2009 or no later than one-year after adoption of the Housing Element. Government Code
Section 65583(a)(5) now states:
City of Hawaiian Gardens - Housing Element                                              4-7

HOUSING PROGRAM                                                                   SECTION 4
        “Transitional housing shall be considered a residential use of property
        and shall be subject only to those restrictions that apply to other
        residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone.”
HCD interprets this Section as follows:
        “SB 2 provides that transitional and supportive housing constitute a
        residential use. SB 2 requires zoning to treat transitional and supportive
        housing as a proposed residential use and subject only to those
        restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the
        same zone. For example, if the transitional housing is a multifamily use
        proposed in a multifamily zone, then zoning should treat the transitional
        housing the same as other multifamily uses proposed in the zone.
        “If jurisdictions do not explicitly permit transitional and supportive housing
        as previously described, the element must include a program to ensure
        zoning treats transitional and supportive housing as a residential use,
        subject only to those restrictions on residential uses contained in the
        same type of structure.”
Transitional and supportive housing in a single-family dwelling will be added as
permitted uses in the R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 zones. Transitional and supportive housing
in a multi-family structure will be added as a permitted use in the R-2, R-3 and R-4
Zones. This action will be implemented by an amendment to the Chapter 18.40 of the
Zoning Code – Uses Permitted in Residential Zones.
3)      Single-Room Occupancy Units: Identify in the Zoning Code the zones/sites
where single room occupancy units are permitted. This effort will include a definition of
SRO units consistent with State law as well as development standards for this residential
use; e.g., site area, unit size and occupancy, kitchen facilities, bathroom facilities,
parking, and management.
The City’s current definition of Single-Room Occupancy is:
        “A residential facility which is rented on a weekly or longer basis and
        which provides living and sleeping facilities for one or two persons per
        unit. Each unit contains a toilet and sink. Shower, kitchen, and laundry
        facilities may be shared.”
As noted, the action program will include a definition of SRO units consistent with the
Housing Element Law as well as development standards for this residential use; e.g.,
site area, unit size and occupancy, kitchen facilities, bathroom facilities, parking, and
management. The City’s action program will include a review of other city SRO
ordinances such as one adopted by the City of Santa Rosa.
According to the Santa Rosa ordinance, SROs “… are intended to provide opportunities
for the development of permanent, affordable housing for small households and for
people with special needs in proximity to transit and services, and to establish standards
for these small units.” Among the development standards are the following:
4-8                                                                              January 2010

SECTION 4                                                               HOUSING PROGRAM
         Density. A Single Room Occupancy Facility is not required to meet
         density standards of the General Plan.
         Unit size. An SRO unit shall have a minimum size of 150 square feet
         and a maximum of 400 square feet.
         Occupancy. An SRO unit shall accommodate a maximum of two
         persons.
         Bathroom. An SRO unit is not required to but may contain partial or full
         bathroom facilities. A partial bathroom facility shall have at least a toilet
         and sink; a full facility shall have a toilet, sink and bathtub, shower or
         bathtub/shower combination. If a full bathroom facility is not provided,
         common bathroom facilities shall be provided in accordance with the
         California Building Code for congregate residences with at least one full
         bathroom per floor.
         Kitchen. An SRO unit is not required to but may contain partial or full
         kitchen facilities. A full kitchen includes a sink, a refrigerator and a stove,
         range top or oven. A partial kitchen is missing at least one of these
         appliances. If a full kitchen is not provided, common kitchen facilities
         shall be provided with at least one full kitchen per floor.
         Closet. Each SRO unit shall have a separate closet.
         Code compliance. SRO units shall comply with all requirements of the
         California Building Code.
         Accessibility. All SRO units shall comply with all applicable accessibility
         and adaptability requirements. All common areas shall be fully
         accessible.
         Facility Management. An SRO Facility with 10 or more units shall
         provide on-site management. An SRO Facility with less than 10 units
         shall provide a management office on-site.
The SRO amendments will be accomplished by December 2009 or no later than one-
year after adoption of the Housing Element.
e.       Site Replacement/Maximum Density Program
In order to ensure that housing on the vacant, mixed use and underutilized sites/lots is
built at these maximum densities, the City will implement a site replacement policy
during the planning period. The site replacement policy is modeled after AB 2292 (Dutra)
(Government Code Section 65863). The City will proactively encourage and facilitate
the construction of housing on the vacant, underutilized and mixed use sites at the
maximum densities permitted. In the event a development application on a specific lot is
submitted to the Community Development Department for less than the maximum
density, the Director will encourage the applicant to construct housing at the maximum
density. If the applicant wants to proceed at a density lower than the maximum density,
then the City will identify a lot(s)/site(s) to replace the lower density with higher density

 HOUSING PROGRAM                                                                 SECTION 4
 housing. The higher density replacement lot/site could be accomplished through a re-
 zoning (R-3 to R-4), a density bonus or other means. The implementation of a
 replacement housing policy may require an amendment to the Housing Element.
 However, such a requirement cannot be determined at this time. Any action pertaining
 to the housing replacement policy will be reported in the Annual Housing Element
 Progress Report.
 PROGRAM CATEGORY #2:
 ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADEQUATE HOUSING TO MEET THE NEEDS
 OF EXTREMELY LOW-, VERY LOW-, LOW-, AND MODERATE- INCOME
 HOUSEHOLDS
Government Code Section 65583(c)(2) states that a housing program shall:
         “Assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of
         extremely low-, very low-, low- and moderate- income households.”
 The term “development” includes providing for affordability covenants in existing housing
 and construction of new affordable housing units.
 The City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program, which is described in another section, also
 contributes to “adequate housing” by helping to finance room additions that alleviate
 overcrowding.
 1.      Housing Need Summary
 Cost burden or overpayment is a major existing housing need. Overpaying is defined in
 terms of a percentage of the gross household income a household spends for housing
 including utilities. Overpaying for housing is also known as the housing cost burden.
 Thirty percent of gross household income is the standard affordability level. Severe
 overpaying occurs when households pay 50 percent or more of their gross income for
 housing.
 In 2000, an estimated 815 lower income renter households and 429 lower income
 owners were overpaying.
 2.      Quantified Objectives
 The 167 quantified objective combines the Housing Authority’s lease up rate of 127 and
 the 40 seniors assisted at the Hawaiian Terrace Apartments.
 The income distribution is as follows:
         Extremely Low                  100 (81 current + 19 future assisted families)
         Very Low                        63 (23 current + 40 at Hawaiian Terrace Apts.
         Low                              4 (current)
 4-10                                                                           January 2010

SECTION 4                                                          HOUSING PROGRAM
3.       Housing Programs
a.       Section 8 Rental Assistance (for Existing Cost Burdened Households)
The City’s Housing Authority annually receives from HUD $925,000 for purposes of
providing rental assistance payments. During the six-year period from 2008 to 2014, the
Housing Authority is projected to receive $5,550,000 from HUD to administer the
program.
A housing subsidy is paid to the landlord directly by the Hawaiian Gardens Public
Housing Authority on behalf of the households. The household then pays the difference
between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized by the
program. By law, the Housing Authority must provide 75% of its vouchers to applicants
whose incomes do not exceed 30% of the County median income.
Under the provisions of the Section 8 Rental Assistance Program, the tenant pays
approximately 30% of his/her income towards rent, and the Housing Authority pays the
balance of the rent to the property owner, who participates in the program on a voluntary
basis. HUD annually sets rent ceilings by bedroom size; the FY 2008 rent ceilings are:
         Bedrooms                      Maximum Monthly Rent
                0                              $863
                1                              $1,041
                2                              $1,300
                3                              $1,746
                4                              $2,101
b.       Redevelopment Agency Housing Plan
On June 27, 2007, the Redevelopment Agency adopted a housing plan to guide the use
of the Agency’s Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund. The time span covered by the
Redevelopment Agency’s Housing Plan coincides with the planning period of the
Housing Element. The Housing Plan identifies three housing efforts: rehabilitation;
homebuyer assistance; and replacement housing.
The Redevelopment Agency’s most recent Housing Implementation Plan allocated the
Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund to the following programs:
         Homebuyer Assistance                  $3,190,000
         Housing Rehabilitation                $3,910,000
         Replacement/New Housing               $4,826,952
                                              $11,926,952
These three funding allocations will provide sufficient resources to permit the effective
implementation of each program component. The quantified objectives for each program
are based on these funding allocations. Therefore, the programs and anticipated
accomplishments are realistic and achievable during the planning period.
Table 4-1 lists the quantified objectives of the Redevelopment Agency Housing Plan.

            Source: Table B-1, Redevelopment Agency Implementation Plan –
            2005-06 through 2009-10, adopted June 26, 2007. The Plan projected
            funding and programs through FY 2013-2014.
The “rehabilitation assistance” provides, where applicable, assistance in the conversion
of existing apartments into affordable housing to low- and moderate-income households.
This program, then, has the same purpose as the “Committed Assistance Program” that
is described on the next page.
In order to implement the “new housing” program, the Redevelopment Agency plans to
acquire privately owned lots and work with a private contractor to construct eight new
affordable housing units. This program is similar in purpose to programs that utilize City
owned surplus properties. However, the City has no surplus property. Therefore, the
Redevelopment Agency acquires parcels/lots and then provides incentives through land
value write downs. During the current planning period, four low/moderate income
housing units have been constructed through this program.
The Redevelopment Agency also plans to provide nine housing units by purchasing
homes and then providing zero interest mortgage reduction loans to income-qualified
families.
c.      Nonprofit Partnership Program
The City will develop a Nonprofit Partnership Program in order to promote housing for
low and moderate income households. The City will identify experienced nonprofit
housing developers by: 1) contacting surrounding HOME participating jurisdictions to
identify CHDOs (community housing development organizations); 2) contacting
surrounding cities to identify nonprofit developers of recently constructed affordable
housing developments and 3) contacting the Los Angeles Community Development
Commission to identify special needs housing developers. This action will be
accomplished three months following adoption of the Housing Element.
The City will then transmit a survey all nonprofit developers to determine the kinds of
affordable housing projects they believe could be implemented in the City. The
nonprofits would be asked to provide the City with their need for local funding (e.g.,
housing set-aside fund) and sources to leverage those funds. This action will be
accomplished six months following adoption of the Housing Element.
4-12                                                                         January 2010

The City then would work with one or more nonprofits to achieve an affordable housing
development. At this time, the precise nature and scope of the development cannot be
determined. A development would be identified and selected within 12 months of
Housing Element adoption.
d.       Programs for Extremely Low Income Households
The needs of extremely low income households are addressed within the framework of
the programs administered by the City, Housing Authority and Redevelopment Agency.
Each of these entities addresses the needs of low and moderate income households,
including extremely low income households. The quantified objectives for extremely low
income households are based on individual programs that address the existing and
future needs of extremely low income households. The programs and the corresponding
quantified objectives are listed below:
         New Construction                        2 housing units
         Housing Rehabilitation Program         14 housing units
         Section 8 Rental Assistance            19 additional families 100 total
         Mobile Home Park Preservation          10 households
         Housing Preservation                   68 households
PROGRAM CATEGORY #3:
ADDRESS AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE AND LEGALLY POSSIBLE, REMOVE
GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS TO THE MAINTENANCE, IMPROVEMENT AND
DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING
More specifically, Government Code Section 65583(c)(3) states that a housing program
must:
         “Address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove
         governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and
         development of housing, including housing for all income levels and
         housing for persons with disabilities.
         “The program shall remove constraints to, or provide reasonable
         accommodations for housing designed for, intended for occupancy by, or
         with supportive services for, persons with disabilities.”
1.       Housing Need Summary
The analysis of actual governmental constraints indicates that the City lacks a
“reasonable accommodation procedure.” In addition, the analysis revealed that the City
should revise its requirements for licensed residential care facilities.
2.       Quantified Objectives
No quantified objectives need to be set forth for the mitigation and/or removal of
governmental constraints.

3.      Housing Programs
a.      Adopt a Reasonable Accommodation Procedure
The Federal Departments’ of Justice (DOJ) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
as well as the California Attorney General all encourage cities to adopt a reasonable
accommodation procedure. For example, both the DOJ and HUD state that -
        “Local governments are encouraged to provide mechanisms for
        requesting reasonable accommodations that operate promptly and
        efficiently, without imposing significant costs or delays. The local
        government should also make efforts to insure that the availability of such
        mechanisms is well known within the community.”*
        *Joint Statement of the Department of Justice and the Department of Housing
        and Urban Development, Group Homes, Local Land Use, and the Fair Housing
        Act, August 18, 1999, page 4.
On May 15, 2001 the California Attorney General transmitted a letter to all local
governments advising the localities to consider adoption of a reasonable
accommodation procedure. In that letter, the Attorney General stated:
        “Both the federal Fair Housing Act (‘FHA’) and the California Fair
        Employment and Housing Act (‘FEHA’) impose an affirmative duty on
        local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e.,
        modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use
        regulations and practices when such accommodations ‘may be necessary
        to afford’ disabled persons ‘an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a
        dwelling.”
The Office of Attorney General pointed out that while a city may deny a disabled
applicant’s request from relief under variance or conditional use permit procedures, the
procedures may be insufficient to justify the denial when judged in light of the fair
housing laws’ reasonable accommodations mandate.
A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the
rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or
housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person
with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice.
The City’s Reasonable Accommodation Procedure Program will accomplish the
following within one year of the Housing Element adoption:
        Complete research on Federal and State laws and policies that require
        adoption of a reasonable accommodation procedure.
        Review and evaluate at least three to six reasonable accommodation
        procedures adopted by California cities.
        Conduct outreach with the disabled populations to review initial drafts of
        the procedure and gather input.
4-14                                                                           January 2010

SECTION 4                                                              HOUSING PROGRAM
         Process the reasonable accommodation procedure through a Zoning
         Code Amendment.
         Display brochures/flyers of the procedure at the Planning and Building
         Division counters.
         Advertise the procedure and application requirements on the City’s Website.
b.       Licensed Residential Care Requirements
California law requires that specific types of licensed facilities serving six or fewer
persons be treated for zoning purposes like single-family homes. The specific licensed
facilities are listed below:
         Intermediate care facilities for individuals who have developmental
         disabilities (Health and Safety Code Section 1267.8)
         Residential facilities for persons with disabilities and for abused children
         (Health and Safety Code Section 1566.3, and Welfare and Institution
         Code Section 5116)
         Residential care facility for the elderly (Health and Safety Code Section
         1569.87)
         Alcoholism and drug treatment facilities (Health and Safety Code Section
         11834.23)
         Residential facilities for persons with chronic life threatening illness
         (Health and Safety Code Section 1568.0831)*
         [*Law Offices of Goldfarb & Lipman, Between the Lines: A Question and Answer
         Guide on Legal Issues in Supportive Housing, 1999, pg. 110.]
Health and Safety Code Section 1566.3 states:
         “No conditional use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance
         shall be required of a residential facility which serves six or fewer persons
         which is not required of a family dwelling of the same type in the same
         zone.”
In addition, State law requires that residential care facilities not be defined within the
meaning of boarding house, rooming house, institution or home for the care of minors,
the aged, or the mentally infirm, foster care home, guest home, rest home, sanitarium,
mental hygiene home, or other similar term which implies that a residential facility is
business run for profit.
The City’s Zoning Code has definitions for two of these terms. Boarding House and
Rooming House have the same definition: “A structure used for residential purposes,
other than a hotel, with access provided through a common entrance to guest rooms that
have no cooking facilities, in which lodging and meals are provided for compensation.”

HOUSING PROGRAM                                                                   SECTION 4
The City now permits Community Care Facilities as a principal use in the four residential
zones. However, such facilities are subject to approval of a Minor Use Permit whereas
single-family uses are not. The requirement for a Minor Use Permit is inconsistent with
State law.
The Licensed Residential Care Zoning Code Revision Program that the City will
complete within one year of adoption of the Housing Element is described below:
        Identify by Code section the licensed residential care facilities that must
        be treated like single-family homes.
        Amend the MF zones to state that licensed group homes serving six or
        fewer persons are permitted by right with the same development
        standards as applied to single-family homes.*
        Include spacing or over concentration requirements for licensed group
        homes consistent with revisions to State law, if enacted, as
        recommended by the League of California cities.
        [*If single-family homes are permitted in the MF zones, then residential
        care facilities also need to be permitted.
        “…a licensed group home serving six or fewer residents must be a
        permitted use in all residential zones in which a single-family home is
        permitted with the same parking requirements, setbacks, design
        standards, and the like. No conditional use permit, variance, or special
        permit can be required for these small group homes unless the same
        permit is required for single-family homes, nor can parking standards be
        higher, nor can special design standards be imposed.” [emphasis added]
        [Barbara Kautz, Goldfarb & Lipman LLP, Select California Laws Relating to
        Residential Recovery Facilities and Group Homes, pg. 2, (presented at the
        Residential Recovery Facilities Conference, Newport Beach, March 2, 2007)]
The purpose of this program is to explicitly identify in the City’s Zoning Code the licensed
residential facilities that must be a permitted use in all residential zones in which a
single-family home is permitted. This revision to the Zoning Code removes ambiguity on
the types of facilities that must not require a conditional use permit or variance.
c.      Revisions to Parking and Housing Unit Size Requirements
The City will develop and implement a program to reduce parking standards and
minimum unit sizes for affordable and special needs housing. For example, applicants
could submit parking reductions for housing for the physically and developmentally
disabled. For affordable housing addressing senior and special needs households, the
minimum housing unit size could be reduced. The current minimums are:
        Efficiency apartment             450 square feet
        1-bedroom unit                   750 square feet
        2+ bedroom unit                  950 square feet
4-16                                                                             January 2010

SECTION 4                                                           HOUSING PROGRAM
The City’s parking standards are established in Chapter 18.50.010. As part of the Zoning
Code amendments currently underway (June 2009), the City will complete revisions to
the parking standards and requirements in order to facilitate and encourage the
development of higher densities on multifamily and mixed use sites for affordable
housing and for special needs populations such as the elderly, frail elderly, and disabled.
The Zoning Code amendments will study the following revisions:
          x   Reductions in the number of spaces required for affordable and senior
              housing projects, provided that it can be demonstrated that the occupants of
              the housing will own fewer cars than the current Zoning Code standards
              anticipated.
          x   Reductions in the number of parking spaces required for disabled persons
              such as the physically and developmentally disabled provided that the
              owners demonstrate that there will be reduced or no parking requirements.
              (The developmentally disabled usually do no possess driver’s licenses.)
          x   Reductions in the parking spaces for Single Room Occupancy housing units
              which is typically housing designed for occupancy for one person.
          x   Allowances for “shared parking” in mixed use development projects
              comprised of residential and commercial components that will not have peak
              parking demands at the same time.
This program will be initiated by December 2009. Implementation of the recommended
changes to the Zoning Code, as appropriate, will be completed by June 2010.
PROGRAM CATEGORY #4:
CONSERVE AND IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF THE EXISTING STOCK OF
AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Government Code Section 65583(c)(4) states that a housing program shall describe
actions to:
         “Conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing
         stock, which may include addressing ways to mitigate the loss of dwelling
         units demolished by public and private actions.”
1.       Housing Need Summary
The prior Housing Element estimated 770 housing units were need of rehabilitation –
450 were in need of paint-up/fix-up, 280 were in need of minor or moderate repairs and
40 were in need of major repairs. Since 2000, homeowners on their own as well through
the City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program have made improvements to the housing
stock. In addition, the City’s code enforcement actions have resulted in repairs and
improvements to existing housing.
Taking into account the home improvements made since 2000, and that some housing
units have declined in quality during the past seven years, the current estimate is that
600 housing units are in need of rehabilitation.
2.       Quantified Objectives
City of Hawaiian Gardens - Housing Element                                             4-17

HOUSING PROGRAM                                                                  SECTION 4
The quantified objectives include:
         Housing code enforcement at an average level of 500 new cases per year
         for all income levels during the 2006-2014 program period.
         Rehabilitation of 120 units during the 2006-2014 program period -- 14
         occupied by extremely low-, 44 occupied by very low- and 62 occupied by
         low-income households.
3.       Housing Programs
a.       Housing Code Enforcement
The City will continue to implement – during the program period -- a Housing Code
Enforcement Program. The program is implemented on a complaint basis. The City
staff inspects the properties and notices are given to the property owners having code
violations. The latter may include violations of the Fire, Building, and Zoning Codes, the
State Vehicle Code, and the State and County Public Health Codes. This Program
warns homeowners against converting a garage to a room addition.
This program effort is funded, in part, by CDBG funds that the City’s receives as part of
the Urban County program. According to the County’s Action Plan, the code
enforcement activity provides funds for the enforcement of codes as they relate to
residential properties in the predominately low and moderate income census tracts of the
City of Hawaiian Gardens. The program supplements the Housing Rehabilitation
Program through referral of substandard properties for correction of code violations.
b.       Housing Rehabilitation Program
This Housing Rehabilitation Program helps lower income homeowners (<80% of area
median income) to finance improvements and repairs such as roofing, plumbing,
heating, windows, flooring, electrical systems, painting, remodels, energy conservation,
and bedroom additions to relieve overcrowded living conditions.
Financing options include deferred loans, low interest loans, rebates and grants:
         Deferred loans are available for elderly and disabled households.
         Low interest loans are available for all other income eligible households.
         50% rebates up to maximum of $5,000.
         Grants up to a maximum of $5,000.
During the six-year planning period, it is estimated that $2,400,000 of CDBG and
General Fund monies will be allocated to this program. Due to the high cost of
construction, the City Council in 2006 amended the program guidelines to increase the
financial assistance from $35,000 to $50,000 per project. The increase was done in an
effort to eliminate the financial burden on program applicants.
4-18                                                                            January 2010

SECTION 4                                                            HOUSING PROGRAM
The quantified objective of 120 rehabilitated housing units is based on the assumption
that the average per project funding will be $20,000. The income distribution is based on
that of lower income homeowners, as listed below.
                                        Percent        Number of Rehabilitated
              Income Group           Distribution                 Housing Units
              Extremely Low                11.5%                             14
              Very Low                     36.6%                             44
              Low                          51.9%                             62
As noted above, the Housing Rehabilitation Program provides financial resources for
bedroom additions to alleviate overcrowded conditions.
c.       City Beautification Program
The Program serves to eliminate the appearance of blight, enhance the City of Hawaiian
Gardens neighborhoods, increase property values and bring properties into compliance
with the Municipal Code. The program will provide financial assistance of up to $10,000
to residentially zoned and utilized properties, containing up to two residential units for the
cost of exterior improvements. The annual budget for this program is $200,000.

PROGRAM CATEGORY #5
PROMOTE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL PERSONS
Section 65583(c)(5) requires that the housing program:
         “Promote housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race,
         religion, sex, marital status, ancestry, national origin, color, familial status,
         or disability.”
1.       Housing Need Summary
In California, it is illegal to discriminate in housing against anyone because of race, color,
ancestry, religion, sex, marital status, disability, national origin, familial status, sexual
orientation or source of income. The Fair Housing Foundation, which serves the South
Bay communities including the City of Hawaiian Gardens, has received and processed
more than 4,000 housing discrimination complaints since 1995.
2.       Quantified Objectives
The quantified objectives are:
         50 General Housing Counseling/Resolutions
         10 Inquiries
          5 Cases
3.       Housing Programs
a.       Fair Housing Services
During the program period, the City will continue to provide Fair Housing Services
through its participation in the County’s CDBG Program. The City, in cooperation with
the County and the Fair Housing Foundation, will continue to make available fair housing
services to its residents. The services described below will be available to City residents.
General housing counseling/resolutions involves Landlord/Tenant Counseling. The Fair
Housing Foundation counsels landlord and tenants on their rights and responsibilities.
The Housing Counselors counsel each client initially to determine if any fair housing
violations have occurred. The client then receives information on the resolution
available for their specific concerns. Some examples of the housing issues are eviction,
rent increases, notices, and habitability.
Clients make inquiries in regard to possible discrimination. Counselors work with the
clients to determine if the inquiries pertain to landlord/tenant issues or discrimination.
Following inquiries, cases are opened when the information gathered through the
counseling and inquiry phase substantiates possible discrimination based on state and
federal law.
In order to assist the Fair Housing Foundation in its efforts, the City does the following:
4-20                                                                                 January 2010

         Provides flyers on the Foundation’s programs and services.
         Provides booklets on Landlord/Tenant laws and rights.
         Makes available City offices for fair housing workshops.
b.       Fair Housing Information Program
During the program period, the City will implement a Fair Housing Information Program.
The City will assemble fair housing information and make it available on the City’s
Website. The information may include, but will not be limited, to:
         Summary of Federal and State Fair Housing Laws.
         List of agencies where housing discrimination complaints may be filed.
         Information on fair housing accessibility guidelines.
The City will make information available on its Website and provide links to additional
resources such as the following:
                                 Reasonable Accommodations
Link to the State Department of Fair Employment and Housing’s (DFEH) six-minute
video on reasonable accommodations for tenants.
http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/fairHousingVideo.aspx
                       Fair Housing Information for New Developments
New multi-family housing with four or more units in a building, in the vast majority of
cases, must meet the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act:
         Accessibility Requirements for Buildings -

PROGRAM CATEGORY #6:
PRESERVE LOWER INCOME ASSISTED HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS
Section 65583(c)(6) mandates that the housing program shall do the following:
         "Preserve for lower income households the assisted housing
         developments . . . The program for preservation of the assisted housing
         developments shall utilize, to the extent necessary, all the available
         federal, state, and local financing and subsidy programs… except where
         a community has other urgent needs for which alternative funding
         sources are not available. The program may include strategies that
         involve regulation and technical assistance."
1.       Summary of Housing Needs
The City has one assisted multifamily rental-housing complex. Hawaiian Gardens,
located at 11950 Centralia Road, is a multifamily rental housing complex receiving
financial assistance via the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program and Section 8
rental assistance. Hawaiian Gardens is a “large family” complex having a total of 264
housing units of which 211 are low income – 173 2-bedroom and 38 3-bedroom units.
Rental units with long-term affordability requirements and expiration dates prior to 2016
are considered to be potentially “at-risk.” The California Housing Partnership Corporation
indicates that the Hawaiian Gardens Apartments are at risk because the Section 8
contract expires on April 30, 2008. Currently, 179 households/housing units receive
Section 8 assistance. An additional 32 lower income households have rents at the Low
Income Housing Tax Credit levels.
Private owners of assisted multifamily housing complexes who are no longer considering
providing rent restrictions and converting restricted units to market rate units must notify
HCD. The Hawaiian Garden owners (Hawaiian Gardens Housing Partners L.P.) have
not filed a 12-month or 6-month notice with HCD, the City, or qualified entities (i.e.,
preservation purchasers).
2.       Quantified Objectives
         Preserve 211 low-income rental housing units at the Hawaiian Gardens
         apartment complex.
         Preserve 68 extremely low income housing units at the Hawaiian Gardens
         apartment complex. [The 68 are a part of the 211 stated in the first objected.]
         Preserve 10 extremely low income housing units located in the City’s mobile
         home parks.
3.       Housing Preservation Program
As a resource for preservation, the Community Development Department will implement
the following technical assistance activities during the 2008-2009 time period:
City of Hawaiian Gardens - Housing Element                                               4-23

HOUSING PROGRAM                                                                 SECTION 4
        Evaluation of the legal and procedural framework for preservation of at
        risk units.
        Determination of the feasibility of an entity acquiring and preserving the
        units at risk of conversion.
        Analysis of Federal, State and local financial incentives available to deter
        the conversion and assist with the acquisition and preservation of units at
        risk of conversion.
        Estimates of the amounts local funding resources that could be dedicated
        to housing preservation, including Redevelopment Agency Low and
        Moderate Income Housing Fund, Hawaiian Gardens Section 8 rental
        assistance funds, Industry Housing Funds, and Los Angeles County
        Community Development Commission HOME funds
The City has identified local and sub-regional nonprofit housing corporations capable of
owning and managing the assisted housing developments. The City also has the list of
nonprofits compiled by HCD.
The above-noted information will be used to maintain an inventory of qualified nonprofit
housing organizations capable of owning and managing an affordable rental housing
development.
During calendar year 2009, the City will meet with nonprofit housing corporations having the
capacity to acquire and manage the at-risk housing. The meetings will have the purpose of
devising a strategy to preserve the assisted housing at risk of conversion to market rate
housing. At a minimum, the City will meet with the following nonprofit housing corporations:
        A Community of Friends
        LINC Housing
        Long Beach Affordable Housing Coalition
        Los Angeles Community Design Center
In the event that the Section 8 rental assistance contracts are not renewed, the City will
implement a program to facilitate the preservation of the affordable rental housing. This
program will involve the efforts of the City’s Community Development Department,
Redevelopment Agency and Housing Authority.
The program will focus on making rental assistance available to households and/or
housing units that will lose their Section 8 rental assistance payments. The financing
alternatives will encompass one or more of the following funding sources:
Home Investment Partnership Act (County HOME Funds)
To the extent permissible under federal regulations, the City is prepared to assist a non-
profits application for County HOME funds. The use of this resource would require
inclusion of a program description for preservation during the fiscal year in which
assistance is anticipated. HOME funding is expected to continue during planning period
but is based on congressional and executive action and is therefore not guaranteed.

Community Development Block Grant (County CDBG Funds)
The City of Hawaiian Gardens is not an entitlement City, but participates in the County
program. Typically, areas receiving financial assistance include housing rehabilitation;
public service; public facilities improvements; citizen participation; and administration.
Given the priority established in legislation for the preservation of affordable housing
losing subsidies and restrictions, it is fair to assume that the CDBG program will allow
financing to be used to preserve units at risk of conversion. Therefore, this funding
source could be accessed to preserve units at risk.
Rental Section 8 Certificates and Rental Vouchers
Through the City's Housing Authority with funding provided by the federal government,
certificates and vouchers are provided to low-income families and individuals. The
Housing Authority may direct, to the extent permitted by law, rental certificates and
vouchers towards preserving units at risk of conversion.
Housing Set-Aside Funds
The Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency operates a housing set-aside program.
This housing fund is an appropriate and allowable source of funds to preserve units at
risk of conversion. The Implementation Plan Housing Component guides the use of the
Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund. During the course of updating his Plan, the
City will include housing preservation as a key priority.
Section 8 Operating Reserve
The Housing Authority receives administrative funds to implement the Section 8
program. When a Housing Authority is well managed at an administrative cost less than
the amount received from HUD, the Housing Authority may retain the excess amount in
an operating reserve account. A minimum balance is required, but at certain times the
Housing Authority may utilized the excess reserve for affordable housing.
A second effort is the preservation of mobilehome parks. The City has a Mobilehome
Park Zone that has been applied to two parks. Chapter 18.40.060 states the purpose of
this zone.
         “The purpose of the mobilehome park zone (MHP) zone is to preserve existing
         mobilehome park sites, consistent with the city’s goals of accommodating
         alternative housing types…”
Through this zoning, the City preserves affordable housing for at least 10 extremely low
income households.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX A                                    HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Purpose
Technical Appendix A provides estimates and projections on the City’s housing needs,
as those needs are defined by the State housing law. In addition to serving as a
beginning point for looking at the community’s housing needs, Technical Appendix A
also serves the following functions:
                Benchmark data to track trends later in this decade.
                Establish a community “housing” profile.
                Meet the requirements of the Housing Element Law.
                Quantify the “need” among different population groups.
                Provide a shared understanding of the nature and scope of
                housing needs.
                Provide information helpful to setting priorities.
Housing Needs Summary
Chart A-1 shows the three housing need categories and the specific needs included in
each category.
Chart A-2 summarizes the housing needs data in regard each category that Chart A-1
displays.
The balance of Technical Appendix A explains in more detail each “need” category.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX A                                    HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
A.       INTRODUCTION
According to State law, Hawaiian Gardens’ Housing Element must contain:
         1.     An analysis and documentation of household characteristics,
                including level of payment compared to ability to pay, housing
                characteristics, including overcrowding, and housing stock
                condition.
         2.     An analysis of existing assisted housing developments that are
                eligible to change from low-income housing uses during the next
                10 years due to termination of subsidy contracts, mortgage
                prepayment, or expiration of restrictions on use.
         3.     An analysis of any special housing needs, such as those of the
                elderly, persons with disabilities, large families, farmworkers,
                families with female heads of households, and families and
                persons in need of emergency shelter.
         4.     An analysis of population and employment trends and
                documentation of projections and a quantification of the locality’s
                existing and projected housing needs for all income levels. These
                existing and projected needs shall include the locality’s share of
                the regional housing need in accordance with Section 65584.
Consistent with the State housing law, Chart A-2 lists the “needs” that comprise the
City’s Housing Needs Assessment:
                Existing Housing Needs
                Special Housing Needs
                Projected Housing Needs

HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT                                     TECHNICAL APPENDIX A
B.      HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS AND EXISTING HOUSING NEEDS
Part B includes data and analysis on:
                Housing and Household Characteristics – for example, the
                existing housing stock and household incomes.
                Overpaying – for example, lower income households who are cost
                burdened because housing costs exceed 30% of their income.
                Overcrowding – too many people living in a home.
                Condition of the housing stock – for instance, the need to
                rehabilitate or replace existing dwellings.
1.      Housing and Household Characteristics
Part B 1 provides a “profile” of some key housing and household characteristics. This
part includes information on –
                Existing Housing Stock
                Housing Types Occupied by Owners and Renters
                Vacant Housing Units
                Year Householders Moved into Unit
                Household Income by Tenure
                2007 Household Income Groups
                City Household Income Groups
a.      Existing Housing Stock
About 3,700 dwellings comprise the City’s housing stock. Table A-1 shows that about
four of every 10 housing units are single-family detached structures. These homes are
primarily located in two neighborhoods. The boundaries of the first neighborhood are
Carson Street, Pioneer Boulevard, Norwalk Boulevard, 226th Street and the City’s
southern limits. The boundaries of the second neighborhood are 221st Street, Norwalk
Boulevard, 226th Street, and Wardham Avenue.
About one of every eight dwellings are attached single-family homes. These units are
primarily located at the Parkside Townhomes community located at 214th Street and
Norwalk Boulevard.
Multi-family units comprise one of every four dwellings. The multi-family housing is
mainly located in the apartment communities of Hawaiian Gardens (along Centralia
Road) and Cypress Garden Villas (along Bloomfield Avenue).
Mobile homes comprise an important segment of the housing stock. The City has two
mobile home communities – Lakewood Mobile Estates (Carson Street and Bloomfield
Avenue) and Bloomfield Mobile Home Park (south of Carson Street along Bloomfield
Avenue).
                                                                          January 2010

b.       Housing Types Occupied by Owners/Renters
Census 2000 reports 3,509 occupied housing units – 1,584 owners and 1,925 renters.
The housing types occupied by owners and renters, as of 2000, are presented in Table
A-2. The percentage figures in the table represent the percentage of housing units of
that type that are occupied by owners or renters. For example, 64.5% of the occupied
single-family detached structures are owner-occupied while 35.5% are renter occupied.

Table construction by Castañeda & Associates
In 2000, the vast majority of owners lived in single-family detached housing units (950)
and mobile homes (227). In fact, about 14% of all owners occupy mobile home units.
Renters live in all housing types; however, the largest numbers reside in single-family
detached and attached units.

c.       Vacant Housing Units
Three percent of the housing units were vacant at the time of Census 2000. Table A-3
indicates the vacant units by housing type. There was a very low vacancy rate (1.1%)
among single-family homes, which may be the consequence of a high demand from both
owners and renters. The highest vacancy rates occur in structures having three to four
units and duplexes. Stated differently, the City had a scant 107 vacant housing units
when Census 2000 was taken. The State Department of Finance’s Demographic
Research Unit estimates 119 vacant units and a 3.2% vacancy rate as of January 1,
2007.

d.       Year Householder Moved to Unit
Another characteristic of interest is how recently householders have moved to their
Hawaiian Gardens housing unit. Table A-4 on the next page shows that as of April
2000, 68.3% of all owners had moved to their unit prior to 1995. By comparison, 36.4%
of all renters had moved to their unit prior to 1995.
The data indicate that owners have been residents of Hawaiian Gardens for a longer
period of time than renters. However, it must be noted that the data does not mean that
36.4% of all renters actually moved to Hawaiian Gardens between 1995 and 2000.
Indeed, some may have moved from one unit in Hawaiian Gardens to another one in the
City after 1995.
                                                                            January 2010

e.       Household Income -- 2000
Lower income renter households, to a higher degree than owners, experience many of
the housing needs addressed by the Housing Element Law, such as overpaying,
overcrowding and living in substandard housing. Therefore, communities having a
majority of renter households also will have more housing needs than communities
where owners predominate.
In Hawaiian Gardens, owners occupy about 45% of the housing and renters occupy
55%. Table A-5 presents data on household income by tenure. A little more than one
third of all renters had household incomes of less than $20,000 per year. Households in
this income category can afford a maximum of $500 per month on housing costs, based
on the 30% of income standard.

A way to measure basic income changes is the median household income in 1999 --
$34,500 -- and 1989 -- $29,510. The median household income increased by 17%
during the period between the 1990 and 2000 Census’. The income percentage gains
are far less than the increases in the cost of existing homes and condominiums that the
City experienced in the same period.
f.      Household Income Groups -- 2007
By way of background, the Housing Element Law defines five income groups based on
increasing percentages of the median income of Los Angeles County. Chart A-3 defines
each income group.

g.       Hawaiian Gardens’ Income Groups
At this time, data are unavailable on the numbers of owners and renters in each group –
extremely low-, very low-, low- and moderate-income. Table A-8 – which bases the
income groups on Census 2000 – reveals that 54% of the households have annual
incomes less than the “low” level and that 46% have annual income above that
threshold. Because the majority of households rent their dwelling, the community’s
housing needs – as defined by the Housing Element Law – are likely to be affecting a
high percentage of renters.

2.      Overpaying
a.      Guidelines
In comparing level of payment with ability to pay, the number of lower-income
households (those at or below 80 percent of the median income) who are overpaying for
housing should be quantified by tenure (owner/renter).
Overpaying is defined in terms of a percentage of the gross household income a
household spends for housing including utilities. Overpaying for housing is also known
as the housing cost burden. Thirty percent of gross household income is the standard
affordability level. Severe overpaying occurs when households pay 50 percent or more
of their gross income for housing. The element should estimate the number of lower-
income households paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing and the
number of households who pay 50 percent or more of their gross income for housing.
[emphasis added]
(The italicized text is guidance provided by the State of California Department of Housing and
Community Development in Housing Element Questions and Answers, October 2006.)
b.      Analysis
When housing costs exceed the ability to pay, other family needs are sacrificed – health
care, childcare, food, insurance, transportation, for example. Therefore, the most serious
problem confronting lower income households often is paying more than they really can
afford for housing. “Need” is quantified separately for lower income renter and owner
households because owners have more financial options (e.g., reverse mortgages) than
renters, and monthly cost assistance to owners is usually unavailable from governmental
sources.
c.      Housing Need Estimates
1)      Renter Households: Table A-9 shows Census 2000 data on gross rent as a
percentage of income for 1,837 renter households. An estimated 876, or 47.7%, of all
renter households paid 30% or more of their income on rent. An estimated 408, or about
22%, of all renters paid 50% or more of their income on rent.

By comparison, 46.5% of all renters in 1989 paid 30% or more of their income on gross
rent. Comparable 1990 severe overpaying (50%+) percentages are unavailable as the
data was reported only for those paying 35% or more of their income on rent. The rate of
overpaying among all renters, then, has slightly increased between 1990 and 2000.
In 2000, overpaying was adversely affecting just over 800 lower income renter
households. Table A-10 shows that “small related” renter households comprise more
than one half of the lower income renter households.

The meanings of the four household types are:
         Elderly: A one or two person household in which the head of the
         household or spouse is at least 62 years of age.
         Small Related: A household of 2 to 4 persons that includes at least one
         person related to the householder by blood, marriage, or adoption.
         Large Related: A household of 5 or more persons that includes at least
         one person related to the householder by blood, marriage, or adoption.
         Other: A household of one or more persons that does not meet the
         definition of a small related, large related, elderly, or special populations
         household. This category includes all households with only unrelated
         individuals present except those qualifying as elderly or special
         populations households.

Many overpaying renters probably live in single-family homes rather than apartments
because:
                42% of all renters occupy single-family homes (see Table A-2)
                Hawaiian Gardens is a 264-unit apartment community of which
                211 unit are rent-restricted – Section 8 or tax credit rents
2)      Owner Households: Housing costs as a percentage of income were calculated
for 612 specified owner-occupied housing units. According to the U.S. Census Bureau:
        “Owner costs are the sum of payments for mortgages, deeds of trust,
        contracts to purchase, or similar debts on the property; real estate taxes;
        fire, hazard, and flood insurance; utilities; and fuels and, where
        appropriate, the monthly condominium fee.
Table A-11 shows that in 2000 429 lower income owners were overpaying. The
household type characteristics of overpaying owners differ from the renters. The largest
groups of overpaying owners are “large families” and “elderly” households.

Although the causes of overpaying are uncertain, they could be due to added debt from
equity lines of credit, higher energy costs, loan approvals with housing debt-to-income
ratios exceeding 30%, and unemployment.
Severe overpaying (50% or more of income) affects more lower income renters (403)
than owners (222). However, 52% of all lower income owners are severely cost
burdened compared to 49% of the lower income renters.
                                                                               January 2010

d.       Conclusions and Findings
In summary, overpaying is often cited as one of the major problems confronting the
lower income households. In Hawaiian Gardens more renters than owners are cost
burdened. The City’s Housing Authority has for many years provided Section 8 rental
assistance to more than 100 lower income families, seniors and disabled persons. In
addition to the Housing Authority’s efforts, the Section 8 program assists lower
households residing in two affordable apartment communities (large family and senior).

a.       Guidelines
The Census defines an overcrowded unit as one occupied by 1.01 persons or more per
room (excluding bathrooms and kitchens). Units with more than 1.5 persons per room
are considered severely overcrowded. Localities are to estimate the number of
households that live in overcrowded and severely overcrowded units. This incidence of
overcrowding and large households frequently parallel.
An example of overcrowding is an eight-room home: three bedrooms, a living room, a
dining room, a kitchen and two bathrooms. If six persons live in the home, it would be
considered overcrowded (six persons divided by five habitable rooms = 1.2 persons per
room).
b.       Analysis
Overcrowding is one result of the shortage of interior living space. Overcrowding reflects
the financial inability of households to buy or rent housing units having enough space for
their needs. Consequently, overcrowding is considered a household characteristic
(instead of a housing structural condition). An "overcrowded" housing unit does not
necessarily imply one of inadequate physical condition; rather, with fewer persons it
becomes "uncrowded". Overcrowding also may be a temporary situation since some
households will move to larger housing units to meet space requirements.
Overcrowding emerges when households initially move into a unit or overtime. Changes
in household size and composition also can lead to overcrowded conditions. If these
conditions are serious enough, households can move to housing units with enough
space to accommodate family changes. However, financial constraints can prevent
them from moving to larger housing.
For owners, who have ties to neighborhoods, schools and local churches, moving to
another home may not be considered a practical choice. Instead, they can adjust their
lifestyle, or if incomes allow, make physical additions to their home. For renters, making
physical changes to their apartment is not possible. Although renters have a higher
mobility rate than owners, financial constraints can limit their ability to move to housing
with enough space to meet their needs.
c.       Housing Need Estimates
Table A-12 shows that in 2000 overcrowding was affecting 45 of every 100 households.
Overcrowding – in terms of both numbers and percentages – is more of a problem for

renters than owners. For instance, of the 1,600 overcrowded households 1,000 were
renters and 600 were owners. In addition, a higher percentage of renters (35.7%) were
severely overcrowded as compared to owners (27.0%).

d.      Conclusions and Findings
Since 1990, both the number and percentage of overcrowded households has
increased. The number of overcrowded households has increased by 262 renter and
owners while the percentage increased from 46.3% to 51.2%.
The increases in the number and percentage of overcrowded owners and renters could
be due to rising rental costs and home prices that cause households to double-up in
order to bring housing costs closer to their ability to pay. Particularly noteworthy is that
more than one third of all renters were severely overcrowded.
3.      Condition of the Existing Housing Stock
a.      Guidelines
The element should include an analysis of the condition of the housing stock including
an estimate of the total number of substandard units (e.g., those in need of
rehabilitation/repair) and those in need of replacement (demolition). The number of units
to be rehabilitated and/or replaced may be estimated from a recent (within the last five
years) windshield survey or sampling, estimates from the local building department,
knowledgeable builders/developers in the community, nonprofit housing developers or
organizations and redevelopment agencies. Estimates can also be derived from census
data such as percentage of units built before 1960, which can serve as an estimate of
the maximum rehabilitation need.
b.      Analysis
There are differences between housing stock condition and housing improvement
needs. The term "condition" refers to the physical quality of the housing stock; for
instance, “fair” or “poor” condition. Housing improvements, on the other hand, refer to
the nature of the "remedial" actions necessary to correct defects in housing conditions
such as demolition, minor repairs, major repairs and rehabilitation.
                                                                               January 2010

TECHNICAL APPENDIX A                                     HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
A general indicator of housing adequacy is the age of housing. Generally speaking, for
owners, the dilemma often is one of maintenance problems. For these households, low
incomes mean a lack of money for maintenance and repairs. For rental properties, the
rents collected may not result in a cash flow sufficient to catch up to needed
maintenance and replacement.
In general, there is a relationship between the age of the housing stock and the
prevalence of poor housing conditions. For instance, the older a home, the greater is
the need for maintenance, repair and/or replacement of key mechanical systems.
Housing condition problems frequently are concentrated in the interior deficiencies.
Generally, two to three times as many units have interior problems as units with exterior
problems.
c.       Housing Need Estimates
1)       Rehabilitation Needs: Table A-13 shows the Census 2000 estimates on the age
of the housing stock. Seven years have been added to each “age” interval to
approximate the age as of mid-year 2007.

Housing that is 40+years old is indicator of the maximum rehabilitation need, as
indicated by the HCD guidelines. An estimated 471 housing units are at least a 57+years
old, which represents 13% of the entire housing stock. Another 661 dwellings are 47 to
57 years old. Housing this old may exhibit rehabilitation needs due to age and deferred
maintenance.
The prior Housing Element estimated 770 housing units were need of rehabilitation –
450 were in need of paint-up/fix-up, 280 were in need of minor or moderate repairs and
40 were in need of major repairs. Since 2000, homeowners on their own as well through
City assistance programs have made improvements to the housing stock. In addition,

HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT                                         TECHNICAL APPENDIX A
the City’s code enforcement actions have resulted in repairs and improvements to
existing housing.
Taking into account the home improvements made since 2000, and that some housing
units have declined in quality during the past seven years, the current estimate is that
600 housing units are in need of rehabilitation.
2.       Replacement Needs: Housing that is beyond reasonable repair or in a
dilapidated condition usually requires replacement, not rehabilitation. According to the
2003 Housing Element, 14 housing units were beyond repair. Census 2000 reported that
22 housing units lacked complete plumbing facilities and 62 lacked complete kitchen
facilities. Possibly, some of these housing units could be repaired thereby avoiding
replacement.
The replacement housing need is estimated to be 38 housing units, the mid-point
between the 2003 estimate (14) and the dwellings not having complete kitchen facilities
(62).
d.       Conclusions and Findings
Six hundred housing units are need of rehabilitation. An estimated 38 housing units are
in need of replacement.
4.       At-Risk Housing Assessment
a.       Guidelines
Assisted housing developments are multifamily rental housing complexes that receive
government assistance under …. federal, state, and/or local programs …. which are
eligible to change to market-rate housing due to termination (opt-out) of a rent subsidy
contract …. or other expiring use restrictions (e.g., State or local programs) within the 5-
year planning period of the housing element and the subsequent 5-year period.
[emphasis added]
b.       Inventory of Assisted Multifamily Rental Housing Complexes
The City has one assisted multifamily rental housing complex. Hawaiian Gardens,
located at 11950 Centralia Road, is a multifamily rental housing complex receiving
financial assistance via the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program and Section 8
rental assistance. Hawaiian Gardens is a “large family” complex having a total of 264
housing units of which 211 are low income – 173 2-bedroom and 38 3-bedroom units.
The California Housing Partnership Corporation reports that the Section 8 rental
assistance program assists 179 households.
The apartment community was constructed in 1971. An exterior survey showed that the
development was adequately maintained. The entire living area is 235,971 square feet.
The 2-bedroom units range in size from 814-840 square feet; the 3-bedroom units are
1050 square feet. The site size is 10.6 acres.
Rental units with long-term affordability requirements and expiration dates prior to 2016
are considered to be potentially “at-risk.” The California Housing Partnership Corporation
                                                                               January 2010
 A-18

TECHNICAL APPENDIX A                                    HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
indicates that the Hawaiian Gardens Apartments are at risk because the Section 8
contract expires on April 30, 2008. [Elyse Perry, California Housing Partnership
Corporation, 02/02/08]
Private owners of assisted multifamily housing complexes who are no longer considering
providing rent restrictions and converting restricted units to market rate units must notify
HCD. The Hawaiian Garden owners (Hawaiian Gardens Housing Partners L.P.) have
not filed a 12-month or 6-month notice with HCD, the City, or qualified entities (i.e.,
preservation purchasers).
c.       Preservation-Replacement Analysis
The Housing Element Law explains the preservation-replacement analysis as follows:
         “The analysis shall estimate the total cost of producing new rental
         housing that is comparable in size and rent levels, to replace the units
         that could change from low-income use, and an estimated cost of
         preserving the assisted housing developments.”
Worst case, there are 211 affordable housing units at risk of conversion to market rate
housing. The at-risk units are comprised of -- 2-bedroom units, and -- 3-bedroom units.
Preservation of the housing units essentially would require rental assistance at levels
comparable to the Section 8 rental assistance. The Hawaiian Gardens Housing
Authority provides rental assistance to more than 100 households. The average annual
assistance is about $8,500. However, for a large family project, the level of assistance is
likely to be more than average amount experienced by the Housing Authority. Based on
an assumed annual average assistance of $9,500 per large family, $1,700,500 would be
necessary to meet the rental assistance needs of 179 Section 8 assisted households.
There are an additional 32 families obtaining below market rents at the Low Income Tax
Credit Program levels. The amount of rental assistance necessary to assist all
households is unknown.
An estimated $2,000,000 per year of rental assistance is probably necessary to preserve
the affordability of all the housing units. That means $60 million is of rental assistance is
needed to preserve the 211 housing units over a 30-year time period.
Physical replacement of the 211 housing units would be much more expensive because
new construction as well as subsidies would be required. The potential development
costs are outlined briefly below.
         Land: $22,800,000 (12 acres based on average density of 18 dus/ac
         and $1,900,000 per acre)
         Construction: $17,935,000 (211 units at 1000 square feet each and per
         square foot construction costs of $85) (Construction costs based on value
         per square foot from ICBO Building Standards valuation table for
         Apartment Housing.)

HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT                                         TECHNICAL APPENDIX A
         Other Costs: $8,147,000 (based on 20%-25% of land and construction costs to
         account for contingencies, soft costs, overhead and profit)
In addition, there may be an additional need for ongoing rental assistance in a
replacement housing development.
d.       Public and Private Nonprofit Corporations
The Housing Element Law indicates that:
         The analysis shall identify public and private nonprofit corporations known
         to the local government which have the legal and managerial capacity to
         acquire and manage these housing developments.
The City has identified the following nonprofit corporations as having the necessary legal
and managerial capacity:
         A Community of Friends
         LINC Housing
         Long Beach Affordable Housing Coalition
         Los Angeles Community Design Center
The four nonprofit corporations are located in Los Angeles County and are on the HCD
list of certified nonprofits.
e.       Financing and Subsidy Programs
The Housing Element Law requires that the City identify and consider the use of federal,
state and local financing and subsidy programs. The list below identifies several
financing and subsidy programs that may contribute to preserving at risk housing
developments.
         Low Income Housing Tax Credits, California Tax Credit Allocation Committee
         Preservation Interim Repositioning Program, HCD
         Preservation Opportunity Program, CalFHA Bond-Funded Housing Programs
         City CDBG Funds
         City HOME Funds
         City Redevelopment Agency Low and Moderate Income Housing Funds
The State housing programs are subject to a competitive application process. The City’s
allocation of CDBG funds and potential for HOME funds are guided by the County’s
Consolidated Plan. The RDA funds are guided by the housing component of the
Redevelopment Agency’s Implementation Plan. Consideration of the use of local funding
will be included during the course of developing the update of the Redevelopment
Agency’s Housing Implementation Plan.
                                                                                January 2010
  A-20

TECHNICAL APPENDIX A                                     HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
f.       Conclusions and Findings
Physical replacement of the rental assisted housing units is not possible in Hawaiian
Gardens. As noted, the land area is 10.5 acres. There are not vacant sites that large
located within the City. The acquisition of already built sites would be not only
prohibitively expensive, but also displace other lower income households.
There are several entities that possess the legal and managerial capacity to acquire,
preserve, and manage the at-risk Hawaiian Gardens. Many of these entities are located
in southern California and are identified on the HCD list of eligible entities. The
Hawaiian Gardens Housing Authority is also an entity that has the expertise to acquire,
preserve and manage the at-risk housing units.
The City has no rental complexes assisted by the following:
                 Federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds
                 Federal Home Investment Partnership (HOME) funds
                 Hawaiian Gardens is not eligible to compete for United States
                 Department of Agriculture (USDA) funds
                 State housing financial assistance programs
                 Local mortgage revenue bond programs
                 Redevelopment Agency rental housing units assisted with the
                 Low- and Moderate-Housing Income Fund
                 Local in-lieu fees and inclusionary housing programs
                 Local density bonus and directly assisted units
C.        SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
The Housing Element must include:
         "An analysis of any special housing needs, such as those of the elderly,
         persons with disabilities, large families, farmworkers, families with female
         heads of household, and families and persons in need of emergency
         shelter."
HCD guidance on special housing needs is cited below:
Special needs are those associated with relatively unusual occupation or demographic
groups which call for very specific program responses, such as preservation of
residential motels or the development of four bedroom apartments. The statute
specifically requires analysis of the special housing needs of the elderly, the disabled,
female headed households, large families, farmworkers and homeless persons and
families.
City of Hawaiian Gardens - Housing Element                                            A-21
HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT                                        TECHNICAL APPENDIX A
A thorough analysis of the special needs groups helps a locality identify groups with the
most serious housing needs in order to develop and prioritize responsive programs. A
special needs assessment starts with general knowledge of the community’s
demographics. The housing element should analyze the needs of each group
specifically mentioned in the statute as well as any other group the locality deems
appropriate. The analysis should include a discussion of the nature of the special
housing need of each group as well as quantification of the need. [emphasis added]
A housing element should include:
A quantification and qualitative description of the need. For instance, of the 600 elderly
households, census data reveals that 400 are homeowners and 200 are renters and that
250 of all elderly households, have incomes below the poverty level. A qualitative
description of the need would include a description of the potential housing problems
faced by the group and an analysis of unmet need. For example, the analysis of elderly
need might show that an estimated 30 percent of elderly households below the poverty
level live in substandard housing, indicating a housing rehabilitation need. Most local
governments consult information available for service providers, housing or service
waiting lists, and data on income and housing costs to identify special housing needs.
[emphasis added]
So the focus of the analysis is on the nature of the need, potential housing problems,
and a quantification of the persons and/or households in each group.
1.       Elderly
a.       Definitions
For purposes of the Housing Element, elderly persons and seniors are considered
synonymous. There are four age groups that are frequently referred to as “seniors’ –
55+, 60+, 62+ and 65+. This part includes data on persons that are 62 years of age or
older, as well as those that are 65 years of age and older.
b.       Special Housing Needs of the Elderly
Some key housing needs that seniors could potentially experience include, but are not
limited, to:
                 Affordable housing
                 Units with accessibility modifications
                 Units with special accommodations for live-in caretakers
                 Housing developments that provide on-site supportive services
                 Assistance in locating housing or in securing shared housing
                 Housing located near transportation, shopping and medical services
The special housing needs of seniors are unique because of the aging process. As the
younger seniors become the older old, the types of housing needed to meet their needs
changes. To accommodate the needs of seniors, several special housing types have
evolved over the years, which include, but are not limited, to:
                                                                              January 2010

         Senior Apartment: Age-restricted multiunit housing with self-contained
         living units for older adults who are able to care for themselves.
         Independent Living: Multi-unit senior housing developments that may
         provide supportive services such as meals, housekeeping, social
         activities, and transportation. Independent Living typically encourages
         socialization by provision of meals in a central dining area and scheduled
         social programs.
         Assisted Living: A residential community with services that include meals,
         laundry, housekeeping, medication reminders, and assistance with
         Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living
         (IADLs).

         preparing meals, shopping, managing money, taking medication, and
         housekeeping.]
         Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC): Housing planned and
         operated to provide a continuum of accommodations and services for
         seniors including, but not limited to, independent living, congregate
         housing, assisted living, and skilled nursing care. A CCRC resident
         contract often involves either an entry fee or buy-in fee in addition to the
         monthly service charges, which may change according to the medical
         services required.
         Nursing Home: Facility licensed by the state that provides 24-hour

         and those with chronic and/or long-term care illnesses.
         Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF): A Medicare-certified nursing home, with
         increased emphasis on rehabilitative therapies.
Development of these housing types usually involves large project sizes and land area.
Sites for major new developments of this kind are not possible in the City because of
limited land availability. Existing housing, through renovations, may provide opportunities
to address these needs.
c.       Hawaiian Gardens’ Older Persons
Seniors comprise about 8% of the City’s total population, according to Census 2000.
Table A-14 shows the 2000 senior population by age group and gender. In 2000,
females comprised 56.4% percent of the City’s 1,132 persons 62 years of age and older.

Table A-15 reports on the general characteristics of senior householders. The list below
notes some key characteristics:
                Because of their smaller household size, seniors comprise a
                larger proportion of the City’s households than of the population.
                In fact, 6.3% of the population is 65+ whereas 15.3% of the City’s
                households have a householder 65+.
                67.5% of all senior householders are homeowners
                44% of all the senior householders are female householders
                38% of all senior householders live alone
d.       Many Older Persons Have Low Income and Are Cost Burdened
Seniors experience a variety of housing needs because of their fixed and often low
incomes and rising housing-related costs (i.e., home repairs, utilities, etc.)
                Census 2000 data indicates that 79% of senior renters are low
                income (<80% AMI) and 81% of these households are cost
                burdened.
                Census 2000 data indicates that 67% of senior owners are low
                income and 62% of these households are cost burdened.
                                                                                 January 2010

e.       Housing for the Elderly
Census 2000 indicates that the vast majority of Hawaiian Gardens’ seniors live in
households. No seniors 65+ stated they lived in group quarters such as nursing homes
or residential care homes. Seniors comprise a high percentage of the 108 households
currently assisted by the Housing Authority’s Section 8 rental assistance program. In
addition, 40 seniors living at the Hawaiian Terrace Senior Apartments are receiving
Section 8 assistance.
The Community Care Licensing Division indicates that a 6-bed Residential Care Facility
for the Elderly (RCFE) is located in Hawaiian Gardens. The California Department of
Social Services defines these facilities as follows:
         RCFEs provide care and supervision and assistance with activities of
         daily living, such as bathing and grooming. They may also provide
         incidental medical services under special care plans. The facilities
         provide services to persons 60 years of age and over and persons under
         60 with compatible needs. RCFEs may also be known as assisted living
         facilities, retirement homes and board and care homes. The facilities can
         range in size from six beds or less to over 100 beds. The residents of
         these facilities require varying levels of personal care and protective
         supervision.
f.       Conclusions and Findings
Seniors comprise a large percentage of the City’s lower income households who are
overpaying. The City’s Housing Authority and the Section 8 program assist many of
Hawaiian Gardens’ seniors.

2.      Persons with Disabilities
a.      Definitions
Census 2000 defines disability status as:
        “People 5 years and over are considered to have a disability if they have
        one or more of the following: (a) blindness, deafness, or a severe vision
        or hearing impairment; (b) a substantial limitation in the ability to perform
        basic physical activities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting,
        or carrying; (c) difficulty learning, remembering, or concentrating; or (d)
        difficulty dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home. In addition
        to the above criteria, people 16 years and over are considered to have a
        disability if they have difficulty going outside the home alone to shop or
        visit a doctor’s office, and people 16-64 years old are considered to have
        a disability if they have difficulty working at a job or business.”
The 1973 Rehabilitation Act defines “disability” as referring to any person who:
                 Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one
                 or more of such person’s major life activities;
                 Has a record of such impairment, or
                 Is regarded as having such impairment
Disability under Social Security is based on a person’s inability to work. A person is
considered disabled if he/she is unable to do any kind of work for which he/she is suited
and the disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least a year or to result in death.
(Social Security Administration)
b.      Special Housing Needs for Persons with Disabilities
Some key special housing needs may include:
                 Affordable housing
                 Units with accessibility modifications
                 Units with special accommodations for live-in caretakers
                 Housing developments that provide supportive services
                 Units accessible to public transportation
                 Assistance in locating housing or in securing shared housing
                 Housing with design features that facilitate mobility and independence
The majority of housing units in most communities lack features such as ramps, extra
wide doors, raised toilets, hand rails, lowered counters, or slip-resistant floors that would
make them suitable for, or readily adaptable to, people with mobility limitations and
people using assistive technology. The majority of existing dwellings are inaccessible to
people with a mobility impairment.
                                                                                 January 2010

c.       People With Disabilities
Table A-16 indicates that a total of 5,399 disabilities were reported by the populations 5
years+, meaning that many disabled persons reported having more than one disability.
In fact, there was an average of 1.77 disabilities per disabled person.

            Source: Census 2000, Summary File 3, Table P41, Types of Disability.
            Table construction by Castañeda & Associates
Census 2000 gives the following meanings to the disabilities:
         Sensory disability: blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing
         impairment.
         Physical disability: a condition that substantially limits one or more basic
         physical activities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or
         carrying.
         Mental disability: difficulty learning, remembering, or concentrating.
         Self-care disability: difficulty dressing, bathing, or getting around inside
         the home.
         Go-outside disability: difficulty going outside the home alone to shop or
         visit a doctor’s office.
         Employment disability: difficulty working at a job or business.
As noted above, the disabilities having the highest frequency are those that prevent
people from working and go-outside-home disabilities.
Census 2000 data indicates that 3,045 persons 5 years and over reported a disability.
Disability prevalence rates progressively increase as the population ages. For instance,
5.6% of the population 5-15 years of age reports one or more disabilities. By contrast,
66% of the population 75+ years reports one or more disabilities. A closer look at Table
A-17 indicates that more than one-half of the seniors live with one or more disability.

   Source: Census 2000, Summary File 3, Table P42, Disability Status by Age
   Table constructed by Castañeda & Associates
HUD-produced data reveal that nearly 800 households had a “mobility or self care
limitation,” representing 23% of all households. According to HUD:
         This includes all households where one or more persons has 1) a long-
         lasting condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical
         activity, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying
         and/or 2) a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting more than 6
         months that creates difficulty with dressing, bathing, or getting around the
         home.
What this means is that the data in Table A-18 should not be interpreted as an estimate
of the number of heads of household with a disability. Instead, the disability could be
affecting someone other than a householder, perhaps a spouse, child, or grandparent.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX A                                    HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The numbers of renter and owner disabled householders are somewhat similar.
However, almost 64% of all the disabled householders had low incomes (<80% AMI), a
higher percentage that among all households. These figures may mean that a disability
causes some householders to not work regularly or at all, thus depressing their annual
incomes. Table A-17 shows that almost 30% of the disabled persons had “difficulty
working at a job or business.”
Key housing need indicators are:
                 Of the 277 low income (<80% AMI) disabled renters, 87%
                 experience one or more housing problems.
                 Of the 229 low income (<80%) AMI) disabled owners, 68%
                 experience one or more housing problems.
Any housing problem means cost burdened greater than 30% of income and/or
overcrowding and/or without complete kitchen or plumbing facilities.
d.       Conclusions and Findings
Housing for disabled persons is an important need of the community. Hawaiian Gardens
has no rental housing complexes developed exclusively for this special needs population
group. The Hawaiian Gardens and Cypress Gardens apartment communities each state
that wheelchair access is available in the ground floor units. The Hawaiian Terrace
Senior Apartments reports that all housing units are accessible for disabled persons.
3.       Large Families
a.       Definitions
HCD defines large families as consisting of five or more persons. Census data provides
estimates of households with five, six, seven or more persons.
b.       Special Housing Needs
Lower income, large families need three, four or five bedroom housing units at affordable
costs. Since housing with these numbers of bedrooms usually command higher costs
than smaller units, affordability is another key need of large families/households.
c.       Large Families/Households
Table A-19 shows an estimated 1,374 large households with five, six, and seven or more
persons, representing 39% of all households. The percentage of large households
increased between 1990 and 2000 by 3%. The percentage of owners and renters
among large households -- 45.8% owners and 54.2% renters -- is almost the same as
for all households.

The exact causes for the increase in the number of large households are unknown. And
it could be due to multiple reasons. One factor could be that the increase in housing
costs in the latter 1990s motivated households to double-up and share housing
expenses.
In 2000, the City’s lower-income, large households had multiple housing problems,
including overpaying, overcrowding and substandard housing. Table A-20 on the next
page reveals that 100% of all lower income large homeowners experience one or more
housing problems. Likewise, a very high percentage of lower income large renters
experience one or more housing problems.
d.      Housing Affordability
Besides having enough space, housing affordability is another key need of large
families. Overpaying is a problem affecting large renter and owner households alike.
The list below compares renters and owners.
                241 large renter households were overpaying in 2000,
                representing almost 30% of all the low-income renters that were
                overpaying.
                172 large owner households were overpaying in 2000,
                representing 40% of all the low-income owners that were cost
                burdened.
                                                                             January 2010

Households”, May 2004 [Data current as of 2000]

e.       Housing for Large Families/Households
Census 2000 reports a supply of just over 800 housing units with 3, 4 or 5-bedrooms. A
comparison is given below of housing availability for large owner and renter households:
                 An estimated 498 housing units with 3, 4, or 5-bedrooms were
                 available for 629 large owner households, a ratio of .79.
                 An estimated 292 housing units with 3 or 4-bedrooms were
                 available for 745 large renter households, a ratio of .39. (Renters
                 occupied no 5-bedroom units.)
Based on these indicators, housing availability for large renter householders is
significantly less than for owners. However, housing availability for lower income, large
renter households is strengthen due to the affordable two and three bedroom units
located at the Hawaiian Gardens apartment community.
f.       Conclusions and Findings
Large families experience overpaying problems, as do seniors, small families, disabled
and other households. However, this problem is compounded by the fact that large
families also lived in overcrowded conditions. Although this is an important housing
need, the City has a large-family rent-restricted apartment community to assist these
households.

4.      Farmworkers
a.      Guidelines
The element should estimate the number of permanent and migrant farmworkers within
the community. The analysis should describe the zones where housing for farmworkers
is allowed, evaluate whether sufficient opportunities for housing for migrant and
permanent farmworkers exists, and describe any conditions on development,
development standards, and processing requirements.
b.      Definitions
A farm worker is --
                A person who performs manual and/or hand tool labor to plant,
                cultivate, harvest, pack and/or load field crops and other plant life.
                A person who attends to live farm, ranch or aquacultural animals
                including those produced for animal products.”
                [Source: State of California, Employment Development
                Department, Labor Market Information Division Occupational
                Definition]
Because of their predominantly low incomes, housing affordability is an acute need for
farmworkers.
c.      Farmworkers in Hawaiian Gardens
The City has no land devoted to the production of field crops and/or other plant life.
Likewise, there is no land used for animals. As a result, there are no farmworkers
employed in Hawaiian Gardens. There may be persons residing or “housed” in the City
who are farmworkers at locations outside the municipal boundaries.
The housed “farmworkers” who may reside in the City would live in a household and
occupy a housing unit. As such, they would be among the existing households counted
as part of the 2000 Census, and estimates of existing and projected housing needs
produced by SCAG. Consequently, the resident low-income "farmworker" households –
if any -- would be included among all the households. That is, the resident farmworker
housing needs would be counted as part of the lower income households experiencing
problems of overpaying, overcrowding, and living in substandard housing.
Census 2000 estimates that a total of 26 persons/residents had jobs in the “agricultural,
forestry, fishing, and hunting” industry. Four persons were the employee of a private
company. Twenty-one persons were private not-for-profit wage and salary workers. The
number of residents employed in “agricultural” compared to “forestry, fishing and
hunting” is unknown.
The City has not devoted a residential zone exclusively for farmworker housing.
However, housing for farmworkers could be developed in the multifamily residential
zones.
                                                                                January 2010

d.       Conclusions and Findings
Based on the above information, however, the City concludes that there is not a need for
farmworker housing in Hawaiian Gardens.
5.       Female Householders
a.       Definitions
By way of background -
          “Householders are classified by type according to the sex of the
         householder and the presence of relatives. Two types of householders
         are distinguished: family householders and non-family householders. A
         family householder is a householder living with one or more people
         related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption. The householder
         and all of the people in the household related to him or her are family
         members. A nonfamily householder is a householder living alone or with
         nonrelatives only.” (U.S. Census Bureau)
In most cases, the householder is the person, or one of the people, in whose name the
home is owned, being bought, or rented and who is listed as Person 1 on the Census
questionnaire. A female householder, then, is one who is maintaining a household. A
female householder, no husband present means a family with a female householder and
no spouse of the householder present.
b.       Special Housing Needs of Female Householders
Some key housing needs include:
                 Affordable housing
                 Housing developments that provide supportive services
                 Assistance in locating housing or in securing shared housing
                 Access to housing which accommodates children
                 Access to housing which is designed for security and convenience
                 Access to housing near parks and open space to serve the needs
                 of female householders with children.
c.       Estimate of Female Householders
Nearly one-third of the City’s householders are female householders. Table A-21 shows
the owner/renter status of female householders. As indicated, 44.2% are owners and
55.8% are renters.

    Living Alone) by Age of Householder
    Table construction by Castañeda & Associates
Some important female householder characteristics are:
                302 live alone (29.6%)
                668 live in a family of two or more persons with no spouse present
                (65.5%%)
                50 live in nonfamily households with nonrelatives (4.9%)
Because so many female householders live alone, overcrowding is not expected to be a
problem as it is for small and large families. Female householders, especially those that
are renting an apartment or home, do have housing affordability concerns.
Table A-22 further describes the tenure and age characteristics of female householders.
                Seniors comprise one-half of all the female householders living alone.
                About two-thirds of these women are owners.
                Female family householders are predominantly non-seniors. Three of
                every four such householders are renters.
                There are few non-family female householders.
Perhaps, the key indicator of housing need is the overpaying situation of female
householders living in rental housing. Almost 300 renter female householders are cost
burdened based on the overpaying rate among all the City’s renter households.
                                                                              January 2010

6.      Families and Persons in Need of Emergency Shelter
a.      Guidelines
An estimate or count of the daily average number of persons lacking permanent shelter.
Wherever possible, this figure should be divided into single males and females, and
families (one or more adults with children). These subgroups require significantly
different types of shelter.
As local data allows, also include the mentally ill, developmentally disabled, substance
abusers, survivors of domestic violence, and other categories of homeless considered
significant by the jurisdiction.
An inventory of the number, approximate location, and type of existing shelter beds,
hotel/motel vouchers, and units of transitional housing available. Present shelter
resources by type (e.g., family shelter beds, homeless adult female housing, transitional
living units, etc.).
An estimate derived from the figures above, of the number of additional beds or shelters
and transitional housing units needed.
b.      Definitions
The following definitions are those adopted by the Los Angeles Homeless Services
Authority:
        Homeless Persons: are people who lack a fixed, regular and adequate
        nighttime residence, and have a primary nighttime residence that is either
        a public or private shelter, an institution that provides temporary
        residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized, or a public or
        private location that is not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular
        sleeping accommodation for human beings.
        Emergency Shelter: is the provision of a safe alternative to the streets,
        either in a shelter facility, or through the use of motel vouchers.
        Emergency shelter is short-term, usually for 30-days or less. Domestic
        violence shelters are considered emergency shelter, as they provide safe,
        immediate housing for victims and their children.
        Transitional Housing: facilitates the movement of homeless individuals
        and families to permanent housing. It is housing in which homeless
        persons may live up to 24 months and receive supportive services that
        enable them to live more independently. Supportive services – which
        help promote residential stability, increased skill level or income, and
        greater self-determination – may be provided by the organization
        managing the housing, or coordinated by that organization and provided
        by other public or private agencies. Transitional housing can be provided
        in one structure or several structures at one site, or in multiple structures
        at scattered sites.
                                                                                January 2010

TECHNICAL APPENDIX A                                    HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
         Unsheltered Persons: are those homeless who are living on the streets,
         in abandoned buildings, storage structures, vehicles, encampments, or
         any other place unfit for human habitation. Generally, those not utilizing
         Los Angeles County operated emergency or transitional housing shelters
         are considered unsheltered.

c.       Special Housing Needs
HUD's model approach to helping meet the needs of the homeless is referred to as a
Continuum of Care. A Continuum of Care begins with a point of entry in which the needs
of a homeless individual or family are assessed. The intake and assessment component
is performed by an emergency shelter or through a separate assessment center. To
reach and engage homeless persons living on the street, the homeless service system
also includes a strong outreach component.
Once a needs assessment is completed, the person/family may be referred to
permanent housing or to transitional housing where supportive services are provided to
prepare them for independent living. For example, a homeless person with a substance
abuse problem may be referred to a transitional rehabilitation program before being
assisted with permanent housing. Some individuals, particularly persons with chronic
disabilities, may require ongoing supportive services once they move into permanent
housing. The goal of the comprehensive homeless service system is to ensure that
homeless individuals and families move from homelessness to self-sufficiency, housing
and independent living.
d.       Estimates of Homelessness
As noted in a recent report:
         “…the transience of America’s unhoused makes it difficult to quantify the
         homeless population and determine who is at risk of becoming homeless.
         In addition to having no fixed address, individuals may experience bouts
         of homelessness lasting a few days or several years, and a significant
         number return to homelessness after leaving the streets, resulting in
         constant population fluctuation.”
         [Helping America’s Homeless: Emergency Shelter or Affordable Housing?]
This same report found that the –
          “Essential elements of homelessness as a social problem are so extreme
         that homeless people cannot remove their homeless condition
         themselves.”
LAHSA estimates a homeless count of 20 persons for the City of Hawaiian Gardens.
However, no actual street enumeration was made to establish this homeless estimate.

HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT                                    TECHNICAL APPENDIX A
The estimate was based on a projection, rather than a street enumeration.           The
transitional housing need would be a subset of the 20 homeless persons.
The City does not have a homeless shelter. The City is located near the MultiService
Center (MSC), which is operated by the City of Long Beach, Department of Health and
Human Services, with 14 co-located nonprofit agencies. The MSC is designed to
provide one-stop access to resources for individuals and families experiencing
homelessness within the City of Long Beach.
The MSC serves as the point of entry for homeless services city-wide, providing a wide
range of services from basic amenities of shower, laundry, mail and message center, to
street outreach, van shuttle, transportation, childcare, medical care, mental health
services, substance abuse treatment, HIV/AIDS, integrated case management, and
housing coordination. The MSC mission is to provide comprehensive supportive
services to promote progress towards permanent housing, self-sufficiency, by creating a
community where health, safety, and well-being are established.
The MSC provides assistance to homeless persons whose last known address was
Hawaiian Gardens.
e.       Conclusions and Findings
LAHSA estimates that Hawaiian Gardens has 20 homeless persons. The City has two
zones that permit homeless shelters. The City plans to implement a housing program
and zone that meet the SB 2 requirements.
D.       PROJECTED HOUSING NEEDS
1.       Population Trends and Projections
Table A-23 shows the population growth trends between 1970 and 2007. Inn the 80s,
the City experienced considerable population growth. Population growth slowed in the
1990s compared to the population gains experienced in the decade of the eighties. As
of January 1, 2007, the City’s population was 15,922 persons, according to the State
Department of Finance. Census 2000 estimated a total population of 14,779 persons.
The two estimates indicate an increase of more than 1,100 persons since the April 2000
Census.
                                                                           January 2010

2.       Employment Trends and Projections
Table A-25 indicates that most recent employment growth projections developed by
SCAG. During the 150-year period from 2000 to 2015, SCAG projects an increase of
430 jobs to be created in the City. These jobs projections are subject to revision due to
SCAG’s ongoing growth forecasting efforts.

3.      Share of Regional Housing Needs
According to the State Housing Law, “ . . . a locality’s share of the regional housing
needs includes that share of the housing needs of persons at all income levels within the
area significantly affected by a jurisdiction’s general plan.” (Section 65584 [a]). In
addition, “Each locality’s share shall be determined by the appropriate councils of
government consistent with the criteria" set forth by the HCD.
As Table A-26 indicates, SCAG’s RHNA allocates 145 housing units for the January 1,
2006 to June 30, 2014 period. The three components of the City’s allocation include
household growth, replacement housing needs, and an ideal vacancy rate. Household
growth refers to the housing needed to accommodate the projected increase in
households (i.e., occupied housing units). Replacement housing needs, according to the
RHNA Methodology, are based on the nine-year average between 1997 and 2005 of
demolition permits reported to the State Department of Finance (DOF).
In 2006, AB 2634 amended the Housing Element Law to require that the needs
assessment specifically analyze the “extremely low income” level. The law was
amended to indicate that –
        “Local agencies shall calculate the subset of very low income households
        allotted under Section 65584 that qualify as extremely low income
        households.”
The calculations shown in Table A-26 are based on the City’s proportion of extremely
low- (.43) and very low-income (.57) households among all the households below 50%
of the area median income. These two proportions were applied to the RHNA allocation
of 35 housing units to the <50% of median income group.
                                                                              January 2010

E.       ENERGY CONSERVATION
The City facilitates energy conservation through three methods: 1) dissemination of
information on energy conservation opportunities to local residents; 2) promoting energy
conservation in existing housing; 3) encouraging energy conservation in new
development and 4) protecting solar access.
1.       Dissemination of Information on Energy Conservation Opportunities
The General Plan provides basic background information for local residents on energy
conservation. The information contained in the General Plan is described below.
a.       General Plan Opportunities
1)       Energy Resources: All traditional energy supplies consumed by land uses in the
City are imported. There are no wells producing oil or natural gas, coal deposits,
generating stations, or refineries and processing facilities within the City. The Southern
California Gas Company from its interstate system imports natural gas. Electrical energy
is accessed by transmission and distribution lines from substations owned by Southern
California Edison Company.
2)       Energy Conservation Opportunities: Energy is consumed in Hawaiian Gardens
through a variety of uses, and serves different purposes. Energy is needed for
transportation, residential and nonresidential heating and cooling, water heating, and
lighting. The Conservation Element contains policies that encourage energy
conservation, including energy efficiency and public education on energy conservation.
A significant component of energy conservation is energy efficiency in the design of
structures within the City. The concept of “green building” encourages the design,
construction, renovation, reuse, or operation of buildings that enhance resource

HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT                                      TECHNICAL APPENDIX A
efficiency, therefore making the building sustainable. There are several useful and
proactive measures for residences and also nonresidential land uses that owners can
take in order to make their structures more energy efficient.
For residences, homeowners can install high performance windows. These windows
employ advanced technology such as proactive coatings and improved frame
assemblies to trap heat in during winter and keep heat out during hot seasons. The
windows also block damaging ultraviolet sunlight that can destroy carpets and
furnishings. Along with improved windows, ensuring effective insulation is provided for
walls, floors, and interior spaces of a home stabilize temperatures indoors and improve
comfort.
Installing effective heating and cooling systems also reduce energy consumption.
ENERGY STAR appliances and fixtures, such as light bulbs, ventilation fans,
refrigerators, washing machines, and other typical household appliances use less
energy, and are easy to find in stores. For yard areas, using landscape irrigation with
low-drip systems, drought-tolerant landscaping, and native California plants can reduce
wasteful water consumption.
There are also energy conservation methods for nonresidential land uses, such as
commercial and industrial. Operating facilities with tankless water heating systems, low-
flush toilets, and flow-reducing water faucets reduces wasteful water consumption and
energy use. For onsite landscaping, native soils and mature trees should be preserved.
This helps prevent soil erosion, maintains sources of natural cooling, diverts additional
waste from landfills, and preserves nature. Recycling job site and construction waste
also helps divert waste from landfills. Typically, C&D waste accounts for 21% of the
statewide waste stream. These materials are renewable resources, which can very
easily be recycled.
b.       City Website
The City’s Website encourages residents to “Make energy-efficiency at home and work a
priority.” The Website also informs residents of the Gas Company’s rebate, incentive
and other programs to save energy. A link is given to the Gas Company’s energy
efficient programs.
c.       City Newsletter
The City publishes a monthly newsletter. Each issue contains a column titled Going
Green. The purpose of this column (printed in English and Spanish) is to describe useful
tips on ways and means to achieve energy conservation. The Going Green column
provides information on the energy conservation opportunities available to local
residents. For instance, the November 2008 Newsletter describes the opportunity to
conserve energy when replacing older appliances.
                                                                             January 2010
 A-42

TECHNICAL APPENDIX A                                   HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
2.       Energy Conservation in Existing Housing
The City has a very active Housing Rehabilitation Program. As noted below, one of the
eligible improvements is energy conservation:
         Eligible improvements and repairs include, but are not limited to; roofing,
         plumbing, heating, windows, flooring, electrical systems, interior/exterior
         painting, bathroom and kitchen remodels and energy conservation
         improvements and bedroom additions to relieve overcrowded conditions
During the work write-up, the City’s housing rehabilitation specialist explains to grant and
loan applicants the eligible energy conservation improvements that could be made
during the renovation of their home.
3.       Energy Conservation in New Housing
The City also provides energy conservation by implementation of the following
residential design guideline:
         “New development should incorporate energy and water conservation
         design to the extent possible.”
The City will amend the Residential Design Guidelines to provide examples of specific
ways to incorporate energy conservation design in new housing developments. The
examples will be provided in Chapter 18.50.100B(10) of the Zoning Code.
4.       Solar Energy and Solar Access
The City has established standards for solar energy and access. These regulations
indicate that developments proposing the use of solar apparatus shall obtain solar
easements from adjacent properties. Solar access protection means protecting southerly
roofs, walls and yards of new and existing buildings from shading by adjacent buildings
and trees.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX B                         INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
A.       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.       Overview
Housing constraints are categorized as “governmental” and “nongovernmental.”                   The
governmental constraints analysis includes –
         Land use controls, building codes and their enforcement, site improvements, fees
         and other exactions required of developers, local processing and permit
         procedures. The analysis shall also demonstrate local efforts to remove
         governmental constraints that hinder the locality from meeting its share of the
         regional housing need…and for meeting the need for housing for the disabled.
These factors affect two very important aspects of the housing market: 1) the range and
diversity of housing types which can be built in the City; and 2) the cost of new housing
production. The statewide legislation does not presume that Hawaiian Gardens, or any other
city for that matter, regulates these factors in such a way as to restrict housing choices or raise
housing costs above normal levels. However, if the analysis does reveal that unnecessary
constraints are being imposed then it is expected that efforts will be made to mitigate the
impacts.
The nongovernmental constraints include the availability of financing, the price of land, and the
cost of construction. These constraints are discussed in Technical Appendix C.
Resources to address housing needs and either mitigate or remove governmental constraints
include:
         Land suitable for residential development
         Land use and development controls
         Regulatory concessions and incentives
         Financial resources – Federal, State, and local housing funds
Sections 2 and 3 and Technical Appendix D describe these key resources.
2.       Summary of Governmental Constraints
A brief summary of the governmental constraints analysis is presented below. The full analysis
is presented on pages B-4 through B-28.
a.       Land Use Controls
The City concludes that the land use controls do not pose a constraint to the maintenance,
improvement, or development of housing for all income levels. Although only five vacant lots
exist in the City, previous efforts have facilitated the development of large family affordable
housing, senior affordable housing, mobilehome housing, and market rate apartment
communities.
City of Hawaiian Gardens - Housing Element                                                 B-1

INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS                                 TECHNICAL APPENDIX B
Currently, the City’s land use controls would apply to five vacant lots and 32 underutilized lots.
The City has one site comprised of five contiguous lots. The 32 underutilized lots could yield a
net increase of 120 housing units at a density of 18.9 dwelling units per acre. (This density is
almost identical to the Housing Element Law recommended minimum density of 20 dus/ac for a
community the size of Hawaiian Gardens.) The 32 underutilized lots are located on the following
streets:
         Hawaiian Streets              10 lots
         Verne Street                  8 lots
         214th Street                  7 lots
         Juan Avenue                   5 lots
         Claretta Avenue               2 lots
The community’s residents, during the General Plan Update process, frequently expressed
concerns about the high-density housing located on these streets, and the ensuing
overcrowding and parking problems caused by this density.
The City’s land use controls will facilitate the development of housing for moderate-income and
lower income households through the continued development of …the housing programs of the
Redevelopment Agency.
The City will revise the density bonus incentives to meet the new requirements of SB 1818.
b.       State Housing Law and the California Building Code
The California Building Code, as noted, was adopted by reference. The City's codes are
considered to be the minimum necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The
Codes, which are based on the State Housing Law and uniform codes, are adopted by many
cities throughout southern California and do not pose a constraint to residential development.
On January 1, 2008, the 2007 California Building Code (which was published in July 2007) will
be effective.
c.       On- and Off-Site Improvements
The on- and off-site improvement requirements have guided past and recently constructed
housing. The streets on which the vacant and underutilized lots are located have been
improved to the maximum widths. In some cases, curbs, gutters and sidewalks must be
constructed to be consistent with adjacent developments.
The City concludes that the land use controls do not pose a constraint to the maintenance or
improvement of housing. With regard to the development of housing, the improvement
requirements apply to five vacant and 32 underutilized lots. As mentioned in the preceding
paragraph, the City streets have been widened to their maximum width.
For all the reasons previously stated, the City concludes that on- and off-site improvements do
not pose a constraint to the maintenance, improvement and development of housing.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX B                        INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
d.       Fees and Exactions
The City concludes that the fees established by the City do pose a constraint to development. In
addition, residential developments consistent with the General Plan and Zoning Code would
have no division of land fees or land use fees (i.e., zone change) imposed.
Since the City does not carry out exactions, they are not a constraint to local development.
e.       Processing and Permit Procedures
The City concludes that the processing and permitting procedures do not pose a constraint
upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels. Multi-
family rental housing is permitted in the R-2, R-3 and R-4 residential zones. Landscaping and
design standards are needed in order to ensure that new housing enhances neighborhood
quality. Review processes for landscaping and design plans are minimal, as the Community
Development Director has the authority to approve the submitted plans.
f.       Constraints on Housing for Persons with Disabilities
The City will amend the Zoning Code to ensure that its rules, policies, and standards are
consistent with fair housing laws. The City will develop a reasonable accommodation procedure
that encompasses both zoning and building standards.
Guidance for developing the procedure will be obtained from disabled persons and advocacy
groups. Once adopted, the reasonable accommodation procedure will be explained on the
City’s website and prominently displayed at the Planning and Building counters.
In addition, the City will amend the Zoning Code to ensure that residential care facilities are
permitted in all zones that permit single-family homes.
g.       Constraints on Meeting Regional Share Housing Needs
There are no local governmental constraints that would prevent the City from meeting its share
of the regional housing need. The non-governmental constraints such as the cost of land and
construction do create constraints on the development of housing affordable to all income
levels.

B.     GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS ANALYSIS
In accordance with the Housing Element Law, this part provides:
       ”An analysis of potential and actual governmental constraints upon the
       maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels….”
The required analysis includes seven subjects:
               Land use controls
               Building codes and their enforcement
               Site improvements
               Fees and exactions required of developers
               Local processing and permit procedures
       Ƒ        Constraints on housing for persons with disabilities
               Constraints on meeting regional share housing needs
The purpose of the analysis is to find out if a standard or practice -
        “…constitute a barrier to the maintenance, improvement or development of
       housing.”
And whether certain policies –
       “…have a disproportionate or negative impact on the development of particular
       housing types (e.g., multifamily) or on housing developed for low- or moderate-
       income households.”
According to HCD, a determination should be made for each potential constraint whether it
poses an actual constraint.
1.     Land Use Controls
a.     Guidelines
       Identify and analyze zoning, density, parking requirements, lot coverage, height
       limits, lot sizes, unit sizes, design criteria, floor area ratios, setbacks, moratoria
       and prohibitions against multifamily housing developments, growth controls,
       urban growth boundaries, open space requirements, etc.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX B                          INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
The focus of analysis, then, is on whether the City’s land use controls facilitate the development
of a variety of housing types that can meet a wide spectrum of needs, including special housing
needs.
b.       Analysis
1)       Residential Zones: Hawaiian Gardens has five residential zones, as follows:
         R-1 Estate:     The purpose of the Single Family Estate (R-1:10,000) zone is to provide a
         safe, attractive and stable environment for large lot single-family residential
         development. This designation is intended to promote detached single-family units with
         adequate area for homes, yards, and accessory uses. The “10,000” suffix refers to the
         minimum lot size requirement, in square feet, for lots within this zone.
         R-1 Single-Family:      The purpose of the Single Family Residential (R-1) zone is to
         provide areas for the development of detached single-family units at low densities, to
         promote the preservation of existing detached single-family residential units and to
         encourage redevelopment of these areas with similar land uses.
         R-2 Medium Density: The purpose of the Medium Density Residential (R-2) zone is to
         provide safe, attractive and stable environment for single-family, duplex, and other
         medium density multi-family residential uses. This zone is intended to encourage and
         stabilize existing medium density developments, such as one or two single-family
         detached units, two-family units, or group homes.
         R-3 Intermediate Density: The purpose of the Intermediate Density Residential (R-3)
         zone is to provide areas for multi-family residential developments where adequate
         services, traffic circulation, and the existence of open space and recreation areas are
         available. These areas are intended to accommodate several detached single-family
         homes on one lot or small-scale multi-family development projects.
         R-4 High Density: The purpose of the High Density Residential (R-4) zone is to provide
         areas for multiple family residential developments where adequate services, traffic
         circulation, and the existence of open space and recreation areas are available. These
         are found in areas that provide a transition to non-residential zones and are primarily
         intended for apartments, condominiums and other high-density multi-family
         developments.
The City also has established a Mobilehome Park Zone (MHP) for purposes of conserving this
housing type and contributing to addressing affordable housing needs. The two mobilehome
parks located in Hawaiian Gardens are zoned MHP. These two parks were developed in
accordance with the MHP zone standards that require a minimum lot size of 2.5 acres for a
mobilehome park and individual lot sizes of 2,100 square feet.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX B                        INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Attachment A (pg. 35) provides visual illustrations of how the development standards are
applied to land parcels meeting the minimum lot sizes of each residential zone.
In many ways, the County of Los Angeles established the development future of the City. The
County prior to the City’s incorporation created the lot sizes and dimensions. The lots and
zoning shown on the August 1971 Zoning Map (see next page) are practically identical to the
current configuration. The C-4 (commercial) parcel located near the intersection of Pioneer
Boulevard and Centralia Street, however, was re-zoned to enable the development of a large-
family affordable housing development. The A-2 parcel near the intersection of Norwalk
Boulevard and 226th Street was re-zoned to facilitate the development of a senior apartment
housing community.
2)       Required Parking Spaces. The City’s Municipal Code requires the provision of parking
for residential uses as identified in Chart B-2. As indicated in the prior Housing Element, these
standards are comparable to parking standards found in most communities.
Parking is a problem in many streets, especially Hawaiian Avenue, Claretta Avenue and Verne
Avenue. The density of residential development has overburdened the streets, which are
narrow. As previously noted, the parking standards apply to only seven vacant lots.
The information in Table D-3, page D-7 demonstrates that the City’s parking standards can be
accommodated on zoned parcels that meet the minimum lot size requirements. That is, the
parking standards do not reduce housing capacity below the maximum permitted by zoning on
lots meeting the minimum lot size requirements.
The parking standard in the R-2 and R-3 Zones is two spaces per dwelling unit in a garage.
Lowering the number of parking spaces per unit and eliminating the enclosed space
requirement would not result in bringing new housing within the cost/rent levels affordable to
lower income households. Land costs and the cost of constructing the housing unit itself would
exceed the maximum affordable housing costs pursuant to the HOME Program, California
Community Redevelopment Law and Low Income Housing Tax Credits.
The City will implement a policy to relax some regulatory standards to facilitate the production of
affordable housing. Upon the request of a developer and submittal of a parking needs study, the
City may reduce the number of spaces required and enclosed space requirement. Some
populations served by affordable housing do not generate the same demand for parking as, say,
family rental housing developments. Some of these populations include the frail elderly,
developmentally disabled and emancipated foster youth.

INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS                                  TECHNICAL APPENDIX B
3)      Open Space Requirements: The open space requirements are the same for multi-family
housing located in R-2, R-3 and R-4 residential zones:
        500 square feet per unit, consisting of 250 square feet of common useable open
        space for unit.
        150 square feet of private useable open space (patios, balconies, terraces) per
        unit adjacent to unit, with a minimum dimension of 6 feet.
        100 square feet of passive landscaped areas per unit.
4)      Design Criteria: All residential developments, including additions, within the City must
conform to design guidelines. The guidelines are utilized during the Site Plan Review and
Approval process for each housing development. The Community Development Director
determines compliance with the design guidelines.
5)      Specific Plans: The Specific Plan (SP) zone allows for the development of a specific land
use or a mix of land uses subject to the development standards and design guidelines outlined
in the approved Specific Plan for the area. This zone provides flexibility in the development of
sites, which possess unique characteristics, such as size and dimensions of certain properties.
The City has two adopted Specific Plans:
        Las Brisas Hawaiian Avenue Specific located on Hawaiian Avenue, just south of
        Carson Street.
        Las Brisas 214th Street Specific Plan located on 214th Street, just east of Norwalk
        Boulevard.
6)      Emergency Shelters, Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing: Government Code
Section 65583(a)(4)(A) requires the City to identify –
        “… a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use
        without a conditional use permit or other discretionary permit. The identified zone
        or zones shall include sufficient capacity to accommodate the need for
        emergency shelter…. except that each local government shall identify a zone or
        zones that can accommodate at least one year-round emergency shelter.”
The City permits “emergency shelters” in the General Commercial (C-4) and Public Facilities
(PF) Zones. The Zoning Code, however, does not define “emergency shelters” or establish
development standards to guide the siting of emergency shelters.
The Zoning Code will be amended in order to comply with all of the “emergency shelter”
requirements of SB 2, as stated in the Government Code Section cited above.
The Land Use Element indicates the number of acres designated as General Commercial and
Public Facilities. There are several vacant and underutilized C-4 zoned sites along Carson
Street.
SB 2 also states that a city’s zoning regulations should consider transitional housing and
supportive housing as a residential use. HCD advises that transitional housing sites should be
close to public services and facilities, including transportation. HCD also states that
B-10                                                                                   January 2010

TECHNICAL APPENDIX B                          INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
development standards such as parking requirements, fire regulations, and design standards
should not impede the efficient use of the site as transitional housing.
Pursuant to SB 2, the City will identify in the Zoning Code that transitional and supportive housing
are considered a residential use of property. This effort will include definitions consistent with
State law, as well as development standards for these residential uses. The City’s actions will
follow the guidance provided by HCD in the SB 2 Technical Assistance Memorandum.
7)       Density Bonuses:       Section 18.90.090 of the Zoning Code provides regulatory
concessions and incentives through density bonuses. The City’s density bonus provisions are
consistent with the requirements of the State Density Bonus Law (SB 1818). In general, the
concessions and incentives include:
         “A reduction or modification of Zoning Code requirements, site development
         standards, or architectural design requirements that exceed the minimum
         building standards approved by the State Building Standards Commission, as
         provided in Part 25 of Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code.”
Concessions and incentives may include reductions and modifications to open space, parking,
setback, density, building height and off-site improvements.
8)       Moratoria and Prohibitions of Multifamily Housing Developments: The City has no
moratoria or prohibitions against multifamily housing developments.
9)       Growth Controls, Urban Boundaries: The City does not have a “growth control
ordinance” that limits the number of housing units that be constructed. In addition, the City does
not have an “urban growth boundary” extending beyond the current incorporated area. The City
is completely surrounded by the incorporated cities of Lakewood, Long Beach, and Cypress.
c.       Conclusions and Findings
The City concludes that the land use controls do not pose a constraint to the maintenance,
improvement, or development of housing for all income levels. Although only seven vacant lots
exist in the City, previous efforts have facilitated the development of large family affordable
housing, senior affordable housing, mobilehome housing, and market rate apartment
communities.
Currently, the City’s land use controls would apply to five vacant lots and 32 underutilized lots.
The City has one vacant site comprised of five contiguous lots. The 32 underutilized lots could
yield a net increase of 120 housing units at a density of 18.9 dwelling units per acre. (This
density is almost identical to the Housing Element Law recommended minimum density of 20
dus/ac for a community the size of Hawaiian Gardens.) The 32 underutilized lots are located on
the following streets:
         Hawaiian Streets               10 lots
         Verne Street                   8 lots
         214th Street                   7 lots
         Juan Avenue                    5 lots
         Claretta Avenue                2 lots

INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS                                   TECHNICAL APPENDIX B
The community’s residents, during the General Plan Update process, frequently expressed
concerns about the high-density housing located on these streets, and the ensuing
overcrowding and parking problems caused by this density.
2.      Building Codes and Enforcement
a.      Guidelines
HCD guidance on this subject indicates that the analysis should:
        Identify and analyze any local amendments to the State Housing Law or Uniform
        Building Code, and the degree or type of enforcement. A strict code enforcement
        program or a code amendment, which specifies expensive materials and/or
        methods, can pose a significant constraint to housing development or
        maintenance.
b.      Analysis
1)      State Housing Law: The regulations implementing the State Housing Law mandate
statewide residential building standards for new construction and are found in the California
Code of Regulations, (CCR), Title 24, Parts 2 through 5, known as known as the California
Building Standards Code. In November 2007, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 519 that
approved the use of the 2007 California Building Code, effective January 1, 2008. The
Ordinance specially stated:
        (A)     The 2007 California Building Code as amended by Title 26 Los Angeles
        County Building Code (Adopted November 27, 2007 by the Los Angeles County
        board of supervisors), together with their appendices, which regulates the
        erection, construction, enlargements, alteration, repair, moving, removal,
        conversion, demolition, occupancy, use, equipment, height, area, security,
        abatement, and maintenance of buildings or structures within the city, provides
        for the issuance of permits and collection of fees therefore, and provide for
        penalties for violation thereto, is adopted by reference, and conflicting ordinances
        are hereby repealed.
        (B)     All of the regulations, provisions, conditions, and terms of said codes,
        together with their appendices, one copy of which will be on file and accessible to
        the public for inspection at the city clerk’s office, are referred to, adopted and
        made part of this chapter as if fully set forth in this chapter with the exceptions,
        deletions, additions, and amendments thereto as set forth in this subchapter.
A city (or county) may make such changes or modifications in the requirements contained in the
California Building Standards Code if the city (or county) makes findings that they are
reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological, or topographical conditions.
Ordinance No. 519 did not reference any local amendments.
B-12                                                                                    January 2010

TECHNICAL APPENDIX B                         INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
With regard to new housing, Health and Safety Code Section 17920 states:
         “Enforcement means diligent effort to secure compliance, including review of
         plans and permit applications, response to complaints, citation of violations, and
         other legal process.”
The City’s Building Division activities continue to adhere to this definition of enforcement.
2)       Existing Housing Codes: The regulations governing residential use, maintenance and
occupancy for existing buildings are adopted into the California Code of Regulations. These
regulations are not considered building standards and are not adopted under the purview of the
California Building Standards Commission. The City has adopted the various provisions of the
State Housing Law, as set forth in California Health and Safety Code Section 17910 et. seq. and
the State Housing Law Regulations as set forth in Title 25 of the California Code of Regulations.
California Health and Safety Code Section 17920.3 defines the conditions that constitute a
“substandard building.” The substandard housing conditions include:
         Inadequate sanitation
         Structural hazards
         Defective wiring, plumbing and mechanical equipment
         Faulty weather protection.
With respect to existing housing, Health and Safety Code Section 17920 states:
         “… enforcement may, but need not, include inspections of existing buildings on
         which no complaint or permit application has been filed…”
3)       Code Enforcement: The City will continue to implement – during the program period -- a
Housing Code Enforcement Program. The program is implemented on a complaint basis. The
City staff inspects the properties and notices are given to the property owners having code
violations. The latter may include violations of the Fire, Building, and Zoning Codes, the State
Vehicle Code, and the State and County Public Health Codes. This Program warns
homeowners against converting a garage to a room addition.
The Housing Code Enforcement program is funded, in part, by CDBG funds that the City’s
receives as part of the Urban County program. According to the County’s Action Plan, the code
enforcement activity provides funds for the enforcement of codes as they relate to residential
properties in the predominately low and moderate income census tracts of the City of Hawaiian
Gardens. The program supplements the Housing Rehabilitation Program through referral of
substandard properties for correction of code violations.
c.       Conclusions and Findings
The California Building Code, as noted, was adopted by reference. The City's codes are
considered to be the minimum necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The
Codes, which are based on the State Housing Law and uniform codes, are adopted by many
cities throughout southern California and do not pose a constraint to residential development.

INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS                                   TECHNICAL APPENDIX B
3.      On-Site and Off-Site Improvement Requirements
a.      Guidelines
HCD guidance on this subject indicates that the analysis should:
        Identify and analyze street widths, curb, gutter, and sidewalk requirements, water
        and sewer connections, and circulation improvement requirements. Describe
        any generally applicable level of service standards or mitigation thresholds.
b.      Analysis
Developers are required to install streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, sewers, water lines, street
lighting, and trees in the public right-of-way. These facilities are then dedicated to the City for
maintenance. Examples of specific ordinance requirements are given below:
15.28.020 Constructions to include curbs, sidewalks and gutters
        Any person constructing or arranging for the construction of a building or dwelling
        in the city shall also provide for the construction of cement curbs and gutters and
        sidewalks, in accordance with the city specification, unless adequate curbs,
        gutters and sidewalks already exist on the property where the building or dwelling
        is to be constructed. (Ord. 34 § 2, 1965)
15.28.040 Street width—Dedication
        Such curbs, gutters and sidewalks shall be installed in accordance with a street
        width to be established by the city engineer; the property owner shall, if required,
        dedicate such additional frontage as may be necessary to install curb, gutter and
        sidewalk in accord with the width of street as designated by the city engineer.
        (Ord. 34 § 4, 1965)
15.28.050 Exceptions
        In cases of unusual hardship any person aggrieved by the provisions of Sections
        15.28.020 or 15.28.030 may appeal to the city council, and the council with or
        without public hearing on the matter may except some or all of the parcel of
        property from said provisions upon such conditions as it may deem just. (Ord. 34
        § 5, 1965).
All residential streets have been developed to the maximum widths. The following list indicates
the widths of existing streets in single-family and multifamily neighborhoods:
        Residential streets in single-family neighborhoods have existing street widths of
        60 feet.
        Streets in multifamily neighborhoods have street widths of 40-45 feet, including
        streets such Hawaiian Avenue, Verne Avenue and Claretta Avenue.
As previously stated, all residential streets have been constructed to their maximum widths.
That is, the development of new housing in City on the infill lots does not require the dedication
B-14                                                                                  January 2010

TECHNICAL APPENDIX B                          INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
of land or construction of streets. In very rare instances, for a large development, it may be
necessary to dedicate land and widen the street width by a few feet.
Curbs, gutters and sidewalks are already installed throughout the City’s residential
neighborhoods. Occasionally, the development of new housing requires the replacement of
existing curbs, gutters and sidewalks.
The City concludes that the cost and supply of housing is not impacted by street width
requirements, or the need for curbs, gutters and sidewalks.
c.       Conclusions and Findings
The on- and off-site improvement requirements have guided past and recently constructed
housing. The streets on which the vacant and underutilized lots are located have been
improved to the maximum widths. In some cases, curbs, gutters and sidewalks must be
constructed to be consistent with adjacent developments.
The City concludes that the land use controls do not pose a constraint to the maintenance or
improvement of housing. With regard to the development of housing, the improvement
requirements apply to five vacant and 32 underutilized lots. As mentioned in the preceding
paragraph, the City streets have been widened to their maximum width.
For all the reasons previously stated, the City concludes that on- and off-site improvements do
not pose a constraint to the maintenance, improvement and development of housing.
4.       Fees and Exactions
a.       Guidelines
HCD has indicated that the analysis should:
         Identify and analyze permit, development and impact fees (e.g., park, school,
         open space, parking district, etc.) in-lieu fees, land dedication requirements (e.g.,
         streets, public utility and other right-of-ways, easements, parks, open spaces,
         etc.) and other exactions imposed on developers. Describe any contribution or
         payment required as an authorized precondition for receiving any type of
         development permit by type of development (i.e., multifamily and single-family).
b.       Analysis
1)       Fees: The City has established a Growth Requirements Capital Fee that applies to new
development, as follows:
         “New development” includes all residential, commercial and industrial
         construction projects except as specifically exempted in Section 15.36.070.
         “Capital improvements,” for purposes of this chapter, means costs related to
         acquisition of land and improvements thereto, construction of buildings and other
         facilities, equipment and debt service relating to any of the foregoing. (Ord. 267 §
         1, 1983)
City of Hawaiian Gardens - Housing Element                                                    B-15

INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS                                  TECHNICAL APPENDIX B
        Each new development shall pay a growth requirements capital fee of four
        percent of the building valuation of that development. (Ord. 267 § 2, 1983)
The fee shall be used as follows:
        All funds received by the city in connection with the payment of the growth
        requirements capital fee shall be placed in the general fund of the city and may
        be used for any general government purpose. It is the determination of the city
        council that over time the capital improvements contemplated as the basis of this
        chapter will be paid by the city out of general fund revenues, including funds
        received from the growth requirements capital fee. (Ord. 267 § 7, 1983)
The Growth Requirements Capital Fee is uniform in that it is based on set percentage of a
building’s value. Additions to single-family homes are exempt from this fee.
Other fees are charge by governmental agencies that are set independent of the City. These
include the County Building and Safety fees, the County Sanitation District 19, and the ABC
Unified School District. The County fees are uniform throughout the service areas. Hawaiian
Gardens is located in District No. 19, an area that also includes the cities of Artesia, Cerritos,
Lakewood and parts of Long Beach. The Sanitation Districts’ fees are based on the type of land
use and size. The ABC Unified School District school impact fee is $2.64 per square foot.
a)      Single-Family Home Fees: The construction of a typical single-family home on a
standard R-1 lot would have few fees. Single-family homes are exempt from the Growth Capital
Fee of 4% of building valuation. The School Fee is $4,752 for a home of 1,800 square feet. The
County Sanitation District Fee is $2,480 for a single-family home. In summary, the fees include:
        School Fee                             $4,752
        County Sanitation District Fee         $2,480
                                               $7,232
In addition, building and plan check fees would be charged based on the building valuation of
the home.
(Assumes that the project – a single family home - does not require a Negative Declaration or
EIR; therefore, the Fish and Game Filing Fee is not required.)
The City fees for a single family home are itemized below:
SFD             Cost/sq.ft     Valuation       Plan Check    Bldg Permit
    1800sq.ft       $95.91     $172,638.00
Garage
    400sq.ft        $37.34     $14,936.00
                    Total:     $187,574.00 $1800.52          $2118.26
These fees represent about 2% of the building valuation for a new home, which exclude land
costs and, therefore the total home value. The City fees represent a small percentage of total
new housing costs and do not impede the development of new housing.
B-16                                                                                 January 2010

TECHNICAL APPENDIX B                        INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
b)       6-Unit Subdivision: A six unit subdivision development in Hawaiian Gardens would incur
the following project related fees:
         Tentative Tract Map                   $3,288
         Final Tract Map                       $1,963
         School Fees                           $28,512
         County Sanitation District Fee        $11,160
In addition, building fees would be charged based on the building valuation of the home.

(Assumes that the project does not require a Negative Declaration or EIR; therefore, the Fish
and Game Filing Fee is not required.)
(Also, assumes that the project does not require a General Plan Amendment ($4,767 fee) or
Zone Change ($3,267 fee).)
The per unit fee amounts are:
         Tentative Tract Map                   $548
         Final Tract Map                       $327
         School Fees                           $4,752 (1800 square foot unit)
         County Sanitation District Fee        $1,860
                                               $7,487
On a per unit basis, the fees represent about less than 3% of the development cost/sales price
of a typical single family home in a subdivision. This percentage assumes that the home has a
cost or sales price of $300,000. The City fees represent a small percentage of total new housing
costs and do not impede the development of new housing.

c)       Multifamily Developmentǣ A 6-unit multi-family rental development would incur the
School Fees and County Sanitation District Fee. On a permit unit basis, the fees are:
         School Fees                           $3,168 (1200 square foot apartment)
         County Sanitation District Fee        $1,488
                                               $4,656
In addition, building and plan check fees would be charged based on the building valuation of
the home.
(Assumes that the project does not require a Negative Declaration or EIR; therefore, the Fish
and Game Filing Fee is not required.)
(Also, assumes that project does not require a General Plan Amendment ($4,767 fee) or Zone
Change ($3,267 fee).)
If the project were a condominium, a conditional use permit would be required ($2,126).

INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS                                  TECHNICAL APPENDIX B
The City fees are itemized below:
Multi-Family                                   Plan Check     Bldg Permit
    1200sq.ft.      $88.46      $106,152
Garage
    400sq.ft.       $37.34      $14,936.00
                                $121,088.00 $1389.68          $1634.92
6 Units                         $726,528.00 $5450.63          $6412.50

The City fees represent 2% of the total building valuation, which excludes land costs. As a
result, the City fees do not impede the development of new housing or add significantly to the
total costs of new housing.

2)       Exactions: By definition, an exaction is a large capital improvement included in a
project’s approval for development (e.g., a park dedication, building a school, etc.). The City
does not require large-scale capital improvements to be constructed by project applicants.
Residential projects in the City are infill and small in scale. Since the City does not carry out
exactions, they are not a constraint to local development.
c.       Conclusions and Findings
The City fees do not represent a high percentage of the sales price of single family homes or
multi-family owner and rental housing. The City concludes that the number, type and cost of
fees do not pose a constraint upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing
for all income levels. Since the City does not carry out exactions, they are not a constraint to
local development.
5.       Processing and Permit Procedures
a.       Guidelines
HCD guidance on this issue indicates the analysis should:
         Identify and analyze the types of permits, discretionary and standard approval
         procedures, and processing time required for recent residential projects,
         including all permits applicable to residential development. The element should
         also identify and analyze any overlay zones (e.g., Community Plan
         Implementation Zones, Hillside Overlay Zones, Environmentally Sensitive Areas,
         etc.). The element should identify and analyze the permitted uses in each zone.
         For example, if the jurisdiction requires a conditional use permit for multifamily
         housing zone, the element should analyze this permit procedure as a constraint.
         Other applicable regulations such as landscaping, design review policies,
         planned districts should also be included. For this analysis, localities should
         compare the permit and approvals process for a typical single-family subdivision
         and a typical multifamily project.
B-18                                                                                  January 2010

TECHNICAL APPENDIX B                          INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
b.       Analysis
Figure B-1 shows the City’s processing procedures for a zone change and Zoning Code
amendment. The figure shows the sequence of steps and actions of the Community
Development Department, Planning Commission and City Council. Chart B-3 shows the various
permits and the authority of each decision-making body authority. The City Council’s final
decision making authority is limited to a General Plan Amendment, Zone Change, Specific Plan
and Planned Development. Development consistent with the City’s Land Use Element Update
does not require these four discretionary actions.
Housing development will occur on five vacant lots and 32 underutilized sites. These
developments will not require a General Plan Amendment or Zone Change. The following
housing types are permitted in the R-2, R-3, and R-4 residential zones:
         Affordable housing
         Multi-family rental housing
         Residential condominiums
         Factory-built housing
         Manufactured housing
         Senior housing
1)       Design Review: With respect to design criteria and guidelines, the City’s Zoning
Ordinance states:
         “Design guidelines have been developed to promote high quality development, to
         protect the city from the adverse effects of poor design, to encourage originality,
         creativity, and compatibility within the neighborhood, and to enhance the beauty;
         livability and prosperity of the community. All residential developments, including
         additions, within the city shall conform to the design standards….. These
         standards shall be utilized during the site plan review and approval process for
         each development.
         “Development shall be compatible with the character of the neighborhood and
         surrounding sites and shall not be detrimental to the orderly and harmonious
         development of the surrounding areas and of the city. The height and bulk of any
         proposed building and structure on the site should be in scale and in proportion
         with surrounding structures and not dominate the site or neighborhood. The
         structural design of all structures shall be of a conventional wood or metal frame
         construction meeting industry standards. The exterior finish must not have
         exposed rough lumber and must have a minimum of a stucco application, wood
         siding or similar material.”
Design reviewed is accomplished concurrently with the site plan review process. Therefore,
design review does not add to the processing timelines described in Chart B-4.

INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS                                  TECHNICAL APPENDIX B
a)      Objective Written Standards: Applicants for residential development permits can easily
determine what is required to satisfy the City’s design guidelines. Developers of single and
multiple dwelling units are familiar with the design guidelines and find compliance with them a
straightforward part of the development process. The guidelines are, in fact, written standards
(Section 18.50.100 of the Zoning Code) that are predominantly stated in quantitative terms so
that compliance can be measured by the applicant. For example, the design standards state the
following:
        1.      Electrical and mechanical equipment must be screened from public view.
        2.      New development should incorporate energy and water conservation design.
        3.      New development shall incorporate clay or concrete roof tile.
        4.      All utility lines shall be placed underground, including facilities and wires for
                power, telephone, gas, cable television, etc.
        5.      Window and door security gates or guards may only be installed on the interior of
                the structure.
        6.      Multi-family residential structures must incorporate architectural design
                guidelines details and elements which provide visual character and interest,
                avoiding flat planar walls and “box-like” appearances through the use of
                courtyards, balconies, offset planes and levels, deeply recessed or projecting
                windows, sloping roofs and landscaped yards.
        7.      Recycled materials or materials recovered from the demolished structures shall
                only be used for new construction or reconstruction if they are an integral part of
                a sustainable building design.
        8.      The minimum area for common open space shall be 250 square feet per unit.
b)      Impact on Housing Affordability: Landscaping, siding, windows, roofs, garage doors,
walls, fences, utility lines, etc. are all elements required to build a finished housing product.
These materials and elements are required of all housing regardless of whether the City has
design standards or not. Except for clay or concrete roof tile, the design guidelines/standards do
not require specific materials or products and therefore do not generate incremental costs
above those already required to build a finished home or apartment unit.
There is no negative impact on affordability because all new construction in Hawaiian Gardens
as well as other southern California cities exceeds the maximum housing costs affordable to
lower income households that are allowed by the provisions of the California Community
Redevelopment Law, Federal HOME Program, and Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Having
no design standards or guidelines does not reduce housing production costs to a level
affordable to lower income households.
To facilitate the development of housing affordable to lower income households, the City will
offer developers the opportunity to request minor deviations from design guidelines based upon
completion of a statement of cost savings as long as the architectural appearance remains
aesthetically pleasing. All approvals will be subject to review by the Community Development
Director. The City will establish this procedure by June 2010 and will monitor annually to ensure
the process is facilitating affordable housing development.

2)       Site Plan Review: By way of explanation, the purpose of the Site Plan Review process is
to ensure that:
         1.      Development in the City is consistent with the General Plan, the Zoning
                 Ordinance, and other regulations, plans and policies of the City;
         2.      Development in the City contributes to the long-term attractiveness of the
                 City;
         3.      Development in the City contributes to the economic vitality of the
                 community by ensuring compatibility of development throughout the
                 community; and
         4.      Development in the City contributes to the public safety, health, and
                 general welfare.
A site plan review is required for all development applications in the City. Development
applications which require other permits shall be subject to Site Plan Review and Approval as
part of the overall permit process.
The Community Development Director considers all applications for site plan review. The
Director has the authority to approve, conditionally approve or deny a site plan application,
based upon the findings listed below:
         1.      The proposed development is compatible with adjacent development and
                 development in the area;
         2.      The proposed development is consistent with the General Plan, the
                 Zoning Code, and other adopted City plans, policies and standards;
         3.      Building design and landscape materials are consistent with the design
                 standards and guidelines in the Zoning Code; and
         4.      Building or buildings may be developed across a property line, provided
                 the affected lots are legal parcels of record and are owned by the same
                 property owners and would be merged as one parcel as part of the
                 application and for the determination of development standards.
There is time savings because the Director may approve the site plan and design concurrently.
Rarely, does the Director need to refer a site plan and design to the Planning Commission. If a
site plan/design is referred to the Planning Commission a public hearing is required. The City
Council has the appeal authority for Site Plan Review and approval by the Planning
Commission.
Chapter 18.50.020 establishes the landscaping and screening standards in order to provide
landscaping and buffering guidelines to improve the aesthetic appearance of the City and to
promote compatibility between land uses. In addition, the standards encourage the use of water
efficient techniques in the design and maintenance of landscaping, promotes the safety of
pedestrians and motorists, and enhances the distinctive character of the City. The landscaping
standards apply to all new projects and additions and existing properties. Landscaping plans are
required of non single-family development. The Community Development Director has the
responsibility for approval of the submitted landscape plans.

3)       Overlay Zones: The City has two overlay zones. The Card Club Overlay Zone provides
for the development of card clubs, bingo parlors, and similar gaming uses in the underlying
General Commercial (C-4) Zone. The Planned Development Overlay Zone applies to sites that
are a minimum of one-acre in size within a single parcel or on contiguous parcels. There are no
vacant residential parcels that meet the minimum size standard for application of the PD
Overlay Zone.
4)       Processing Procedures for Residential Land Uses: Chart B-4 identifies the processing
procedures of single-family units, subdivisions and multi-family units. The processing times
reflect current practice in the City and do not unduly delay a residential project. A typical multi-
family project would not likely require an environmental impact report. There is only one vacant
multi-family site (1.42 acres) that may have a development proposal large enough to warrant an
EIR.

  For condominium projects, a Conditional Use permit is required and the processing time is four
months.

Site plan review and design review are accomplished concurrently and approved by the
Community Development Director. The tentative tract map and final map require approval by
the Planning Commission.
Chapter 18.100 of the Zoning Code completely describes administrative process for applications
such as CUPs, variance, and zone changes. The public is fully informed on what constitutes a
complete application, the review and approval standards, and the roles and responsibilities of
staff, the Planning Commission and City Council.
5)       Processing Procedures for Mixed Use Development: Mixed-use development will be a
permitted use in the C-4 General Commercial Zone. Chapter 18.60.040 of the Zoning Code will
be amended to state that mixed use development will be permitted subject to a minor use permit
in the C-4 Zone. The development standards of the C-4 Commercial Zone facilitate mixed use
development as it allows a 70% maximum lot coverage and building heights up to 45 feet.
Development processing in the C-4 Commercial Zone requires a site plan approval and
administrative review and approval. A site plan must include information such as topography

and proposed grading and existing and proposed structures. The Community Development
Director considers all applications for site plan review. The Director has the authority to
approve, conditionally approve, or deny site plan approval. The approval of site plans must
include the following findings:
         1.       The proposed development is compatible with adjacent development and
                  development in the area;
         2.       The proposed development is consistent with the General Plan, this Zoning
                  Code, and other adopted City plans, policies and standards;
         3.       Building design and landscape materials are consistent with the design
                  standards and guidelines in this Zoning Code; and
         4.       Building or buildings may be developed across a property line, provided the
                  affected lots are legal parcels of record and are owned by the same property
                  owners and would be merged as one parcel as part of the application and for the
                  determination of development standards.
An administrative approval is required of all new construction. The administrative and site plan
approvals are processed concurrently and subject to approval by the Community Development
Director. A public hearing before the Planning Commission is only required if the applicant
wants to appeal the Director’s decision.
c.       Conclusions and Findings
The City concludes that the processing and permitting procedures do not pose a constraint
upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels. Multi-
family rental housing is permitted in the R-2, R-3 and R-4 residential zones. Landscaping and
design standards are needed in order to ensure that new housing enhances neighborhood
quality. Review processes for landscaping and design plans are minimal, as the Community
Development Director has the authority to approve the submitted plans.

6.       Constraints on Housing for Disabled Persons
a.       Guidelines
         Analyze potential and actual constraints upon the development, maintenance
         and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities and demonstrate local
         efforts to remove any such constraints.
More specifically, HCD recommends an analysis -
         To identify whether the locality has an established reasonable accommodation
         procedure, review zoning laws, policies, and practices for compliance with fair
         housing laws; evaluate permits and processing as they affect applications from
         disabled persons; and review Building Code amendments and practices that
         might diminish the ability to accommodate persons with disabilities.

b.       Analysis
1)       Reasonable Accommodation Procedure: HCD recommends the analysis -
         Identify whether the locality has an established reasonable accommodation
         procedure and describe how that procedure operates with respect to zoning,
         permit processing, or building codes, accommodating procedures for the
         approval of licensed residential care facilities, Fair Housing Amendment Act
         (FHAA) physical accessibility efforts, and an evaluation of the zoning code for
         FHAA compliance.
The City has not adopted a formal procedure for a disabled applicant’s request for a reasonable
accommodation. Generally, a request for reasonable accommodation may include a
modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and
use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a
person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice.
Attachment B (pg. 35) contains information on group homes, local zoning, and the importance of
adopting a “reasonable accommodation procedure.” Attachment C (pg. 37) provides additional
information specific to a reasonable accommodation procedure.
The Federal Departments’ of Justice (DOJ) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as well
as the California Attorney General all encourage cities to adopt a reasonable accommodation
procedure. For example, both DOJ and HUD state that -
         “Local governments are encouraged to provide mechanisms for requesting
         reasonable accommodations that operate promptly and efficiently, without
         imposing significant costs or delays. The local government should also make
         efforts to insure that the availability of such mechanisms is well known within the
         community.”*
         *Joint Statement of the Department of Justice and the Department of Housing and Urban
         Development, Group Homes, Local Land Use, and the Fair Housing Act, August 18,
         1999, page 4.
On May 15, 2001 the State Attorney General transmitted a letter to all local governments
advising the localities to consider adoption of a reasonable accommodation procedure. In that
letter, the Attorney General stated:
         “Both the federal Fair Housing Act (‘FHA’) and the California Fair Employment
         and Housing Act (‘FEHA’) impose an affirmative duty on local governments to
         make reasonable accommodations (i.e., modifications or exceptions) in their
         zoning laws and other land use regulations and practices when such
         accommodations ‘may be necessary to afford’ disabled persons ‘an equal
         opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.’”
The City has a Minor Exception Permit that the Community Development Director can approve
or disapprove. However, the City will adopt a specific reasonable accommodation procedure, as
it would directly respond to the issues discussed by DOJ, HUD and the State Attorney General
Office.

2)       Zoning and Land Use: HCD recommends -
         A review of all zoning laws, policies and practices for compliance with fair
         housing laws; broaden the definition of family, identify zones allowing licensed
         residential care facilities including those zones where facilities for seven or more
         persons are permitted, review siting or separation requirements for licensed
         residential care facilities, and residential parking requirements for persons with
         disabilities.
a)       Definition of Family: In 1980, the California Supreme Court in the City of Santa Barbara
v. Adamson struck down a municipal ordinance that permitted any number of related people to
live in a house in a R1 zone, but limited the number of unrelated people who were allowed to do
so to five. A group home for individuals with disabilities that functions like a family could be
excluded from the R1 zone solely because the residents are unrelated by blood, marriage or
adoption.
Both State and Federal fair housing laws prohibit definitions of family that either intentionally
discriminate against people with disabilities or have the effect of excluding such individuals from
housing. Fair housing laws, for instance, prohibit definitions of family that limit the development
and siting of group homes for individuals with disabilities (but not families similarly sized and
situated). Such definitions are prohibited because they could have the effective of denying
housing opportunities to those who, because of their disability, live in a group setting. The
failure to modify the definition of family or make an exception for group homes for people with
disabilities may also constitute a refusal to make a reasonable accommodation under the Fair
Housing Act.
The City’s definition of family is:
         An individual or two or more persons living as a family.
The City’s definition does not refer to related persons or to a maximum number of persons
comprising a family. Therefore, the family definition is not inconsistent with fair housing laws.
As mentioned in a recent study, a definition of family should look to whether the household
functions as a cohesive unit instead of distinguishing between related and unrelated persons.
The definition of “family” should emphasize the functioning of members as a cohesive
household. Two examples are given below and on the next page.
         Example #1: One or more persons living together as a single housekeeping unit
         in a dwelling unit.
         Single housekeeping unit: One person or two or more individuals living together
         sharing household responsibilities and activities including, for example, sharing
         expenses, chores, eating evening meals together and participating in recreational
         activities and having close social, economic and psychological commitments to
         each other.
         Dwelling unit: A group of two or more rooms, one of which is a kitchen, designed
         for occupancy by one family for living and sleeping purposes.
         Example #2: Any group of individuals living together as the functional equivalent
         of a family where the residents share living expenses and chores, eat meals

         together and are a close group with social, economic and psychological
         commitments to each other. A family includes, for example, the residents of
         residential care facilities and group homes for people with disabilities. A family
         does not include larger institutional group living situations such as dormitories,
         fraternities, sororities, monasteries or nunneries.
The City may refine its definition to reference households, housekeeping unit, and that the
definition explicitly includes the “residents of residential care facilities and group homes for
people with disabilities.”
b)       Zones Allowing Residential Care Facilities: Residential care facilities, as defined by the
California Health and Safety Code, are permitted as a principal use in the City’s residential
zones. However, they are subject to approval of a Minor Use Permit whereas single-family
homes are not. This permit requirement is inconsistent with State law.
However, a Minor Use Permit is a straightforward process that is neither costly nor time
consuming. A Minor Use Permit is approved or disapproved at the staff level. The chart below
describes the nature and scope of a Minor Use Permit.
                                     18.100.050 Minor Use Permit
Purpose. Certain land uses are relatively minor in nature and with relatively little potential for
adverse impacts on the surrounding community or the environment. These uses are subject to
approval of a Minor Use Permit by the Community Development Director.
Application. Applications for Minor Use Permits must be submitted for uses allowed as minor
uses in the applicable zone, as listed in Section 18.40.070 Permitted Uses in Residential Zones
and Section 18.60.040 Permitted Uses in Non-Residential Zones.
Processing. The Community Development Director may approve a Minor Use Permit, approve
with conditions, or deny the permit. Permit processing and approval of a Minor Use Permit shall
follow the procedures shown in Figure B.
Recommendation and Decision. The Community Development Director shall consider all
applications for Minor Use Permits, whose decision is final, unless an appeal is filed to the
Planning Commission in accordance with Section 18.100.170 Appeals, below.
Required Findings. In granting a Minor Use Permit, the Director shall make the following
findings:
a. That the proposed use is consistent with the General Plan;
b. That the proposed use is not contrary to the objectives of this Zoning Code or to the
objectives of the applicable regulations;
c. That the proposed use will be located, operated, and maintained in a manner consistent with
the policies of the General Plan and the provisions of this Zoning Code;
d. That the proposed use will not be detrimental to the property or improvements in the
surrounding area or the public health, safety, or general welfare.
As noted elsewhere, the City will amend the Zoning Code to permit residential care facilities for
six or fewer persons in all zones that permit single-family homes. As a result, a Minor Use
Permit for this land use no longer would be required.
Under California state law, licensed facilities serving six persons or fewer receive special land
use protection. California requires that many types of licensed facilities serving six persons or
fewer be treated for zoning purposes like single-family homes. Except in extraordinary cases in
B-28                                                                                   January 2010

which even a single-family home requires a conditional use permit, these laws bar conditional
use permits for facilities that serve six or fewer persons.
The land use protection applies to --
         Intermediate care facilities for individuals who have developmental disabilities
         (Health and Safety Code Section 1267.8)
         Residential facilities for persons with disabilities and for abused children (Health
         and Safety Code Section 1566.3, and Welfare and Institution Code Section 5116)
         Residential care facility for the elderly (Health and Safety Code Section 1569.87)
         Alcoholism and drug treatment facilities (Health and Safety Code Section
         11834.23)
         Residential facilities for persons with chronic life threatening illness (Health and
         Safety Code Section 1568.0831)*
         *Law Offices of Goldfarb & Lipman, Between the Lines: A Question and Answer Guide on
         Legal Issues in Supportive Housing, 1999, pg. 110.
For example, Health and Safety Code Section 11834.23 (Zoning Laws) states:
         Whether or not unrelated persons are living together, an alcoholism or drug
         abuse recovery or treatment facility, which serves six or fewer persons shall be
         considered a residential use of property for the purposes of this article. In
         addition, the residents and operators of such a facility shall be considered a
         family for the purposes of any law or zoning ordinance which relates to the
         residential use of property….”
Furthermore:
         “No conditional use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance shall be
         required of an alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facility which
         serves six or fewer persons that is not required of a single-family residence in the
         same zone.”
         [emphasis added]
Essentially, identical provisions are stated with regard to a residential facility, which serves six
or fewer persons. A residential facility
         “…means any family home, group care facility, or similar facility for 24-hour
         nonmedical care of persons in need of personal services, supervision, or
         assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living or for the protection
         of the individual.
Health and Safety Code Section 1566.3 states:
         “No conditional use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance shall be
         required of a residential facility which serves six or fewer persons which is not
         required of a family dwelling of the same type in the same zone.”

INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS                                     TECHNICAL APPENDIX B
Further:
        “’family dwelling,’ includes, but is not limited to, single-family dwellings, units in
        multifamily dwellings, including units in duplexes and units in apartment
        dwellings, mobilehomes, including mobilehomes located in mobilehome parks,
        units in cooperatives, units in condominiums, units in townhouses, and units in
        planned developments.”
To achieve consistency with fair housing laws, the City will amend the Zoning Code with respect
to permitting residential care facilities for six or fewer persons in all zones that permit single-
family homes. As a part of the Zoning Code amendments, the City may establish an all-inclusive
term such as “licensed group homes” to identify the scope of residential care facilities to be
permitted unconditionally.
In addition, State law requires that residential care facilities not be defined within the meaning of
boarding house, rooming house, institution or home for the care of minors, the aged, or the
mentally infirm, foster care home, guest home, rest home, sanitarium, mental hygiene home, or
other similar term which implies that a residential facility is a business run for profit.
The City’s Zoning Code has definitions for two of these terms. Boarding House and Rooming
House have the same definition:
        “A structure used for residential purposes, other than a hotel, with access
        provided through a common entrance to guest rooms that have no cooking
        facilities, in which lodging and meals are provided for compensation.”
c)      Residential Care Facilities for Seven or More Persons: In the single-family zones, the
Zoning Code prohibits residential care facilities having seven or more persons. Such uses are
conditionally permitted in the R-2, R-3 and R-4 residential zones. State law -- as the summary
below explains -- allows cities to require a conditional use permit for residential care facilities for
seven or more persons.
        “Because California law only protects facilities serving six or fewer residents,
        many cities and counties restrict the location of facilities housing seven or more
        clients. They may do this by requiring use permits, adopting special parking and
        other standards for these homes, or prohibiting these large facilities outright in
        certain zoning districts. While this practice may raise fair housing issues, no
        published California decision prohibits the practice, and analyses of recent State
        legislation appear to assume that localities can restrict facilities with seven or
        more clients. Some cases in other federal circuits have found that requiring a
        conditional use permit for large group homes violates the federal Fair Housing
        Act. However, the federal Ninth Circuit, whose decisions are binding in
        California, found that requiring a conditional use permit for a building atypical in
        size and bulk for a single-family residence does not violate the Fair Housing Act.*

        Recovery Facilities and Group Homes, pg. 3, (presented at the Residential Recovery

TECHNICAL APPENDIX B                          INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
However, the City would adhere to the DOJ and HUD interpretation of the Fair Housing Act. In
this regard, the two Departments state that
         “…because persons with disabilities are entitled to request reasonable
         accommodations in rules and policies, the group home for seven persons with
         disabilities would have to be given the opportunity to seek an exception or
         waiver.”
The reasonable accommodation procedure – to be developed and adopted as part of the
Housing Program – will make explicit that facilities housing seven or more disabled persons
may seek an exception or waiver from the Zoning Code standards. Consequently, residential
care facilities for seven or more persons would be processed through a reasonable
accommodation procedure (per the DOJ/HUD guidelines) instead of through either a CUP or
variance process.
d)       Siting or Separation Requirements for Licensed Residential Care Facilities: The City’s
Zoning Code does not establish siting or separation requirements for the facilities.
Over concentration of certain care homes in a neighborhood is regulated by the State for
licensed facilities. Except for foster homes and elderly care, licenses issued by the California
Department of Social Services (CDSS) must be a minimum of 300 feet away from any other
licensed home (as measured from the outside walls of the house – Health and Safety Code
Section 1520.5) If a home is less than the 300 feet, an exemption must be granted by the city,
otherwise the license in denied. This 300-foot separation restriction does not apply to licenses
issued by the State Department of Alcohol and Drugs for rehabilitation homes.
CDSS must submit any application for a facility covered by the law to the city where the facility
will be located. The city may request that the license be denied based on the over
concentration or an existing facility (or within 1,000 feet of a congregate living health facility)
unless the city approves the application. Even if there is adequate separation between the
facilities, a city or county may ask that the license be denied based on over concentration.
These separation requirements apply only to facilities with the same type of license. For
instance, a community care facility would not violate the separation requirements even if located
next to a drug and alcohol treatment facility.
The City complies with fair housing laws as they relate to spacing and separation requirements.
The City has not adopted a standard different from or more stringent than the one the State
applies. Moreover, the DOJ and HUD acknowledge that neighborhoods as well as the disabled
may suffer if licensed residential care facilities are over concentrated. The DOJ and HUD offer
the following guidance:
         “…if a neighborhood came to be composed largely of group homes, that could
         adversely affect individuals with disabilities and would be inconsistent with the
         objective of integrating persons with disabilities into the community. Especially in
         the licensing and regulatory process, it is appropriate to be concerned about the
         setting for a group home. A consideration of over-concentration could be
         considered in this context. This objective does not, however, justify requiring
         separations which have the effect of foreclosing group homes from locating in
         entire neighborhoods.”

         Development, Group Homes, Local Land Use, and the Fair Housing Act, August 18,
         1999, page 4.)
e)       Parking Requirements for Persons with Disabilities: The City’s parking standards are
established for different uses, not in terms of the occupants of the use. For instance, the City
does not have parking standards for single- or multi-family housing occupied by disabled or
elderly persons.
The City, however, recognizes that disabled persons who occupy licensed residential care
facilities generate a parking need different from non-disabled persons.                 For instance,
developmentally disabled persons may not have licenses to drive a car. The “reasonable
accommodation procedure” will include an opportunity for disabled persons (or their
representatives) to request a reduction and/or waiver of parking requirements.
3)       Permits and Processing: According to HCD -
         Issues to evaluate include the process for requesting retrofit for accessibility,
         ensuring compliance with all State laws regulating permit requirement of licensed
         residential care facilities with fewer than six persons in single-family zones, and
         identification of any conditions or use restrictions for licensed residential care
         facilities with greater than 6 persons or group homes that will be providing
         services on-site.
a)       Requesting Retrofit for Accessibility: Non-structural retrofits within buildings like adding
grab bars, replacing doorknobs with single-lever doorknobs, and exchanging toilets do not
require building permits, or City approvals. Structural retrofits like widening doorways or
constructing ramps requires a building permit. These requirements are the same for single- and
multi-family housing. Tenants residing in apartments must first obtain permission from the
owner and/or property manager to make the retrofits.
b)       Ensuring Compliance with all State Laws Regulating Requirements for Licensed
Residential Care Facilities: As explained earlier, the City will complete Zoning Code
amendments in order to ensure compliance with all State laws that regulate licensed residential
care facilities.
c)       Conditions or Use Restrictions for Licensed Residential Care Facilities with Greater than
6 persons or Group Homes that will be Providing Services On-Site: Apart from requiring a Minor
Use Permit, the City has no other conditions or use restrictions on group homes serving seven
or more persons.
4)       Building Codes: HCD recommends the analysis -
         The year of the Uniform Building Code adoption and any amendments that might
         diminish the ability to accommodate persons with disabilities, identification of
         adopted universal design elements in the building code, the provision of
         reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities in the enforcement of
         building codes and the issuance of building permits.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX B                            INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
a)       Building Code Adoption and Amendments: In November 2007, the City Council adopted
Ordinance No. 519 that approved the use of the 2007 California Building Code, effective
January 1, 2008. The City adheres to the Title 24 accessibility requirements.
b)       Universal Design Elements: The City understands that universal design aims to serve all
people of all ages, sizes, and abilities and is applied to all buildings. For instance, a universal
design feature is any component of a house that can be used by everyone regardless of his or
her level of ability or disability. A feature, for instance, such as no steps at entrances. Or single-
lever water controls at all plumbing fixtures and faucets.
Although the City has not adopted a “universal design ordinance” this is not deemed a
constraint on existing or new housing for disabled persons. The application of universal design
requirements would have limited application, given the scarcity of vacant and underutilized land.
c)       Building Code Reasonable Accommodations: The City, as described earlier, does not
have a reasonable accommodation procedure with respect to modifications of zoning
development standards. A procedure will be prepared and adopted for building code
modifications as well as ones pertaining to zoning.
c.       Conclusions and Findings
The City will amend the Zoning Code to ensure that its rules, policies, and standards are
consistent with fair housing laws. The City, as previously explained, will develop a reasonable
accommodation procedure that encompasses both zoning and building standards. Guidance
for developing the procedure will be obtained from disabled persons and advocacy groups.
Once adopted, the reasonable accommodation procedure will be explained on the City’s
website and prominently displayed at both the Planning Division and Building Division counters.
In addition, the City will amend the Zoning Code to ensure that residential care facilities for six
or fewer persons are permitted in all zones that permit single-family homes. In addition,
residential care facilities for seven or more persons would be processed through a reasonable
accommodation procedure (per the DOJ/HUD guidelines) instead of through either a CUP or
variance process.
7.       Constraints on Meeting the City’s Share of the Regional Housing Need
a.       Guidelines
The Housing Element Law requires the City to identify and remove any governmental
constraints that hinder meeting the community’s share of the regional housing need. Moreover,
in regulating subdivisions, Government Code Section 65913.2 provides --
         that a local government may not impose design criteria for the purpose of
         rendering an affordable housing development infeasible. A community may not
         impose standards and criteria for public improvements (e.g. streets, sewers,
         schools, or parks) that exceed those imposed on other developments in similar
         zones. Additionally, the effect of a community’s ordinances and actions on
         accommodating the housing needs of the region must be considered.

b.      Analysis
145 housing units have been allocated to the City as its share of the regional housing need
(Final Regional Housing Needs Assessment). The information in Technical Appendix D shows
that public Services and facilities are adequate to accommodate new residential development
equivalent to the City’s regional share.
c.      Conclusions and Findings
There are no local governmental constraints that would prevent the City from meeting its share
of the regional housing need. The non-governmental constraints such as the cost of land and
construction do create constraints on the development of housing affordable to all income
levels.

                       Joint Statement of the Department of Justice and
                      the Department of Housing and Urban Development
                   Group Homes, Local Land Use, and the Fair Housing Act
                                          August 18, 1999
The DOJ and HUD in August 1999 issued a Joint Statement pertaining to several issues on
housing for the disabled. Group homes and local procedures to consider requests for
reasonable accommodations were among the issues addressed in the Joint Statement. Below is
a summary of the Joint Statement.
       “…the term ‘group home’ refers to housing occupied by groups of unrelated
       individuals with disabilities. Sometimes, but not always, housing is provided by
       organizations that also offer services for individuals with disabilities living in the
       group home. Sometimes it is this group home operator, rather than the
       individuals who live in the home, that interacts with local government in seeking
       permits and making requests for reasonable accommodations on behalf of those
       individuals.
       “The term ‘group home’ is also sometimes applied to any group of unrelated
       persons who live together in a dwelling – such as a group of students who
       voluntarily agree to share the rent on a house. The Act does not generally affect
       the ability of local governments to regulate housing of this kind, as long as they
       do not discriminate against residents on the basis of race, color, national origin,
       religion, sex, handicap (disability) or familial status (families with minor children).
       “The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap.
       “Handicap” has the same legal meaning as the term “disability.” Persons with
       disabilities (handicaps) are individuals with physical or mental impairments that
       substantially limit one or more major life activities. The term physical or mental
       impairment may include conditions such as blindness, hearing impairment,
       mobility impairment, HIV infection, mental retardation, alcoholism, drug addiction,
       chronic fatigue, learning disability, head injury, and mental illness. The term
       major life activity may include seeing, hearing, walking, breathing, performing
       manual tasks, caring for oneself, learning, speaking, or working.
       “Local zoning and land use laws that treat groups of unrelated persons with
       disabilities less favorably than similar groups of unrelated persons without
       disabilities violate the Fair Housing Act. For example, suppose a city’s zoning
       ordinance defines “family” to include up to six unrelated persons living together
       as a household unit, and gives such a group of unrelated persons the right to live
       in any zoning district without special permission. If that ordinance also disallows
       a group home for six or fewer people with disabilities in a certain district or
       requires this home to seek a use permit, such requirements would conflict with
       the Fair Housing Act. The ordinance treats persons with disabilities worse than
       persons without disabilities.”
B-42                                                                                      January 2010

TECHNICAL APPENDIX B                            INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
         “A local government may generally restrict the ability of groups of unrelated
         persons to live together as long as the restrictions are imposed on all such
         groups. Thus, in the case where a family is defined to include up to six unrelated
         people, an ordinance would not, on its face, violate the Act if a group home of
         seven unrelated people with disabilities was not allowed to locate in single-family
         zoned neighborhood, because a group of seven unrelated people without
         disabilities would also not be allowed.”
         “As a general rule, the Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to make
         ‘reasonable accommodations’ (modifications or exceptions) to rules, policies,
         practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford
         persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling.
         “Even though a zoning ordinance imposes on group homes the same restrictions
         it imposes on other groups of unrelated people, a local government may be
         required, in individual cases and when requested to do so, to grant a reasonable
         accommodation to a group home for persons with disabilities. For example, it
         may be a reasonable accommodation to waive a setback required so that a
         paved path of travel can be provided to residents who have mobility impairments.
         A similar waiver might not be required for a different type of group home where
         residents do not have difficulty negotiating steps and do not need a setback in
         order to have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
         “Where a local zoning scheme specifies procedures for seeking a departure from
         the general rule, courts have decided, and the Department of Justice and HUD
         agree, that these procedures must ordinarily be followed. If no procedure is
         specified, persons with disabilities may, nevertheless, request a reasonable
         accommodation in some other way, and a local government is obligated to grant
         it if it meets the criteria discussed above. A local government’s failure to respond
         to a request for reasonable accommodation or an inordinate delay in responding
         could also violate the Act.
         ”Whether a procedure for requesting accommodations is provided or not, if local
         government officials have previously made statements or otherwise indicated
         that an application would not receive fair consideration, or if the procedure itself
         is discriminatory, then the individuals with disabilities living in a group home
         (and/or operator) might be able to go to court to request an order for an
         accommodation.
         “Local governments are encouraged to provide mechanisms for requesting
         reasonable accommodations that operate promptly and efficiently, without
         imposing significant costs or delays. The local government should also make
         efforts to insure that the availability of such mechanisms is well known within the
         community.”*

                                            Attachment C
                 Background Material – Reasonable Accommodation Procedure
State of California Guidance -- Office of the Attorney General
On May 15, 2001 the State Attorney General transmitted a letter to all local governments
advising the localities to consider adoption of a reasonable accommodation procedure. In that
letter, the Attorney General stated:
         “Both the federal Fair Housing Act (‘FHA’) and the California Fair Employment
         and Housing Act (‘FEHA’) impose an affirmative duty on local governments to
         make reasonable accommodations (i.e., modifications or exceptions) in their
         zoning laws and other land use regulations and practices when such
         accommodations ‘may be necessary to afford’ disabled persons ‘an equal
         opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.’”
Many jurisdictions currently handle requests for relief from the zoning ordinance through
variance or conditional use permits. The Attorney General also remarked that:
         “…the criteria for determining whether to grant a variance or conditional use
         permit typically differ from those which govern the determination whether a
         requested accommodation is reasonable within the meaning of fair housing laws.
         “Thus, municipalities relying upon these alternative procedures have found
         themselves in the position of having refused to approve a project as a result of
         considerations which, while sufficient to justify the refusal under the criteria
         applicable to grant of a variance or conditional use permit, were insufficient to
         justify the denial when judged in light of the fair housing laws’ reasonable
         accommodations mandate.”
The Attorney General also stated that the variance and conditional use permit procedures – with
their different governing criteria – serve to encourage community opposition to projects housing
the disabled. The Attorney General then wrote:
         “Yet this is the very type of opposition that, for example, the typical conditional
         use permit procedure, with its general health, safety and welfare standard, would
         seem rather predictably to invite, whereas a procedure conducted pursuant to the
         more focused criteria applicable to the reasonable accommodation determination
         would not.”
Definitions of Reasonable Accommodation Procedure
One city has defined the purpose of this procedure as:
         “Codification of a formal procedure for persons with disabilities seeking equal
         access to housing to request reasonable accommodation in the application of the
         City's land use regulations, and establishment of relevant criteria to be used
         when considering such requests to ensure prompt, fair and efficient handling of
         such requests in accordance with the fair housing laws' reasonable
         accommodation mandate.”
B-44                                                                                   January 2010

TECHNICAL APPENDIX B                         INVENTORY OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Another city has defined this procedure as follows:
         “It is the purpose of this chapter, in compliance with the Fair Housing Laws, to
         provide a procedure to evaluate requests for reasonable accommodation related
         to specific applications of the zoning law in order to assure that no person is
         discriminated against because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation,
         familial status, marital status, disability, national origin, source of income, or
         ancestry by being denied an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling and to
         authorize the application of exceptions to the zoning law if warranted.”
Factors Considered In Evaluating a Request for a Reasonable Accommodation
A request for a fair housing reasonable accommodation considers the following factors:
         Is the housing, which is the subject of the request for reasonable
         accommodation, to be used by an individual protected under fair housing laws?
         Is the request for reasonable accommodation necessary to make specific
         housing available to an individual protected under fair housing laws?
         Will the requested accommodation impose an undue financial or administrative
         burden on the jurisdiction?
         Will the requested accommodation require a fundamental alteration in the zoning
         code?
If the applicant establishes protection under the law and that the requested accommodation is
necessary, then the accommodation must be provided unless a city can present evidence that
doing so would either create an undue burden or result in a fundamental alteration of the code.
Many requests for accommodation involve a modification or waiver of a regulation or procedure.
This accommodation would be a request for non-enforcement of a rule and, therefore, not
create an undue burden.
In addition to not imposing an undue financial or administrative burden, a reasonable
accommodation must also not result in the “fundamental alteration” in the nature of a zoning
program. In the land use and zoning context, “fundamental alteration in the nature of the
program” means an alteration so far reaching that it would change the essential zoning scheme
of a municipality. In most instances, granting a request to modify or waive a zoning policy or
procedure does not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program.

A.       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.       Overview
For purposes of providing guidance to cities, HCD has offered the following advice:
         Although nongovernmental constraints are primarily market driven and
         generally outside direct government control, localities can significantly
         influence and offset the negative impact of nongovernmental constraints
         through responsive programs and policies. Analyzing specific housing
         cost components including the cost of land, construction costs, and the
         availability of financing assists the locality in developing and implementing
         housing and land-use programs that respond to existing local or regional
         conditions. While the price of new housing depends on some factors
         beyond a locality’s control, local governments can create essential site
         preconditions (favorable zoning and development standards, fast track
         permit processing, etc.) that encourage and facilitate development of a
         variety of housing types and prices.
         (State Department of Housing and Community Development, Housing Element
         Questions & Answers, October 2006, page 34.)
The analysis must include:
                Availability of financing
                Price of land
                Cost of construction
In addition, the analysis includes the cost of existing and new housing, as well as
monthly rental housing costs.
2.       Summary of Non-Governmental Constraints
a.       Affordable Housing Costs
Land, construction and financing costs each contribute to establishing the minimum
costs to produce housing.
Financing costs have been at historic lows for several years and are still at low levels
compared to the interest rates prevailing in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.
In Hawaiian Gardens, as well as other southern California cities, land costs alone and
construction costs alone exceed the housing costs “affordable” to lower income
households. What this means is that the private housing market cannot produce new
rental or ownership housing within the means of lower income households.
Basically, the dollar amount that can be expended on housing is far below what it takes
to produce new housing. Economists refer to this fact as “ineffective demand” – a
demand too weak to make new housing production feasible for certain income groups.

NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS                                   TECHNICAL APPENDIX C
State and Federal laws define “lower” income and stipulate the monthly costs that are
“affordable” for this income group. “Affordable” housing costs for lower income
households are determined by four factors:
               Household income ceilings (which vary by household size)
               Gross monthly housing costs (as set forth by State and Federal
                housing programs)
               Expenses subtracted from the gross monthly housing costs
               Net monthly income available for contract rent or a loan payment
Attachment A explains how affordable housing costs are computed and the payments
and expenses subtracted from the gross monthly affordable housing costs. After these
expenses and payments are deducted, the net monthly affordable costs equal about
60% to 70% of the gross costs. Tables C-1 and C-2 indicate the gross monthly costs
affordable to renter and owners in the extremely low, very low, and lower income groups.

b.       Availability of Financing
Financing has been readily available until early 2007. Because of the large number of
southern California owners defaulting on subprime loans and the number of foreclosed
homes, financing is not as available as it was prior to these two events. The number of
approved loans also has dropped as mortgage loan standards have tightened, including
the unavailability of 100% financing, the need for larger down payments, verified income,
and a requirement for a solid credit history including high FICO scores.
As a result, the loan denial rates reported on Tables C-3 and C-4 should be interpreted
with some caution. In part, the denial rates reflect periods of both easy credit approvals
and financing and the start of more stringent standards in mid-2006. The numbers of
City homeowners with notices of default is unknown at this time, as is the number of
foreclosed properties.
For borrowers with a solid credit history, savings to pay a 20% down payment and good
income, financing is still available at reasonable interest rates. Fixed rate, 30-year loans
are available for interest rates in the range of 6.0 to 6.5%. However, “jumbo” loans more
than $417,000 have higher interest rates.
c.       Price of Land
Vacant land, which means lots, is extremely scarce. In fact, no lots were sold in 2006
or 2007 according to the MLS Alliance. As such simple rules of supply and demand will
dictate that prices will be high for vacant and potential re-use sites.
d.       Cost of Construction
The cost of construction varies considerably due to several factors including the quality
of construction. Utilizing average per square foot construction costs for a standard
quality stucco on frame dwelling -- 1,600 square foot, three-bedroom home with an
attached two-car garage -- would cost an estimated $190,900 to build. The average per
square foot costs includes general contractor’s overhead and profit and fees for new
construction. Land costs, financing and other real estate related costs are not included,
however.
Consequently, the cost of construction often – if not always – exceeds the total housing
costs affordable by lower income households.

a.      Guidelines
HCD guidance on this nongovernmental factor states:
        This analysis could indicate whether mortgage deficient areas or
        underserved groups exist in the community.
        A lack of, or limited access to, take out (new construction, rehabilitation,
        and/or permanent (mortgage) financing could be addressed through
        responsive housing finance programs such as mortgage revenue
        bonding, a mortgage credit certificate program, use of tax credits, first
        time homebuyer and down payment assistance programs, and/or
        targeted low-interest CDBG or HOME rehabilitation loans.
        (The italicized text is guidance provided by the State Department of Housing and
        Community Development in Housing Element Questions and Answers, October
        2006, pg. 35.)
b.      Analysis
1)      HMDA Data: HCD has advised cities that an understanding of the geographic
areas and/or groups without sufficient access to credit will help localities to design
programs to address known deficiencies. The information that helps most to understand
the geographic areas served by credit is the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act or HMDA
data.
HMDA requires lenders to disclose the number, amount, and census tract location of
mortgage and home improvement loan applications. The HMDA data encompasses
lender activity for conventional, FHA, home improvement loans and refinancing loans.
The data identifies five types of action taken on a loan application: loan originated,
application approved by the lender and not accepted by the applicant, application
withdrawn, file closed for incompleteness and application denied.
The 2005 and 2006 denial rates were computed using HMDA data based on the
applications that went completely through the underwriting process because a denial
could not be made on withdrawn or incomplete applications. Therefore, the denial rate
is based on the number of loans denied as a percentage of loans originated +
applications approved but not accepted + applications denied.
According to the both 2005 and 2006 HMDA data, there was only one FHA loan reported
during the two years. This is not surprising because the majority of Hawaiian Gardens’
single family housing prices exceed the maximum FHA loan limit for single-family
dwellings, which in 2007 was $362,790.
C-4                                                                                January 2010

TECHNICAL APPENDIX C                              NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
2)       Conventional Loan Applications: The number of conventional loan applications
was 761 and 637 in 2005 and 2006, respectively. In 2005, 159 of 761 loan applications
were denied – 20.9%. In 2006, 177 of 637 loan applications were denied – 27.8%.
Between 2005 and 2006 the number and percentage of denied conventional loan
applications increased.
In 2005 and 2006, the number of loan applications on a census tract basis ranged from
low 100’s to the low 200’s. In 2005, the census tract with the highest denial rate was
5551.02. In 2006, the census tract with the highest denial rate was 5552.12. This finding
is important because it means that the same census tracts (geographic areas) do not
consistently have the highest loan denial rates. Refer to Tables C-3 and C-5. Exhibit C-1
on page C-9 shows the census tract boundaries.
3)       Home Improvement Loan Applications: Usually, home improvement loan
applicants experience the highest loan denial rates. In Hawaiian Gardens, there are few
home improvement loan applicants compared to conventional loan applicants. In fact,
the ratio of conventional loan applicants to home improvement loan applicants was
nearly 5:1. From 2005 to 2006 the denial rate decreased from 33.9% to 28.3%.
Occasionally, it is helpful to focus improvement programs in neighborhoods with high
denial rates. The City may consider focusing efforts and/or having lenders refer denied
applicants to the City’s programs. Refer to tables C-4 and C-6.
4)       Reasons for Conventional Loan Denials: Data on “reasons” is available only for
the entire Los Angeles County area. Table C-7 shows the nine reasons for a loan
denial. Unfortunately, the largest category is “other.” For the known reasons, “credit
history” and “unverifiable information” are the two highest reasons a lender gives for
denying a conventional loan application. Downpayment assistance programs may be of
help to applicants who are denied because of “debt-to-income ratios,” “lack of collateral,”
and “insufficient cash.” It seems unlikely that the City can develop programs to overcome
the other denial reasons.
5)       Reasons for Home Improvement Loan Denials: Table C-8 shows the nine
reasons for a home improvement loan denial. For the known reasons, “credit history”
and “debt-to-income” are the two highest reasons a lender gives for denying a home
improvement loan application. The City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program can assist
some of these denied applicants through grants and deferred loans. These grants and
deferred loans would not increase an applicant’s debt-to-income ratio. In addition, the
City can be somewhat more lenient than a private lender insofar as past credit history.

6)      Denial Rates, Low Income, and Minority Populations by Census Tract: The
Housing Element uses HMDA in part to identify areas – that is, census tracts – where
denial rates are higher compared to other areas. The idea is that geographic areas may
be mortgage deficient because of the characteristics – that is, the people – residing in
the area. Historically, redlining -- or the practice of drawing a boundary around areas
where loans would not be made, or if made, on terms less favorable than in other areas
– was done because of the minority and/or low income population characteristics of the
area.
Table C-9 shows loan denial rates and the percentage of the population that is low/mod
income (<80% median income) and minority by census tract. The census tracts are in
rank order – high to low – based on the conventional loan denial rates. The data show
that the census tract with the highest percent of low/mod income actually had the second
lowest denial rate. The census tract with the highest conventional loan denial rate had
the second lowest percentage of low-income persons.

It is important to remember that the census tract location in Table C-9 refers to the
property location on which a loan application was made. However, borrowers who live
outside the City frequently make the loan applications, and the reasons for denial may
be due entirely to the credit worthiness of the borrower, and not the characteristics of a
census tract.

7)       Market Interest Rates: For a sustained period, market mortgage interest rates
have been either very reasonable or at historic lows. Table C-10 shows interest rates for
two points in time. According to a weekly survey of 60 southland lenders, as of January
6, 2008, the average mortgage interest rates on fixed rate loans decreased by 32 basis
points during the past six months. For loans up to $417,000, a 30-year fixed rate loan is
available at an interest of 5.92%, a rate that is very reasonable compared to historic
rates. However, for adjustable rate loans, the interest rates for conforming and “jumbo”
loan amounts have increased.

It should be noted that not all would be homebuyers would qualify for the lowest interest
rates available. The most favorable interest rates are available to loan applicants who
have good FICO credit scores.
(FICO refers to Fair Issac Corporation, a firm that developed the mathematical formulas
used to produce FICO scores. A FICO score is a snapshot of an applicant’s credit risk;
the higher the score, the lower the risk to lenders. Five main kinds of information are
used to compute the FICO score: payment history, amount owed, length of credit history,
new credit, and types of credit in use.)
(Table C-10 also shows the average points. A point is a term used by the lending
industry to refer to the loan origination fee. One point is equal to 1% of the loan
amount.)
The City has no direct influence on mitigating the effect of interest rates on reducing
housing affordability. If first time homebuyer programs were feasible, the City could
provide down payment assistance at a zero interest rate deferred until the home is sold.
The City provides home improvement financing at no cost through grants and deferred
home rehabilitation loans.

8)      Below Market Interest Rates: With respect to below market interest rates, the
California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) assists low and moderate-income
homebuyers in the realization of their goal of homeownership. CalHFA offers below
market interest rate 30-year fixed loans to first-time homebuyers who meet the income
and sales price limits for the County in which they wish to purchase. Borrowers are to
contact an approved CalHFA lender for complete program details.
Table C-11 on the next page lists the various interest rates established by CalHFA. For
low-income households, interest rates can be as low as 3.00% for a fixed rate, 30-year
loan. The maximum homeownership income limits for existing resales are:

c.      Conclusions and Findings
Financing has been readily available until early 2007. Because of the large number of
southern California owners defaulting on subprime loans and the number of foreclosed
homes, financing is not as available as it was prior to these two events. The number of
approved loans also has dropped as mortgage loan standards have tightened, including
the unavailability of 100% financing, the need for larger down payments, verified income,
and a requirement for solid credit history including high FICO scores.
As a result, the loan denial rates reported on Tables C-3 and C-5 should be interpreted
with some caution. In part, the denial rates reflect periods of both easy credit approvals
and financing and the start of more stringent standards in mid-2006. The numbers of
City homeowners with notices of default is unknown at this time, as is the number of
foreclosed properties.
For borrowers with a solid credit history, savings to pay a 20% down payment and good
income, financing is still available at reasonable interest rates. Fixed rate, 30-year loans
are available for interest rates in the range of 6.0% to 6.5%.
The HMDA data indicate that there are no mortgage deficient areas. The denial rates are
not unusually high and are relatively low for home improvement loans.

2.       Land Costs
a.       Guidelines
HCD suggests that –
         In looking at the price of land, estimate the average per unit cost of land,
         or the range of costs for developable parcels, in both single-family and
         multifamily zones.
b.       Analysis
Land costs are a major component of new housing production costs. The development
industry typically categorizes land into three types, raw land, entitled land and finished
lots. The values attributed to parcels of land increase through these three stages. Raw
land is just that, a vacant piece of land without any entitlements or improvements.
Entitled land can range from having the appropriate zoning to having a recorded
subdivision for the land. Finally, land can be categorized as “finished lots”. This is the
final stage prior to the actual construction of a home. All grading has been completed
and all infrastructure (streets, curbs, gutters, storm drains, sewers and utilities) have
been installed. In most cases, this also means that all fees (except those associated
with building permits) have also been paid. At this stage, the land is at it highest value.
Developers typically look to have a finished lot value to range from 30% to 35% of the
sales price of the home. Therefore, if a home was to sell for $600,000, the finished lot
should not cost more than about $180,000 to $210,000. Since fees and entitlement
costs are a component of a finished lot values, these components (in addition to
anticipated sales prices) can affect the price a developer is willing to pay for a raw piece
of land. In determining a value for a raw piece of land, developers typically conduct a
residual land analysis. From the anticipated sales price of a home, they subtract the
finished lots’ value per lot, the costs of construction, sales and marketing expenses and
a profit margin to arrive at a residual land value.
Data on land costs is extremely limited. In order to obtain current information on land
costs, the MLS Alliance for the Multi-Regional Multiple Listing Service (MRMLS) was
used. There has been no land parcels reported sold by the MLS Alliance in the previous
two years. The most recent sale was in 2005 for a 5,000 square foot parcel that sold for
$215,000. Furthermore, there are no parcels currently on the market for-sale according
to the MLS Alliance. A web-based real estate site called LoopNet shows one automotive
use site on the market at $2,300,000 for .93 acres, or $56.61 per square foot.
c.       Conclusions and Findings
In Hawaiian Gardens, the availability of vacant parcels is extremely scarce. As such
simple rules of supply and demand will dictate that prices will be high for vacant and
potential re-use sites. Additionally, other components of housing production costs also
drive new housing costs beyond the means of lower income households. One of these
components – construction costs – is discussed in Part C.

3.       Construction Costs
a.       Guidelines
HCD suggests –
         The analysis of construction costs, for typical single-family and multifamily
         projects, should focus on the total cost to the developer, exclusive of
         profit, but including land, fees, material, labor and financing.
b.       Analysis
1)       Components of Construction Costs: Little has changed over the years with
respect to the components of a typical house. While there have been some
technological advances, they are still essentially “sticks and bricks”. However, with
every new building code change the costs of construction do rise. Increases can occur
as a result of code changes requiring higher energy efficiency requirements,
handicapped access, and required changes in building materials. Even with new tools
and some building materials requiring less onsite labor, contractors have not achieved
improvements in labor productivity experienced in other industries.
Labor represents the highest cost component in the cost of construction. The cost of
labor is based on a number of factors, including housing demand, the number and
availability of contractors, and unionization of workers. In some instances it is difficult to
pinpoint exact labor costs because subcontractors often supply materials as well as
labor.
In addition to the “sticks and bricks” constructions costs, there are several more costs
associated with the construction of new homes. These include the following:
         Engineering Costs:       Costs associated with taking raw land to an entitled
                                  stage such as a subdivision. Also included are
                                  grading plans, sewer plans, storm drain plans,
                                  street improvements plans, engineer calculations
                                  for energy efficiency (Title 24) and structural
                                  calculations, and geo-technical studies.
         Architectural Plans:     The actual house plans and construction plans.
                                  This may also include landscape plans.
         Site Improvement
         Costs:                   These are the costs associated with taking raw,
                                  entitled land, and completing the grading,
                                  installations of curbs, gutters, sidewalks, streets
                                  and the utilities.
         City Fees:               These include City fees for reviewing engineering
                                  and architectural plans and the issuance of building
                                  permits.

                               school impact fees and may include sewer
                               connection fees
        Financing Costs:       The interest paid on the construction loan.
        Sales and Marketing: Once a home is completed, these are the costs
                               associated with the actual sale of the home and
                               include marketing costs (advertising), sales
                               commissions, escrow and title costs, and warranty
                               expenses.
2)      Quality of Construction: Saylor Publications, Inc. has developed a manual
designed to provide “single family” building cost data that serves contractors, architects,
lenders, planners and appraisers. Saylor’s “residential square foot building costs” are
suitable for immediate use in “ballpark” estimating of the construction costs of a single
family residence knowing only the class of construction, living area, and exterior wall.
Saylor provides per square foot construction cost estimates for four quality levels --
Economy, Fair, Standard and Custom. The definition of “Standard” quality is as follows:
        “This class of residence is constructed to meet and exceed requirements
        and to provide comfortable accommodations. There are usually several
        features that make the residence attractive from the exterior. These
        features are standard but significant enough to give residences an
        individual identity among similar residences. The interior finishes have
        several distinctive features. These residences usually have design
        enhancements that are functional and efficiently installed. The windows,
        doors, kitchen cabinets and plumbing fixtures are standard quality and
        carefully installed. The quality of workmanship indicates experienced
        workers working in a “structured” environment with several levels of
        quality control and accountability.”
3)      Average Per Square Foot Construction Costs: Based on the above definition of
“Standard” construction quality, the per square foot factor for a typical stucco on stud
frame 1,600 square foot home would be $114.20 for the dwelling and $45.80 per square
foot for a 400 square foot attached two-car garage. In addition, Saylor Publications, Inc.
provides a cost relationship index for factors dealing with location. In Los Angeles, the
adjustment factor is .93. According to Saylor, the costs include labor, materials, and
general contractor’s overhead and profit and fees for new construction. However, land
costs, financing and other real estate related costs are not included.
4)      Construction Cost Estimate for a Single-Family Home: Utilizing the per square
foot construction costs above for a standard stucco on frame dwelling (adjusted by the
.93 factor), a 1,600 square foot, three bedroom home with an attached two car garage
would cost $190,872 to build. The amount is calculated as follows:
        1,600 Square Feet X $114.20 X .93 =                        $169,929
        400 Square Foot Two Car Garage X $56.30 X .93 =             $20,943
        Total (rounded)                                            $190,872

5)       Construction Cost Impacts of State Laws - Prevailing Wages and Fish & Game
Fees: The Housing Element Law focuses the constraints analysis on “local” factors with
scant mention of State laws that cause an increase in housing costs, especially on the
cost to produce affordable housing. The cost impacts of State law requirements – such
as prevailing wages – probably equal or exceed whatever the City can accomplish
through a reduction of development standards and/or increased density.
The prevailing wage legislation passed in October 2001 – SB 975 – broadened the
existing law to cover construction work paid for in whole or in part by public funds.
Construction projects supported by public funds include affordable housing. Few
projects can escape the requirements – housing assisted exclusively by a
redevelopment agency’s affordable housing fund are exempt. But frequently affordable
housing include several sources of public funds and, therefore, fall within the purview of
prevailing wages.
When required, prevailing wages significantly increase the cost of construction.
Estimates of the additional construction costs on 205 residential projects subsidized by
the California Low Income Housing Tax Credit program range from 9% to 37%. That
same study estimated that the effect of uniform application of the prevailing wage law
decreased by 3,100 the number of new dwellings for low-income households*.
[*Sarah Dunn, John M. Quigley, and Larry A. Rosenthal, The Effects of Prevailing Wage
Requirements on the Cost of Low Income Housing, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, Vol.
59, No. 1, October 2005, pg. 141.]
The Los Angeles County Community Development Commission (CDC) provides yet
another measure of construction cost impacts.                 The CDC suggests to
Industry Housing Fund applicants to add 20% more than non-prevailing wage to their
construction cost estimates if they think that the funding sources will trigger a prevailing
wage requirement.
The California Department of Fish and Game fee is another example of how State laws
impact the cost of housing. Fish and Game fees have increased to $1,800 for Negative
Declarations and $2,500 for EIRs. County Clerks are not able to accept a Notice of
Determination until a Fish and Game fee is paid. This fee may be waived only for
projects with “no impact” on wildlife. However, Fish and Game will consider practically
any construction project to have an impact – high-rise buildings may cause birds to
collide with windows and removal of a palm tree may remove habitat for birds. *

c.      Conclusions and Findings
The cost of construction alone exceeds the cost affordable to lower income households.
Several factors contribute to the cost of construction including dwelling unit size, height
(elevator may be required), terrain, slopes, quality, State laws, profit motivations, and
several other considerations.
Construction costs, however, are but one component of housing production costs. New
affordable homes and apartments can not be constructed without some public funding
sources that subsidize the entire development and reduce the loan amount to that which
can be supported by the affordable rents and ownership costs.
4.      Homeownership Housing Prices
a.      Guidelines
Although the Housing Element Law and guidelines do not explicitly mention the price of
existing housing, this potential constraint falls within the meaning of “nongovernmental”
or market-driven barriers to affordability. The analysis also helps to determine whether
local, State or Federal programs can be practically applied to address the needs of first-
time homebuyers.

2)       2007 Sales Prices: The number of sales of resale homes dropped dramatically
from 2006 to 2007. The year-over-year decrease of 54% is quite significant. Also, the
sales prices have decreased. The number of sales over $400,000 dropped from 43% in
2005 to 39 % in 2006.

NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS                                 TECHNICAL APPENDIX C
c.      Conclusions and Findings
The cost of existing, as well as new, housing is beyond the means of lower income
households. Market rate costs make down payment assistance and first-time homebuyer
programs exceedingly expensive, and difficult to implement.
5.      Monthly Housing Rents
a.      Guidelines
Although the Housing Element Law and guidelines do not explicitly mention the cost      of
existing rental housing, this potential constraint falls within the meaning             of
“nongovernmental” or market-driven barriers to affordability. The analysis also helps   to
determine whether local, State or Federal programs can be practically applied           to
address the needs of cost burdened lower income renters.
b.      Analysis
In May and August of 2007, and in January of 2008, a telephone survey was conducted
to ascertain the rent levels in Hawaiian Gardens. Three apartments (one senior) and
two mobile home parks were surveyed. The results are summarized below.
Hawaiian Terrace Senior Apartments: Built in 1991, this complex of 101 units consists
of one and two bedroom units. The one bedroom/one bath units rented for $825 per
month. The two-bedroom/one bath units rented for $925 per month, while the two
bedroom/two bath units had rents of $1,025. According to the leasing office, about 38 of
the units were Section 8 assisted. There were no vacancies at the time of the survey.
Hawaiian Gardens: This project has a total of 264 units of two and three bedrooms.
According to the leasing office, about 30% of the units are Section 8. There are two rent
types in the complex, market-rate and tax credit rents. The market-rate rents for the two
bedroom units are $1,103, while the tax credit rental rate is $999. With respect to the
three bedroom units, the rent levels are $1,275 and $1,109 respectively. Although there
were six vacancies at the time of the survey, they were in the process of being rented.
Cypress Gardens: This market-rate complex consists of 102, one and two bedroom
units. The one bedroom units have rent ranges of $975-$995 and $1,050-$1,070. The
rent of the two bedroom units ranged from $1,295 to $1,395. There were three vacant
two-bedroom units at the time of the survey.
Bloomfield Mobile Home Park: This is a senior complex with five single-wide and 43
double-wide spaces. The monthly space rent is $795 for both sizes. At the time of the
survey there were three vacant spaces.
Lakewood Mobile Home Estates: This senior park consists of 200 spaces all of which
are single-wide. The monthly rent is $495 plus utilities, and at the time of the survey
there were two homes for sale.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX C                           NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
c.       Conclusions and Findings
The current monthly rents do pose a non-governmental, or market, constraint that
impedes the application of rental housing assistance programs. However, for a City the
size of Hawaiian Gardens, there is a high number of lower income households assisted
by the Housing Authority and in private senior and large family projects.

        family size appropriate to the unit. Health and Safety Code Section
        50052.5(b)(3).
        Affordable Housing Cost for Moderate Income Households is not less
        than 28 percent of the gross income of the household, and not more than

TECHNICAL APPENDIX D                             INVENTORY OF HOUSING RESOURCES
 A.      INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
Local housing elements must describe resources relevant to meeting future housing
needs. The relevant resources include -- primarily -- sites that are suitable, appropriate
and available within the planning period to accommodate the housing needs of all
income groups as quantified in the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). The
identified sites in Table D-1 can accommodate the RHNA allocation of 145 housing
units. In addition to the identified residential sites, the Redevelopment Agency plans to
implement a program of “committed assistance”.
B.       RESOURCES: SITES INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS
1.       Guidelines
Section 65583(a)(3) states that a housing element must include:
         An inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant
         sites and sites having potential for redevelopment and an analysis of the
         relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to these sites.
Section 65583.2(a) states that the inventory of land suitable for residential development –
         …shall be used to identify sites that can be developed for housing within
         the planning period and that are sufficient to provide for the jurisdiction’s
         share of the regional housing need for all income levels….”
HCD guidance includes the following:
         The purpose of the land inventory is to identify specific sites suitable for
         residential development in order to compare the locality’s new
         construction need by affordability category with its residential
         development (total supply) capacity. A thorough land inventory will help
         the locality determine if additional governmental actions are needed
         to provide enough sites with appropriate zoning, development
         standards, and infrastructure capacity to accommodate its new
         construction need as required by Section 65583(c)(1). [emphasis added]
         Land ‘suitable for residential development’ has characteristics that make
         the sites appropriate and available for residential use in the planning
         period. These characteristics include physical features (flooding, seismic
         hazards, chemical contamination, other environmental constraints, and
         slope instability or erosion) and location (proximity to transit, job centers,
         and public and community services).
         Sites not currently planned and zoned for residential use may be included
         in the inventory if they are otherwise suitable for residential development
         and the element includes program actions to change the land use within
         the current planning period. [emphasis added]
Chart D-1 shows HCD’s guidance on the sites inventory and analysis process.

2.       Analysis
This part explains both the sites inventory and the analysis of sites that can
accommodate a portion of the regional housing need by income level. The final RHNA,
adopted by SCAG in July 2007 and approved by HCD in September 2007, projects the
following needs by income level:
               Above Moderate-Income          64 housing units
               Moderate-Income                24 housing units
               Lower-Income                   57 housing units
a.       Inventory of Residential Sites
Per Section 65583.2(b), the land inventory must include:
               A parcel-specific listing of available sites, including parcel number
                or other ‘unique’ reference.
               The general plan and zoning designations, along with the size of
                each parcel listed in the inventory.
               For non-vacant sites in the inventory, the housing element must
                describe the existing uses for each identified site.
Exhibits D-1a and D-1b show the location of each site (except for housing already
constructed), the Zoning Designation and Assessor Parcel Number for the five vacant
sites. The Land Use Element Map follows page D-14.
1)       Housing Units Constructed in 2006 and 2007: In a November 30, 2006 letter from
the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to the Southern
California Association of Governments (SCAG), HCD noted that –
         In updating their housing elements, local governments may credit, by
         applicable income category, housing units added since January 2006.
According to the State Department of Finance (DOF), 12 housing units were added to
the stock in 2006 and 2007:
                                               2006             2007
         Single-Family Detached                3                5
         Single-Family Attached                0                2
         2-4 Units                             0                2
Four of the housing units constructed in 2007 have, pursuant to a Development and
Disposition Agreement, a deed restriction indicating that for 45 years the property shall
be designated for low and moderate income households. The Redevelopment Agency
provided a land value writedown in order to facilitate the affordability of the constructed
units.
2)       Housing Units Constructed in 2008: Seven housing units have been constructed
through mid-year 2008. The constructed units are identified in Table D-1.

  (a)       Potential Residential Development Capacity: According to the Housing
  Element Law, estimates of capacity must be adjusted based on the application of
  land use controls. That is, the City must establish housing capacity by
  considering the cumulative impacts of minimum lot area and coverage standards
  and open space, parking, and floor area ratios (FARs). Table D-3 shows the
  housing capacity of each site is realistic in view of land use controls. The capacity
  analysis determines the “maximum habitable area” that could be developed for
  housing and the “minimum floor area” that can be satisfied within the available
  habitable area. (The analysis excludes the 221st Street site because the because
  the lot area of 4,400 square feet exceeds the minimum lot area requirement of
  3,750 square feet and only one unit can be constructed.)

   Open space requirement is 500 SF per unit. The 500 SF consists of 250 SF for common space
  (tot lots, etc.); 100 SF for private space (patios, balconies, terraces); and 100 SF for passive
  landscaped areas. Although all private space need not be provided within the lot area (i.e.,
  balconies), for calculation purposes the 500 SF figure was used.

 Guest required parking is .75 guest space per unit. If the calculation of required parking spaces
results in a fractional number, the fraction shall be rounded up to the next number. Two guest
spaces are required for Site One. Each space is estimated to be 200 SF (10’ by 20’).
4
 Net lot area is the total lot area less the area for setbacks, open space, and guest parking.
5
 Maximum building area is an estimate of the building square footage that could be constructed
on the lot. Building area is inclusive of the housing units and garage. The R-2 Zone District has a
2-story height limit. Thus, the maximum building area is two times the net lot area. (2 X 1,960 =
3,920 SF)
6
 Garage parking requirement is 2 spaces per unit. Each garage is estimated to be 400 SF (20’ by
20’) X the number of units.
7
 The minimum floor area per dwelling units for a 2+ bedroom unit is 950 SF.
8
 The total floor area for two 2+ bedrooms is 1,900 SF.
Attachment A in Technical Appendix B provides illustrations on how the
development standards are applied to parcels meeting the minimum lot sizes.
(b)      Single-Family Homes in R-2 and R-3 Zones: Single-family homes are
permitted in the R-2 and R-3 Zones. The housing capacity of the vacant sites ½
acre in size or less as well as the one large vacant residential site and
underutilized residential sites are all zoned R-2 and R-3. The housing capacity of
these sites are based on the maximum number of housing units that can be
constructed at densities of 17 and 18.9 dwelling units per acre.
Housing at the maximum densities can be physically accommodated on the
lots/sites based on the cumulative effect of the City’s land use controls. Private
owners, including investors and developers will be motivated to construct the
maximum number of housing units because of the relatively high land values.
Housing at the highest densities possible will be an investor and developer
motivation in order to justify paying for the land costs. In other words, the
multifamily zoned land is too valuable to construct only one single-family home
per lot.
The housing unit capacity is based on the R-2 density of 17 dwellings per acre and
the R-3 density of 18.9 dwellings per acre. Housing affordability for lower income
households is based on a density of 18.9 dwelling units per acre, as there is no
major difference in affordability at densities of 20 dwellings or 18.9 dwellings per
acre. In order to ensure that housing on the vacant and underutilized sites/lots is
built at these maximum densities, the City will implement a site replacement
policy during the planning period.
The site replacement policy is modeled after AB 2292 (Dutra) (Government Code
Section 65863). The City will proactively encourage and facilitate the construction
of housing on the vacant, underutilized and mixed use sites at the maximum
densities permitted. In the event a development application on a specific lot is
submitted to the Community Development Department for less than the maximum
density, the Director will encourage the applicant to construct housing at the
maximum density. If the applicant wants to proceed at a density lower than the
maximum density, then the City will identify a lot(s)/site(s) to replace the lower
D-8                                                                                    January 2010

TECHNICAL APPENDIX D                           INVENTORY OF HOUSING RESOURCES
density with higher density housing. The higher density replacement lot/site could
be accomplished through a re-zoning (R-3 to R-4), a density bonus or other
means. The implementation of a replacement housing policy may require an
amendment to the Housing Element. However, such a requirement cannot be
determined at this time. Any action pertaining to the housing replacement policy
will be reported in the Annual Housing Element Progress Report.
 (c)     Lot Consolidation Potential: The four smaller sites are not contiguous.
Therefore, lot consolidation involves the consolidation of vacant lots and
residentially developed lots. Opportunities for lot consolidation are strong when
vacant lots are adjacent to single family homes.
As noted, the City has five vacant sites/lots. One site is comprised of five
contiguous lots and is under one ownership. Two of the other four sites definitely
have lot consolidation potential. The vacant site at 221st Street is adjacent to two
residential lots having older, smaller homes. The homes were built in 1902 and
1927 and have an estimated 1,227 and 720 square feet. The two lots have a
combined square footage of 10,120 square feet. The vacant lot on Juan Street is
adjacent to two lots with low intensity duplex units. One lot has two units built in
1960 with an estimated 1,753 square feet of living space. A second lot has two
units built in 1945 with an estimated 1,226 square feet of living space. The two lots
have a combined square footage of almost 26,000 square feet.
A third vacant lot (Ibex/221st) is a corner lot adjacent to a single family home built
in 1913. The dwelling, which is 1,140 square feet, is owner-occupied. The fourth
vacant lot (Elaine Avenue) is a corner lot and is adjacent to an owner-occupied
single-family home built in 1950. The home has 1,840 square feet of living space.
(d)      Ability to Facilitate Housing for Lower-Income Households: Smaller, infill sites
are ideal locations for affordable housing, particularly for special needs
population who need to live in established neighborhood environments. SRO,
transitional and supportive housing often serve special needs population,
especially the disabled, on small, infill lots.
Local and federal funding resources often contribute to the development of
special needs housing constructed on small infill sites/lots. Examples of federal
resources include HOME funds and Section 811 capital advances.                     Local
resources include redevelopment agency funds and the Industry Housing Funds
both of which can provide financial assistance to the development of group
homes and SRO housing for special needs populations such as the
developmentally disabled and emancipated foster youth.
An example of such housing on small lots is SRO housing to be developed for six
developmentally disabled adults in the City of Monterey Park. The six SRO
housing units will be located in a 2-story home on a residential lot. Funding for
the project includes Redevelopment Agency low and moderate income housing
funds and Federal HOME funds.
The Section 811 program allows very low income adults with disabilities to live as
independently as possible in the community by increasing the supply of rental
housing with the availability of supportive services. HUD provides interest-free

INVENTORY OF HOUSING RESOURCES                             TECHNICAL APPENDIX D
capital advances to nonprofit sponsors to help them finance the development of
rental housing. The program also provides project rental assistance, which covers
the difference between the HUD-approved operating costs of the project and the
tenants' contribution toward rent. Examples of affordable Section 811
developments include group homes (in a single-family dwelling) for five or six
disabled adults.
4)      Vacant Residentially Zoned Site on Sites of More Than One-Half Acre: There is
one vacant site consisting of five contiguous lots. The geographic identifiers for
this site consist of the following assessor parcel numbers:
        7076-005-012
        7076-005-013
        7076-005-017
        7076-005-018
        7076-005-019
The entire site is 1.42 acres. The lot dimensions are: width is 177 feet and depth is
349.6 feet, yielding a site of 61,879 square feet.
The site has a Land Use Element designation of Intermediate Density and is zoned
R-3, which permits up to 18.9 dwelling units per acre. The housing unit capacity
of the site is 27 housing units.
The R-3 site is comprised of five contiguous lots. A multi-family development
application on this site would be facilitated through a lot merger to create one lot.
The R-3 Zone permits by right multi-family rental housing. As previously noted,
the R-3 Zone requires a minimum of 2,300 square feet per dwelling unit.
Therefore, 27 housing units can be constructed on the site (61,879 SF divided by
2,300 SF)
The consolidated site meets the minimum lot width of 50 feet and minimum lot
depth of 100 feet. The R-3 Zone maximum height limit is three stories or 35 feet,
whichever is less.
In the event the developer wanted to construct a multi-family owner project
(condominium, townhouse), then a tentative tract map would need to be
processed pursuant to the City’s Subdivision Ordinance. The City has adopted –
by reference - the County of Los Angeles Subdivision Ordinance. The processing
of a tentative tract map is a usual part of the development process and the City
does not require extra processing steps in addition to those included in the
County Subdivision Ordinance, an ordinance that has been adopted by several
cities located in the County.
5)      Vacant Non-Residential Sites: The City has nine vacant non-residentially
zoned sites. All of the sites are zoned C-4 General Commercial and are located on
Norwalk Boulevard and Carson Street, the City’s major thoroughfares. Because
mixed-use development is permitted in the General Commercial land use
designation and zone, the commercial sites shown in Table D-4 are considered
appropriate for housing. The 1-acre minimum requirement means that vacant lots
will need to be consolidated with non-vacant commercial lots.

6)       Mixed-Use Sites: The Zoning Code was amended prior to adoption of the
Housing Element in order to implement the following land use policy:
         Encourage the development of mixed-use housing opportunities in
         the General Commercial land use designation, on sites with a
         minimum lot size of 1 acre.
The Land Use Element describes the General Commercial designation as follows:
         General Commercial land uses are classified by a broad range of
         commercial services and uses, including retail sales, service-related
         uses, entertainment, community service organizations, and
         professional offices. All General Commercial areas are located along
         the City’s major arterial corridors, Carson Street and Norwalk
         Boulevard. The maximum floor area ratio allowable for General
         Commercial land uses is 0.5. The maximum allowable building
         intensity is also supported by the zoning code, which establishes
         maximum site coverage of 70 percent. Additional uses permitted in
         the General Commercial designation that are consistent with the
         zoning code include:
                 Inns and boarding houses
                 Institutional uses and public facilities
                 Emergency shelters
City of Hawaiian Gardens - Housing Element                                                  D-11

INVENTORY OF HOUSING RESOURCES                            TECHNICAL APPENDIX D
              Health services
              Social service facilities
              Mixed-use development, on a minimum lot size of 1 acre.
The City has recognized that the City’s population will continue to grow in the
future, resulting in the impending need for diverse housing opportunities in the
community. In order to address this need, mixed-use development will be
encouraged in the City. In order to be classified as mixed-use, development
should include the following components:
              A combination of two or more significant land uses as part of a
               single or contiguous site;
              Significant functional and physical integration of project
               components; and
              Development in conformance with a coherent plan.
There are considerable benefits to mixed-use development, including increasing
housing options within the community, reducing auto dependency, and creating a
sense of place.
Tables D-5, D-6 and D-7 show the housing capacity of three mixed-use sites. Each
site exceeds the one-acre minimum standard established for mixed use
development. The housing capacity is based on a) the adopted standard of one
dwelling unit for each 1,850 square feet of lot area devoted to residential land use
and b) 25% of the lot area allocated to housing. The sites are vacant or have low
intensity land uses such as auto repair, parking lots, or single-family structures.
The Elks Lodge structure represents about 25% of the total lot size of parcel 7066-
013-057. The housing capacity is 30 housing units at a minimum density of 23.5
dwelling units per acre.
In order to encourage and facilitate housing development on these sites, a “Mixed
Use Incentives Program” will be included in the Housing Program section of the
Housing Element. The mixed use incentives will include lot consolidation
incentives such as density bonuses, reduced development standards, fee
deferrals, reductions or waivers; assistance through the Redevelopment Agency
in lot consolidation; and other incentives. Lot consolidation by the
Redevelopment Agency is facilitated by the fact that the entire City is located
within the Project Area. In addition, as noted in Table D-7 one lot is owned by the
City. Mixed use developments will be processed through approval of a Minor Use
Permit.
Exhibit D-2 on page D-15 shows the locations of the mixed use sites.

    Site 7066-170-012 will provide opportunities for residential development during the
    program period. The site has a low intensity S & J Auto Center that sells tires and
    mufflers. Twelve percent of the site has a one-story structure. The building is in poor to
    fair condition. The balance of the site is in an asphalt paved area with no physical or
    building improvements. The value of this lot is in the land, not the improvements.
    According to the Los Angeles County Assessor’s Office, the improvement value is only
    27% of the total lot value. The low intensity nature of the existing land use provides an
    excellent opportunity for reutilization of the site.

       Site 7066-006-008 will provide oppurtunities for residential development during the
       program period. The site contains four buildings between 1955 and 1966. One building
       is a one-story garage of 720 square feet. Another building is a two-bedroom structure of
       805 square feet built in 1955. The other buildings are estimated to be 1600 square feet.
       The existing use does not involve manufacturing or sales. The existing use is the
       processing of chicharrones (fried pork rinds). In addition, the existing use is a non-
       conforming use. The low intensity nature of the existing land use together with the
       adjacent vacant sites provides an excellent opportunity for reutilization of the site.

6)      Underutilized Residentially Zoned Sites: Thirty-two underutilized residentially
zoned sites are identified in Table D-8. These sites can accommodate a net
increase of 120 housing units through the construction of multi-family structures,
predominantly tri-plexes, four-plexes and five-plexes.
(a)     Existing Uses: Non-vacant sites have low intensity residential land uses
consisting of either older single family homes (24) or duplexes (7). One non-
vacant site has a six-plex on a site that can accommodate 16 housing units. The
structural conditions (from exterior surveys) show signs of deterioration common
with older homes and duplexes. New development would not likely take the form
of new units in addition to those already existing on the parcels. Instead, new
development on the underutilized sites would replace the existing units. As a
result, the existing residential units would be demolished to make way for new
housing developments.
(b)     Development Trends and Market Conditions: Recent demolition and rebuilding
activity indicates that there is a market demand to demolish existing older
dwellings and to replace them with newer housing units. Housing units have
recently been demolished on the following streets:
        221st Street
        Violeta Avenue
        Seine Avenue
Since housing values hit their peak in late 2005/early 2006, the sales prices have
decreased very significantly, as much as 26.7% in Los Angeles County. In
Hawaiian Gardens the June 2008 median price of an SF dwelling was 43.6% less
than a year ago. (Source: Data Quick, Southern California Home Resale Activity,
L.A. Times Sunday Edition Charts, Data for June 2008) Housing prices are
expected to remain stagnant or fall even further over the next six to 18 months.
The drop in home values, together with foreclosure sales, provides the
opportunity for investors, developers and owner-builders to acquire older
properties at values significantly below the peak values of late 2005/early 2006.
Lower land and building values represent market conditions conducive to
property acquisition, demolition and rebuilding at higher densities.
In addition, the “net increase” in housing units provides incentives to replace
existing older structures with new housing. The underutilized lots range from
three to 10 additional housing units on a given lot. The list on page D-18 shows
the net housing unit increase and the number of lots that have that increase.

(c)     Lot Consolidation Incentives: Several lots are contiguous and, and with
incentives, present opportunities for developers to consolidate lots and develop
multi-family housing. One area has five contiguous lots along 214 Street. The
total lot area of the five lots is 66,450 square feet. When combined, the lot area can
support the development of 29 housing units, or four more units than be yielded
on an individual lot basis. A second area is located along Hawaiian Avenue and
consists of 6 contiguous lots with a total area of 65,340 square feet. When
combined, the lot area can support the development of 28 housing units, or four
more than on an individual lot basis.
(d)     Regulatory Standards and Lot Consolidation Incentives: To facilitate and
encourage lot consolidation, the City will establish a program of incentives. The lot
consolidation incentives will include one or more of the following actions: fast
tracking processing, fee waivers, financial assistance, rounding up to the next unit when
fractions are involved, Redevelopment Agency assistance to consolidate lots, other
potential incentives.
5)      Non-Residentially Zoned Sites That Can Be Redeveloped for Housing: Existing
non-residentially development sites are not suitable and/or appropriate for
residential use.      The existing sites already developed as commercial and
industrial uses primarily are located along Carson Street and Norwalk Boulevard
and need to be retained to main the City’s property and retail sales tax base.
Consequently, the land inventory does not include any of these sites as sites that
can accommodate the City’s share of the regional housing need.
b.      Densities to Encourage and Facilitate Housing for Lower Income Households
Sites zoned at a minimum of 20 dwelling units per acre are accepted by HCD as
accommodating the City’s share of the regional housing need for lower income
households. The City’s share of the regional lower income housing need is 57
housing units. The zoned mixed-use sites will accommodate 30 housing units at a
minimum density of 23.5 dwelling units per acre. Another vacant site will
accommodate 27 housing units at a density of 18.9 dwelling units per acre. HCD
indicates that an analysis should be presented on whether this density
encourages and facilitates housing for lower-income households based on factors
such as market demand, financial feasibility, and development experience within
zones.
1)      Market Demand: Market demand is different from housing need. Market
demand is a term with many meanings. One meaning refers to the market
segments that the homebuilding industry satisfies through the production of non-
subsidized housing. Developers in southern California address this demand
D-18                                                                         January 2010

TECHNICAL APPENDIX D                         INVENTORY OF HOUSING RESOURCES
through a variety of housing types, densities and amenities. However, the
incomes of lower income households do not represent “market demand” because
their incomes do not generate an effective demand for new housing. That means
new housing cannot be produced because land costs, construction costs and
other development costs add to total costs that exceed what can be afforded by
lower income households. Whether lots are zoned at 18.9 or 20 dwelling units per
acre has no impact on enabling lower income households to transition from an
“ineffective” demand (for new housing) to a market demand.
2)       Financial Feasibility:  The housing costs affordable by lower income
households are described in Section C, Tables C-1 and C-2. As a general rule,
these affordable housing costs are able to pay for about 25% to 30% of the total
development costs of new housing. The balance of the 70% to 75% in
development costs must be filled by gap financing which typically is the form of
land write downs, fee waivers, low income housing tax credits and other sources
of subsidy financing. The financial feasibility of new housing for lower income
households is not enhanced in any significant way by increasing the density of a
lot from 18.9 to 20 housing units per acre.
Affordable rents for moderate, low, and very-low income units are limited to 30%
of the maximum income limits based on the Los Angeles County Area Median
Income (AMI) for the defined household size less the County’s standard allowance
for utilities. In terms of determining maximum affordable rents, the maximum
annual incomes are as follows:
         Extremely Low Income               30% AMI
         Very Low Income                    50% AMI
         Lower Income                       60% AMI
         Moderate Income                    110% AMI
For example:
         Very low income tenant
         2-bedroom unit
         3-person household
         $53,800 = median income for a 3-person very low income household
         $26,900 is 50% of the median income
         $8,070 is 30% of $26,900
         $672.50 is the “affordable rent”
         $50 is the assumed utility allowance
         $622.50 is the monthly rent
Certain expenses still must be deducted from the monthly rent to determine the
dollar amount available to pay off a 30-year loan. These expenses include
operating expenses, vacancy losses due to turnover and rent-up periods, and rent
collection losses. Operating expenses include property taxes, insurance,
maintenance and repairs, management fees, water, rubbish collection, water, and
other related expenses. Operating expenses, vacancy loss and rent collection
losses add up to about 35% of the monthly rent (gross scheduled income).
Therefore, a very low income person has $405 to contribute to a loan payment
(65% of $622.50). The monthly rent of $405 can support a loan in the amount of

INVENTORY OF HOUSING RESOURCES                               TECHNICAL APPENDIX D
$62,500 at a 6.75% for a 30-year term. The loan that can be supported represents
a relatively small percentage of the total development costs to produce a new 2-
bedroom housing unit.
3)      Development Experience: The City’s affordable housing development
occurred following incorporation when the City had large vacant parcels. Vacant
parcels of that size no longer exist in Hawaiian Gardens. However, housing
capacity in four of the five City’s vacant lots is not different whether housing is
built at a density of 18.9 or 20 dwelling units per acre. The per unit land costs
would be same because the minimum lot area of 2178 SF in instead of 2300 SF
would not yield any more capacity on the four sites identified in Table D-2.
The City does have a 1.42 vacant site. At a density of 18.9 dus/ac, the capacity of
the site/lot is 26.84 dwelling units. At a density of 20 dus/ac, the capacity of the
site/lot is 28.4 housing units. Increasing the density from 18.9 to 20 housing units
per acre does not increase in any significant way the affordability of the site/lot.
The City concludes that housing built at 18.9 dwelling units per acre results
essentially the same affordability as housing at 20 dwelling units per acre.
Pursuant to the site replacement policy, the City will encourage development on
this site at the maximum density permitted by the zoning designation.
c)      Accommodating the Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA)
The inventory or land suitable for residential development provides the database to
determine which sites can accommodate – by income category – a portion of the
regional housing need. More specifically, Government Code Section 65583.2(c) states:
        “…a city or county shall determine whether each site in the inventory can
        accommodate some portion of its share of the regional housing need by
        income level during the planning period.”
1)      Above Moderate Income Housing Need: The above moderate income housing
need is 64 housing units. Sites to accommodate “above moderate income” need include:
        Constructed Housing Units                  8 (page D-3)
        Recently Constructed Housing               7 (Table D-1)
        Housing on Vacant R-2 Sites                6 (Table D-2)
        Housing on Vacant R-3 Sites                4 (Table D-2)
        Housing on R-3 Underutilized Sites         24 (scattered sites, Table D-8)
        Housing on R-3 Underutilized Sites         29 (consolidated lots, page 18)
2)      Moderate Income Housing Need: The moderate income housing need is 24
housing units. Sites to accommodate “moderate income” need include:
        Constructed Housing (RDA Assisted)          4 (page D-3)
        Housing on R-3 Underutilized Sites         28 (consolidated lots, page 18)

TECHNICAL APPENDIX D                               INVENTORY OF HOUSING RESOURCES
3)       Lower Income Housing Need: The lower income housing need is 57 housing
units. Sites to accommodate “lower income” need include:
         R-3 Consolidated Site (1.42 acres)              27
         Mixed Use Sites                                 30 (Tables D-5, D-6 and D-7)
C.       ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Government Code Section 65583.2(b)(4) states that the inventory of land shall include:
         “A general description of any environmental constraints to the
         development of housing within the jurisdiction…. This information need
         not be identified on a site-specific basis.”
Site 7076-005-013, 18 and 10 is currently contaminated with hydrocarbons. This site
also has been identified by the Redevelopment Agency as a candidate affordable
housing site. If acquired by the Agency would ensure that the appropriate remedial
actions are taken.
D.       PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES
Government Code Section 65583.2(b)(5) states that the inventory of land shall include:
         “A general description of existing or planned water, sewer, and other dry
         utilities, including the availability and access to distribution facilities. This
         information need not be identified on a site-specific basis.”
1.       Water Resources
Water service in Hawaiian Gardens is provided by the Golden State Water Company
(formerly the Southern California Water Company) Region II Central District – Central
Basin East Artesia System. The Central District – Central Basin East Artesia System
serves approximately 19,600 customers in the communities of Artesia, Norwalk,
Hawaiian Gardens, and portions of Cerritos, South Gate, and Lakewood.
Water sources in the area include a blend of groundwater pumped from the Central
Groundwater Basin and imported water from the Colorado River and the Bay Delta in
Northern California (40 percent imported and purchased water, 60 percent water
pumped from ground wells). The Golden State Water Company has two external
connections: one with Cerritos that has a Metropolitan Water District (MWD) connection,
and another Orange County connection with an MWD connection. The Golden State
Water Company has no immediate concern with the availability of water supply because
it has entitlement of groundwater resources in the Central Groundwater Basin, with
supplemental imported water available from MWD. The Golden State Water Company
also leases additional water rights from other entities that no longer pump groundwater
but have entitlements, in order to meet the increases in water demand from its service
area. The water company is currently working on the construction of new wells, pumping
plants, water mains, new wells, pumping plants, water mains, and other improvements,
including replacement wells for older wells.

INVENTORY OF HOUSING RESOURCES                                                            TECHNICAL APPENDIX D
The local sewer lines in the City are maintained by the Los Angeles County Department
of Public Works, Consolidated Sewer Maintenance District (CSMD). The Los Angeles
County Sanitation District provides sewage treatment for wastewater from Hawaiian
Gardens. The Los Angeles Sanitation District’s Wastewater Treatment Division operates
10 water reclamation plants and one ocean discharge facility (Joint Water Pollution
Control Plant). Wastewater from Hawaiian Gardens is conveyed to the Long Beach
Water Reclamation Plant1.
The General Plan Update and EIR indicate there is sufficient water and sewer
capacity to accommodate the City’s share of the regional housing need and other
land use development projected to occur in the near- and long-term future.
2.        Solid waste
Solid waste disposal services for the City are provided by Consolidated Disposal
Services. Waste from the City is taken to the Bel Art Transfer Station in Long Beach,
with final disposal at Chiquita Canyon Disposal Facility. The Chiquita Canyon Disposal
Facility is a 592-acre facility located in Valencia, north of Los Angeles County.
Currently, the City contributes approximately 15,713 tons of waste annually.
Approximately 23 percent of waste is recycled through the City’s programs. Commercial
land uses are the largest producer of disposable waste, generating approximately 6,404
tons of waste and 2,823 tons of recyclable materials annually (In 2006). Industrial uses
are the lowest generators of disposable waste and recyclable materials. This may be in
part because industrial land use is a smaller land use category compared to residential
and commercial land uses in Hawaiian Gardens.
AB 939, the California Waste Management Act of 1989, requires local jurisdictions to
prepare, adopt, and implement source reduction and recycling plans in order to make
substantial decreases in the volume of waste materials going to landfills, and to reach
landfill diversion goals of 50 percent. To meet these goals, it is necessary for Hawaiian
Gardens to promote the reduction of solid waste and the stream of waste going to
landfills. In response to this, the City of Hawaiian Gardens has prepared and adopted an
ordinance related to recycling and diversion of construction and demolition waste.

3.       Recycling
The City of Hawaiian Gardens has an active recycling program, which includes a
curbside recycling program, drop-off areas, and providing public education materials.
The curbside recycling program includes picking up recyclable materials, but does not
include green waste. Recycling materials can include paper, plastics, glass, and metal
items. There is also one drop-off site located in the City, where residents can bring
recyclable materials to dispose of. The City also provides solid waste disposal services
for bulk and special items. The service operates bi-monthly, at different sites throughout
the City. The program targets different neighborhoods in the City each time and
advertises the opportunity for residents to dispose of bulk items. Large disposal
containers are provided. This helps eliminate bulk and unnecessary items within public
areas that are commonly abandoned in yards, vacant lots, and other areas.

INVENTORY OF HOUSING RESOURCES                                TECHNICAL APPENDIX D
The City actively promotes recycling and has provided pamphlets and flyers on
recycling. Goals and policies in the Conservation Element will serve as a steady base for
the City’s active promotion of recycling.
4.      Street Infrastructure
The City has seven vacant lots and 32 underutilized lots. Only three of the seven vacant
lots are contiguous. The 32 underutilized lots are located on the following streets:
        Hawaiian Streets               10 lots
        Verne Street                   8 lots
        214th Street                   7 lots
        Juan Avenue                    5 lots
        Claretta Avenue                2 lots
The streets on which the vacant and underutilized lots are located have been improved
to the maximum widths. In some cases, curbs, gutters and sidewalks must be
constructed to be consistent with adjacent developments.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX E                            REVIEW OF PRIOR HOUSING ELEMENT
A.       INTRODUCTION
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires the City to review the current
Housing Element to evaluate:
               “Effectiveness of the element” (Section 65588[a][2]): A
                comparison of the actual results of the earlier element with its
                goals, objectives, policies and programs. The results should be
                quantified where possible (e.g., rehabilitation results), but may be
                qualitative where necessary (e.g., mitigation of government
                constraints).
               “Progress in implementation” (Section 65583[a][3]): An analysis of
                the significant differences between what was projected or planned
                in the earlier element and what was achieved.
               “Appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies” (Section
                65588[a][1]): A description of how the goals, objectives, policies
                and programs of the updated element incorporate what has been
                learned from the results of the prior element.
Table E-1 explains the progress and effectiveness of each housing program. Part B
discusses the appropriateness of the goals, objectives and policies.
In general, the prior Housing Element included programs that were difficult to implement
given the staff and time resources available. The programs that were especially
effective included those with staff dedicated to their implementation such as the Section
8 Rental Voucher Program, Housing Rehabilitation Program and Code Enforcement.
Other efforts of the City – notably the Housing Component of the Redevelopment
Agency’s Implementation Plan and Replacement Housing Plan – contributed to the
implementation of other programs.
Other efforts, particularly those suggesting funding applications, also were difficult to
attain because the City’s few vacant sites cannot support the development of many
housing units on a specific parcel. The housing unit capacity of these sites is too low to
justify the enormous time and cost involved in submitting application to County and State
agencies.
The review of goals, policies and objectives reveals the need to establish a vision that is
capable of accomplishment. The Housing Element Update contains goals and policies
that specifically relate to the state housing goal and the objectives are accomplishable,

Goal 1
The provision of decent and adequate housing for all existing residents, and for those
who choose to become residents of Hawaiian Gardens, regardless of age, sex, marital
status, ethnic background, religion, income, or other arbitrary factors.
        Policies
        1.1     Review the General Plan and zoning map on an annual basis to monitor
                the availability of suitable vacant or underutilized land to accommodate a
                variety of housing types in the City.
                The availability of housing sites was monitored annually. The City is now
                in the process of a comprehensive General Plan Update. All vacant and
                underutilized sites have been identified.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX E                              REVIEW OF PRIOR HOUSING ELEMENT
                A variety of housing types were constructed during the planning period.
                The City experienced a net increase of 90 housing units:
                         30 single family detached units
                         33 singe family attached units
                         11 units in structures of 2 to 4 units

                accommodate the special housing needs of the City for handicapped,
                elderly, large family, overcrowded, and/or female headed households.
                The City and Redevelopment Agency did not participate in the
                construction of new housing units.              Consequently, new housing
                construction could not be regulated in a way that guaranteed special
                housing needs were addressed.
                The City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program does offer to handicapped
                and/or elderly homeowners deferred loans at 0% interest up to a $10,000
                maximum.
                An estimated 62 low-income elderly and/or disabled households obtain
                Section 8 rental assistance.
         1.4    Use the Land Use Element of the General Plan and the zoning ordinance
                to provide adequate sites for a variety of housing types, while ensuring
                that environmental, public infrastructure and traffic constrains are
                adequately addressed.
                Accomplished. As noted above, a variety of housing types were
                constructed during the planning period.
         1.5    Where appropriate, encourage the re-designation of vacant or under-
                utilized non-residential lands to residential use, with allowable densities to
                facilitate the development of a variety of housing types to meet the
                existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the City.
                During the planning period, the City found no appropriate sites and
                locations for re-designation. The City is now in the process of a
                comprehensive General Plan Update, which includes updating the Land
                Use Element.
         1.6    Promote Fair Housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race,
                religion, sex, marital status, ancestry, national origin or color.
                During the planning period, the City provided financial support to the Fair
                Housing Foundation, a major fair housing provider in Los Angeles
                County. The Fair Housing Foundation provided a variety of fair housing
                services to Hawaiian Gardens’ residents.

                recycling is consistent with established land use plans.
                Residential development during the planning period did occur on some
                sites that were identified as underutilized. An estimated 45 housing units
                were constructed on underutilized sites.
        1.8     Pursue the acquisition of substandard units and assembly of land for
                development of new residential units.

                available Federal grant programs and Redevelopment Agency monies to
                assure that the existing housing stock is adequately maintained.
                Accomplished.
        2.3     The City, through its rehabilitation and improvement assistance programs
                will encourage housing additions to reduce overcrowding conditions; and
                modifications to accommodate the elderly and the disabled.
                The City’s Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program has financed room

                 Development (HUD) and publicize and encourage the use of Section 8
                 rental assistance certificates.
                 Accomplished by the Hawaiian Gardens Housing Authority.
         3.2     The City and the Redevelopment Agency will continue to provide
                 assistance in the development of new affordable housing purchase
                 opportunities as described in the above programs for Goal 1 above.
                 The Agency has developed a mortgage reduction program that targets
                 the purchase of as many as eight existing single-family homes.
         3.3     Provide incentives for and otherwise encourage the private development
                 of new affordable housing for low- and moderate- income households.
                 The City incentives include land acquisition, mortgage reduction program,
                 density bonuses and other incentives that are consistent with the Housing
                 Component of the Redevelopment Agency’s Implementation Plan. During
                 the prior planning period of 2000 to 2005, no affordable housing units
                 were constructed.

                 including the elderly and disabled.
                 Accomplished. The Hawaiian Gardens Housing Authority now provides
                 Section 8 rental assistance to an average of 108 eligible low-income
                 households. 59% are elderly and/or handicapped.
         3.5     Facilitate the construction of low and moderate income housing, to the
                 extent possible.
                 This policy was not accomplished due to a scarcity of vacant sites and the
                 high cost of land that was experienced in the 2000 to 2005 planning
                 period.
