                                INTRODUCTION
I. GENERAL PLANS
Every city and county in the state of California is required to prepare and maintain a
comprehensive, long-term general plan to guide its future (California Government Code Section
65300). The general plan must cover a local jurisdiction’s planning area and address the broad
range of issues associated with the jurisdiction’s development. The General Plan for the City of
Biggs includes policies providing standards and guidance for land use decisions by the Planning
Commission and the City Council.
II. COMMUNITY OVERVIEW
Physical Location
The City is located in the fertile farmlands of the Sacramento Valley about an hour north of
Sacramento. Known as the “heart of rice country,” Biggs is approximately 25 miles south of Chico
and 25 miles north of Yuba City, just off State Route 99, at an elevation of 93 feet. Biggs is
approximately 4 miles north of Gridley.
Community Character
Biggs typifies the image of a rural, small American town. The population of approximately 1,700
allows most residents to know each other in passing, and many residents have spent most or all
of their lives in the city.
Among the most attractive qualities of Biggs are the relatively quiet and safety, the high quality
of education offered through the Biggs Unified School District, and the affordability of homes in
the community. The qualities of a safe and friendly community make Biggs a pleasant place for
families and those seeking a peaceful place to live.
History
Biggs is a primarily residential community located approximately one-half mile from State Route
99. The main entrance into town is lined with orchards and passes several attractive homes and
the classic architecture of the Biggs Unified School District Administration building. The mature
shade trees lining the City’s primary east-west street (B Street) provide a wonderful canopy and
set the relaxed tone for the community.
Located in the southwest portion of Butte County, the town was founded in 1871 by Mr. A. M.
Pitts and Lewis Posey. It was named Biggs Station after Major Marion Biggs, a prominent local
political leader. After two serious fires in the summer of 1878, a community water system was
constructed. The town was rebuilt with brick commercial buildings and the word “Station” was
dropped from the town name. By 1882, the town had 600 inhabitants and 280 registered voters.
        April 2014                            I-1                     City of Biggs General Plan

                                       INTRODUCTION
Purpose
This document is the General Plan (also referred to as the “Plan”) for the City of Biggs. It
incorporates by reference the Housing Element (prepared and periodically updated separately)
and any future elements to be adopted by the City as an element of the General Plan. The
General Plan affects current and future generations, which requires that the Plan take a long-
term perspective. Typically, general plans look 10 to 20 years into the future. This plan addresses
planning through the year 2030.
The General Plan is the City’s “constitution” for development. It is an effort by the City to
consider and respond in advance to the needs and expectations of its residents concerning
future development. This constitution is framed within the legal framework established by the
State and is based on knowledge of opportunities and constraints affecting the City of Biggs. The
General Plan is implemented through a series of “goals,” “policies,” and “actions” designed to
resolve and/or direct significant community issues.
The General Plan is also regularly referred to by individuals and businesses contemplating
potential development activity within the community. The document explains what the
community expects from new development and where development should occur. Goals in the
General Plan also aid the City Council in seeking grants and other funding to address local issues
and needs.
The General Plan has four main purposes:
•   To enable the Planning Commission and the City Council to reach agreement on long-range
    development policies.
•   To provide a basis for judging whether specific private development proposals and public
    projects are in harmony with City policies.
•   To allow other public agencies and private developers to design projects that are consistent
    with City policies or to seek changes in those policies through the process of amending the
    General Plan.
•   To provide an agreement between the City and outside agencies for development in
    unincorporated portions of the planning area.
III. SCOPE OF THE GENERAL PLAN
The City Limits
The General Plan is more effective on the lands over which the City of Biggs has jurisdiction: land
within the city limits. The incorporated area of the community represents the boundaries of the
City at the time the particular update of the General Plan is adopted. This Plan adopts land use
designations for land outside of the City but which is expected to be annexed in the future. As
          City of Biggs General Plan                 I-2                             April 2014

                                INTRODUCTION
annexations occur, land use designations in the City’s General Plan Land Use Diagram for areas
outside the city limits will apply.
The Sphere of Influence
The Butte County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) has adopted a Sphere of
Influence for the City of Biggs. A sphere of influence is established to represent a city’s ultimate
service limits and is the area in which the city has planning concerns related to the provision of
community services and the management of related resources. To aid in future planning, the
City of Biggs General Plan provides land use designations and policies for all of the land within
the City’s Sphere of Influence.
IV. LEGAL BASIS & REQUIREMENTS OF THE GENERAL PLAN
State law requires that the Plan be comprehensive and that specific subjects or “elements” be
addressed in the Plan. The required elements as specified by Government Code Section
65302(a) through (g) are:
Land Use                  Housing                  Open Space                 Safety
Circulation               Conservation             Noise
Some elements like the open space element encompass a number of planning issues, while
others, such as the noise element, address a more specific topic. Because local conditions vary,
the relevance and importance of each issue will differ from city to city. The General Plan needs
only to address each required element to the extent that it is applicable to the City of Biggs, as
long as the minimum requirements of the law are satisfied.
State law also allows the local jurisdiction to include additional, or “optional,” elements to
address specific issues of concern, as well as to combine required and optional elements as
deemed appropriate (Government Code Section 65303). This General Plan combines the Open
Space and Conservation Elements into a single element, merging it with a Recreation Element,
and adds a Public Facilities & Services Element, a Community Enhancement Element, and an
Economic Development Element.
Consistency with Other City Regulations
The General Plan provides the basis for all of the City’s regulations, policies, and programs that
relate to issues addressed in the Plan. In addition to requiring that the Plan be internally
consistent, the State requires vertical consistency. This means that the City’s zoning and
subdivision ordinances, and any other plans that address development, must all be consistent
with the General Plan. In addition, all development approvals and public projects must be
consistent with the General Plan.
        April 2014                           I-3                       City of Biggs General Plan

                                        INTRODUCTION
The State's General Plan Guidelines provide the following rule for defining consistency:
    An action, program, or project is consistent with the general plan if, considering all its
    aspects, it will further the objectives and policies of the general plan and not obstruct
    their attainment.
This rule clarifies that consistency does not require all subsequent City actions to be specifically
anticipated by the General Plan. Because the Plan is both broad and long-range, there are many
circumstances where future City actions will be addressed only briefly in the Plan and refined by
subsequent action. Due to the complexity of the General Plan and the need for flexibility,
interpretations of the goals, objectives, and programs may result in the appearance of conflicts.
The City Council is the interpreter of the General Plan.
V. GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
Each General Plan element contains a brief discussion of the legal requirements; goals, policies,
and actions to address required topics; and narrative text as necessary to provide an
understanding of the issues addressed. The following terms apply within this General Plan:
Goal:
An achievement to which an effort is directed. The goal states an ideal resolution of the issue
under consideration.
Policy:
A specific statement in the form of text or diagram that helps to clarify and define the goal
statement.
Action:
A specific measure that is readily quantifiable and helps move toward attainment of the goal.
Each goal is numbered to allow easy reference when using the General Plan. The numbering
system does not imply a ranking or priority of the goals, policies, and actions.
While the topics that must be addressed within the General Plan are clearly specified by state
law, the organization is determined by each jurisdiction based on local conditions and issues of
significance. The following are descriptions of the elements of the Biggs General Plan.
          City of Biggs General Plan                  I-4                           April 2014
                                INTRODUCTION
Land Use
The Land Use Element provides guidance for the physical form of the community. This element
contains the Land Use Diagram, which identifies the existing and proposed land uses within the
City. The Land Use Diagram is supported by descriptions of allowed uses and development
densities for each land use designation. Additionally, the land use diagram identifies those areas
where the City anticipates growth in the future, with the intent of avoiding incompatible land
use changes by neighboring agencies and jurisdictions.
Circulation
The Circulation Element provides a framework to guide transportation planning throughout
Biggs and its planning area. The Circulation Element is coordinated and consistent with the
portions of the Land Use, Community Enhancement, Public Facilities & Services, and Public
Health & Safety Elements that address topics directly related to circulation and transportation.
Discussion topics in the Circulation Element include the roadway network, road improvement
standards and guidelines, road maintenance, pedestrian and bicycle circulation, the railroad, and
public transit.
Housing
The Housing Element establishes policies in an effort to ensure all segments of the community
are provided an opportunity for decent and affordable housing. As housing elements must be
updated every five years per state law, this element was prepared and adopted separately in
May 2010. The next update of the housing element will occur in 2014.
Conservation, Open Space & Recreation
Typically, this is a broad-ranging element; many conservation, open space, and recreation topics
are addressed in other sections of the General Plan. This section addresses managed resource
production (agriculture and mineral extraction), biological resources, air quality, and water
resources. A description of natural resources in the vicinity of the city is provided.
Noise
The primary purpose of the Noise Element is to clarify policies and standards by which the local
government can limit the exposure of the community to excessive noise levels. Technical data
relating to mobile and fixed sources is collected into a set of noise control policies and programs.
The policies of the element are to be used as a basis for land use decisions.
Public Health & Safety
Issues discussed in the Public Health & Safety Element include emergency preparedness, flood
hazard, fire and police protection, geologic hazards, hazardous materials and waste
management, and rail service–related hazards.
        April 2014                           I-5                         City of Biggs General Plan

                                        INTRODUCTION
Community Enhancement – Optional Element
The Community Enhancement Element sets forth the City’s vision on issues related to urban
form and community design and establishes policies and programs to guide public
improvements and private development. This element encourages and promotes those aspects
of the city that are valued and desired by residents and which make Biggs a unique community
with a positive memorable character.
Public Facilities & Services – Optional Element
The Public Facilities & Services Element provides policies to address the community’s need for
infrastructure, sewer and wastewater systems, and other community services, as well as
describing the status of public faculties and services within the planning area.
Economic Development – Optional Element
The Economic Development Element addresses efforts that the City will take to bring additional
primary industries, jobs, and other types of industry to Biggs, as well as efforts the City will take
to protect existing jobs in the city.
VI. GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
The City of Biggs must meet a broad range of challenges and obligations with limited financial
resources. Many of the programs described in this General Plan address situations that have
evolved over a number of years and will not be easily resolved.
Since financial limitations are the primary constraint in addressing many of the issues that face
the City, it is imperative that the City seek economically feasible strategies for implementing
General Plan programs. Such strategies will include seeking funding assistance through state and
federal grant programs. Some issues will be more easily resolved by working in conjunction with
other local agencies to achieve mutual goals.
VII. GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS
State law provides for up to four amendments to the General Plan each year. An amendment
may include several “changes” to the General Plan. Amendments to the General Plan require
compliance with the Government Code and environmental laws before they can proceed.
          City of Biggs General Plan                  I-6                            April 2014

             INTRODUCTION
           LAND USE ELEMENT
March 2014                City of Biggs General Plan

                                     LAND USE ELEMENT
The City of Biggs maintains its small-town character through sound
planning, orderly growth, and good design. Biggs’ structure recognizes
the city’s compact, grid-based urban form and supports the agricultural
land uses surrounding the city through the maintenance of firm urban
edges, incorporation of agricultural buffers, and support for agricultural
industry. The city’s form enhances non-vehicular circulation opportunities
and supports the circulation system. New developments are integrated
into and strengthen the existing fabric of the community, and
opportunities for new commercial and employment-generating land uses
are available.
          I. INTRODUCTION
          The Land Use Element provides the central framework for the General Plan and serves as a
          guide for policymakers, city staff, landowners, developers, and the general public on the desired
          pattern of development in the city. The Land Use Element describes both the existing and future
          pattern of the city and provides the foundation for how Biggs will grow and develop over time.
          While the cornerstone of the Plan is the Land Use Diagram that graphically depicts the desired
          land use pattern of the city, the goals, policies, and actions set the course and provide direction
          for how that vision is to be achieved.
          Legal Basis and Requirements
          Government Code Section 65302(a) requires that the General Plan include:
              A land use element which designates the proposed general distribution and general
              location and extent of all uses of the land including land for housing, business, industry,
              open space, including agriculture, natural resources, recreation and enjoyment of scenic
              beauty, education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid disposal facilities, and
              other categories of public and private uses of land. The land use element shall include a
              statement of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended
              for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan. The land use element
              shall identify areas covered by the plan which are subject to flooding and shall be
              reviewed annually with respect to those areas.
          While the Land Use Element is often viewed as the heart of the General Plan, the General Plan is
          also required to maintain consistency between the other individual elements of the Plan.
          Because of the nature of topics addressed in the Land Use Element, all other elements of the
          General Plan overlap land use issues and topics to varying degrees.
                 April 2014                           LU-1                       City of Biggs General Plan

                                      LAND USE ELEMENT
The Circulation Element addresses the transportation network that allows people, vehicles, and
goods to move freely from one land use area to another. The Housing Element addresses the
availability, type, and condition of housing within the community. The Public Health & Safety
Element considers issues of flooding and other community hazards. The Noise Element
considers conflicts between noise-generating and noise-sensitive land uses. The Community
Enhancement Element, an optional element, addresses land use–related issues that contribute
to the community’s character and create a desirable urban environment, including community
recreation. The Public Facilities & Services Element considers the physical facilities that provide
drainage, domestic water, and wastewater treatment services within the community.
This element is composed of five sections. Section I, Introduction, discusses the content of the
element, documents existing land uses and community demographics, and provides projections
for land use demands in Biggs through the year 2030. Section II, Issues and Opportunities,
identifies and addresses various land use–related opportunities and constraints. The Land Use
Plan, Section III, describes the land use classification structure that is employed by the element
and will guide future development. This section also contains the Land Use Diagram for Biggs.
Section IV, Goals, Policies, and Actions, establishes land use goals and policies for the city that
will assist in achieving and facilitating the vision outlined in this Plan, and the actions in this
section outline the various steps that need to be taken to help realize the element’s vision.
Finally, Section V, Special Planning Areas, provides greater depth and discussion regarding the
various issues and opportunities that exist in defined areas of the city.
The City of Biggs desires to be a vibrant city that provides its residents with a range of living,
shopping, and employment opportunities. This element seeks to provide a framework for the
use of land in and around the city that helps to achieve this vision. The element seeks to move
Biggs forward by providing for a sustainable land use pattern that recognizes both the
opportunities and the constraints that exist in the city and sets forth a responsible and
reasonable policy structure to ensure that future growth is consistent with the ity’s vision and
integrated into the existing community.
                                               Overview
                                               Biggs is located in Butte County in the Sacramento
                                               Valley of Northern California, approximately 60
                                               miles north of Sacramento. The city encompasses
                                               approximately 413.9 acres, or 0.65 square miles.
                                               There are currently 540.6 total acres, or 0.84 square
                                               miles, within the Biggs Sphere of Influence. The
                                               Planning Area encompasses 4,627 acres, or 7.23

Biggs was incorporated in 1903 as a general law city intended to serve the agricultural
commerce in the vicinity. The town was originally founded in 1871 by Mr. A.M. Pitts and Lewis
Posey. It was named Biggs Station after Major Marion Biggs, a prominent local political leader.
Situated approximately one-half mile west of State Route 99 along the mainline of the Union
Pacific Railroad line, the city’s location has allowed it to serve as a support community for the
abundant agricultural activities occurring in the area. At the same time, its rural location off of
the main highway allowed it to retain its compact, small-town environment. Biggs has no state
highways within its jurisdiction. Rather, arterial streets and rural roadways serve to connect
Biggs to regional highways, neighboring communities, and surrounding lands.
The majority of Biggs’ residents are deeply rooted
in the area, and many have spent most or all of
their lives in Biggs. The city’s small population
allows for a compact, tightly knit community
composed primarily of single-family residential
dwelling units arranged around a grid street
pattern.
LAND USE SETTING
Existing Land Uses
The city limit of Biggs encompasses an area of
about 414 acres that is predominantly residential
in use. By comparison, employment-generating
uses, commercial land, and vacant land available
for development within the city make up less
than 16 percent of the total area of the city.
By far the largest land use in Biggs is residential. Most of the housing consists of single-family
dwellings, and there are no mobile home parks and no multi-story, multiple-family dwelling unit
developments in the city. More details on the condition of the local housing stock are provided
in the Existing Conditions Report and the Housing Element of this General Plan.

                                      LAND USE ELEMENT
Commercial and industrial land uses in Biggs have been in a state of decline for a number of
years. This change is due to a number of factors. Large retail stores have been developed in the
surrounding cities and have drawn shoppers from Biggs to Oroville, Chico, Yuba City, and
Gridley. Several retail stores in Biggs have experienced significant decreases in sales, forcing
some stores out of business and leaving vacant store fronts in the city’s previously vibrant
commercial area.
The industrial base in Biggs for many years has been rice processing and drying and agricultural
support uses. The limited employment options in the city have resulted in the outward
movement of residents and have limited the commercial development opportunities that often
result from a strong employment base.
Public uses include Biggs Elementary School, Biggs High School, numerous churches, city
buildings, the US Post Office, and city parks.
Biggs currently has limited infill and redevelopment opportunities within the existing city limits
and Sphere of Influence. The 2009–2014 City of Biggs General Plan Housing Element, published
and adopted in 2010, listed a total of 16 vacant residential parcels within the city boundary,
totaling 10.2 acres.
The results of this situation have led to significant interest and pressure for the city to facilitate
development of land outside of the current city limits. The City Council, various landowners, and
some of the city’s residents have expressed interest in the possibility of extending the current
Sphere of Influence and Planning Area to take advantage of growth opportunities presented by
the city’s unique location, topography, and visual, scenic, and natural resources.
Planning Boundaries
Various boundaries are established to define the level of authority of the local agency. With
regard to land use planning for a city, these boundaries are the city limits, the Sphere of
Influence, and the Planning Area.
Within the city limits, the city is the primary land use authority and is responsible for the review
and approval of land use proposals. The Sphere of Influence includes surrounding lands where
the city is likely to expand in the near future. Review and approval of land use proposals in the
sphere rests with the decision-making body of the surrounding county. However, county
decision-makers are encouraged to consider the plans of a city when reviewing development
proposals within the city’s Sphere of Influence. The planning area is a boundary that is defined
by the city and encompasses those lands where the city has interests and concerns. A city has
little authority on land use decisions for land that is within its planning area, but outside of its
Sphere of Influence.
City of Biggs boundaries for these areas are depicted on Figure LU-1.

Population and Demographics
Forecasts of the amount of land required to meet a
community’s demand for urban expansion form the basis for
long-range land use planning decisions. Such forecasts tend to
rely on a combination of information on historic growth rates
and somewhat uncertain projections of market and economic
factors.
The 1977 Biggs General Plan anticipated that the growth rates
of the 1960s and early 1970s would continue. This led to a
belief that the population of Biggs would increase from a 1975
level of 1,377 persons to 2,200 by 1995. In fact, the population
in 1995 population was 1,640, and it has increased only slightly
to 1,692 as of 2013. The 2013 population figure represents a decrease from the city’s year 2000
population of 1,793. As described in the following tables, Biggs has generally enjoyed a steady
rate of growth. However, the growth rate for the period from 1990 through 2000 was the lowest
since Biggs incorporated in 1903.
Table LU-2 shows the population growth in Biggs since 1980. Between 1990 and 2000, the city’s
overall population increased by 13.4 percent, which equals a 1.3 percent average annual
increase. This growth rate was higher than that for Butte County during the same period, which
was 1.0 percent. The population has decreased since the year 2000.

Projected Population
Table LU-3 identifies the future population of Biggs as projected by the Butte County Association
of Governments (BCAG) in their Long-Term Regional Growth Forecast 2010-2035 report. These
projections form the basis for anticipating land required to meet future development needs.
During the decade of 1980 to 1990, the population growth rate was about 1.3 percent per year
on average. Utilizing a longer 30-year historical growth term extending from 1970 through 2000,
the city population grew at a rate of approximately 1.45 percent annually. The Long-Term
Regional Growth Forecasts report published by BCAG in January of 2011 evaluated a range of
potential growth scenarios utilizing annual growth rates ranging from 3.3 percent to 4.1 percent
average annual growth. Utilizing these growth scenarios, it is projected that the city will
potentially double in population size by the year 2035. Table LU-3 shows the potential increase
in population based on the three growth rate scenarios utilized in the Growth Forecast Report.

It is noteworthy that the growth rates assumed in these projections are optimistic. Based on the
city’s historical growth rates and acknowledging the current market conditions, such growth
rates may not be reflective of future growth trends. Unless regional conditions change
significantly in coming years, an average growth rate of 1 percent to 1.5 percent annually is
more likely. However, planning for a slightly higher rate of growth ensures that the General Plan
will accommodate development should economic conditions in the region improve and helps to
ensure the availability of land to accommodate future conditions.
Currently, Biggs could accommodate approximately 18–20 infill dwelling units in existing
neighborhoods. The North Biggs Estates subdivision added 57 new residential lots and
construction is expected to start on the residences in 2014.

                           LAND USE ELEMENT
Idenitified development areas surrounding the city are described in Section V of this element,
Special Planning Districts. Using the growth accommodation projections contained in the Special
Planning District narratives, it is estimated that the potential exists for up to 70 new single-
family homes to be built in the North Area Residential
District and that 111 single-family homes may be built
in the South Area Residential District. These
development areas contain sufficient land to
accommodate the allowed dwelling units.
Additionally, the North Area Residential District will
accommodate an unknown number of attached
dwelling units on land designated as High Density
Residential. Designation of the High Density
Residential land satisfies the Regional Housing Needs
Allocation numbers contained in the adopted Biggs
Housing Element.
Nonresidential land use types required to meet the needs of the community include public
(schools, parks, wastewater treatment, flood control, etc.), industrial, and commercial.
Public uses will be accommodated on land outside the city and primarily on land designated as
Agriculture. The Biggs Unified School District owns 30 acres of undeveloped land (in addition to
the high school farm) adjacent to the existing school site. This area will meet the school’s needs
and may also allow development of new parkland. Additional parks will be developed in areas
designated for residential development. Expansion of the wastewater treatment plant, if
necessary, will occur on agricultural land to the west of designated urban uses.
Expansion of commercial and industrial uses has been quite slow in recent years. This General
Plan assumes that between 10 to 30 acres of new industrial development could occur by 2020.
Commercial development assumed under this Plan includes intensified uses along B Street and
the need for 5 to 10 acres of new commercial development within the city limits to
accommodate the projected increase in overall city population.
II. ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
This section of the element identifies and addresses
primary land use issues identified during the
development of the General Plan and the public
outreach process. Policy guidance is found in Section
IV of this element.
Since the time of its incorporation, Biggs has
maintained the grid-based street and block pattern
that defines its current form. Streets and blocks are
generally laid out in an evenly spaced pattern using a
       April 2014                           LU-9                      City of Biggs General Plan

                                      LAND USE ELEMENT
rectilinear orientation moving away from the railroad tracks in the center of the city. The result
of this pattern is a highly walkable, highly connected urban fabric that allows for multiple
circulation options for pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles. Biggs’ large urban lot sizes promote
substantial property setbacks and allow for design features such as detached sidewalks and
street planting strips while maintaining room for ample front yards. The traditional grid form
also serves to focus development in an “outward-looking” orientation. The use of the traditional
grid-based block and street pattern is accommodated by the city’s flat terrain and limited
topographical and natural landform impediments.
Recent developments both inside of the city and in surrounding communities have been moving
away from the traditional grid-based design system to a land form pattern that incorporates
curvilinear and cul-de-sac streets and makes use of common area open spaces and varied lot
sizes and orientations. This recent movement away from a more traditional or structured urban
form to layout that incorporates a more organic form also results in developments that are
focused “inward” with development oriented toward the interior of the project.
This shift in development layout will require the city to pay heightened attention to ensure that
new developments are integrated into the existing urban fabric and that new development does
not become isolated from the existing developed areas of the city. Additionally, attention will
need to be paid to make sure that adequate circulation and transportation linkages are
maintained and that the newer areas of the city retain the essential character qualities that
residents of Biggs have valued.
Biggs is now and has always been a city that values,
supports, and complements the agricultural
community that surrounds it. Due to the city’s
location in an active and thriving agricultural area,
any outward expansion of the city will necessarily
transition the use of land from active agriculture to
urban development. As a result, the city will need to
pay particular attention to issues of land use
compatibility and will look to ensure that new
development minimizes the impacts of growth on the
agricultural community that has supported Biggs
since its beginnings. Through the use of land use
buffers and transitions, sensible design, and a
planned and methodical pattern of expansion, the
impacts to surrounding agriculture can be minimized.
This Plan recognizes both the opportunities that
outward expansion onto undeveloped lands offers
and the constraints that expansion into active
agricultural areas brings. This Plan proposes a hard
urban-agricultural edge along the city’s west side that
seeks to responsibly allow for the use of land in close

proximity to the city’s existing urban infrastructure and municipal services while providing for a
transition of land use on the outer-edge of the city that recognizes the need for the continued
use of agricultural lands in that area. Additionally, the land use plan incorporates agriculturally
supportive land use classifications that accommodate existing agricultural operations within the
city limits and that place a value on agricultural service areas which can enhance the feel and
value of the community.
Commerce and Employment-Generating Development
The nature of commercial development has changed dramatically in the last 30 years. Services
that were traditionally located in central urban core or “downtown” areas have vacated these
areas in search of more lucrative locations, often along major transportation corridors offering
better access and enhanced visibility. Traditional family-oriented and small businesses have
been replaced with “big box” and regional-serving commercial centers with an array of
commercial service offerings in a common location.
This Plan recognizes both the importance of revitalizing and enhancing the urban core of the city
and the value and necessity to accommodate regional-serving commercial and employment
uses in high visibility and easily accessible locations in the city. The Land Use Diagram and policy
orientation of this Plan seek to accommodate the need for a strong and vibrant downtown core,
along with additional commercial service and employment-generating land use locations along
major transportation routes. This Plan provides for both of these options and utilizes a land use
concept that focuses nonresidential land use at important transportation hub locations.
Industrial land uses are located to take advantage of existing municipal infrastructure as well as
land use compatibilities with existing uses and the opportunities presented by the railroad
tracks.
                                          Urban Growth and Annexation
                                          As described elsewhere in this element and in the
                                          General Plan Update Existing Conditions Report
                                          supporting this Plan, future growth opportunities are
                                          constrained by the small size of the city and the city’s
                                          Sphere of Influence as well as the highly developed
                                          nature of the existing city. The analysis undertaken as
                                          part of the preparation of the city’s Housing Element
                                          identified only a limited number of urban infill
opportunities remaining within the existing city limits for new residential development and only
one undeveloped infill site for new commercial development. As a result of the limited options
remaining in the city for new development, the city will need to look beyond its existing
developed core for new opportunities. The outward development of the city presents numerous
challenges related to the installation of municipal services and infrastructure to support new
development as well as procedural and policy issues related to updating municipal services plans
        April 2014                           LU-11                       City of Biggs General Plan

                                      LAND USE ELEMENT
and the city’s Sphere of Influence, including annexation of property and the undertaking of the
necessary environmental analysis documents. Undertaking the necessary efforts to achieve the
vision of this Plan will take a focused commitment by the city along with the necessary
resources to achieve the goals of this General Plan.
However, along with the procedural and policy issues that result from the need to expand in an
outward direction come the potential benefits to the city resulting from new commercial and
employment-generating uses. Because new development will need to be planned “from the
ground up,” the city is in a desirable position of being able to ensure that future projects
advance the goals and objectives of this Plan and are designed in a way that enhances the
overall city.
Transportation Linkages
As Biggs grows from a small, densely populated city of
under 2,000 people to become a city approximately twice
its current size, the movement of people in and around
the city will be a key issue. Walking, cycling, public
transit, and driving will all be important modes of travel.
Residents, employees, and visitors should have
transportation choices in moving throughout the
community and traveling to communities in the region.
Streets will be designed to offer circulation choices to all
modes of travel, a system of off-street trails will connect
the city, and transit opportunities will be expanded to offer additional circulation options. Land
use and transportation planning will go hand in hand to ensure transportation options are
integrated into the future of the city.
III. THE LAND USE PLAN
Land Use Classification Descriptions
State planning law requires that the land use element of a general plan include a statement of
the standard population density, building intensity, and allowed uses for the various land use
designations in the plan (Government Code Section 65302(a)). The city’s land use designations
are generally described below and mapped on the Land Use Diagram (Figure LU-2). Table LU-5
includes information on the permitted density ranges and floor area ratios, if applicable, for
each designation. The Biggs Municipal Code provides detailed land use and development
standards for development.
With this General Plan, a variety of new land use designations have been established to reflect
the more mixed and, in some cases, more intense land uses envisioned for Biggs. New mixed-
use designations provide the opportunity for a combination of residential, commercial, and
office uses on a single site, depending on the designation.

                         LAND USE ELEMENT
Agricultural Categories
A – Agriculture
This land use designation encompasses areas inside of the
city’s Planning Area, but outside of designated urban
development areas. The principal land use in this area is
agricultural production.
AC – Agriculture Commercial
This land use designation allows for the growing and sales of
agricultural products grown, produced, or processed on-site.
The intent of this designation is to encourage farms within
the Planning Area to continue in operation by allowing for
fruit and vegetable stands, field crops, flower sales, product
sales, etc. The principal land use in this area remains
agriculture; however, direct agriculturally supporting
commercial uses may be permitted.
AI – Agriculture Industrial
This land use designation allows for more intensive agricultural
processing such as rice mills, hulling operations, dairies, and similar
agricultural product processing. The principal land use remains
agriculture; however, direct agriculturally supporting industrial
uses may be permitted.
Residential Categories
LDR – Low Density Residential
This designation allows for single-family homes, second
dwelling units, and other compatible uses. This land use
designation would be expected to result in the form of
detached dwellings on individual lots. The designation has
generally been applied to areas slightly removed from
higher-density core areas or in areas where a transition of
density is desirable.

                           MDR – Medium Density Residential
                           This designation allows for a variety of residential living
                           environments, including single-family detached dwellings on
                           small lots, townhomes, duplex residences, multi-story
                           dwellings, and other compatible uses. The expected urban
                           form would be higher-density dwelling units on individual or
                           commonly held parcels or lots. This designation has generally
                           been applied to the developed core area of the city and areas
                           located adjacent to higher-intensity core areas.
                           HDR – High Density Residential
                           This designation allows for a broad variety of housing types,
                           including single-family detached, zero-lot-line single-family,
                           duplex, triplex, and four-plex units, townhouses, apartments,
                           and condominiums. The expected urban form would be
                           higher-density dwellings on commonly held parcels or lots.
                           This designation has generally been applied to areas of
                           higher-intensity land use and in areas serviced by existing or
                           planned collector or arterial roadways.
                           MU – Residential Mixed Use
                           This designation is intended to encourage a mix of residential
                           dwelling types and densities, professional office, and light
                           commercial uses. This designation has generally been applied
                           in areas of higher-intensity land use and in locations served
                           by planned collector or arterial roadways.
                             Commercial Categories
                             DMU – Downtown Mixed Use
                             This designation encompasses areas primarily in the city’s
                             downtown along B Street and west of Fourth Street. This
                             designation encourages the use of second and subsequent
                             floors of commercial buildings as residential and
                             professional office space. The primary land use will be
                             commercial with supporting residential or professional
                             office uses.

Land Use Density and Intensity Standards
California planning law requires that density and intensity standards be presented for each land
use designation contained in the General Plan. These standards are intended to describe the
desired size of buildings in relation to the size of parcels of property and the intended number of
dwelling units on each acre of land. Specific development standards, including setbacks, street
frontage requirements, and building height, are not generally included in the General Plan but
are generally included in the city’s Zoning Ordinance.
Residential development is regulated according to density, which is expressed in the number of
dwelling units per gross acre. Nonresidential development is regulated according to
development intensity. This General Plan provides floor area ratios, described as the physical
area of a building divided by the area of a parcel of land. Additionally, the City of Biggs uses a
combination of maximum lot coverage and building height to regulate the intensity of
nonresidential development.
Allowable density and intensity for each General Plan land use designation is described on Table
LU-5.

1. Gross acreage and net acreage are commonly used measurements of area in planning and zoning. A gross
acre is all land (inclusive of streets and rights-of-way) designated for a particular use. Net acreage is the area of
a parcel exclusive of streets, rights-of-way, and other areas not normally within lots. Gross acreage is utilized in
this Plan to regulate density.
2. Please refer to the Zoning Ordinance contained within the Biggs Municipal Code for specific development
standards for guidance on lot size, lot coverage, building height, and other development standards.
Note: It is noted herein that individual parcel lot coverages may exceed the maximum lot coverage listed in the
table above when developed as part of a larger project meeting the lot coverage/intensity standards of the
applicable land use designation.
General Plan/Zoning Consistency
The Zoning Ordinance serves and the primary tool for implementing the city’s General Plan land
use policies. State planning law requires the Zoning Ordinance to be consistent with the General
Plan. Each General Plan land use designation must have one or more corresponding zoning
districts, and the development standards and land use regulations contained in the Zoning
Ordinance must reflect the policy statements in the General Plan. While the General Plan may
be somewhat broad in its discussion of permitted land uses and development intensities, zoning
provisions must identify specific regulations so that property owners and developers can
determine how particular properties can be used and developed. Table LU-6 identifies the
relationship between land use categories and zoning districts.

V. SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS
Planning districts have been defined in this General Plan to document the major planning areas
that may be developed during the term of this General Plan. Additionally, the general character
and anticipated uses envisioned by the city are described for each special district. The eight
Special Planning Districts are graphically depicted on Figure LU-3.
The Special Planning District narratives are envisioned as supplemental information intended to
provide additional details about specific areas of the city and to provide an enhanced level of
information for the areas described. The narrative descriptions are intended to portray uses the
city would encourage within the given area. For purposes of development, the base General
Plan designations depicted on Figure LU-2 provide the applicable land use designation and the
parcel-specific zoning designation describes the appropriate uses.
The following discussions address general development constraints. One constraint, drainage,
will apply to all new development. Channels carrying runoff from Biggs are at full capacity
downstream of the city. Therefore, all new development must contribute to facilities to retain
runoff so as to avoid increasing the rate of runoff leaving the community. Specific plans for such
drainage facilities will be prepared by the city, and appropriate fees or other requirements will
be applied to all new development.

B Street Corridor Commercial District
Setting
The B Street Corridor Commercial District forms the downtown core of the community and
includes virtually all the commercial businesses within the existing city limits of Biggs. Significant
historic structures along B Street include the Colonia Hotel, the Biggs Carnegie Library, and the
Sacramento Valley Bank Building.
Commercial uses along B Street have been in a state of decline for more than 20 years due to a
variety of conditions. Currently, numerous buildings on the south side of B Street are not
occupied by active businesses and have fallen into a state of disrepair and dilapidation.
Constraints
The most immediate constraint in the establishment of new businesses along B Street is the lack
of available spaces for purchase or rent. Limited vacant land is located on the north side of B
Street and could accommodate new construction. The underutilized buildings along the south
side of B Street represent the greatest potential for creating new business sites. However, the
condition of these buildings is a concern, and some of the structures may require significant
improvements to meet current earthquake safety standards.
B Street Corridor Commercial District Vision
The city envisions the B Street Corridor remaining as the primary business district of Biggs.
Ideally, businesses will occupy all structures or properties along B Street between Fifth and
Seventh streets, possibly extending further east or west as well, and will provide basic goods
and services to meet the needs of the community.
Of particular interest is the restoration of the Colonia Hotel and reuse of the Brinks building,
which is located next to the Colonia.
North Area Residential District
Setting
The North Area Residential District is located north of H Street, east of Fourth Street, and
northwest of Rio Bonito Road. This district is currently in primarily agricultural uses, interspersed
with rural residential home sites. The North Area Residential District is designated on the
General Plan as an area dominated by low- and medium-density residential land uses in the
north and west area and having one of two mixed-use core areas on its northeast side. The
mixed-use core area has been identified in the area surrounding the existing intersection of Rio
Bonito Road and Milky Way Drive. This core area is envisioned as a predominantly residential
area allowing for medium- to high-density residential development with limited commercial and
mixed-use land uses. The mixed-use core area of the district is located at the intersection of
three roadways identified as collector roads on the Circulation Diagram.
           City of Biggs General Plan               LU-32                             April 2014
                           LAND USE ELEMENT
Constraints
Historically, drainage concerns have been the major development constraint in this area. The
existing drainage channel (Lateral K), which conveys water from the Biggs Unified School District
high school site, north along Second Street, and around the northern boundary of Biggs,
represents an area of concern due to historical flooding and water backflow. This channel
currently operates at near to full capacity during major storms as waters in the canal area
ultimately drained into Hamilton Slough west of the city. During major storm events, water is
occasionally unable to drain from Lateral K into Hamilton Slough due to downstream flooding
and capacity issues and backs up in the canal. Undergrounding of this channel, along with
downstream realignment actions, may be required prior to full development of this area.
Historically, the area located at the northern end of Second and Third streets, directly adjacent
to the North Area Residential District, experienced drainage and flooding issues. Recent
modifications to the water flow structures in this area have minimized these issues; however,
downstream capacity issues still remain. These drainage issues will most likely need to be
addressed prior to significant development activity occurring in this area.
Providing wastewater treatment service to this area may also be problematic due to the
distance to the treatment plant and limited capacity in collection lines. Prior to development,
project proponents in this area will be required to provide documentation of collection and
treatment facility capacity and specific improvements that will be required to provide
wastewater treatment service.
North Area Residential District Vision
The city envisions this area to be developed in primarily residential uses as an extension of
existing neighborhoods to the south. The City of Biggs approved the North Biggs Estate
residential subdivision in this area in 2006, which extended roadway and utility infrastructure
into the area and provided for future roadway connections to continue the integration of the
North Area Residential District into the existing city pattern. This project, while undeveloped at
the time of the development of this Plan, serves as the first step in opening up future
development opportunities in the area.
The Biggs Unified School District owns land directly across Rio Bonito Road from this area, and
the relationship between the proposed residential development and the existing and proposed
school sites is considered a positive attribute.
Southeast Area Residential District
Setting
The Southeast Area Residential District is located generally south and east of the existing city
limits and outside of the developed area of the city. This area includes land east of First Street
and south of B Street, and wraps around the southeast corner of Biggs to encompass properties
adjacent to Dakota Avenue.
        April 2014                           LU-33                     City of Biggs General Plan
                                      LAND USE ELEMENT
Constraints
Drainage, infrastructure availability, and circulation are the major development constraints in
this area. Hamilton Slough is located directly north of Dakota Avenue along the westernmost
section of the road. Immediately north of Hamilton Slough are the Pichotta and Southfield
Manor subdivisions.
Reclamation District (RD) 833 has expressed strong concern over residential development
immediately adjacent to Hamilton Slough and has indicated that Hamilton Slough is currently
operating at full capacity during major storm events. As such, RD 833 has indicated that no new
peak storm flows can be accommodated in the channel. Historically, RD 833 has indicated a
desire to see that Hamilton Slough be placed underground to accommodate an engineered
solution to the conveyance of storm water and agricultural discharge waters in the area;
however, engineering, environmental, and cultural resource constraints make this request
highly unlikely. Additional consultation with RD 833 will be required to address storm drainage
issues in this area. However, the city will explore the possibility of expanding the Hamilton
Slough corridor to provide a recreational parkway and nature reserve while addressing the
concerns of the reclamation district in this area.
Access to undeveloped or underdeveloped parcels in this area may also offer a constraint to
development in the Southeast Area Residential District. First Street has not been constructed or
planned as a typical urban street, and adequate right-of-way is currently unavailable to make
the necessary improvements to widen and upgrade the street. Additionally, First Street does not
cross Hamilton Slough on its south end, thereby limiting circulation options to B Street only at
this time. Additionally, Dakota Avenue, a rural local street in the unincorporated county area, is
also an underdeveloped roadway having right-of-way and street improvement limitations.
The Southeast Area Residential District does not currently have any developed municipal
infrastructure within its boundaries. Potentially significant constraints exist relative to extending
water and sewer lines to the area due to the presence of Hamilton Slough and existing capacity
issues in service and collection lines located in the developed area of the city to the west. Any
future development in this area will be required to provide detailed engineering plans
addressing the extension and provision of municipal services to this area.
Southeast Area Residential District Vision
The city envisions this area developed with primarily low-density residential uses as an
extension of existing neighborhoods to the north and west and to provide a buffer to the larger
unincorporated farm properties located to the south and east. Eventually, Sixth Street will
become one of the major entries to the city. The city anticipates the replacement of the existing
bridge structure crossing Hamilton Slough within the life of this Plan, which would reduce
existing traffic congestions issues entering and exiting Biggs from the south. Development in this
area should support and contribute to the design elements of street design and landscaping that
create attractive community entries.
           City of Biggs General Plan                LU-34                             April 2014
                            LAND USE ELEMENT
Ultimately, development in this area should extend the established grid of the city streets and
should provide roadway connections between B Street and Dakota Avenue.
West Area Industrial/Residential District
Setting
The West Area Industrial/Residential District is located in the southwest portion of Biggs and is
adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad tracks on its eastern edge, wrapping around the
southwest and western edge of the city. The developed properties in this area are currently
utilized for primarily public facilities, heavy industrial, and agricultural industrial purposes.
Constraints
Development in this area is relatively unconstrained. Potential concerns include noise generated
by the railroad and the dust, noise, and heavy truck traffic generated by the SunWest Milling
facilities in the area. However, the industrial uses anticipated for this area are not highly
sensitive to the existing environmental constraints. Additional concerns in this area include odor
and capital facilities buffering concerns related to the city’s wastewater treatment plant.
Portions of this area that are adjacent to existing or future residential uses will be limited to
industrial and agricultural industrial uses which will not adversely impact the neighboring
residential uses.
West Area Industrial/Residential District Vision
The city envisions this area developed with industrial, agricultural industrial, and low-density
residential uses. This development is intended both to provide jobs and revenue to Biggs and to
buffer existing and future residential uses from the noise and dust–related impacts of existing
and future industrial uses and railroad activity. The portion of the district allowing for low-
density residential development is intended to provide a transition of density from the existing
developed area of the city, utilizing the proximity of the area to existing municipal infrastructure
to allow for the extension of utilities to serve new development. New residential development
in this area will need to incorporate site design and planning elements that address land use
compatibility concerns with the industrial and agricultural industrial uses planned to the south
and west.
The city supports the creation of a new road crossing of the Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the
area south of town (see Figure LU-2: Land Use Diagram and Figure CIRC-3: Circulation Diagram).
This southern crossing would improve access to industrial areas and would reduce heavy truck
traffic within the city.

North Area Industrial District
Setting
The North Area Industrial District located north of H Street, east of the Union Pacific Railroad
tracks and west of Fourth Street, is dominated by the existing Red Top Rice Growers rice drying
facility, which has been active for more than 50 years. Existing development in this district
consists primarily of the Red Top Rice facility, agricultural operations, and limited rural
residential development within the unincorporated county area.
Constraints
Major constraints in this area include noise and dust impacts from the Red Top Rice Growers
facility, the Union Pacific Railroad, and drainage issues related to the RD 833 Lateral K canal that
provides flood control to the north Biggs area.
North Area Industrial District Vision
The city envisions this area to be developed with a combination of light and heavy industrial
uses that are not negatively affected by the noise and dust conditions of the area. Industrial
uses would serve to buffer existing and future residential uses located to the south and east
from the existing rice drying facility and agricultural operations to the north. New industrial
development would generally consist of light industrial uses limited to uses having minimal
exterior operations and lower noise, lighting, and dust attributes.
As with all development in the city, increases in surface runoff resulting from new development
will be retained in storm water detention facilities. Additionally, North Area Industrial District
development will contribute to improving existing drainage channels located within the area.
State Route 99/West Rio Bonito Special District
Setting
The State Route 99/West Rio Bonito Special Planning District is located to the north and south of
West Rio Bonito Road and to the west of State Route 99. This land is in use for agricultural and
agricultural commercial purposes, with limited rural residential development supporting the
agricultural uses.
Located along State Route 99, this district serves as one of the primary gateways to Biggs, and it
is anticipated that this area will eventually be annexed to Biggs. Therefore, the city has an
interest in ensuring that the form and character of development in this area is consistent with
the city’s long-term vision.
Annexation of land in this district is viewed as possible during the horizon of this General Plan.
As such, the city maintains an active interest in the activities that occur in the area and desires
to see them develop in a manner consistent with this Plan.
            City of Biggs General Plan                LU-36                          April 2014

                           LAND USE ELEMENT
Constraints
The primary constraint to development in this area is related to its distance from existing
development and municipal services. While some development may occur prior to extension of
services, full development as envisioned by the city will not occur until services are extended
and the area has been annexed to Biggs.
State Route 99/West Rio Bonito Commercial District Vision
The city envisions this area developed in agriculturally supportive commercial uses that attract
passing consumers and visitors on State Route 99. The character of this area will be one of
unique shopping opportunities that, ideally, highlight the local character and agricultural
products of the region.
Typical highway commercial will be strongly discouraged in this area. Appropriate uses include
shops selling local products and produce. The anchor use of this area will likely be the Bayliss
Farms lavender farm, which produces herbs and distills essential oils. Other uses which the city
considers appropriate for this area include specialty gardening and hardware shops, a restaurant
capable of attracting patrons from surrounding communities, and small-scale professional
offices supporting the local agricultural community.
State Route 99/B Street Mixed-Use Core District
Setting
The State Route 99/B Street Mixed-Use Core District is envisioned as an area of primary interest
for development within the horizon of this General Plan and is envisioned as a priority area for
the expansion of the city. The land area in this district would provide Biggs with a visual window
and physical presence on the major regional circulation route in the area, State Route 99, and
would open up new developable opportunities having the potential for the development of
substantial commercial and employment-generating land uses.
Existing land uses in the area consists primarily of agricultural tree-crop uses along with limited
commercial and rural residential uses.
Constraints
The primary constraint to development in this area is related to its distance from existing
development and municipal services. While some development may occur prior to extension of
services, full development as envisioned by the city will not occur until services are extended
and the area has been annexed to Biggs. An additional constraint in this area is related to
drainage. Issues related to the discharge of water into Hamilton Slough will need be addressed,
and localized drainage impoundment will be required.

                                      LAND USE ELEMENT
State Route 99/B Street Mixed-Use Core District Vision
The city envisions this area as one of the primary areas for the urban expansion of the city
within the horizon of this Plan due to the opportunities that are presented by State Route 99
and the circulation options available in the district. The Land Use Diagram envisions this area as
being developed with a mixture of medium- and higher-density residential uses, mixed-use
development, and commercial service uses. The area within this district is envisioned as
providing a full-range of urban living options along with both local and regional-serving
commercial and employment opportunities.
Hamilton Slough Parkway
Setting
Hamilton Slough approaches Biggs from the northeast, passes town to the south, and flows on
toward southwest Butte County. This waterway serves irrigation and flood control needs of
Biggs and surrounding land owners.
Constraints
Constraints to development along Hamilton Slough are of two primary types: conditions which
restrict urban development potential and conditions which restrict development of the
proposed Parkway.
Urban development constraints include flooding potential related to the channel as well as
concerns of increasing overall downstream flows during storm events. The existing vegetation,
particularly in the vicinity of the Slough and First Street is the most significant wildlife habitat
remaining in the Biggs planning area and will merit special consideration to avoid loss of wildlife
resources.
Constraints to development of the Parkway itself are primarily economic. Expansion of the
Slough corridor will be required to accommodate Parkway uses. This land is currently in private
ownership and acquisition costs may be significant. Additionally, the Slough is under the
authority of Reclamation District 833 and coordination with this agency will be required before
initiating new uses along the Slough Corridor.
Hamilton Slough Parkway Vision
The initial proposal under consideration by the City is to create a publicly accessible trail that
would follow Hamilton Slough from B Street, east of the Biggs Elementary School, to the
crossing of the Slough at Sixth Street.
Uses along the Slough would be passive in nature, with a walking/jogging trail passing through
an oak woodland and agricultural land setting. Ultimately, uses might be expanded to include a
City owned/leased agricultural demonstration site that highlights production and processing of
local agricultural goods.

                                  CIRCULATION ELEMENT
The City of Biggs provides a circulation system that functions as a well-
connected, safe, and efficient system offering residents, visitors, and
businesses a range of transportation mode choices and route options.
Bikeways, pedestrian improvements, and transit are integrated
throughout the system. The city’s streets will function as aesthetically
attractive public spaces that serve to efficiently circulate traffic while
recognizing the City’s fiscal constraints.
          I.     INTRODUCTION
          The Circulation Element describes the full-range of transportation systems in the City of Biggs
          and its Planning Area. Circulation refers to the ability to move people and goods safely and
          efficiently about the city. A well-functioning circulation system is important to the overall
          success of the City and is an important consideration to Biggs’ quality of life. This element seeks
          to guide the City in its development of a circulation system that recognizes all modes of travel
          based on a network of roadways arranged around a
          modified grid street system. The goals, policies, and MULTIMODAL means the movement
          actions established herein will guide development of of people and goods using more than
          the city’s circulation system, including roadways and one mode of transportation. The
                                                                        Circulation Element focuses on
          transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities and services.
                                                                        meeting the needs of all users of the

          accommodates vehicles, transit, bicycles, and pedestrians. This network is intended to enhance
          mobility for the entire community and all user groups.
          Overview
          Biggs is located approximately one-half of a mile west of State Route 99 (SR 99), a primary
          north–south highway serving local, regional, and interstate users. The city has connections to SR
          99 at B Street and at Rio Bonito Road. The connection of B Street and SR 99 has a signalized
          intersection, while the intersection at Rio Bonito Road is stop sign controlled only.
          Biggs’ circulation system is typical of a small, rural city. Much of the existing street system
          follows a traditional grid pattern, which allows for efficient movement and good connection

between all parts of the city. B Street and E Street are the primary east–west streets, with both
streets having signal-controlled crossings of the railroad tracks. Both streets are designated
truck routes. Eighth Street, West Biggs-Gridley Road, and Sixth Street are the primary north–
south streets, with Eighth Street providing access to the north and West Biggs-Gridley Road and
Sixth Street providing access to the south. Eighth Street, West Biggs-Gridley Road, and Sixth
Street are all designated truck routes.
Although the roadway network primarily serves automobile traffic, it also serves a variety of
other modes, such as trucks, buses, bicycles, and pedestrians. One of the main characteristics of
the roadway network in Biggs is the low volume of traffic, which facilitates easy movement
throughout the city. Further, because the topography of the town is flat and the climate
agreeable, conditions are optimal for alternative modes of transportation.
There are two main constraints to the existing circulation system. The first is the limited east–
west connectivity caused by the Union Pacific Railroad tracks that run north–south bisecting the
western portion of the city between Seventh and Eighth
streets. Currently, there are three at-grade crossings of the MODIFIED GRID – A network of streets

II. ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
This section of the element identifies and addresses various circulation issues and opportunities
known to the city and raised during the General Plan update process. Policy guidance is found in
the element’s text and maps and the goals, policies, and actions section of this element.
Connectivity
Connectivity between neighborhoods, the downtown, schools, businesses, and shopping areas is
critical to good land use planning. Connecting the city through the choice of multiple route
options reduces automobile dependence, focuses traffic issues, and reduces overall vehicle
miles traveled. Goals, policies, and actions in this element focus on maintaining and enhancing
the existing grid-based system of streets and improving connectivity between activity centers,
destinations, regional connections, and commerce locations.

Complete Streets
The creation of a multimodal circulation network is an important consideration for the city. One
of the most effective ways to achieve this goal is to require streets, where appropriate, to be
designed as “complete streets” presenting options for movement beyond simply a focus on
vehicles. State law (California Complete Streets Act of 2007) requires consideration of complete
streets in California general plans. Roadways developed using the principles of complete streets
can accommodate vehicles, transit, bicycles, and pedestrians using designs that may include
sidewalks or paths, on- or off-street bicycle facilities, vehicle parking and travel lanes, and transit
facilities. The complete streets concept seeks to ensure that all residents, regardless of mode of
travel, are provided an opportunity to use the city’s circulation network. The concept does not,
however, dictate a specific street design or
mandate that all streets accommodate all modes
of travel in the same manner.
Non-Motorized Circulation
Biggs has a limited number of non-motorized
circulation options due in part to the city’s limited
size, geographic positioning, low growth rate, and
financial constraints. Residents commonly utilize
the city’s street system for non-motorized
circulation due to low traffic volumes and limited
options for off-street travel. However, over the past ten years, the City has made significant
progress toward providing sidewalks, off-street paths and trails, and designated on-street
bicycle facilities. The city has recently completed an update to its Bicycle Transportation Plan
that identified numerous new potential bike routes, completed a project to install off-street
access to Rio Bonito Park, and worked with new development to install the foundations for a
future trail leading to the northern parts of the city.
Heavy Truck Traffic
                                                  As further described in other parts of this Plan,
                                                  the primary industry within and surrounding the
                                                  city is agriculture. Two major rice storage and
                                                  processing facilities are located within the city
                                                  and Planning Area. The locations of these
                                                  facilities result in periodically significant volumes
                                                  of heavy truck traffic traversing city streets. Both
                                                  of these facilities are located on the west side of
                                                  the city. While their locations are convenient for
                                                  trucks accessing the facilities from the rice fields

                         CIRCULATION ELEMENT
facilities and seeking to access SR 99 results in
truck trips traversing the city on B Street or E
Street. Both B Street and E Street are located
adjacent to schools, traverse residential areas of
the city, and often have pedestrians present.
Additionally, B Street traverses the city’s
downtown commercial core where potential
hazards associated with on-street parking and
additional pedestrian presence creates potential
hazards. While significant problems have been
minimal to date, the mixing of heavy truck traffic,
pedestrians, school zones, and residential neighborhoods is an issue that continues to present
itself. To address this issue, the city should continue to be vigilant in enforcing traffic safety laws
and look to opportunities to establish new or alternative routes for heavy truck traffic.
The city’s existing designated truck routes are presented on Figure CIRC-2.
Railroad Tracks
The west-coast mainline of the Union Pacific Railroad bisects Biggs on its west side. While the
presence of railroad tracks within a city in not uncommon, the tracks present issues related to
safety, noise, and roadway continuity. The city currently has three crossings of the railroad
tracks at B, E, and F streets. All three crossings are signal controlled with crossing gates and
lights. The existing crossing at F Street is the least used crossing, as F Street is not a major
circulation route in the city. The primary issue with the three crossing locations is that all three
locations can be, and are occasionally, blocked simultaneously when a train is present.
Additionally, if a train stops at the local rice mill to pick up or deliver rail cars, all three crossings
can be blocked and thus no access across the track is available. This condition presents an issue
for emergency responders and could present a significant traffic issue if the railroad tracks were
to be blocked for an extended period of time.
Future Growth and Development
The compact nature of the city’s existing form, combined with the relative lack of vacant parcels
to accommodate growth and the vision of the General Plan’s Land Use Diagram to grow the city
outward, presents both issues and opportunities to the circulation system. The opportunities
presented by future urban growth include the ability to provide new routes to address existing
connectivity and safety issues and to provide additional opportunities for complete streets and
non-motorized travel. The issues associated with such growth include issues of maintenance and
expense, an increase in the potential for traffic conflicts, and an overall increase in vehicle trips
on city streets. The result will be that the city needs to continue to plan for and consider the

potential opportunities and issues presented by outward expansion to make sure the future
improvements to the circulation system advance the vision of this Plan and conform to the
goals, objectives, and actions of this Circulation Element.
III. EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK
The major roadways serving the city are described below.
State Highways
State Route 99 (SR 99) is a north–south two-lane conventional rural highway approximately one-
half mile east of the city limits. It is a major route for goods movement, especially agricultural
products, through California’s north-central valley. Access to SR 99 is provided via B Street and
Rio Bonito Road. State Route 99 is a California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) roadway
facility.
Existing Major Roadways
Arterial Roadways
B Street is designated as a two-lane arterial that runs east–west through the city from SR 99 to
West Biggs-Gridley Road. B Street also serves as a designated truck route through the city. On-
street angled parking is provided between Sixth and Seventh Streets through the main
downtown commercial area. On-street parallel parking is available on the remaining portions of
the street.
E Street is designated as a two-lane east–west arterial that extends from West Rio Bonito Road
to Ninth Street. It also serves as a designated truck route through the city. Parallel on-street
parking exists along the entire length of the street, except for the north side of the street
between Fifth and Sixth Streets where a combination of on-street angled and on-street
perpendicular parking is provided. E Street has a Class II bike lane on both sides of the street
from Second Street to Eighth Street.
Eighth Street runs parallel to and on the west side of the Union Pacific Railroad tracks and
operates as a two-lane arterial from Afton Road on the north to Bannock Street. Eighth Street is
a designated truck route and accommodates nearly all of the heavy truck traffic on the west side
of the city. Eighth Street has a Class II bike lane along its eastern edge from B Street to E Street.

West Biggs-Gridley Road runs parallel to and on the west side of the Union Pacific Railroad
tracks and operates as a two-lane arterial street from its transition from B Street on the north to
the point where it exits the city limits on the south. West Biggs-Gridley Road is a designated
truck route and accommodates all of the heavy truck traffic on the west side of the city entering
or exiting Biggs to the south and on the west side of the railroad tracks.
Collector Roadways
Sixth Street is a two-lane north–south collector through the center of Biggs that extends from H
Street south until it leaves the city. Sixth Street is a designated collector roadway south of E
Street. Sixth Street continues to the south of the city where it connects to various county
roadways accessing SR 99 to the east. Sixth Street is the only city street to extend in a southerly
direction across Hamilton Slough. On-street parallel parking is provided from E Street to
Bannock Street. Sixth Street south of B Street is a designated truck route.
Fourth Street is a two-lane north–south collector street extending northward from its current
terminus south of Bannock Street to a point where it exits the city to the north and continues to
Ditzler Road. Fourth Street is a designated collector roadway between B Street and its northern
exit point from the city at Lateral K.
Second Street/Trent Street is a two-lane collector street having a north–south orientation until
its transition to Trent Street north of Hamilton Slough where it becomes an east–west-oriented
street connecting to Sixth Street. Second Street extends from the North Biggs Estates
development project in the northern to its transition to Trent Street south of Mary L Court.
Second Street become Trent Street and continues its connection to Sixth Street.
The existing roadway system within and surrounding the city is presented on Figure CIRC-1. The
city’s existing designated truck routes are shown on Figure CIRC-2.
IV. TRANSPORTATION PLANNING CONTEXT
Local transportation planning is a complex and coordinated effort involving multiple agencies.
This section of the element identifies several documents and transportation planning agencies
that are important to understanding the context of the Circulation Element.
Highway Capacity Manual
Published by the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, the Highway
Capacity Manual contains concepts, guidelines, and methodologies for computing the capacity
and quality of service of various facilities including freeways, local roadways, and intersections,
as well as the effects of transit, pedestrians, and bicycles on the performance of these facilities.
              City of Biggs General Plan                CIRC-8                         April 2014

                       CIRCULATION ELEMENT
State Transportation Planning
Caltrans establishes minimum design standards for several types of transportation facilities,
including roadways, trails, and bicycle paths. Local governments are generally required to meet
or exceed relevant Caltrans standards with locally adopted plans when they occur within the
city. Caltrans also prepares Transportation Concept Reports as a first step in the planning
process to determine how a highway will deliver the targeted level of service and quality of
operations over a 20-year period.
Regional Transportation Planning
The Butte County Association of Governments (BCAG) is the agency that manages local and
regional public transit as well as prepares and implements regional transportation plans in Butte
County. The BCAG 2035 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) is the long-range regional planning
document that identifies and programs roadway improvements throughout Butte County. The
RTP does not focus on local transportation needs. BCAG is also responsible for implementing
Senate Bill 375, which requires development of a Sustainable Communities Strategy that links
the RTP with state greenhouse gas reduction goals. The Butte County General Plan also includes
transportation plans and policies for roadways, transit, bike, and pedestrian improvements in
areas surrounding Biggs.
Local Transportation Planning
This element is supported through various implementing documents, including local street
design and improvement standards in the Municipal Code. The city is committed to working
collaboratively with federal, state, and regional agencies and jurisdictions to implement all
transportation laws and regulations and to provide an efficient circulation system for all modes
of transportation.
V. ROADWAY CLASSIFICATION
This section of the Circulation Element describes how Biggs’ circulation system will classify and
accommodate all modes of travel within and outside of the community.
The Circulation Diagram, Figure CIRC-3, depicts roadways that support the Land Use Diagram.
Where appropriate, new connections will be located and designed as multimodal links between
neighborhoods, businesses, schools, and employment areas. The figure is not intended to show
exact alignments of future roadways, but rather to show general connections that would be
refined through future study and environmental review. Goals and policies address system
connectivity and complete streets, as well as flexibility in street design.
Table CIRC-1 describes the different classes of roadways in the city.

                                         Arterials. The primary function of an arterial
                                         street is to move larger volumes of traffic through
                                         the city and between destination points. Arterials
                                         are generally larger streets providing for up to
                                         four travel lanes, but may have fewer lanes. On-
                                         street parking may be provided but can be
                                         limited where traffic conflicts may exist. Driveway
                                         access should be minimized where possible,
                                         consistent with the primary function of arterials
                                         to move traffic. Bike lanes, medians, park strips,
                                         sidewalks, and transit facilities may also be
                                         accommodated within the right-of-way. Arterial
                                         streets are often designated truck routes.
                                         Collectors. Collector streets generally provide a
                                         link between local streets and arterials.
                                         Collectors provide two travel lanes. On-street
                                         parking is generally permitted. Driveway access
                                         is allowed, but may be minimized where
                                         necessary. Bike lanes, park strips, sidewalks,
                                         and transit facilities may also be accommodated
                                         within the right-of-way.
                                         Local Streets. The primary function of local
                                         streets is to provide direct access to adjacent
                                         properties. Local streets normally provide two
                                         travel lanes, landscaped park strips, sidewalks,
                                         and on-street parking. Bike lanes are not
                                         included because local streets have narrow street
                                         widths, carry low traffic volumes, and are
                                         considered to be bicycle-friendly.

In June of 2011, the City of Biggs adopted the revised Biggs Area Bicycle Transportation Plan
(BTP) that identifies existing and proposed bicycle facilities citywide. The purpose of the BTP is
to improve and encourage bicycle and pedestrian transportation in the city and to allow the city
to pursue funding opportunities through Caltrans. The BTP identifies the current and future
needs of bicyclists and establishes goals and policies for planning and implementing bicycle
facilities within the city. The BTP anticipates the development of three types of bicycle facilities
in the city, which are defined as follows:
•    Class I Bicycle Paths provide a completely separated facility designed for the exclusive use
     of bicycles and pedestrians with minimal interruption by motorists. Class I bikeways typically
     have a minimum of 8 feet of pavement with 2-foot graded shoulders on either side. These
     bikeways must also be at least 5 feet from the edge of a paved roadway.
•    Class II Bicycle Lanes provide a restricted right-of-way designated for the exclusive or semi-
     exclusive use of bicycles with through travel by motor vehicles or pedestrians prohibited,
     but with vehicle parking and cross flows by pedestrians and motorists permitted. Class II
     bicycle lanes are typically a 5-foot striped and signed lane.
•    Class III Bicycle Routes provide designated areas where bicycles share the road with other
     modes of travel (such as vehicles). Class III routes are typically signed as such.
For pedestrians, sidewalks exist on a majority of streets within the city. Pedestrian facilities
comprise paths, sidewalks, and pedestrian crossings.
Transit
Public transportation services in Biggs are provided by the regional B-Line system, managed and
operated by the Butte County Association of Governments (BCAG). The B-Line provides a range
of services from commuter routes throughout the county to local service routes in and around
                                                larger communities, such as Chico. Park-and-ride
                                                locations promote and support the B-Line system.
                                                Biggs is also serviced by the Butte College student

Goods Movement
The railroad system and state highway system combine to provide the major transportation
network for the movement of goods in California and the region. Each system is discussed below
as it relates to operation and service of transporting freight to or within Biggs.
Rail Freight Transportation
Biggs is served by the Union Pacific Railroad that
parallels Eighth Street. Commonly transported
commodities include chemicals, food and food
products, truck trailers and containers, forest
products, grain and grain products, metals and
minerals, and automobiles and commodities. On
an average day, approximately 24 trains pass
through Biggs on the Union Pacific tracks. The
SunWest Mill has the city’s only off-track rail
siding.
Highway Freight Transportation
All interstates and some roadway segments of the state highway system are included in the
National Network for Service Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA). State Route 99 and
B Street are designated as terminal access routes by the STAA while E Street is a locally
designated truck route.
VI. LEVEL OF SERVICE
Level of service (LOS) is a general measure of traffic operating conditions whereby a letter
grade, from A (no congestion) to F (high levels of congestion), is assigned. LOS E generally
represents “at capacity” operations. These grades represent the perspective of drivers and are
an indication of the comfort and convenience associated with driving as well as speed, travel
time, traffic interruptions, and freedom to maneuver. The LOS grades are generally defined as
follows:
     •    LOS A represents free-flow travel for vehicles. Individual users are virtually unaffected
          by others in the traffic stream.
     •    LOS B represents stable flow, but the presence of other users in the traffic stream
          begins to be noticeable.
        April 2014                          CIRC-13                     City of Biggs General Plan

                                         CIRCULATION ELEMENT
     •    LOS C continues to represent stable flow, but it is the beginning of the range of flow in
          which the operation of individual users becomes significantly affected by interactions
          with others in the traffic stream.
     •    LOS D represents high-density, stable flow, but approaching unstable conditions.
     •    LOS E represents unstable operating conditions at or near the capacity level where
          maneuverability is severely limited.
     •    LOS F is used to define forced or a breakdown traffic flow where unsignalized and
          signalized intersections exceed 50 and 80 seconds of delay, respectively.
The existing LOS was calculated for 22 of the city’s roadway segments and three segments of
State Route 99. Existing roadway traffic volumes were compared to daily LOS capacity
thresholds from the existing General Plan. The daily thresholds for city streets shown in Table
CIRC-2 refer to the “environmental capacity” of the roadway that takes into account the vehicle
friction of the roadways caused by on-street parking maneuvers, heavy vehicle traffic, and the
residential nature of the city streets. The daily thresholds for SR 99 are based on the Highway
Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board 2000) used by BCAG in the Regional
Transportation Plan.
The General Plan identifies LOS C as the minimum acceptable level of service. The State Route
99 Transportation Corridor Concept Report (Caltrans 2010) identifies that the concept LOS for
SR 99 in proximity to Biggs is LOS E.

 CONSERVATION, OPEN SPACE &
           RECREATION ELEMENT
March 2014                  City of Biggs General Plan

 CONSERVATION, OPEN SPACE & RECREATION ELEMENT
The City of Biggs actively protects the natural environment through
preservation and enhancement of open space, natural resources, and
agriculture. The city preserves the natural landscape by conserving
agricultural land and by providing accessible natural recreation areas for
all residents. The community enjoys fresh water, clean air, and numerous
recreation options.
          I. INTRODUCTION
          The areas in and around the Biggs and the Biggs Planning Area contain an abundance of open
          and undeveloped spaces. These open space areas provide habitat and movement corridors for
          wildlife, as well as options for recreation and education, and help to create the visual aesthetic
          of the city and enhance the overall quality of life
          for residents. The Conservation, Open Space &
          Recreation Element is included in this General
          Plan to address issues related to open space,
          including city parks, recreation, and a broad
          range of natural resource issues.
          In addition to discussing open space, parks, and
          recreation resources, this element will also
          discuss an important issue to the City of Biggs
          area: agriculture. Amounting to approximately
          4,000 acres, agricultural lands comprise the vast
          majority of land use within the Planning Area and
          are the most significant component of the city’s economy.
          Because agriculture is such an important component of the city’s economy and geographic area,
          conversion of agricultural lands for nonagricultural purposes must be considered carefully and
          allowed only as a result of logical and orderly planning. It is also important that any farmland
          conversion results in an efficient use of land so as to minimize the need for further conversion.
          Overview
          A conservation element and an open space element are required elements of a general plan
          pursuant to the requirements of Government Code Section 65302(d). This element combines
          the required General Plan Conservation and Open Space elements as described in Sections
          65302(d) and (e) of the Government Code and adds information and policies covering recreation
          resources in the city. The element provides context and sets goals and policies for the use and
          acquisition of open space and the protection of biological resources, air quality, water
          resources, and agriculture. The element is organized into sections addressing the following five
          topics:

II. ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
Open Space and Parks
Open space not only functions to preserve habitat and natural resources but also allows visual
and physical access to those resources and their associated recreational opportunities. Human
beings are drawn to open space as a respite from the built urban landscape. Both developed
parklands and undeveloped natural features establish areas around which neighborhoods and
cities are often centered or oriented. Open space also may define the edges of a community’s
urban development and the beginning of areas of agricultural production, resource
management, or resource production.
The City of Biggs is in a unique position with respect to its parks, recreation, and open space
planning. Citizens benefit from resources provided and developed (or “improved”) by the city as
well as from a range of additional regional resources including the Oroville Afterbay, the Oroville
Wildlife Area, the Feather River, and local wildlife refuges, all located within 10 miles of the city.
While there are a number of challenges with regard to the city’s provision and operation of
recreation facilities and services, a significant range of opportunities stems from the city’s small
size and existing recreational assets. These existing facilities, which are detailed below, provide
the appropriate amount of recreational lands to meet the needs for parks, recreation, and open
space of Biggs’ current and future residents.
Existing Facilities
Because of the compact nature of Biggs, all
residences in the city are within walking distance
(approximately one-half mile) of an existing park.
The city currently provides three parks and has
one piece of property on which recreation
options may exist (see Table CR-1). Additional
park and recreation facilities in the Biggs area are
provided by the Biggs Unified School District.
Figure CR-1 depicts the approximately 10 acres
of parks and facilities available to Biggs citizens.

                                                 maintained portion of the site is approximately 3
                                                 acres in size and includes bathroom facilities,
pedestrian areas, a play structure area, picnic amenities, and a lighted parking area.
Cork Oak Park: This small park is located on the high school campus, adjacent to the community
swimming pool (Schor’s Pool), and is owned and maintained by the Biggs Unified School District.
Approximately 1 acre in size, this park provides picnic tables, horseshoe pits, and turf amid a
former cork oak orchard.
Schor’s Swimming Pool (CSA 31): County Service
Area (CSA) 31 encompasses approximately 85
square miles in western Butte County. CSAs are
often established by counties to provide
authority and funding for recreational,
infrastructure, and other improvements and
services in unincorporated areas. CSA 31, which
was formed in 1967 to provide swimming pool
facilities to the area, operates and maintains
Schor’s Pool. The pool is located near Biggs
Elementary School and Biggs High School on the
eastern side of the community.

Parkland Standards and Needs
The City of Biggs has established a minimum park and recreation land standard of 5 acres of city-
owned or joint-use park facilities per each 1,000 city residents as the minimum standard for
parks and recreation land and park and recreation land dedication requirements. As detailed in
Table CR-2, the 2013 population of the city was 1,692, which corresponds to 8.5 total acres of
city-operated parkland. The City of Biggs is approximately 3.5 acres short of meeting the city’s
parkland standard when considering only city-owned parks and recreation facilities. However,
when joint-use facilities are included, the city exceeds the park and recreation standard by 2.0
acres. The city estimates that by 2030, the city’s estimated population of 3,830 will result in the
need for an additional 8.65 acres of parkland to maintain the parkland standard of 5 acres per
each 1,000 city residents.

Funding and Financing of Parks
The city’s challenge regarding park and recreation amenities is associated with the allocation of
limited monetary resources. However, the city has at its disposal various methods not directly
associated with the city’s General Fund for financing recreation facilities. These include grants,
private donations, assessment of fees as a condition of development approval, and
establishment of citywide assessment districts. Donations of labor and money from individuals
and local service clubs can be used to construct and maintain recreation facilities. Local groups
such as Little League, Lions Club, and Parent Teacher Association have traditionally supported
recreation facility projects, especially the projects that benefit young people. Grants from the
state and federal governments may also be available to finance construction of new recreation
facilities or modernize existing resources. Such grants are often used to supplement local funds
in order to produce larger or higher-quality projects.
The city currently charges impact fees from development for park and recreation purposes. As
new development occurs on vacant and undeveloped parcels in and around Biggs, opportunities
will arise to incorporate new parks within and adjacent to these areas and to add acreage to the
city’s park and recreation system totals.

     Future Recreational Facilities and
     Sites
     The city’s recreational needs will evolve as Biggs
     moves forward. As needs change, the city will
     reevaluate its facilities and locations in order to
     effectively provide recreational opportunities to
     the expanding population. Possible facilities and
     services that the city may consider within the
     General Plan’s horizon include the following:
     •   Trent Street Lot improvements
     •   Hamilton Slough greenway improvements
     •   Cooperation with the Biggs Unified School District to upgrade tennis courts and the
         community swimming pool
     •   Restrooms at Family Park
     •   Community youth/senior center
     In addition, the city may examine the possibility of partnering with Butte County and the City of
     Gridley to provide additional recreational services to citizens. These partnerships could provide
     opportunities for organized youth activities.
     Agricultural Resources
     Agriculture has shaped the landscape and culture of Biggs more than any other land use or
     industry. Totaling approximately 4,000 acres, agricultural uses are the largest use of land within
     the Planning Area and continue to be a major component of the local and regional economy.
                                                      Agriculture and agricultural resources within and
                                                      around the city extend beyond the growing of
                                                      crops and are inclusive of commercial and
                                                      industrial operations supporting the use, as well
                                                      as the processing, manufacturing, and shipping of
                                                      agricultural goods.
                                                      While few agricultural growing operations are
                                                      located within the city limits, numerous
                                                      operations exist nearby and adjacent to the city
                                                      limits and within the Planning Area. Biggs is in an
                                                      agricultural transition area, with field and row
     crops located to the west of the city and grazing land and tree crops located to the east. The
     primary agriculture-related industries and land uses in and around the city are rice, nuts, citrus,
     and prunes. Several locations offer farm-fresh produce direct from the grower to the consumer.

            CONSERVATION, OPEN SPACE & RECREATION ELEMENT
Most of the land surrounding Biggs is considered prime agricultural land by the State of
California, because it has the best combination of physical and soil characteristics for crop
production. In addition to providing direct food production and employment, agricultural land
also provides valuable undeveloped spaces and important and valuable wildlife habitat. For
more information on agricultural land and products in the Biggs area, please see the Existing
Conditions Report, Chapter 6.0 Natural, Agricultural & Cultural Resources.
Urban-Agricultural Interface
Protection of viable and active agricultural land is essential to Biggs and is an important
consideration in this General Plan. Protection of viable and active agricultural land ensures
continued crop production and protects the economic base for the city and the surrounding
unincorporated area. Additionally, this Plan establishes standards to protect city residents from
potential negative agricultural byproducts, including spray-drift from chemicals, dust, and noise.
This General Plan seeks to minimize potential conflicts between agricultural and urban uses by
directing new urban development to vacant land within Biggs prior to expanding the city to
accommodate new growth. However, vacant land is limited within the existing city limits, and
the available vacant parcels are small in size and often not available for utilization. Because
Biggs is surrounded on all sides by agricultural lands, some conversion of agricultural land to
urban use is envisioned by this Plan and is inevitable given Biggs’ need to accommodate the
projected population growth of the city. As outlined in greater detail in the Land Use Element,
this General Plan strives to utilize smart growth policies to efficiently use Biggs’ land resources
and to minimize the need for unnecessary or premature land conversion.
Implementation of the Land Use Diagram of this General Plan will require a well-planned urban-
agricultural interface, as Biggs is surrounded by large- and small-scale agricultural activities on
all sides. As noted above, this element and the Land Use Element provide policies to address
agricultural land conversion, growth planning, and the agricultural-urban interface. These
policies include prioritizing infill development within the existing city limits, promoting
compatible compact development in new growth areas, establishing buffers areas and “edge”
treatments, and promoting the continuation of agricultural activities in the Planning Area and
areas surrounding the city. Policy CR-2.2 of this element, and the actions that follow it, establish
the City of Biggs’ primary policies regarding buffering and the agricultural-urban interface.
This Plan and the policies of this element recognize that a one-size-fits-all approach to the
buffering of agricultural operations does not work for the City of Biggs and the agricultural
operations that surround it. Rather, the most appropriate approach to buffering will depend on
the site-specific nature of a project and the type of agricultural operation that is adjacent to it. A
result of a customized approach to the buffering of the agricultural-urban interface area is the
recognition that this Plan and this element establish minimum policy standards and present the
overall concepts that the city will use when evaluating future projects.
There are certain aspects of this discussion, however, that this General Plan seeks to advance
regardless of the specific attributes or location of future projects. A key aspect is the
             City of Biggs General Plan                CR-8                             April 2014

     establishment of an urban growth boundary line west of Lateral K and the Riceton Road
     alignment and extending from Farris Road on the south to north of Afton Road on the north.
     Additionally, this urban growth boundary would follow the alignment of West Biggs-Gridley
     Road south of Farris Road to the southern extent of the city’s Planning Area boundary and
     continue east of the Union Pacific Railroad line to the north. As shown on the Land Use Diagram
     (Figure LU-2) of this Plan, the city would remove from consideration any growth west of this line
     and all growth potential not agriculturally related or compatible with agricultural operations or
     directly related to public service to a point east of Lateral K. This Plan advances the location of
     the urban growth boundary line in the location shown on the Land Use Map, as Lateral K and
     West Biggs-Gridley Road represent identifiable physical landscape features as well as the point
     at which large-scale irrigated cropland continues uninterrupted moving west on the valley floor.
     This Plan also supports the policy concepts that the presence of an adequate physical separation
     between developed land and agricultural land is as important as the ownership of the buffer
     area and acknowledges that buffer areas may not be needed as land continues to develop at the
     urban edge. This Plan advances those ideas in the actions described under Policy CR-2.2.
     Biological Resources
     The City of Biggs, its Planning Area, and the areas surrounding it include a rich and diverse range
     of biological resources. Due to its location in the Sacramento Valley, Biggs is located in an area
     with high levels of waterfowl activity. However, the developed areas both inside and just
     outside of the city limits are generally less likely to contain significant wildlife resources or
     habitat.
     There is limited evidence of protected species occurring within the developed areas of Biggs.
     However, since detailed biological evaluations have generally not been conducted in the vicinity
     of Biggs, the lack of identified occurrences is not proof of the absence of protected species.
     While the city’s environment is not known to contain threatened or endangered species, various
     species, including the giant garter snake, the western pond turtle, and the Swainson’s hawk, are
     known to utilize habitats similar to those located within the Biggs Planning Area. Therefore,
     future development sites may require review by a city-approved qualified individual to
     determine if species or habitats are present. If potential habitats or species are found, biological
     surveys may be required to determine the extent, viability, and approach to avoid or potentially
     mitigate a loss.

Butte Regional Habitat Conservation Plan and Natural Community
Conservation Plan
The Butte County Association of Governments (BCAG) is the lead agency in the preparation of
the Butte Regional Habitat Conservation Plan and Natural Community Conservation Plan
(HCP/NCCP). BCAG is preparing the plan on behalf of its member agencies and will serve as the
lead agency for the management and implementation of the plan upon adoption. The
HCP/NCCP is a voluntary plan that will provide comprehensive species, wetland, and ecosystem
conservation and contribute to the maintenance of biological diversity in Butte County. The
intent of the plan is to streamline the environmental mitigation and permitting process for
individual covered projects while taking a regional approach to ecosystem and species
preservation.
The HCP/NCCP will provide a more streamlined process for environmental permitting that will
be inclusive of various state and federal permitting requirements currently acquired individually.
Additionally, the plan will provide broad, planning-level mapping of covered species habitat
areas and will establish a program to address the handling of each covered species in the plan.
The Butte Regional HCP/NCCP document has been prepared with a regional vision and
establishes a regional approach to addressing species, habitat, and ecosystem conservation. The
plan establishes mitigation strategies for each covered species and establishes a plan
implementation strategy and funding approach for the HCP/NCCP’s conservation programs.

                                                city and Planning Area are urban storm water
                                                runoff, groundwater use and quality, and
                                                pollutants from industrial, agricultural, and urban
                                                land uses. This element establishes a policy to
                                                reduce the water quality effects of urban runoff
                                                through treatment of storm water runoff and
                                                protection of watercourses. This element
addresses the need to protect surface water and groundwater quality and quantity by
supporting the use of National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System standards and water
system efficiency and effectiveness.

     Groundwater Resources
     Groundwater represents 100 percent of Biggs’ potable water supply; therefore, maintenance of
     groundwater quality is crucial. Potential sources of groundwater pollutants include chemicals
     used in the growing and processing of agricultural products, industrial sources, and improper
     installation of individual septic tank systems in areas containing porous soils and/or high
     groundwater tables.
     The quality of groundwater in the Biggs Planning Area is generally good. The quality of
     groundwater is often affected by activities that occur outside of the city limits and therefore are
     beyond the city’s ability to fully control. The city’s primary method for protecting groundwater
     quality is the proper maintenance of active wells and the proper abandonment of historic wells.
     Appropriate well procedures can protect groundwater by ensuring that contaminants do not
     travel along well shafts to aquifers.
     The city can also protect water quality through
     the land use review and approval process. While
     it is anticipated that new land uses will be served
     by the city’s wastewater treatment plant, it may
     be advantageous to allow some uses to proceed
     with alternative treatment methods, such as
     pretreatment or package treatment plants. In
     such cases, it is important for the city to carefully
     examine the potential for groundwater quality
     issues that could result. Such scrutiny would also
     be utilized when examining future projects
     adjacent to Biggs on county lands through the
     city’s role as an involved agency in the
     environmental review process.
     The city is also an active participant on regional
     water quality councils and actively participates in
     regional water quality testing programs and
     policy discussions.
     Surface Water
     Surface water quality is regulated by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board,
     Region 5 (CVRWQCB). This agency establishes water quality standards for surface water
     discharge in its Water Quality Control Plan (Basin Plan). Because Biggs relies exclusively on
     groundwater as its domestic water source, a primary concern is the treatment of surface water
     runoff and the quality of surface water potentially entering the groundwater system.
     The City of Biggs owns and operates a publicly owned wastewater treatment plant, located at
     2951 West Biggs-Gridley Road. The facility treats wastewater and releases the treated water

into Reclamation District 833 channels. This discharge method requires that the city operate
under a CVRWQCB discharge permit. The standards for the treated wastewater are quite
rigorous to prevent pollutants from entering surface water. For more information concerning
the wastewater treatment plant, see the Public Facilities & Services Element.
Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases
Protecting air quality is a complex task that must consider local land uses and activities which
generate air pollution, as well as pollutants originating outside the region that are transported
by weather and wind patterns.
The Biggs Planning Area is located in the Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin (NSVAB), and air
quality is locally regulated by the Butte County Air Quality Management District (BCAQMD). The
BCAQMD is responsible for developing and implementing the planning, regulation,
enforcement, technical innovation, and education of air quality issues
The NSVAB has been categorized as “moderately nonattainment” for ozone and particulate
matter (PM), which means that the region is not meeting state or federal standards for these air
pollutants. Butte County is currently in a nonattainment status with respect to the state ozone,
PM 10 , and PM 2.5 standards, as well as the federal 8-hour ozone standard.
Biggs’ geographic location in the north central valley affords its residents the opportunity to
breathe clean and healthy air not available in more urbanized areas of California. However, the
city’s proximity to vast expanses of agricultural lands where soil turning, land cultivation, and
seasonal burning activities, along with the city’s agricultural-supporting industrial operations,
can heighten and make more difficult the attainment of regional air quality standards. The city’s
specific geographic and physiographic attributes are recognized by this Plan and the potential
impacts of surrounding land uses are acknowledged as part of the city’s land use planning
program.
Greenhouse gases (GHGs) and their potential impact on the earth’s temperature are currently a
significant area of focus for policymakers, elected officials, and city employees. Increasing
concentrations of GHGs and increased GHG emissions levels are generally thought to be
responsible for increases in overall global temperatures and thus a major contributing factor of
global climate change. Greenhouse gases currently believed to be major contributors to the
atmospheric greenhouse effect are carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ).
The regulatory framework to address both global climate change and its implications and the
emissions of greenhouse gases is a relatively new and evolving one. However, various significant
pieces of legislation have been passed in California to address these issues. The major pieces of
legislation in this area to date include:
     •   Assembly Bill (AB) 1493, codified at Health and Safety Code Sections 42823 and 43018.5
             City of Biggs General Plan                 CR-12                        April 2014

CONSERVATION, OPEN SPACE & RECREATION ELEMENT

              38574, 38580, 38590, 38592–38599
          •   Senate Bill (SB) 375, codified at Government Code Sections 65080, 65400, 65583,
              65584.01, 65584.02, 65584.04, 65587, 65588, 14522.1, 14522.2, and 65080.01 as well
              as Public Resources Code Sections 21061.3, 21159.28, and Chapter 4.2
          •   Senate Bill 1078, Public Utilities Code Sections 387, 390.1, 399.25 and Article 16
     Due in part to its limited size, the small number of nonresidential land uses in the city, and the
     nature of the city’s existing nonresidential uses, Biggs does not currently have any significant
     issues related to the emission of GHGs. In California, the transportation sector contributes the
     largest share of GHG emissions, followed by miscellaneous processes including fuel combustion,
     farming operations, and construction (CARB 2010). Figure CR-2 presents data compiled by the
     California Air Resources Board (CARB) showing primary sources of air pollutants within
     California.
     As Biggs grows and expands, the city will continue to be aware of and informed about the
     potential impacts associated with the emissions of greenhouse gases and will continue to take
     appropriate steps to address this issue as required.
     Addressing public and environmental health issues related to air quality requires not only
     conservation policies, but coordination between land use, circulation, health and safety, and
     community design policies. Because transportation is the largest source of GHGs in California,
     land use and transportation planning to reduce the need for driving is a fundamental focus for
     jurisdictions that have air quality goals. Regularly used approaches for reducing vehicle travel
     include placing residences within walking distance of daily destinations, developing street
     networks that encourage cycling and walking, and providing and increasing the viability of
     transit.

     State Legislation
     Assembly Bill 32 (the California Global Warming Solution Act) and Senate Bill 375 (Redesigning
     Communities to Reduce Greenhouse Gases) are aimed at addressing the threat that climate
     change poses to California’s economic, social, and environmental well-being.
     AB 32 seeks to reduce California’s GHG emissions to 1990 levels. SB 375 works to achieve AB 32
     by working to reduce GHGs associated with vehicle miles traveled. To comply with AB 32 and
     SB 375, Biggs, along with other local jurisdictions, must coordinate land use and transportation
     planning according to the state’s GHG reduction objectives.

           INTRODUCTION
               NOISE
March 2014              City of Biggs General Plan

                                         NOISE ELEMENT
Biggs is free of excessive and unnecessary noise disturbances. Residents
and visitors are able to enjoy indoor and outdoor spaces without the
intrusion of unhealthy levels of noise, and noise-generating uses are able
to operate without unnecessary encroachment from noise-sensitive uses.
Noise mitigation efforts focus on site and building design and discourage
walls and barriers.
          I.    INTRODUCTION
          The Noise Element is a legally required element of the General Plan. The purpose of the element
          is to identify the major noise sources and noise-related concerns in Biggs, establish noise
          standards, and outline the city’s goals, policies, and actions addressing noise.
          Noise is typically defined as unwanted sound that interferes with an individual’s ability to
          perform a task or enjoy an activity. From a planning perspective, noise control focuses on two
          primary concerns: (1) preventing the introduction of new noise-producing uses in noise-sensitive
          areas; and (2) preventing the encroachment of noise-sensitive uses into existing noise-producing
          areas. Some facilities, such as airports and certain industrial operations, inherently generate
          noise, and the encroachment of noise-sensitive uses can jeopardize their continued operation.
          Therefore, some noise-generating uses need to be protected from the development of
          incompatible uses in their vicinity. Working to balance the compatibility of uses and reduce the
          impact of significant sources of noise will improve the quality of life for Biggs residents.
          Overview
          Noise level compatibility varies with numerous factors, including:
              •    Background noise levels
              •    Intensity of noise source
              •    Character of noise source
              •    Frequency of noise
              •    Timing of noise (day versus night)
              •    Sensitivity of adjacent land uses
          The information presented in this element is based on various sources, including field
          measurements of community noise levels, observations of existing traffic levels, railroad activity
          data provided by the Union Pacific Railroad, existing city land uses and projections for future
          land uses, and transportation (road and rail) activities.
                 April 2014                            N-1                        City of Biggs General Plan

                                         NOISE ELEMENT
The findings of the Noise Element have aided in the development of the General Plan Land Use
Diagram. Where possible, land uses have been arranged to avoid exposure of sensitive land uses
to excessive noise levels.
II. ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
This section of the element identifies primary noise issues raised during the outreach efforts for
the General Plan and explains how they are addressed. Policy guidance can be found in the
Goals, Policies, and Actions section of this element. An explanation of specialized terms used in
this element can be found in the Glossary (Appendix A).
Land Use Compatibility
One factor in determining and managing the compatibility of different land uses is the need to
separate noise-sensitive uses from uses that generate significant amounts of noise. A primary
purpose of this element is to establish standards that can be used to equitably manage the noise
compatibility of land uses. For example, standards may prevent noise-generating uses such as
industrial operations or major roadways from developing near residences or outdoor recreation
areas. Conversely, new noise-sensitive uses may be prevented from locating near existing noise-
generating uses to avoid an incompatible situation. Since the General Plan promotes a compact
urban form and the integration of different land uses, there is a need for the Noise Element to
establish standards that support a mix of uses in close proximity to one another.
Transportation-Related Noise
The inclusion of noise mitigation measures to
protect residents from unhealthy levels of
transportation-related noise exposure should
be incorporated into projects. This issue
primarily concerns development near the
Union Pacific Railroad and State Route 99 and
along the city’s larger arterial roadways.
Noise standards along these corridors must
be met and maintained over time without
unnecessary or undesirable construction of
visually obtrusive and community-dividing
sound walls. This element establishes noise
standards to attenuate noise to levels that
minimize disruption to noise-sensitive uses, and it includes policies and actions that address
noise compatibility issues.

                               NOISE ELEMENT
Railroad Noise
By far, the greatest noise generator in Biggs is the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) railway. The
lines pass through the western edge of the downtown area, separating the western portion of
the city. Originally serving primarily agricultural interests, the tracks are now part of the major
rail corridor that connects the Pacific Northwest with Southern California. Approximately 24
trains pass through Biggs daily, and rail activity is expected to increase in the future. This
element addresses train-generated noise by establishing standards for noise attenuation and by
providing policy guidance for the use of land adjacent to the railroad tracks.
III. NOISE CHARACTERISTICS AND MEASUREMENTS
This section explains noise characteristics and measurements used for the noise standards in the
Goals, Policies, and Actions of this element.
Noise Characteristics
Noise in a community is generated by a number of sources including transportation-related
sources, such as automobiles, trucks, trains, and airplanes, and stationary sources, such as
construction sites, machinery, and industrial operations. The human response to environmental
noise is subjective and varies considerably from one individual to another. Noise in a community
has often been cited as a health concern, not necessarily in terms of actual physiological
damage, such as hearing impairment, but in terms of its impact on general well-being and
contribution to excessive stress, annoyance, and sleep disturbance.
Noise-sensitive land uses are those for which noise exposure could cause health-related risks to
individuals or where quiet is essential to the use. Land uses identified in Biggs as being noise-
sensitive include most types of residences, schools, parks, and places of assembly, such as
churches and meeting halls.
Outdoor activity areas are the portions of parcels where outdoor activities generally occur, such
as residential patios and yards or outdoor instructional areas. These exterior activity areas are
exposed to noise with fewer structural elements such as walls and windows for noise
attenuation.
The characterization and quantification of noise levels and their effects on people typically
include the use of technical terminology. While an in-depth explanation of noise terminology is
not included in this element, a summary of industry standards and terms used in this chapter is
provided below.

                                              NOISE ELEMENT
Noise Measurement
To approximate the sensitivity of the human ear to changes in frequency, sound is usually
measured in what is referred to as A-weighted decibels (dBA). On this scale, the normal range of
human hearing extends from about 10 dBA to about 140 dBA.
The intensity of noise fluctuates over time, and several measurements of time-averaged noise
levels are used to describe noise characteristics for different circumstances. The following
acoustical measurements are commonly used:
    •   dB – Decibel. A measure, on a logarithmic scale, of the amplitude of sound. On the
        decibel scale, the smallest audible sound (near total silence) is 0 db. A sound 10 times
        more powerful is 10 dB. A sound 100 times more powerful is 20 dB. The A-weighted
        decibel, commonly abbreviated as dBA, relates the measurement of sound to the
        sensitivity of the human ear.
    •   L eq – Energy Equivalent Noise Level. A single measure, in dBA, of average acoustic
        energy level used to represent fluctuating sound levels over a specific period of time.
    •   L min – Minimum Noise Level. Represents the minimum instantaneous noise level during
        a specific period of time.
    •   L max – Maximum               Noise    Level.
        Represents               the        maximum
        instantaneous noise level during a
        specific period of time.
    •   SEL – Single Event Level. Measures
        the total acoustic energy of a single
        noise event, such as an aircraft
        overflight, compressed into a period
        of 1 second. Because the SEL is
        normalized to a 1-second period, it
        will almost always be larger in
        magnitude than the L max for the
        event.
    •   DNL or L dn – Day-Night Average
        Noise Level. A 24-hour L eq with a 10
        dBA “penalty” for noise events that
        occur during the noise-sensitive
        hours between 10:00 PM and 7:00
        AM.
    •   CNEL – Community Noise Equivalent
        Level. The CNEL is similar to the L dn
        described above, but with an
             City of Biggs General Plan               N-4                             April 2014

                               NOISE ELEMENT
         additional 5 dBA penalty for noise events that occur between the hours of 7:00 PM and
         10:00 PM. The calculated CNEL is typically approximately 0.5 dBA higher than the
         calculated L dn .
     •   Hourly L 2 – The dBA level which is exceeded during 2 percent, or approximately 1
         minute, of a given hour. The noise level descriptor L 50 may also be used, which is the
         noise level exceeded during 50 percent (or 30 minutes) of a 1-hour period.
     •   L n – The dBA level exceeded for n percent of a given time period. For instance, L2 is the
         level exceeded for 2 percent of the time, and L50 is the level exceeded 50 percent of the
         time. The commonly used values of n are 2, 10, 50, and 90.
     •   Noise-Sensitive Land Uses – Land uses for which noise exposure could cause health-
         related risks to individuals or where quiet is essential to the use. Land uses identified
         in Biggs as being noise-sensitive include residences, nursing homes, day-care centers,
         hospitals, schools, parks, and places of assembly, such as theaters, churches, and
         meeting halls.
Ambient Noise Levels
Several sources of noise are located in the Biggs area. These sources include noise generated
from stationary activities (e.g., commercial and industrial uses), aircraft operations, and traffic
on major roadways and highways. Short-term (10-minute) noise level measurements were
conducted on September 19, 2008, and April 3, 2009, for the purpose of documenting and
measuring the existing noise environment in various areas in and around Biggs. Ambient noise
measurement locations and corresponding measured values (i.e., L eq and L max ) are summarized
in Table N-1. Based on the monitoring conducted, average-hourly daytime noise levels in the
city generally range from the lower end of approximately 50 dB to a higher end of approximately
75 dB, dependent primarily on distance from major noise sources. Major stationary and
transportation noise sources noted in Biggs are discussed separately.
Noise-Sensitive Land Uses
Noise-sensitive land uses are generally considered to include those uses that would result in
noise exposure that could cause health-related risks to individuals. Places where quiet is
essential are also considered noise-sensitive uses. Residential dwellings are of primary concern
because of the potential for increased and prolonged exposure of individuals to both interior
and exterior noise levels. Other land uses such as parks, historic sites, cemeteries, and
recreation areas are also considered sensitive to increases in exterior noise levels. School
classrooms, places of assembly, hotels, libraries, and other places where low interior noise levels
are essential are also considered noise-sensitive land uses.

Noise Sources
Noise issues associated with stationary and transportation sources in the Planning Area are
discussed below.
Transportation Noise Sources
Union Pacific Railroad
The UPRR tracks extend in a north–south direction, parallel to and just east of Eighth Street. The
UPRR is used for both freight transport and Amtrak passenger service. Approximately 22 freight
trains and two Amtrak passenger trains travel along this rail line on a daily basis. The number of
freight trains traveling along this segment can vary from day to day, depending on demand, and
there are currently no hourly limitations pertaining to freight train travel. Amtrak passenger
trains typically run during the early morning hours.
Noise levels generated by trains can vary depending on numerous factors, including train speed,
the number of engines used, track conditions (e.g., welded vs. jointed), the condition of train
wheels, and shielding provided by intervening terrain. Additional factors, such as the sounding

of the train horns as well as the operation of roadside signaling devices, can also contribute to
overall noise levels. Depending on such factors, wayside noise levels associated with train
passbys can reach levels of up to 110 dBA L max at 50 feet from the track centerline (FTA 2006).
Noise measurements of train noise levels were conducted on September 19, 2008, near the B
Street crossing. Based on noise measurements conducted, wayside train noise levels, with
roadside warning devices and train horns sounding, ranged from approximately 94 to 97 dBA
L max at 50 feet from the track centerline.
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment
Guidelines (2006) were used for the calculation of wayside noise levels generated by the trains
traveling along the UPRR corridor. Based on the modeling conducted, the predicted 60 dBA
CNEL noise contour for the UPRR corridor would extend to approximately 463 feet from the
track centerline without the sounding of train warning horns and to approximately 1,356 feet
with the sounding of train horns. It is important to note that predicted noise levels do not
include shielding or reflection of noise from intervening terrain or structures. Although these
predicted noise contours are not considered site-specific, they are useful for determining
potential land use conflicts.
Roadways
Vehicle traffic on area roadways also contributes to the ambient noise environment in the city.
Roadway noise is primarily created during the stopping and starting of vehicles due to
acceleration and deceleration, which typically occurs at intersections. Roadways with high levels
                                                 of heavy-duty truck traffic are of particular
                                                 concern. Major roadways in Biggs include B
                                                 Street, Eighth Street, West Biggs-Gridley Road,
                                                 and West Rio Bonito Road. Existing traffic
                                                 volumes have not yet been provided; therefore,
                                                 associated noise levels for area roadways have
                                                 not been calculated. Currently, traffic levels and
                                                 roadway volumes in Biggs are considered to be
                                                 good, and traffic-related noise is not considered
                                                 substantial. For more information, see the
                                                 Circulation Element of this General Plan.
Stationary Sources
Stationary noise sources include industrial and commercial land uses. Many industrial processes
produce noise, even when the best available noise control technology is applied. Noise
exposures within industrial facilities are controlled by federal and state employee health and
safety regulations (i.e., regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the
US Department of Labor [OSHA] and the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health
[Cal-OSHA]). Exterior noise levels that affect neighboring parcels are typically subject to local
standards. Commercial, recreational, and public facility activities can also produce noise that
may affect adjacent noise-sensitive land uses. These noise sources can be continuous or

intermittent and may contain tonal components that are annoying to individuals who live
nearby. For instance, emergency-use sirens and backup alarms are often considered nuisance
noise sources, but may not occur frequently enough to be considered incompatible with noise-
sensitive land uses. In addition, noise generation from fixed noise sources may vary based on
climate conditions, time of day, and existing ambient noise levels.
From a land use planning perspective, fixed-source noise control issues focus on two goals:
(1) preventing the introduction of new noise-producing uses in noise-sensitive areas; and
(2) preventing encroachment of noise-sensitive uses on existing noise-producing facilities. The
first goal can be achieved by applying noise performance standards to proposed new noise-
producing uses. The second goal can be met by requiring that new noise-sensitive uses near
noise-producing facilities include mitigation measures to ensure compliance with noise
performance standards. Each of these goals stresses the importance of avoiding the location of
new uses that may be incompatible with adjoining uses.
Commercial and Industrial Uses
Noise sources commonly associated with commercial and industrial uses often include the
operation of power tools, material handling equipment (e.g., forklifts), and stationary
equipment (e.g., compressors, compactors), as well as noise associated with the loading and
unloading of materials from delivery trucks. Noise levels from commercial and industrial uses
are dependent on numerous factors and can vary substantially, depending on the specific
activities conducted. For instance, noise associated with neighborhood commercial activities
may be indiscernible from the ambient noise level, whereas noise levels associated with major
industrial activities involving the use of heavy off-road equipment can generate high noise levels
that may result in increased levels of annoyance and activity interference at nearby noise-
sensitive land uses. For this reason, noise generated by commercial and industrial uses and
impacts to nearby noise-sensitive land uses should be evaluated on a project-by-project and
site-specific basis.
Within and near Biggs, the primary fixed noise sources are related to the rice operations of
milling and drying along the western edge of the city. Discussion of the two largest and most
significant noise-producing rice milling/drying operations is presented below.
SunWest Milling Company
The SunWest Milling Company rice mill is located at 507 Bannock Street. SunWest Milling
Company also operates a wild rice mill located at 2875 Eighth Street. Significant noise-producing
equipment at these facilities is predominantly associated with the operation of baghouse filters
and heavy truck traffic, as well as rice milling and drying equipment. The plant operations are
dictated by demand, and it is not unusual for the plants to operate 24 hours a day. The facilities
typically generate approximately 45 truck trips per day, and the truck drivers are advised to
avoid residential streets to the extent practical. The plant is also served by approximately three
railroad operations per week (Williams 2009).
             City of Biggs General Plan                 N-8                           April 2014
                              NOISE ELEMENT
                                                 Noise measurements of the plant in operation
                                                 were conducted on September 19, 2008, and
                                                 April 3, 2009 (refer to Table N-1). Noise
                                                 measurements were conducted along the
                                                 northern and eastern boundaries of the plant.
                                                 Measured average-hourly noise levels along the
                                                 northern boundary of the plant ranged from
                                                 approximately 51 to 54 dB L eq . Existing
                                                 residential land uses located along the northern
                                                 boundary of the plant are largely shielded from
                                                 on-site noise sources by intervening structures.
                                                 Along the eastern boundary of the plant,
operational noise levels measured 64 to 76.4 dBA L eq . The highest measured noise level of 76.4
dBA L eq was associated with the simultaneous operation of three baghouses located near the
eastern boundary of the SunWest Milling Company plant. Assuming an operational noise level of
76 dBA L eq at 60 feet, the predicted 50 dBA L eq noise contour would extend to approximately
699 feet from the plant at locations located within the line of sight of the baghouses. The
SunWest wild rice plant operates two baghouses located at the southwestern boundary of the
plant. Based on the measurements conducted and assuming that both baghouse filters were
operating simultaneously, the calculated 50 dBA L eq noise contour would extend to a distance of
approximately 595 feet at locations located within the line of sight of the baghouses. Because of
the directional aspects of on-site noise sources and shielding provided by on-site structures,
operational noise levels at off-site locations are highly variable. Operational noise levels and
distances to predicted noise contours will vary depending on these and various other factors,
including the specific operational activities being conducted, on-site sources of primary concern
and orientation to off-site receptors, and meteorological conditions.
Red Top Rice
The Red Top Rice facility dries and stores rice. Primary noise sources consist of fans, motors,
related drying equipment, and heavy truck traffic. The facility also operates three baghouse
filters, which also contribute to on-site operational noise levels. There is no railroad activity
associated with the operations of the Red Top facility. Hours of operation vary according to
demand. During the harvest season (September through mid-November), approximately 150
trucks per day bring in rice. During this period, the plant reportedly operates 24 hours a day.
Between November and August, there are reportedly about 4,500 truckloads out of the plant.
The plant manager reports no current plans for expansion (Cribari 2009).

                                          NOISE ELEMENT
Noise measurements of the plant in operation
were conducted on September 19, 2008, and
April 3, 2009 (refer to Table N-1). Noise
measurements were conducted along the
western and eastern boundaries of the plant.
Measured average-hourly noise levels at the
western and eastern plant boundaries measured
approximately 71 dBA L eq . Based on the
measurements conducted, the predicted 50 dBA
L eq noise contour would extend to a maximum
distance of approximately 1,542 feet from the
plant at locations located within the line of sight
of major on-site noise sources. Because of the
directional aspects of on-site noise sources and
shielding provided by on-site structures,
operational noise levels at off-site locations are
highly variable. Operational noise levels and
distances to predicted noise contours will vary
depending on these and various other factors,
including the specific operational activities being
conducted, on-site sources of primary concern
and orientation to off-site receptors, and meteorological conditions.
Construction Activities
Construction noise typically occurs intermittently and varies depending on the nature or phase
(e.g., demolition/land clearing, grading and excavation, erection) of construction. Noise
generated by construction equipment, including earthmovers, material handlers, and portable
generators, can reach high levels. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has found that
the noisiest equipment types operating at construction sites typically range from 88 dBA to 91
dBA L eq at 50 feet. Typical operating cycles may involve 2 minutes of full power, followed by 3 or
4 minutes at lower settings. Although noise ranges were found to be similar for all construction
phases, the building construction phase tended to be less noisy (i.e., 79 dBA to 88 dBA L eq at 50
feet), when compared to the initial site preparation and grading phases (EPA 1971).

   music, or for recurring impulsive noises. Noise-level standards do not apply to mixed-use residential units
   established in conjunction with industrial or commercial uses provided interior noise levels remain below 45
   dB L dn /CNEL.
   2In areas where the existing ambient noise level exceeds the established daytime or nighttime standard, the
   existing level shall become the respective noise standard and an increase of 3 dBA or more shall be
   significant. Noise levels shall be reduced 5 dBA if the existing ambient hourly L eq is at least 10 dBA lower

 An acoustical analysis prepared pursuant to the Noise Element shall:
 A. Be the financial responsibility of the applicant.
 B. Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of environmental noise
    assessment and architectural acoustics.
 C. Include representative noise-level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and
    locations to adequately describe local conditions and the predominant noise sources.
 D. Estimate existing and projected cumulative (20 years) noise levels in terms of L dn, CNEL,
    and the standards of Table N-1 or Table N-2, as applicable, and compare those levels to
    the adopted policies of the Noise Element. Where the noise source consists of intermittent
    single events, address the impact on sleep disturbance.
 E. Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the adopted policies and
    standards of the Noise Element, giving preference to site planning and design over
    mitigation measures that require the construction of noise barriers or structural
    modifications to buildings which contain noise-sensitive land uses.

       improvement projects are likely to expose noise-sensitive land uses to noise
       levels exceeding the standards in Table N-2 or an increase of 10 dB L dn or more
       in ambient noise levels, conduct an acoustical analysis to determine the level
       of impacts and to identify feasible noise mitigation measures that could be
       included in the project design to minimize impacts.

            projects where an acoustical analysis demonstrates that it is not practical to reduce
            traffic noise levels to be consistent with Table N-2, the following criteria will be used
            as a test of significance for the environmental review:
            •     Where existing traffic noise levels are less than 65 dB L dn in the outdoor activity
                  areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +3 dB L dn increase in noise levels due to a
                  roadway improvement project will be considered significant.
            •     Where existing traffic noise levels range between 65 and 70 dB L dn in the outdoor
                  activity areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +4 dB L dn increase in noise levels due to a
                  roadway improvement project will be considered significant.

                 improvement project will be considered significant.
       Policy N-1.5 (Proposed Projects Near Railroads) – Require site-specific noise
       studies for noise-sensitive projects that require a discretionary action and may
       be affected by railroad noise. Incorporate noise attenuation measures into the
       project design to reduce any impacts to the levels specified in Table N-2.
       Policy N-1.6 (Construction Activity) – Utilize standards in the Municipal Code to
       address issues related to the timing and duration of construction activity.
             Action N-1.6.1 (Construction Hours) – Consider the establishment of a construction
             noise ordinance or standards to regulate hours of construction to the hours of 7:00
             AM to 7:00 PM on weekdays and 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM on weekends, with the

             INTRODUCTION
PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT
  March 2014              City of Biggs General Plan

                         PUBLIC HEALTH & SAFETY ELEMENT
Biggs is a safe community, supported by appropriate development
standards and a clear understanding of potential man-made and natural
hazards. Public safety has been enhanced by improvements to local
circulation systems, including the roadways, well-lit bike and pedestrian
trails, and railroad crossings. Children are able to safely walk or bike to
school. Public safety is maintained by efficient and effective emergency
response services, and citizens are knowledgeable and informed about
potential hazards and appropriate responses.
          I. INTRODUCTION
          The Public Health & Safety Element, a legally required element, is included in this General Plan
          to address the services provided by the City of Biggs and the city’s public safety providers
          related to public safety. Such service providers include fire protection, crime prevention, public
          works, and building safety services.
          The city actively plans for its approach to hazards such as flooding, earthquakes, and other
          potentially dangerous situations. It proactively seeks to provide education in disaster
          preparedness and response through public information outreach to enable residents to help
          themselves during a disaster. The Public Health & Safety Element addresses the community’s
          safety concerns and sets forth the goals and policies essential in addressing these concerns.
          Overview
          The Public Health & Safety Element is a mandatory element of the General Plan (Safety Element)
          pursuant to Government Code Section 65302(g). The element identifies and appraises potential
          safety issues in and around the city and establishes goals, policies, and actions addressing the
          subjects discussed. The element is used as a guide to assist in understanding potential safety
          risks and how to minimize the exposure of city residents to natural and man-made hazards. It
          also establishes policies and implementing actions that seek to minimize risks associated with
          seismic, geologic, flood, fire, and environmental hazards. By identifying these hazards and the
          appropriate abatement measures, the Public Health & Safety Element works to reduce the
          potential for events to occur that would threaten lives, damage property, and disrupt the local
          economy.
          The Public Health & Safety Element is organized into sections addressing the following seven
          topics:
          •    Emergency Preparedness
          •    Flood Hazard and Dam Inundation
                  April 2014                         S-1                        City of Biggs General Plan

                            PUBLIC HEALTH & SAFETY ELEMENT
•    Fire Protection
•    Law Enforcement and Crime Prevention
•    Seismic and Geologic Hazards
•    Hazardous Materials and Waste Management
•    Transportation Hazards
II. ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
Emergency Preparedness
Guidance for emergency preparedness in Butte County as a whole, including Biggs, is provided
in the Butte County Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The Emergency Response Plan establishes
procedures for responding to various emergency situations, including regional flooding,
hazardous materials incidents, defense emergency, dam failure, wildland fire, and seismic
activity. In addition to the Butte County ERP, the City of Biggs also maintains a locally adopted
and locally focused Major Emergency Plan that sets forth policies and procedures for local
emergency events, provides for an emergency management response structure, and outlines
strategies for hazard mitigation. The city also maintains emergency response notification lists
and emergency response communications plans focused on Biggs.
Butte County released a Multi-Jurisdictional All Hazard Pre-Disaster Mitigation Plan (MHMP) in
March 2007. The MHMP was approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
and has been adopted by all local jurisdictions in Butte County. It was adopted by the City of
Biggs on April 16, 2007. The plan represents a cooperative effort between the County and the
incorporated cities, including Biggs, to document and plan for mitigation of natural and man-
made hazards. According to the document, the overall intent of the MHMP is to “reduce or
prevent injury and damage from hazards in the County. It identifies past and present mitigation
activities, current policies and programs, and mitigation strategies for the future. The Mitigation
Plan also guides hazard mitigation activities by establishing hazard mitigation goals and
objectives.”
The Butte County MHMP is available at:
http://hazardmitigation.calema.ca.gov/docs/lhmp/Butte_County_MHMP.pdf.
Flood Hazard and Dam Inundation
According to the Butte County MHMP, the probability and potential severity of flooding in Biggs
is considered to be high. This is due in part to the city’s location downstream of Lake Oroville
and the Thermalito Afterbay as well as the city’s flat topography and proximity to the Feather
River. In response to the various ongoing regional and statewide efforts to study and address
flood safety and levee stability issues, and FEMA’s process to reevaluate designated flood
hazard areas, the City of Biggs prepared a local flood hazard evaluation study that identified
Biggs as being outside of the designated 100-year flood hazard zone. The city’s preliminary flood
             City of Biggs General Plan                S-2                             April 2014

               PUBLIC HEALTH & SAFETY ELEMENT
hazard study determined that floodwaters moving westward from the Feather River would be
diverted in part by the Sutter Butte Canal located east of the city and east of State Route 99,
with additional diversions of water being made by Hamilton Slough located east of the city and
west of State Route 99. As a result of this study and the various ongoing efforts to evaluate the
stability of the levees along the Feather River, the City of Biggs was not identified by FEMA as
being within a 100-year flood hazard area as part of its regional flood hazard remapping effort
occurring in 2011.
Two primary types of regional flood events have the potential to threaten Biggs. These are the
failure of a dam located upstream from the city and the catastrophic failure of Feather River
levees along the river’s western side upstream from the city. Several dams located above Biggs
are also located above Oroville Dam in the Feather River watershed. In the event of failure of
one of these dams, floodwater would be contained in Lake Oroville. However, there are four
dams that are located such that their failure might create flooding in the city. These are the
Oroville Dam itself and the three structures that create the Thermalito complex: the Thermalito
Diversion Dam, the Thermalito Forebay Dam, and the Thermalito Afterbay Dam. The potential
flood hazards associated with the catastrophic failure of these dams is the primary reason why
Biggs was identified as having a high potential for flooding within Butte County’s Multi-
Jurisdictional All Hazard Pre-Disaster Mitigation Plan.
As noted above, a potential flooding threat to Biggs is the Hazelbrush Levee, which is the
western levee of the Feather River below the Thermalito Afterbay spillway. This levee is located
where the Feather River flow turns from a southwest to south flow path. Immediately
downstream from this area, the Feather River channel is further constrained by remnant rock
piles from past gold prospecting activity and cobble mining activities associated with the
construction of Oroville Dam. According to the Butte County MHMP, the combinations of
channel directional turn and blockage, along with the river’s physical location above Biggs,
represents a potential threat to the city should a significant breach occur at that location. A
proposal that has been discussed for Biggs is the reopening of passages beneath the Union
Pacific Railroad tracks to allow water to flow to the west in the event of a levee failure above the
city. Originally built on trestles, the base of the railroad has been filled and now serves as a
levee. Unfortunately, in the event of a levee breach northeast of Biggs, floodwater would flow in
a generally southwest direction and upon meeting the rail tracks would be forced toward Biggs.
Overtopping of Sacramento River levees is not considered to be a significant local concern due
to the general topography of the region and the distance between Biggs and the Sacramento
River. Levee failure or overtopping of the Sacramento River in areas north of Biggs would
generally be directed to the lower elevation Butte Sink area and would most likely not directly
affect the city. However, when the Sacramento River floods, localized flooding is possible due to
water backing up into local drainage channels and thereby reducing the ability of the city’s
storm water drainage system to remove water from inside Biggs.
Figure S-1 shows the flood hazard areas associated with the potential failure of Oroville Dam.

Flood Control
Flood control in the Biggs area is provided by a combination of federal, state, and local agencies.
The general purpose of these agencies is to identify potential flood hazard areas and devise
preventive programs, policies, and structures to avoid or minimize flood damage. FEMA
produces Flood Insurance Rate Maps, which identify areas of potential flood hazards, and
designates 100-year floodplain zones. A 100-year floodplain is the area that has a 1 percent
chance of being flooded in any one year. FEMA also manages the National Flood Insurance
Program, which provides insurance to the public based on the predicted 100-year flood event.
FEMA and the California Department of Water Resources are in the process of evaluating
whether flood control infrastructure in the area meets 100-year and 200-year flood protection
standards. These agencies have taken the position that various levees and flood control
structures, for which adequate data is unavailable, cannot be certified or accredited as adequate
to provide the required 100-year or 200-year level of flood protection.
                                                  As of the publication of this General Plan, Biggs
                                                  was identified as located outside of the 100-year
                                                  floodplain and was not classified as being in a
                                                  flood hazard area. However, FEMA is currently
                                                  undergoing a process to decertify several levees
                                                  in California and based on preliminary
                                                  information, it appears as though the city could
                                                  be reclassified as being within the 200-year flood
                                                  hazard designation. Biggs is part of the Sutter
                                                  Butte Flood Control Agency (SBFCA), which was
                                                  formed to evaluate and construct improvements
                                                  to the levee system to allow it to comply with the
requirements of FEMA for flood protection. The SBFCA is currently in the process of preparing
for construction efforts to increase the stability and protection of Feather River levees.
The role of Reclamation District 833 (RD 833) is of special significance to flood control in and
around Biggs. RD 833 channels surround the city and serve the dual purposes of providing and
conveying agricultural irrigation water as well as removing storm runoff from the city. Increases
in development in the region, coupled with the nearly flat terrain, result in the potential for
flooding miles “downstream” from Biggs to the southwest, which is known as the Butte Sink.
Avoiding increases in storm water runoff entering the RD 833 channels has become an
important concern due to the potential for increase in downstream flooding.
This General Plan contains policies addressing the city’s interaction with RD 833 and how the
city plans to address storm water within its jurisdictional area. Protection against local flooding
is addressed specifically in the Public Facilities & Services Element under the topic of Storm
Drainage Facilities.

Flood Legislation
In 2006 and 2007, the state legislature produced several pieces of legislation governing various
aspects of flood planning. The following is a list of legislation included as part of that package,
which affects the city and the General Plan:
•    SB 5 – Flood Management. Establishes higher standards of flood protection (generally 200-
     year protection) for urban and urbanizing areas exceeding 10,000 residents.
•    AB 70 – Flood Liability. Requires a city or county to contribute its fair-share cost of property
     damage caused by a flood event where the jurisdiction’s actions contributed to or increased
     the state’s exposure to liability.
•    AB 162 – Flood Planning in General Plans. Establishes enhanced requirements for cities and
     counties to address flood-related matters in their general plans.
In addition, consistent with the requirements of Proposition 1E approved by voters in 2006 and
as part of the State’s overall effort to reevaluate flood hazards in the Central Valley, the State of
California is preparing the State Plan of Flood Control (SPFC) and the Central Valley Flood
Protection Plan (CVFPP), which will serve as comprehensive flood control documents and will
help to define the reevaluated 100- and 200-year flood areas. The City of Biggs Planning Area
and various flood control structures are in the area covered by the SPFC and CVFPP documents.
The drainage facilities that provide local flood control are discussed in detail in the Public
Facilities & Services Element of the General Plan. The Public Health & Safety Element addresses
flood and dam inundation hazards through policies that require compliance with flood
protection building standards and actions to work with federal, state, and local agencies to
identify areas susceptible to flooding and accredit the flood control levees in the city.
Fire Protection
Biggs is potentially vulnerable to a variety of fire types. Reducing the potential for fire-related
injuries and property losses involves the prevention of fires through community education and
enforcement of building and safety codes, as well as the ability to respond to fire-related
emergencies once they occur.
The highest probable fire threats in Biggs are
structural fires in residences or businesses.
Additionally, other types of fires have the
potential for resulting in major losses in and
around the city. These include fire or explosion at
one of the local agricultural processing plants,
major operational failure of the rail service that
passes through Biggs, and urban conflagration
(multiple simultaneous structural fires). Wildland
and vegetation fires on the perimeter of the city

              PUBLIC HEALTH & SAFETY ELEMENT
are also possible, though the Butte County MHMP has determined the probability and severity
of these risks to be low.
The Biggs Fire Station is located at 454 B Street. Fire protection services in the city have been
provided through a cooperative agreement with Butte County Fire and the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) since 1989. This agreement is renewed on a
three-year basis and is funded on an annual basis by the Biggs City Council and the Butte County
Board of Supervisors. Agreements for mutual assistance have been established between Butte
County Fire/CalFire and various fire protection agencies. In the event of a major fire in Biggs, all
county fire departments, Butte County Fire/CalFire, and, if necessary, Sutter County and Live
Oak fire departments could respond.
Existing equipment consists of one primary engine owned by the City of Biggs, one reserve
engine, and one water tender. The station is currently staffed by two firefighters 24 hours a day
year-round, assisted by seasonal and volunteer firefighters during response. The County Fire
Chief leads the department, supported by one Deputy Chief and five Assistant Chiefs. Butte
County Fire/CalFire is a combination fire department; the delivery of fire department services is
accomplished using both career professional and citizen volunteer firefighters. According to the
Biggs Municipal Services Review, the Biggs Fire Station is currently meeting departmental
minimums for staffing as a regional provider.
In 2009–2010, the city upgraded its potable water system, which will allow for increased water
pressure in Biggs. These improvements included replacement of a significant percentage of the
city’s water extraction and delivery infrastructure. A new pressure system and ground tank was
installed at Family Park, which will increase water pressures in the system. Prior to these
improvements, water pressure within the system was below 40 pounds per square inch.
Improvements to this system have allowed an increase in water pressure to approximately 55
pounds per square inch. The increased pressure will significantly assist fire safety services
throughout the city.
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) is based on the idea that design and
effective use of community design can lead to a reduction in the potential for crime and
incidence of crime and an overall improvement in quality of life. CPTED strategies rely on the
ability to influence offender decisions that precede criminal acts by affecting the built, social,
and administrative environments.
Because Biggs does not have a full-time police department within its city limits, a CPTED strategy
would allow a reduction in crime by designing future neighborhoods and buildings in a manner
that would provide security and safety for people and property.

Seismic and Geologic Hazards
According to the Butte County MHMP, the probability and potential severity of geologic hazards
in Biggs are considered low. The city and the surrounding area are relatively free from significant
seismic and geologic hazards. There are no known or inferred active faults within the city. The
only known active fault in Butte County is the Cleveland Hills fault, the site of the August 1975
Oroville earthquake. This earthquake had a Richter magnitude of 5.7.
The city enforces the California Building Code, which mandates construction techniques that
minimize seismic hazards. In addition to seismically induced ground shaking, ground movement
can also be triggered by heavy rains or by grading. Landslide potential is influenced by a number
of factors, including geology, water influences, and topography. Because Biggs is located on the
valley floor, there is no potential for landslides, seiche, or tsunamis within the city or Planning
Area. Further, there is no indication of subsidence ever occurring in the city.
Some locations in the Biggs area are known to have expansive soils that swell when they absorb
water and shrink when drying (see Figure S-2). Expansive soils can cause structural damage to
foundations and roads if the necessary construction techniques and materials are not used.
The policies of this element support the continued use of the California Building Code to address
structural requirements related to safety from seismic and geologic hazards.

Hazardous Materials and Waste Management
Hazardous materials include a wide variety of substances commonly used in households and
businesses. Used motor oil, paint, solvents, lawn care and gardening products, household
cleaners, gasoline, and refrigerants are among the diverse range of substances classified as
hazardous materials. Nearly all businesses and residences generate some amount of hazardous
waste; certain businesses and industries generate larger amounts of each substance, including
gas stations, automotive service and repair shops, printers, dry cleaners, and photo processors.
In addition to these sources, material that is toxic or hazardous is transported on nearby State
Route 99 and on the Union Pacific Railroad, which passes through the city, and could be subject
to accidental release.
Several herbicides and insecticides that are classified by the California Department of Food and
Agriculture as potentially harmful to humans are used in Butte County. Although injuries from
agricultural chemicals are experienced predominantly in occupational situations, some hazards
may occur on neighboring lands during application. For example, if crop spraying adjacent to
urban uses occurs on a windy day, drift could create a hazard. The hazards that farming
operations present for urban uses can be minimized by using organic farming practices,
switching to crops with natural pest resistance, or maintaining buffer zones between urban and
agricultural uses. Policy CR-2.2 of the Conservation, Open Space & Recreation Element, and the
actions that follow it, establish the City of Biggs’ primary policies regarding buffering and the
agricultural-urban interface.
Hazardous Waste Regulation
Use, storage, and transportation of hazardous wastes are heavily regulated by federal, state,
and local agencies, including the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, which is
authorized to implement the regulations of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
In Butte County, a unified team serves as first responders to hazardous materials incidents or
emergencies. The team was first organized by the Butte County Fire Chiefs Association
beginning in 1989 through the use of a joint powers agreement. Team members are from the
fire departments of Chico, Oroville, Paradise, Biggs, Gridley, and Butte County, as well as from
CalFire. The team staffs two units and comprises specialists and technicians. Haz Mat 64 is
stationed at the Kelly Ridge Fire/Butte County Station, and Haz Mat 1 is stationed at Chico
Station 1.
The city and this General Plan will encourage and promote practices and technologies that will:
•    Reduce the use of hazardous substances and the generation of hazardous wastes at their
     source.
•    Recover and recycle the remaining wastes for reuse.
•    Treat those wastes not amendable to source reduction or recycling so that the environment
     and community health are not harmed by their ultimate release or disposal.

Transportation Hazards
The Union Pacific Railroad line passes through Biggs between Seventh and Eighth streets.
Hazardous materials are regularly shipped via the rail line and, while unlikely, an incident
involving a rail accident within the city could have devastating effects.
The city has little control over the types of materials that are shipped via the rail line. With
regard to government activities, the content of shipments may be confidential for reasons of
security and/or is generally unknown to the city. While the city has little influence over the types
of material transported via the rail line, the potential for rail incidents can be reduced by
ensuring that at-grade crossings in Biggs are operating in a safe and effective manner.
                                                  One of the primary concerns is the safety of
                                                  pedestrians along the tracks and vehicles utilizing
                                                  at-grade crossings on B Street, E Street, and F
                                                  Street. The second primary concern, while
                                                  unlikely, is an incident involving derailment of a
                                                  train in the vicinity of Biggs and the hazards that
                                                  could result from spillage of the cargo which the
                                                  train is transporting.
                                                  The design and operation of at-grade crossings is
                                                  the aspect of rail-related hazards that is most
                                                  under the control of the city. Each of Biggs’
                                                  crossing sites is controlled by automated gates.
                                                  Grade-separated        crossings          (overcrossings)
                                                  improve safety in the community by reducing
                                                  collision potential and ensuring that emergency
                                                  vehicles can always cross the tracks. However,
                                                  such crossings are cost-prohibitive and could
                                                  significantly impact existing development
                                                  adjacent to the existing crossing sites. The city
                                                  has engaged in dialogue with the Union Pacific
                                                  Railroad, the City of Gridley, and Butte County to
                                                  explore options for regional crossings, which may
                                                  assist in addressing cost concerns.
Given the land use and financial impacts of grade-separated crossings, it is highly unlikely that
the at-grade crossings in Biggs will be eliminated during the life of this General Plan. Therefore,
ensuring proper gate operation at the crossings is the most effective strategy the city can
employ to avoid accidents and minimize safety risks.

                           PUBLIC HEALTH & SAFETY ELEMENT
Proper gate functioning includes ensuring that gates are not in the lowered position
unnecessarily. Lowering of gates for excessive time durations or when trains are not present can
encourage drivers to maneuver around gates. Over time, such practices can increase the
potential for a train/vehicle collision.

          Action S-6.1.1 (CPTED Guidelines) – Adopt, and update as necessary, development
          standards and design provisions consistent with current CPTED guidelines.
          Specifically, incorporate provisions to address the following:
          •      Natural Surveillance – Intended to keep intruders easily observable, natural
                 surveillance provisions maximize visibility of people, parking area, and building
                 entrances (e.g., doors and windows that look out on to streets and parking
                 areas, pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and streets, front porches, adequate
                 nighttime lighting).
          •      Territorial Reinforcement – Physical design can create or extend a sphere of
                 influence. Users then develop a sense of territorial control while potential
                 offenders, perceiving this control, are discouraged. This design concept is
                 implemented by features that define property lines and distinguish private
                 spaces from public spaces using landscape plantings, pavement designs,
                 gateway treatments, and fences.

           PUBLIC HEALTH & SAFETY ELEMENT
            •    Natural Access Control – A design concept directed primarily at decreasing
                 crime opportunity by denying access to crime targets and creating a perception
                 of risk for offenders. This design concept is achieved by designing streets,
                 sidewalks, building entrances, and neighborhood gateways to clearly indicate
                 public routes and also by discouraging access to private areas with structural
                 elements.
            •    Target Hardening – This is accomplished by adding features that prohibit entry
                 or access, including window locks, deadbolts for doors, and interior door hinges.
GOAL S-7: ENHANCE THE SAFETY OF RAILROAD CROSSINGS.
      Policy S-7.1 (Railroad Crossings) – Enhance the safety of railroad crossings in
      the city.

COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
  March 2014              City of Biggs General Plan

                  COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
The City of Biggs places a high value on the aesthetic character of the city
and recognizes and highlights the role of the city’s geographic, historical,
and cultural features in the creation of the built environment.
          I.     INTRODUCTION
          The Community Enhancement Element sets forth the city’s vision on issues related to urban
          form and community design and establishes policies and programs to guide public
          improvements and private development. This element encourages and promotes those aspects
          of the city that are valued and desired by residents and
          which make Biggs a unique community with a positive            By far the greatest and most
          memorable character.                                           admirable form of wisdom is
                                                                            that needed to plan and
          Authority and Purpose
                                                                          beautify cities and human

          provided by Section 65303 of the California Government
          Code. This section provides authority to cities and
                                                                                       – Socrates
          counties to add optional elements to their general plans
          beyond those elements mandated by the state and which reflect issues of local concern or
          importance to the community. This element focuses on all areas within the Biggs city limits and
          is intended to maintain and enhance the community’s existing character, preserve cultural and
          historic resources, provide guidance on issues of urban form and function, and preserve the
          qualities that make Biggs a safe, desirable, and attractive place to live.
          The purpose of this element is to establish the basic structure upon which decisions related to
          urban form and community design can be based and to set forth a program composed of goals,
          policies, and actions to ensure that investment and reinvestment in the city protects, highlights,
          promotes, and encourages the physical design features and elements most valued by the
          community.
          This element contains three sections. Section one introduces the element, section two briefly
          describes various design and city form issues and opportunities, and section three details the
          goals, policies, and programs of the element. The overall goal of the element is to provide a
          program for the maintenance and enhancement of the basic elements that make the city the
          unique place that it is and to provide a vision which serves to create and enhance the desirable
          characteristics of Biggs. This element focuses primarily on the physical appearance of the
          community. It provides direct guidance on topics such as design, streetscape, historic structures,
          and buildings, with the intent of enhancing, promoting, and expanding on the physical qualities
          of the community.

                      COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
The element relates to both public and private development and provides specific policy
guidance in focused areas such as the city’s downtown. The policies and actions contained in
this element are intended to help to ensure that Biggs retains its unique, historic, and desirable
elements and qualities.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Community Enhancement Element works in partnership with the other elements of the
General Plan to direct new growth, public investment, public and private improvements, and
community revitalization efforts toward the achievement of the overall vision of the Plan. The
goals and policies of this element work together with and complement those of the other Plan
elements. The city’s goals of creating a high-quality, diverse, and balanced community centered
on the provision of cost-efficient and effective public services, having a balanced and sustainable
transportation system, and fostering a city that is enjoyed by its residents and appreciated by
nonresidents work with the goals and policies of this element to achieve the city’s broader
vision for the future. While the Land Use Element describes the location, distribution, and
intensity of land use in the city and the Biggs Planning Area, the Community Enhancement
Element focuses on how development should relate to residents and visitors both at the human
scale and at the broader city scale.
Background and Context – Urban Form
Since the time of its founding in 1871 to its incorporation as a city in 1903 and extending to the
present time, Biggs has undergone a slow but steady evolution. The city has evolved from a
regional agriculture hub supporting dry-land crops, such as wheat and other grains, to an active
and vital commerce and transportation hub spurred by the construction of local and regional
irrigation canals and the Union Pacific rail line, and subsequently into the residential and
farming-support community that the city is today. Through the passage of time and the
reshaping of the city due to catastrophic fire, changes in transportation, or advancements in
technology, Biggs has retained its essential character and the basic urban form upon which it
was founded. The roots of Biggs’ urban form can be seen in the city’s continued adherence to
the original grid-based street system, the various original or early structures that include the
historic and stately homes along B Street and the historic structures in the city’s downtown
core, and the architecture of the Biggs Unified School District offices. Today, Biggs remains an
agriculture-based community that still feels and moves to the seasonal rhythms of the
agricultural world around it. It has been said that the city’s essential character is equal parts
history and the present and that the combination of these ingredients creates the special
mixture of small-town charm and semi-rural living that characterizes Biggs.
II. ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
This section outlines the issues and opportunities within the city related to urban design, city
form, historic preservation, and the use of public spaces. Specific policy guidance and actions

         COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
can be found in the Goals, Policies, and Actions subsection of this element. Definitions for
specialized terms and subject-specific references are provided in the Glossary (Appendix A).
Urban Form
Built Environment
Biggs has many unique and desirable urban-form, structural, and streetscape features common
to well-established communities (tree-lined main street, grid-based street layout, historic
structures, centrally located city core, etc.). Over the past 100-plus years, Biggs has largely
maintained the compact urban form upon which it was originally planned. The majority of the
city’s residential housing was constructed in the period between the early 1940s and the late
1960s. Building during that period continued to utilize the basic lot-and-block layout of the
original city parcel map. Since that time, Biggs has not seen significant new growth or new
construction activity and thus has not deviated significantly from the original town layout. The
majority of the new residential dwellings and structures that have been constructed in the past
20 to 30 years have been on existing vacant lots or have been reconstruction or remodeling
activities accomplished on previously occupied lots. The historic main street, B Street, contains
many of the city’s oldest homes built in the late 1800s to early 1900s. The oldest homes in the
city are generally reflective of a traditional two-story, Victorian style. The combination of the
slow progression of growth, the efficient utilization of the city’s vacant infill parcels, and the
redevelopment of underutilized parcels has created pressure for Biggs to grow outward beyond
its historic core. To accommodate new growth during the next planning period, the City of Biggs
will need to look to areas beyond the current city limits. This outward growth pressure will
result in the necessity to focus on the integration of the older, established neighborhoods with
newer areas of the city and to integrate the more traditional design elements of the city with
those areas reflective of a more modern style.
The nonresidential component of the city’s urban form centers primarily around the downtown
business area on B Street, between Fifth and Seventh streets. The downtown area is located
near the current geographic center of the city, has traditionally been the focal point of the
community and its events, and is the city’s primary point of social activity. The downtown area
includes Biggs’ only service commercial uses and contains the primary governmental functions
(e.g., City Hall, the Post Office, the Biggs branch of the County Library). The urban form of the
downtown area is reflective of a compact style, with buildings generally extending to the street
in the front and having limited to no setbacks or open areas between adjacent buildings. The
collective style of the downtown core is reflective of the age and evolution of the city’s
nonresidential center. The eastern edge of the current downtown core is anchored by the
historic Carnegie Library and the Colonia Hotel and the shell of the city’s historic pharmacy
building.
Other nonresidential uses are located closer to the outer edges of the city. The primary
industrial area is located in the southwestern portion of Biggs. Nonresidential uses in this area
include the SunWest rice milling facilities, the city’s Public Works Corporation Yard, and the
        April 2014                           CE-3                     City of Biggs General Plan

                       COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
wastewater treatment plant. Biggs High School and Biggs Elementary School are located on the
northwest side of the city and frame the entry to Biggs from State Route 99 from both B Street
and Rio Bonito Road. Residential areas surround the downtown and extend in a grid pattern
toward the agricultural lands surrounding the city.
The City of Biggs will focus on maintaining and creating a high-quality, built environment that
respects the city’s existing development pattern and style. New development will provide
meaningful public spaces, incorporate locally appropriate design and materials, and respect the
city’s history and sense of place in the region.
Natural Environment
Biggs’ edge and edge-transition areas are a second aspect of the city’s urban form. These are the
areas between the existing developed urban area and the rural residential and agricultural lands
that surround the city. Orchards, field crops, and rice fields, along with rural residential uses,
border the current city limits. The western edge of the city marks the beginning of a large
expanse of active, irrigated agricultural activity mainly used for the cultivation of rice. These
areas provide significant open lands with seasonal foraging, habitat, and loafing areas for
wildlife. The areas east of the city are predominantly used for the production of tree crops
(almonds, walnuts, and prunes) and provide shade and seasonal tree-canopy cover with limited
ground-level habitat features. The areas to the north and south of the city are characterized by
larger-lot rural residential development and isolated agricultural and grazing uses. These areas
are characterized by a primary mix of residential and agricultural structures and small
agricultural or ornamental areas providing limited and fragmented habitat areas.
The agricultural fields and orchards are important elements in defining Biggs and provide a
sense of enclosure that defines the city’s urban space. As the city continues to experience
pressure to expand outward from its existing urban center, treatment of the urban-agricultural
and urban-rural edge will be an important consideration. New development will recognize the
value of the natural environment for humans, animals, and plants and will incorporate natural
areas and features into the project design in a way that maintains the overall integrity and feel
of the city’s natural environment heritage.
Gateways
Clear gateway entrances into and out of Biggs help to establish a strong local and regional
identity. A gateway is a visual entrance into a community, usually characterized by a transition
from agricultural to urban landscape and often accentuated by monuments or design features.
Prominent entrances can establish a sense of arrival and departure from an area and promote a
sense of place for a community. A gateway location will gradually change over time as the urban
area develops. It is anticipated as part of this General Plan that the city’s primary existing
gateway to the east, B Street, will shift toward State Route 99, thus presenting new
opportunities to create a statement entry into the city. However, regardless of the direction of
new development, the purpose of the city’s gateways remains constant.
             City of Biggs General Plan               CE-4                           April 2014

        COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
The gateway welcomes visitors and residents into the community and provides a lasting image
upon departure. Biggs’ primary gateways are B Street and Rio Bonito Road from the east, Eighth
Street from the north, and Sixth Street and West Biggs-Gridley Road from the south. As new
development opportunities arise on the city’s periphery, it is envisioned that these new
development areas will retain the desirable elements of the city’s existing gateways and
enhance and add to the value that the entrances provide to Biggs.
Streetscape/Street Pattern
Streetscape
The streetscape, or view from the road, of the city is an important and powerful visual reflection
of the community’s image. A city’s streetscape consists of many elements, including trees,
landscaping, and street furniture (benches, trash receptacles, street lighting, etc.) and can
include the private yard space of residences adjacent to the street. The connection between the
public streetscape (streets, sidewalks, public improvements) and the private streetscape (front
yards, landscaping) serves as an important visual element and can affect factors such as
property values, community pride, and property investment. For residents and visitors alike,
what people see from the street often frames their impressions of the city. As a result, streets,
street improvements, and the view from the road are very important aspects of the overall
appearance and perception of the city. This General Plan places a high value on the quality of
Biggs’ streetscapes and seeks to establish a policy framework that works to retain the existing
desirable qualities and change the undesirable elements of the city’s streetscape.
Street Pattern
The original street pattern in Biggs is based on a grid system and is generally aligned with the
railroad tracks. Streets are laid out in a rectilinear pattern running in a north-to-south and east-
to-west orientation. The city’s small size, combined with mobility options and the small-town
feel that a grid street pattern provides, is a strong identifying element for Biggs and is an
element that residents have indicated they enjoy about the city. Recent developments have
sought to deviate from the use of the traditional grid street pattern in favor of streets having
features identified as being more desirable to modern consumers (cul-de-sacs, discontinuous
links, etc.). The creation of cul-de-sacs and curvilinear streets deviates from the historic
circulation pattern in the city, and residents have indicated that such streets detract from the
traditional character of Biggs. Additionally, the creation of cul-de-sacs and nonlinear street
patterns limits access and movement through the city and tends to channel traffic movement
onto main streets. The continuation of the traditional grid-based street design may become
increasingly difficult due to landownership patterns, physical environmental features (canals,
ditches, and environmental constraints), and economic and land use efficiency considerations.
When and where possible, the city and its residents desire to maintain the integrity of the grid
street system as Biggs expands and seek to limit restrictive circulation patterns that may detract
from the community character and create barriers to movement.
       April 2014                            CE-5                       City of Biggs General Plan

                        COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
Maintaining the basic integrity of the grid street pattern allows for increased circulation and
mobility options and greater options for reaching various destinations by all modes of travel.
Roadways that are fragmented or end by design often provide poor connection with
surrounding roads and load traffic onto adjacent higher-volume streets. Such circuitous or dead-
end streets cause residents to drive extra miles, increasing emissions, focusing traffic, and
restricting mobility choices and route options.
Street Trees/Planting Strips
As described elsewhere in this element, the city’s grid street pattern produces a small-town feel
that is key to the historic character of Biggs. One feature that enhances the feeling is the
incorporation of trees and planting strips within the city right-of-way adjacent to the street. City
residents have continually noted the presence of street trees and right-of-way landscape
plantings as being a highly desirable element of the city’s streetscape. In addition to providing a
defining visual element for many of the city’s streets, street trees and right-of-way landscaping
help to soften or minimize the visual impact of concrete and asphalt improvements, provide
shade, enhance air quality benefits, minimize urban heat buildup, and offer areas of urban
habitat for wildlife.
Street trees and right-of-way landscaping plantings are selected from a list of approved trees
and landscape options to strengthen and provide continuity along city streets, minimize
structural damage that can be caused by root intrusion and uplift, and reduce irrigation
demands from water-intensive and non-native or regionally inappropriate species. This element
of the General Plan reinforces the city’s commitment to street trees and landscaping as an
important element of the overall community feel.
Street Furniture and Pedestrian Pathways
The term “street furniture” refers to the various pieces of hardware or improvements found
within the public right-of-way for the convenience of pedestrians, bicyclists, and users of the
public street. Such improvements commonly include benches, trash receptacles, drinking
fountains, recycling boxes, bicycle racks, bus shelters, information kiosks, decorative street
lighting, and similar items designed and intended to create a functional, friendly, and
aesthetically pleasing environment for users of the public right-of-way. The use and selection of
a visual aesthetic can help to identify special districts or areas within the community and can
help to create a sense of place or feeling about an area or location. The use of street furniture in
Biggs is generally limited to the downtown area and locations on or adjacent to school or park
facilities. The city and this General Plan seek to promote the use of appropriate, functional, and
necessary street furniture to enhance the feel of the community and to help define and enhance
the positive feeling of users of the city’s street system.
Sidewalks and pedestrian pathways are important elements to the city’s overall visual aesthetic
and help create connections within the community. Not all people move and travel using
vehicles, and the creation and enhancement of a functional, efficient, and cost-effective system
of pedestrian paths, sidewalks, and street improvements (handicapped ramps and curbs and
gutters) enhances travel options, encourages people to walk or bike instead of using an
              City of Biggs General Plan                 CE-6                          April 2014

         COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
automobile, and increases public safety for schoolchildren and users of the public right-of-way
system. The City of Biggs has undertaken numerous significant and important projects to install
sidewalks and street improvements on city streets. However, a significant number of streets do
not have full improvements, and pedestrians using streets without sidewalks often walk in
vehicle travel lanes. Additionally, the lack of curb, gutter, and accessibility ramps creates
localized water ponding conditions, results in the tracking of mud and debris on city streets, and
limits mobility options for disadvantaged residents. The City of Biggs and this General Plan seek
to encourage the installation of street improvements, sidewalks, and pedestrian paths to
establish an efficient and effective pedestrian mobility system and to enhance the visual
aesthetic of the city using available grant and loan programs designed to leverage local monies.
Downtown Revitalization
The city’s downtown business area is in the center of the community and, with the exception of
the local schools, serves as the primary focal point for community activity. The city’s original
layout located the commercial and governmental functions of the community in its geographic
center and adjacent to the primary transportation features in the area at the time—B Street and
the newly installed railroad lines. Through the years, the city’s downtown core has evolved from
a thriving regionally significant hub of transportation and commerce containing hotels,
restaurants, saloons, and basic services, to a bucolic “small-town America” downtown providing
basic retail goods and services to city and local area residents, to a struggling commercial center
grappling with changes in the regional economy, the elimination of proximity to regionally
significant transportation features, and a declining local population base. However, whether
through forced change as a result of catastrophic fires or elected change as a result of a
modification in necessary services, the downtown area has remained the core of the city.
Historically, Biggs has been a community with an attitude of self-reliance and self-sufficiency.
Biggs is a city that likes to take care of its own. The downtown area was once an active and
positive focal point of the town. Over the past few decades, the downtown has slowly declined
as once-thriving businesses have shuttered, regional competition has increased, and market
trends have shifted away from small, local goods and service providers to a larger, consolidated,
and more transportation-dependent regional focus.
One of the results of the decline in the downtown area has been a shift in the community’s
attitude toward the city and its ability to provide basic services and goods. Many city residents
now see Biggs as unable to provide the basic goods and services necessary for day-to-day
activities and look to outside opportunities for basic shopping needs and day-to-day services. In
2008, the city completed a study effort to explore what market opportunities exist within the
local service area that could help support an effort to revitalize the downtown area. The
Downtown Economic Analysis study looked at market segments, service gaps, and potential
options for the establishment and growth of new businesses in the downtown area. In 2010, the
city prepared a Downtown Visual Master Plan that continued its efforts to study the
opportunities in the downtown core. The Downtown Visual Master Plan looked at establishing a
        April 2014                           CE-7                       City of Biggs General Plan

common design theme for the downtown, explored potential building reuse issues, and outlined
small but achievable steps that the city and local volunteers could take to begin the process of
beautifying and reinvigorating the downtown area. These studies, coupled with future city
efforts and the work of dedicated volunteers and residents, will once again create and ensure
that the city’s downtown commercial core is a location of positive focus and energy for Biggs.
The challenge for the city during this planning period is to continue to seek ways to strengthen
and revitalize the downtown core. This General Plan recognizes that an economically strong
downtown is both necessary and desirable for residents to maintain pride in the community and
to assist the city in its efforts to move toward other significant city goals and objectives. The
Community Enhancement Element reinforces the idea that Biggs and its residents should work
diligently to revitalize the downtown to encourage a strong and self-sufficient city that provides
the basic core services necessary for residents. This element also seeks to balance the concept
of retaining the historic attributes and elements of the downtown area as revitalization and
revisioning efforts are pursued.
Historic Preservation
Biggs has a rich cultural and historic past. Originally inhabited by members of the Maidu tribe,
the Biggs area was part of the Fernandez Land Grant. This land grant was made by the Mexican
Governor of California, Governor Pio Pico, in June 1846 and totaled roughly 17,800 acres. The
recipients of this grant were Dionisio and Maceimo Fernandez.
The city owes its beginnings to the value of local soils for agricultural purposes. Originally
established to serve the agricultural uses of the late 1800s, the building of the California and
Oregon (later the Southern Pacific) Railway played an important role in the city’s growth, and
Biggs developed as a locally important shipping point for agricultural products.
With the growth of agriculture in the area and the building of the railroad, Biggs can date its
beginnings to 1870. Originally named Biggs Station in 1871 after Major Marion Biggs, the town’s
name was shortened to Biggs in 1903, when the area was incorporated into a city. During the
period of time leading up the city’s incorporation in 1903, the city’s population expanded with
the growth of the region. Stores, hotels, blacksmith shops, butcher shops, and houses were built
in Biggs; the area where the city is now located was the second most populous location in Butte
County. Biggs had two serious fires in 1878, the combination of which destroyed most of the
town’s wooden buildings. In an effort to minimize the fire risk that wooden structures
presented, new brick buildings were constructed in their place. Fire again took most of the
buildings in the downtown area of the city in 1903, and a major flood in 1907 was said to have
flooded most of the structures in the city.
The combination of fires and floods destroyed many of the city’s buildings; however, some
structures remained and were salvaged or rebuilt altogether. Today, numerous older dwellings
and buildings remain as a testament to the city’s history. The old houses and downtown of the
community are a testament to the city’s vitality during the late 1800s and early 1900s.

            INTRODUCTION
    PUBLIC FACILITIES & SERVICES
              ELEMENT
March 2014                 City of Biggs General Plan

                  PUBLIC FACILITIES & SERVICES ELEMENT
The City of Biggs endeavors to provide to its residents high-quality, cost-
efficient, and reliable public facilities and infrastructure that are
strategically planned, funded, and maintained. The city’s electric, water,
storm drainage, and sewer systems have been designed to minimize
impacts to the environment and maximize efficiency and cost-
effectiveness. The city actively supports the provision of high-quality
educational and social service facilities.
          I.     INTRODUCTION
          The Public Facilities & Services Element is intended to address the community’s needs for
          infrastructure, sewer and wastewater systems, and other community services. One of the
          fundamental responsibilities of a city is to provide primary public facilities and services to its
          residents and businesses. The provision of cost-effective and efficient public services and
          infrastructure is instrumental to the overall health and well-being of a balanced community.
          Various aspects of public facilities are considered in this element. While state law requires the
          General Plan to address domestic water service issues, requirements regarding other facilities
          are not as clearly or specifically defined. However, state
          law encourages the local jurisdiction to include any other
          element which it determines to be relevant to the
          jurisdiction (Government Code Section 65303). This
          element considers the range of public facilities that the City
          must provide to support existing and future urban land
          uses.
          Safety-related issues such as fire protection and flood
          control are discussed in the Public Health & Safety Element.
          Overview
          Due to the breadth of information covered in this element,
          the chapter is organized into sections that address the
          following topics:
               •   General Infrastructure                         •   Electrical Utility Service
               •   Water Supply Facilities                        •   Solid Waste Disposal
               •   Wastewater Collection and Treatment            •   Social Services
               •   Storm Drainage Facilities

                      PUBLIC FACILITIES & SERVICES ELEMENT
II. ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
This section of the element identifies and addresses public facilities and services issues raised
during the outreach efforts for the General Plan update. Policy guidance is found in the Goals,
Policies, and Actions section of this element.
General Infrastructure
A key premise of this General Plan is that growth should be guided by the ability of resources
and services to sustain it. For public facilities and services, this means ensuring that new
development does not create demands that cannot be met without diminishing the quality of
services to current residents and businesses. The need to expand public facilities to meet the
needs of a growing community while ensuring the provision of high-quality services to existing
residents is a primary concern of the city and this Plan. Balancing these often competing
demands for public services will require the careful planning of new facilities, the responsible
maintenance of existing facilities, and the collection of appropriate funds to achieve both goals.
The goals, policies, and actions contained in this element establish general requirements for the
planning and financing of new facilities and the continued operation of existing facilities.
Water Supply Facilities
This element addresses issues related to domestic water
service throughout the community, including ensuring that
city water supplies are capable of meeting the needs of the
community and that adequate facilities for treating and
delivering domestic water are created as new development
and urban expansion occur.
The Biggs domestic water system has been serving the
community since 1904 when two wells were drilled and the
initial mains were constructed. Numerous improvements to
the system have occurred since that time, including the
addition of wells, pipeline replacement projects, capacity
expansion, and water pressure enhancements. The city has
recently completed a major water system improvement
project that replaced a significant portion of the water
delivery system. Improvements included the replacement of
water main and distribution lines, rehabilitation of the city’s existing primary service well,
installation of a water pressure booster system, installation of water meters, and upgrades to
various fire protection and water control structures. The city continually endeavors to provide
its citizens a safe and sustainable supply of water and is committed to making those
improvements necessary for improving system reliability and the optimal delivery of water
service to all residents and businesses.

         PUBLIC FACILITIES & SERVICES ELEMENT
In November of 2008, the city adopted a Water Master Plan that identified nine priority projects
needed to bring the city’s water system up to date. The city has since completed each of those
improvements, resulting in the achievement of having sufficient capacity to accommodate the
demands of existing residents along with making sufficient water resources available to address
the potential growth of the community in the coming planning horizon. Additionally, the recent
improvements to the city’s water system have resulted in a significant increase in water
pressure for domestic and fire flow purposes.
Wastewater Collection and Treatment
One of the most important services a city provides is the collection and treatment of
wastewater generated by its residents and businesses. A community’s wastewater collection
and treatment system must be sufficient to serve existing customers, accommodate a
                                                 responsible level of planned growth in the
                                                 community, and meet regional water quality and
                                                 treatment standards. This element provides
                                                 policy guidance on these issues.
                                                 The city developed a comprehensive Sewer
                                                 Master Plan in 2003. The document states that
                                                 most of the wastewater collection system was
                                                 installed between 1920 and 1950 and is at or
                                                 nearing the end of its planned life cycle. The plan
                                                 indicates that the collection system occasionally
                                                 experiences constraints due to infiltration/inflow
issues in various locations, pipe deterioration due to age, root intrusion, and grease buildup. To
address these issues, the city has undertaken numerous projects to address aging pipes and
infiltration/inflow concerns that have resulted in a system which maintains its ability to
responsibly collect and treat the city’s wastewater. Despite these projects, the Master Plan
recommends the continual rehabilitation of the city’s wastewater collection system.
The Sewer Master Plan also addressed the city’s wastewater treatment plant. The treatment
plant was originally built in the 1960s and is a Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB)
level 2 treatment facility. The plan indicates that the treatment plant is in excellent condition
following a major facility upgrade in 2000–2001. The plant currently has more than adequate
capacity to serve Biggs’ wastewater treatment needs. The city is currently exploring options to
further modify the plant and its discharge methods to continue to meet and exceed state
requirements while providing a high level of service to system users.
Storm Drainage Facilities
Two primary sources of storm water runoff are of concern to the city: regional runoff, which
originates outside the city, and runoff from properties located inside the city. Regional runoff
has historically posed the greatest threat of flooding to properties in the city; however, flood
        April 2014                         PFS-3                      City of Biggs General Plan

                      PUBLIC FACILITIES & SERVICES ELEMENT
control facilities such as Oroville Dam have minimized this threat considerably. (See the Public
Health & Safety Element of this General Plan for further discussion of regional flooding.) As a
result, the more immediate concern for the city is the collection, conveyance, and discharge of
storm water from properties in Biggs.
Historically, Biggs experienced localized flooding issues at specific locations in the city. However,
as a result of numerous storm water drainage projects, including the installation of a new storm
water drainage system on the west side of the city, almost all of the areas that once presented
issues in the city have been addressed. The result is a well-functioning storm water drainage
system that efficiently protects the city during normal storm events.
Throughout the public outreach process for the development of this Plan, residents indicated a
strong desire to maintain the natural watercourses traversing the city and to protect the quality
of the waterways surrounding the city. This element establishes policies to improve and extend
the city’s storm drainage system while minimizing impacts to the natural functioning of the
area’s waterways.
Electrical Utility Service
The city of Biggs is one of only a limited number of cities in California that owns, operates, and
maintains its own electric utility system. This service has provided an important source of
revenue for the city and has allowed residents to receive reliable power at competitive rates.
The city is an active member of the Northern California Power Agency and works hard to provide
reliable power to its residents and businesses. The city actively maintains the electrical system in
Biggs and continually looks at ways to cost-effectively upgrade facilities and take advantage of
the opportunities that present themselves as a result. This General Plan supports the city’s
continued provision of electric power and provides goals and policies that seek to enable the
city to capture opportunities presented through ownership of the electric system.
Solid Waste Disposal
The City of Biggs contracts with Waste Management, Inc., for the collection and
disposal/diversion of solid waste, yard waste, and recycling from all developed properties in the
city. Participation in this service is mandatory for all city residents and businesses. Solid waste
generated in the city is primarily disposed of at the Neal Road Recycling and Waste Facility
outside Chico. The landfill has a remaining capacity of approximately 22 million cubic yards and
is permitted to operate until 2033. Both yard waste and recyclable materials are diverted from
landfills, with yard waste deposited at a City of Chico–owned composting facility and recyclable
materials sorted and resold by Waste Management. Using a competitive bidding system, the
City of Biggs continually looks for opportunities to provide an enhanced level of service in the
form of competitive rates, waste diversion, and service enhancements.

Social Services
The Biggs Unified School District provides a public education to the youth of Biggs. There are
three schools within the city limits: Biggs Elementary School, Biggs High School, and Biggs
Community Day School. As of January 2014, Biggs Elementary School (K–8th grade) had 368
enrolled students, Biggs High School (9th–12th grades) had 146 enrolled students, and
Community Day School (9th–12th grades) had 12 students.
The Butte County Library has a branch in Biggs, which is open two days a week. The library
provides book, video, and music loans and also provides free Wi-Fi for patrons. Community
service organizations include the Biggs Lion Club and Biggs Action Community Volunteers.
Annual local events include the Fourth of July Hometown Celebration and Biggs National Night
Out.

             INTRODUCTION
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
  March 2014              City of Biggs General Plan

                      ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
The City of Biggs seeks to create an economic development environment
that values private investment, minimizes impediments to positive
economic growth, and facilitates the creation of a strong and diversified
economy. The city actively seeks to diversify and expand Biggs’ tax and
employment base while actively working to retain existing businesses,
expand the city’s existing commercial and manufacturing resources, and
promote the opportunities provided by the city.
         I.     INTRODUCTION
         This section addresses the efforts that the city
         will seek to make and the policies that the city
         will strive to implement to bring new primary
         industries, jobs, and other types of positive
         economic growth opportunities to Biggs while
         protecting and expanding the existing job base
         and economic health of the city. The principal
         focus of the city’s economic development efforts
         focuses on expanding Biggs’ existing tax and job
         base to provide increased employment options
         for city residents and seeks to expand
         nonresidential opportunities in the city to
         provide additional revenue and economic development options. Local government plays a key
         role in this process by creating conditions that foster and encourage investment and
         opportunity in the city and that provide a sense of welcome for those land uses providing
         positive economic development opportunities. This element seeks to advance these concepts
         through the establishment of an economic development vision for the city, supported by goals
         and policies. However, achieving this outcome will require a combination of vision, foresight,
         practicality, and constant attention over a sustained period of time.
         The General Plan’s focus on economic development issues is important for many reasons.
         Economic diversification insulates the city budget against negative fluctuations in the economy
         and strengthens the city’s ability to provide a consistent level of service to city residents. Quality
         of life is enhanced through the opportunities presented by desirable employment, education,
         and housing combined with reduced commute distances that enhance opportunities for leisure,
         community, and health-related activities. Additionally, a diversified economic base distributes
         costs over a wider group of users and reduces the overall burden of services on the community
         and its individual residents.

                           ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
Overview
The Economic Development Element is an optional element of the General Plan. The authority
for the element is provided by Section 65303 of the California Government Code, which states
that cities and counties can include in their general plans elements beyond those legally
required and which reflect issues of local concern or importance. The element, as described
above, seeks to establish an economic development vision for the city, communicate areas of
issue and opportunity, and establish a cohesive and effective set of goals, policies, and programs
to assist the city in moving toward its desired economic development vision.
History
Biggs’ economic development environment has been in a continual state of change since the
city’s incorporation in the early 1900s. Beginning prior to the time of its incorporation, Biggs and
the areas surrounding the city have been actively cultivated for various agricultural products.
Starting with the establishment of citrus fruits in the late 1800s and transitioning to wheat and
ultimately to rice, the city’s economy has been driven by the strength of local agriculture. The
strength of the city’s agricultural base, and the personalities that resulted from its local
operations, was reinforced by the city’s location as the northernmost stop on the Union Pacific
Railroad line for a period of time in the early 1900s. As the northernmost destination accessible
via rail, Biggs saw substantial growth and prosperity in the form of the establishment of lodging
establishments, mercantile shops, lumber and wood product shipping, and skilled trades such as
blacksmithing and agricultural implement production. However, with the extension of the
railroad to the north and the growth of other regional cities in the county, the city’s strategic
importance began to diminish. The decline of the city’s prosperity was further accelerated when
State Route 99 was constructed east of the city, thereby diverting traffic to locations outside of
Biggs.
Despite changes to the local transportation system that
once served to fuel the city’s cycles of growth and
prosperity, Biggs remains a city that is proud of its past and
looks forward to the opportunities that will once again
provide the city with a strong economic base. The city
continues to benefit from and support the area’s local
agricultural community and looks to new opportunities to
strengthen its future.

            ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
II. ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
This section of the element identifies and addresses economic development issues identified
during the outreach efforts for the General Plan and provides a summary overview of a range of
topics of importance to the city relative to economic development. Policy guidance on specific
issues and opportunities can be found in the Goals, Policies, and Actions section of this element.
Economic Diversification
The economy of Biggs has traditionally centered on agriculture; however, changing agricultural
practices—such as mechanization, industrialization, and the centralization of capital—have
resulted in negative economic impacts for many of California’s agricultural communities. The
cost of transporting agricultural goods to market and the need to consolidate agricultural
processing activities have changed the way agriculture operations function. While Biggs
continues to benefit from the presence of local agricultural processing operations and its
location in the northern Sacramento Valley’s agricultural zone, the city’s industrial base has
become dependent on the fortunes of the local agricultural community. As a result, the city of
Biggs seeks to diversify its industrial and commercial base to create additional jobs and provide
expanded options for existing and future residents. The lack of significant economic growth over
the past ten years highlights Biggs’ need to seek new economic and base-level employment
options. This General Plan continues to support the city’s active agricultural activities while
providing policies and programs that seek to diversify the economic base.
Aging Commercial Core and Changing Markets
The city’s downtown core has continued to decline due to a lack of employment options, the
expansion of regional commercial opportunities outside of the city, and a lack of investment
back into the city’s existing commercial businesses. As other cities in south Butte County have
seen growth over the past decades, commercial businesses that were once located in Biggs have
moved out of Biggs looking for larger markets and increased visibility on regional transportation
routes. This movement out of Biggs and into surrounding cities has impacted the city’s ability to
                                                  retain existing businesses and entice new
                                                  business opportunities. Additional factors,
                                                  including a decline in the overall numbers of small
                                                  businesses due to the growth of larger chain
                                                  stores, the trend toward larger retail operations
                                                  diversifying and centralizing operations to provide
                                                  more products at lower price points, and the
                                                  overall decline in the local, state, and national
                                                  economies, have hurt the city’s commercial core
                                                  as many local businesses have closed or moved
                                                  out of the city, which has led to a decline in Biggs’
                                                  once bustling downtown commercial core.

                          ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
Land Availability and Configuration
Biggs has maintained its compact, low-density form since the time of its initial incorporation.
While this has resulted in the retention of many of the key elements that make the city the
special place it is for its residents, the lack of options for the location of new commercial and
nonresidential land uses may be a contributing factor to the declining health of the city’s
economic base. Because the city has limited options for the location of business opportunities
and because the land options that are located in Biggs may not be financially viable, readily
available, or configured to accommodate a changing market environment, new businesses have
sought other locations where land costs, land availability, and site suitability issues do not
present the constraints that exist in the city today.
Utility and Infrastructure
Historically, Biggs has experienced various
infrastructure constraints that have placed
limitations on the potential for new businesses to
locate in the city. Issues such a low water
pressures and a constrained wastewater system
have not provided an incentive for economic
opportunity. Over the past decade, the city has
successfully completed numerous major
infrastructure improvement projects that have
addressed these issues. These efforts have
resulted in a changed condition of the city’s
infrastructure system, which is now able to
support new demands and opportunities that may present themselves. Additionally, the city is
in a unique position of being a direct provider of electric power to city residents and businesses.
The city should seek to leverage its ability to provide electric power and competitive market
rates along with the recent improvements to the city’s utility infrastructure to capture economic
opportunities that were not available in years past.

                       APPENDIX A – GLOSSARY
DEFINITIONS OF SPECIALIZED TERMS
This glossary provides definitions of common planning terms used in the General Plan. The
definitions may be used to interpret language in the General Plan, but shall not be interpreted
as policies, standards, or guidelines.
Arterial. A roadway with a primary function of allowing the movement of large volumes of
traffic between freeways and other arterials. Arterials generally provide four travel lanes and
may provide on-street parking. Bike lanes, medians, park strips, sidewalks, and transit facilities
are also accommodated within the right-of-way, but driveways are limited.
Attainment Status. The California Air Resources Board is required to designate areas of the state
as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassified with respect to applicable standards. An
“attainment” designation for an area signifies that pollutant concentrations did not violate the
applicable standard in that area. A “nonattainment” designation indicates that a pollutant
concentration violated the applicable standard at least once, excluding those occasions when a
violation was caused by an exceptional event, as defined in the criteria.
Bicycle Lane (Class II facility). A restricted right-of-way designated for the exclusive or semi-
exclusive use of bicycles with through travel by motor vehicles or pedestrians prohibited, but
with vehicle parking and cross flows by pedestrians and motorists permitted. Bicycle lanes
typically have a 5-foot striped and signed lane.
Bicycle Path (Class I facility). A separated facility designed for the exclusive use of bicycles and
pedestrians with minimal cross flows by motorists. Class I bikeways typically have a minimum of
8 feet of pavement with 2-foot graded shoulders on either side.
Bicycle Route (Class III facility). Designated areas where bicycles share the road with other
modes of travel, such as motorized vehicles. Class III routes are typically signed as such.
Bikeways. An inclusive term for “bicycle lanes,” “bicycle paths,” and “bicycle routes.”
Buffer. An area between potentially conflicting land uses, such as agricultural and
nonagricultural uses, utilized or improved to reduce potential conflicts between the different
uses. Buffer areas may use landscaping, fencing, or other techniques to reduce potential
conflicts.
Buildout. The level of urban development when the land depicted in the General Plan Land Use
Diagram has developed to its full theoretical capacity, as projected by the assumptions
documented in Appendix D.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Legislation and corresponding procedural
components established in 1970 by the State of California to require environmental review for
discretionary projects anticipated to potentially result in adverse impacts to the environment;
State of California Public Resources Code Sections 21000—21178.
        April 2014                           AA-3                       City of Biggs General Plan

                                      APPENDIX A- GLOSSARY
Collector. A street that provides a link between local streets and arterials. Collectors provide
two travel lanes. On-street parking is generally permitted. Driveway access is allowed, but
should be minimized. Bike lanes, park strips, sidewalks, and transit facilities are also typically
accommodated within the right-of-way.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). A 24-hour energy equivalent level derived from a
variety of single-noise events, with weighting factors of 5 and 10 dBA applied to the evening (7
PM to 10 PM) and nighttime (10 PM to 7 AM) periods, respectively, to allow for the greater
sensitivity to noise during these hours.
Community Park. A multipurpose park that serves the entire community, generally designed to
provide active play opportunities for people of all ages and abilities.
Compatible (Land Use). Capable of existing together without significant conflict.
Complete Streets. Roadways designed and operated to enable all users safe and convenient
travel through all modes of transportation.
Cumulative Impact. As defined by CEQA, two or more individual effects which, when considered
together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts. The
individual effects may be changes resulting from a single project or a number of separate
projects. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant
projects taking place over a period of time.
dBA. The “A-weighted” scale for measuring sound in decibels as related to the sensitivity of the
human ear. Most measurements of noise for environmental review purposes are expressed in
dBA.
Decibel (dB). A unit used to express the relative intensity of sound. On the decibel scale, the
smallest audible sound (near total silence) is 0 db. Since the decibel scale is logarithmic, a sound
10 times more powerful is 10 dB and a sound 100 times more powerful is 20 dB.
Density, Gross. The number of dwelling units per gross acre of developable land designated for
residential uses on the General Plan Land Use Diagram.
Development. Any construction activity or alteration of the landscape, its terrain, contour, or
vegetation, including the erection or alteration of single or multiple structures and any grading.
Dwelling Unit (du). A room or group of internally connected rooms that have sleeping, cooking,
eating, and sanitation facilities, but not more than one kitchen, which constitute an independent
housekeeping unit, occupied by or intended for one household on a long-term basis. Types of
housing units include single-family housing, two-family housing/duplexes, multi-family housing,

                       APPENDIX A – GLOSSARY
Environmental Impact Report (EIR). A report on the effect of a proposed development proposal
or other major action that could significantly affect the environment. The report consists of an
inventory of existing environmental conditions, projected impacts of development, and
mitigation for significant adverse impacts. A general plan EIR is necessarily more general, or
programmatic, than a site-specific EIR.
Flood, 100-Year. In any given year, a flood that has a 1 percent likelihood of occurring and is
recognized as a standard for acceptable risk.
Floodplain. The relatively level land area on either side of the banks of a stream regularly
subject to flooding.
Floor Area Ratio (FAR). The ratio between the gross floor area of structures on a site and the
gross site area, used to express the intensity of use on the lot. For example, a two-story building
covering 50 percent of its site would have a FAR of 1.0, and a 0.5 FAR can describe a single-story
building that covers half of a lot and a two-story building covering approximately one-quarter of
a lot.
General Plan. A jurisdiction’s constitutional document regarding its future development. The
general plan is a legal document, with supporting maps and diagrams, required of each local
agency by the California Government Code Section 65301. In California, the general plan has
seven mandatory elements (circulation, conservation, housing, land use, noise, open space, and
public safety) and may include any number of optional elements the jurisdiction deems
important.
Greenhouse Gas. Greenhouse gases include, but are not limited to, carbon dioxide, methane,
nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
Groundwater. Water that exists beneath the earth’s surface, typically found between saturated
soils and rock, and used to supply wells and springs.
Household. One or more persons operating as a single housekeeping unit.
Impact Fee. A fee charged to a developer by a jurisdiction according to the proposed
development project, typically by number of units, square footage, or acreage. The fee is used
to offset costs incurred by the municipality for infrastructure such as schools, roads, police and
fire stations, sewers, and parks.
Infill Development. Development that occurs on vacant or partially developed land within areas
that are already largely developed and served by public infrastructure.
L eq , Equivalent Sound Level. A single measure, in dBA, of average acoustic energy level used to
represent fluctuating sound levels over a specific period of time.

county that reviews and evaluates all proposals for formation of special districts, incorporation
of cities, annexation to special districts or cities, consolidation of districts, and mergers of
districts with cities. LAFCo commissions are empowered to approve, disapprove, or conditionally
approve such proposals.
Mixed Use. Any mixture of land uses, such as mixtures of residences with commercial, offices
with retail, or visitor accommodation with offices and retail. As distinguished from single-use
land use designations, mixed-use designations authorize a variety of uses for buildings and sites
in a particular area.

amenities.
Noise Contour. A mapping technique connecting points of equal or constant noise level as
measured on the same scale.
Noise-Sensitive Land Uses. Land uses for which noise exposure could cause health-related risks
to individuals or where quiet is essential to the use. Land uses identified in Biggs as being noise-
sensitive include most types of residences, nursing homes, day-care centers, hospitals, schools,
parks, and places of assembly, such as theaters, churches, and meeting halls.
Nonconforming Use. Land uses, structures, and parcels that were legally established under past
building or zoning regulations, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted
differently under the terms of current regulations.
Open Space. Land in a predominantly undeveloped condition, often designated for conservation
and protection of resources that include natural environment and habitat, water corridors,
parkland, and scenic vistas.
Parcel. A lot or tract of land shown on a subdivision, assessor’s, or plat map.
Planning Area. All land within the city limits, land within the City’s designated Sphere of
Influence (SOI), and other land in unincorporated Butte County outside of these boundaries
which, in the City’s judgment, relates to the City’s planning efforts.
Policy. A statement that guides decision-makers in reviewing development proposals and
making other decisions.

                        APPENDIX A – GLOSSARY
Sense of Place. The characteristics of a location that contribute to its unique identity and make
it readily recognizable and distinct.
Sensitive Receptors (Air Quality). Members of the population who are most sensitive to air
pollution, including children, the elderly, the acutely ill, and the chronically ill. The term
“sensitive receptors” can also refer to the land use categories where these people live or spend
a significant amount of time. Such areas include residences, schools, playgrounds, child-care
centers, hospitals, retirement homes, and convalescent homes.
Special-Status Species. Special-status species are commonly characterized as species that are at
potential risk or actual risk to their persistence in a given area or across their native habitat
(locally, regionally, or nationally) and are identified by a state or federal resources agency as
such. Risk factors to a species’ persistence or a population’s persistence include, but are not
limited to, habitat loss, increased mortality factors, invasive species, and environmental toxins.
Specific Plan. Under Article 8 of the Government Code (Section 65450 et seq.), a legal tool for
detailed design and implementation of a defined portion of the area covered by a general plan.
A specific plan may include all detailed regulations, conditions, programs, and/or proposed
legislation that may be necessary or convenient for the systematic implementation of any
general plan element(s).

•    Allowable land uses
•    Intensity or density of development
•    Height, bulk, and placement of structures
•    Parking
•    Signage
•    Environmental resources
•    Historic and cultural resources
