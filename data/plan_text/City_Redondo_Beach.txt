2.1 LAND USE
2.1.1 Land Use Policy
Overview of Land Use Policy
The Land Use Section of the General Plan establishes goals, objectives, policies, and
implementation programs to guide the manner in which new development will occur and
existing uses will be conserved in the City of Redondo Beach.
In general, these are structured at two levels: a) policies which pertain to the City at-large
and b) policies which pertain only to specific sub-areas or portions of the City. The policies
are defined to address the nine following fundamental issues:
a. What types of land uses should be permitted in the City of Redondo Beach?
b. How should the land uses be distributed throughout the City?
d. In each of the City's land use districts, what should be their functional role, what uses
    should be permitted, and what should be their physical form and character?
e. What mechanisms can be used to increase the supply of housing units affordable for
    very low, low, and moderate income households?
f.  How should existing uses which are inconsistent with an area's objectives be maintained
    or replaced?
g. How can the City's properties, structures, and public open spaces be designed to provide
    a high quality image and character for the City?
h. How can compatibility be ensured between land uses characterized by differing
    functions and intensities?
i.  What mechanisms can be used to maintain the quality of the City's built environment?
j.  What mechanisms can be used to ensure the maintenance of environmental quality in
    the City?
                                           2-1                                     5/6/08
In response to these issues, the Land Use policy recognizes that the basic pattern of land
uses of the City of Redondo Beach are established and provides for their continuation into
the future. With few undeveloped parcels remaining, the policy defines the manner in
which existing uses can be maintained and future development will be infilled to be
compatible with these.
Fundamentally, the Land Use policy will:
a. retain existing residential neighborhoods and principal commercial districts, allowing
     for infill development and recycling for uses which are comparable in function and
     scale to existing development;
b. allow for the modest intensification of selected “key” sites which are economically
     underutilized or contain “marginal” uses, have the potential for achieving significant
     benefits to the City, and can be designed to be compatible with adjacent uses; and
c. allow for a change of use on selected sites to improve their economic viability and
     compatibility with adjacent uses.
The Land Use policy provides for a pattern and form of development which will maintain
and enhance distinct residential neighborhoods and commercial and industrial corridors and
districts. These will be differentiated by their functional role, uses, density/intensity of
development, and design characteristics. Residential neighborhoods throughout the City
will be maintained at essentially their existing scale and density. New housing will occur as
replacement or infill within the context of densities which have been confirmed by City
policy in recent years. Opportunities for increased residential development are provided for
at a number of specifically targeted sites to achieve recycling objectives on a special
pedestrian-oriented community character (as subsequently discussed) and for seniors and
affordable units.
The fundamental pattern of commercial districts will be maintained. As examples, the
Galleria at South Bay will be maintained as a regionally-oriented commercial center and the
Riviera Village will be maintained as a local-oriented, pedestrian-scaled specialty
commercial center.
At a number of sites, the Plan provides for a change from the existing pattern and intensity
of uses. Properties containing existing development which is economically obsolete are
targeted for redevelopment for another use. The recommended use has been selected to
account for its compatibility with adjacent uses and the community character and potential
for achieving economic benefits for the City. The Ruxton Avenue industrial area is an
example of an area so designated.
                                            2-2                                    5/6/08

Changes in the pattern of development are also recommended to achieve greater economic
viability and character along extended strip corridors containing an undifferentiated and
unfocused variety (or “hodge-podge”) of existing development. This is a particular problem
in Redondo Beach where most of the commercial development is located along the City's
arterial corridors (Pacific Coast Highway, Artesia Boulevard, and Aviation Boulevard).
Economic market analyses indicates that viable and healthy commercial development needs
to be focused in definable and focused clusters, rather than spread continuously along
corridors. In response, the Plan provides two policy mechanisms: a) Re-differentiation of
the corridors into pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use, high activity, and general automobile
oriented segments and b) recycling of selected properties for residential development. To
stimulate the latter, residential densities are permitted which are somewhat higher than those
allowed in other areas of the City.
A land use concept new to the City of Redondo Beach is the development of parcels for
mixed commercial and residential use. This would, normally, involve the development of
structures wherein commercial and parking uses are incorporated on the lower floors above
which residential units are located.
This form of development was a staple during the formative years of the nation, where
merchants lived above their ground floor retail. It has re-emerged as a viable planning and
development concept in recent years, as a means to a) reduce vehicular trips and associated
air pollution, providing housing opportunities in proximity to jobs, b) establish active,
pedestrian-oriented districts which enhance the quality of life and vitality of the city, and c)
increase the supply of moderately priced and affordable housing, without increasing the
densities of traditional residential neighborhoods.
While the Plan does not mandate the development of mixed-use structures, it does permit
them in a number of key activity areas of the City. These locations include the western
segment of Artesia Boulevard, Torrance Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway intersection,
and southern segment of Pacific Coast Highway.
The Plan provides for the continuing long-term use of the Redondo Beach Pier and King
Harbor areas for coastal-related recreational, marine, and commercial uses. It acknowledges
and endorses the recent planning efforts by the City for the Pier's reconstruction and
restoration as an amenity which can be used year-round by residents, as well as visitors to
the City. Potential aesthetic and land use improvements, including more effective
consolidation of development, are suggested for long-term consideration for the land areas
of King Harbor.
Policy provides for the retention of lands for public (parks, schools, and governmental
administration and capital), transportation (highways and railroad corridors), and utility
(electrical generating plants and transmission corridors) uses and facilities. In recognition
that the facility needs and programs of these public uses may change over time, the Plan
                                              2-3                                   5/6/08

provides for the re-planning, re-use and redevelopment of these properties and facilities as
they may become surplus and available.
2.1.2 Land Use Policy Buildout Estimate
Development in accordance with the Land Use Plan would result in an 18 percent increase
in residential units (5,062 units) of which 571 units would be single-family and 4,491 units
would be multi-family. Approximately 34 percent of the multi-family units (1,541) would
occur in mixed-use development integrating residential with commercial.
All categories of commercial use would experience a 29 percent increase, or approximately
1,818,935 square feet additional. An estimated 23 percent of the total commercial space
could be developed as a component of mixed-use developments if all areas designated for
this use were to be fully developed for this purpose.
Industrial development would increase by approximately 29 percent. This represents an
additional 1,863,184 square feet of development.
These estimates represent the maximum amount of development which could occur if all
properties in the City were to be developed for the uses and densities prescribed by the Plan.
To a certain extent, these are theoretical maximums, as many parcels which are developed at
densities below those permitted are occupied by physically stable and economically viable
uses which are unlikely to be recycled.
Table 1 indicates the estimated maximum amount of development which would occur in
each general land use category and the changes from the existing level of development.
2.1.3 Land Use Policy Map
The key component of the Land Use policy is the attached Land Use Plan map (Figure 4)
which depicts the permitted land use of all lands within the City of Redondo Beach. These
are designated by categories of residential, commercial, mixed residential and commercial,
industrial, and public use which are differentiated by the specific uses and
denisties/intensities permitted.

A summary of the land use classifications and building density allowances contained within
the plan is attached (Table 2). They are defined to account for the textual policies and
standards contained in the subsequent sub-section of this Element. It should be noted that
the Land Use Plan map must be used in concert with the policies, as the latter often
prescribes development standards and requirements in greater detail than the map
designations (e.g., limitations on building height). Land use classifications used in the
General Plan may not directly correspond to those of the zoning ordinance.
Residential density limitations are measured by the number of units permitted on a net acre
and minimum parcel size. Commercial and industrial density limitations are measured by
the ratio determined by dividing the building area by the size of the lot. For example a floor
area ratio of 1.0 would result by the development of a 20,000 square foot building on a
20,000 square foot site (i.e., 20,000 ÷ 20,000 = 1.0).
Though not previously used by the City of Redondo Beach, the floor area ratio (FAR) is
commonly used throughout the state and is a means to satisfy legislative requirements to
establish density limits on commercial properties, comparable to those traditionally imposed
on residential. FAR limitations are usually related to impacts on traffic and public services
and alone do not necessarily imply the resulting bulk and height. For example, as illustrated
in the diagram, a constant FAR of 1.0 may result in a one-story building on 100 percent of a
site, a two-story building on 50 percent of the site, or a four-story building on 25 percent of
the site.

Issue     HOW SHOULD LAND USES BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE
          CITY?
Goal      It shall be the goal of the City of Redondo Beach to:
                                           2-17                                   5/6/08

1F           Maintain the fundamental pattern of existing land uses, preserving residential
             neighborhoods and commercial and industrial districts, while providing
             opportunities for intensification or reuse of selected sub-areas which improve
             the definition of centers of community activity and identity.
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.10         Provide for new land use development and adaptive reuse which is reflective of
             and complements the overall pattern and scale of existing development, infills
             vacant and underutilized parcels, and offers the opportunity for the evolution
             and intensification and/or reuse of selected sub-areas as distinctly identifiable
             activity centers of the City.
Policies It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.10.1       Accommodate existing land uses and new development in accordance with the
             Land Use Plan map of the General Plan (I1.1).
1.10.2       Permit the adjustment of land use classification boundaries to coincide with
             legal parcel boundaries, provided that land use compatibility is maintained, the
             integrity of each land use district is maintained, and adverse impacts (traffic,
             noise, etc.) of the boundary adjustment do not result or can be adequately
             mitigated (I1.1, I1.2).
1.10.3       Permit the establishment of mixed-use zones where appropriate to provide
             flexibility in the boundary line between zones with different land use
             classifications in order to permit creative solutions for establishing compatibility
             between the differing uses (I1.1).
Issue        WHAT SHOULD BE THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE, PERMITTED USES,
             AND PHYSICAL FORM AND CHARACTER OF THE CITY'S LAND
             USE DISTRICTS?
             RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
Goal         It shall be the goal of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1G           Maintain existing residential neighborhoods and provide opportunities for the
             development of additional housing to provide for the diverse needs of the
             population.
SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
Historically, Redondo Beach has been mostly a low density, single-family residential
community. While some areas have transitioned to multiple-family development, the areas
                                              2-18                                    5/6/08
that have remained "R-1" are now firmly established as permanent single-family
neighborhoods. It is the intent of the General Plan to preserve these traditional
single-family areas, and to institute protections regarding the character and quality of new
development.
                                           2-19                                  5/6/08
Objective  It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.11       Provide for the retention and maintenance of residential neighborhoods which
           are primarily developed with single-family houses and ensure that new
           development is compatible with the character of evolving neighborhoods.
Policies   It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
Permitted Uses, Density, and Height
1.11.1     Accommodate the development of single-family residential units at a maximum
           density of 8.8 units per net acre on parcels of a minimum of 5,000 square feet
           and height of 30 feet (two stories) in areas designated as “R-1." Accommodate
           the development of single-family units on existing legal parcels of less than
           5,000 square feet.(I1.1, I1.2).
1.11.2     Accommodate the development of single-family residential units at a maximum
           density of 17.5 units per net acre on parcels of a minimum of 2,500 square feet
           and height of 30 feet (two stories) in areas designated as “R-1-A."
           Accommodate the development of single-family units on existing legal parcels
           of less than 2,500 square feet.(I1.1, I1.2).
           Design and Development
1.11.3     Require that projects be designed and developed to achieve a high level of

           (1.55.1+), streetscape and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of differing uses
           (1.57+), and physical and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I1.1, I1.10, I 1.18).
1.11.4     Require that new residential development be compatible with evolving
           neighborhoods, utilizing design considerations such as:
           a. use of complementary building materials, colors, and forms, while allowing
               flexibility for distinguished design solutions; and
           b. limitation of building volume and bulk so that it does not adversely affect
               the character of evolving neighborhoods (I1.1, I1.10, I1.18).
1.11.5     Require that single-family residential units and sites be designed to convey a
           high level of quality and character, utilizing design considerations such as:

             b. incorporation of a well-defined roofline;
             c. inclusion of recessed entries and/or porches;
             d. use of extensive site landscape to complement the architectural design of the
                 structure;
             e. minimization of amount and width of the paving of front yards for driveway
                 and garage access; and
             f. location and design of garages so that they do not dominate the street
                 frontage, except in areas designated as “R-1-A” (I1.1, I1.10, I1.18).
1.11.6       Require, in areas where alleys currently exist and driveways from the street
             frontage have not been developed on a significant number of parcels, that
             parking access be from these unless infeasible (I1.1).
1.11.7       Allow the incorporation of a third parking space, developed in tandem, in an
             enclosed garage for larger residential units (I1.1).
               LOW            DENSITY              MULTI-FAMILY               RESIDENTIAL
NEIGHBORHOODS
These areas, designated "R-2" and "R-3," are intended to accommodate multiple-unit
housing developments, while still maintaining a lower density character. The maximum
"R-2" density of 14.6 units per acre allows two units on a 6,000 square foot lot, and the
maximum "R-3" density of 17.5 units per acre allows two units on a 5,000 square foot lot.
Most of these areas were originally developed with single-family homes and have been
allowed to transition to two or three condominium units on a lot to encourage revitalization
and to meet a diversity of housing needs. Even though multi-family development is
permitted, it is desired to maintain a lower density, single-family type of character through
architectural design and limits on density.
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.12         Provide for the retention and maintenance of the existing scale and character of
             multi-family residential neighborhoods which are characterized by a
             predominance of one- and two-story attached units, duplexes, and
             condominiums.
                                              2-21                                  5/6/08

Policies It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
Permitted Uses, Density, and Height
1.12.1       Accommodate the development of multi-family residential units at a maximum
             density of 14.6 units per net acre on parcels of a minimum of 6,000 square feet
             and height of 30 feet (two stories) in areas designated as “R-2." Accommodate
             the development of single-family units on existing legal parcels of less than
             6,000 square feet (I1.1, I1.2).
1.12.2       Accommodate the development of multi-family residential units at a maximum
             density of 17.5 units per net acre on parcels of a minimum of 5,000 square feet
             and height of 30 feet (two stories) in areas designated as “R-3." Accommodate
             the development of single-family units on existing legal parcels of less than
             5,000 square feet (I1.1, I1.2).
1.12.3       Prohibit the consolidation of parcels to create large scale building masses and
             volumes in areas designated as “R-2” and “R-3," except that consolidation of
             parcels shall be allowed in areas designated "R-3" west of Pacific Coast
             Highway provided that the front-facing street frontage of the consolidated lots
             does not exceed 100 linear feet (I1.1, I1.2).
Design and Development
1.12.4       Require that projects be designed and developed to achieve a high level of
             quality and distinctive character in accordance with the policies which pertain to
             the use and/or site for architecture (1.53.1+), signage (1.54.1+), site design
             (1.55.1+), streetscape and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of differing uses
             (1.57+), and physical and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I1.1, I1.10, I 1.18).
1.12.5       Require that residential projects be designed to convey the visual character of
             single-family residential neighborhoods and a high quality character, utilizing
             design considerations such as:
             a. maintenance of a front yard setback comparable to single-family residential
                 neighborhoods;
             b. location of the elevation of the first occupiable floor at or in proximity to the
                 predominant grade elevation, precluding the visibility of subterranean
                 parking along the street elevation;
             c. use of building materials, colors, and forms which complement the
                 neighborhood, while allowing flexibility for distinguished design solutions;
                                             2-22                                    5/6/08

             d. modulation and articulation of all building elevations, conveying the visual
                 character of individual units rather than a singular building mass and
                 volume;
             e. use of a well-defined roofline;
             f. inclusion of separate and well-defined entries on the exterior building facade
                 for each residential unit which are designed to convey the visual character of
                 individual identity;
             g. inclusion of recessed entries and/or porches; and
             h. siting and design of parking areas and facilities to be integrated with and not
                 dominate the architectural character of the structure;
             i. use of extensive site landscape; and
             j. minimization of amount and width of the paving of front yards for driveway
                 and garage access (I1.1, I1.7, I1.18).
             MEDIUM DENSITY MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL
             NEIGHBORHOODS
These areas, designated "RMD" are intended to provide more affordable multiple-family
housing opportunities, including both apartments and condominiums. The maximum
density of 23.3 units per acre allows up to four units on a 7,500 square foot lot.
One of the major concerns expressed in the development of the General Plan was
controlling residential density levels. Because of this, the "RMD" designation was only
applied to areas mostly built out at an overall density exceeding 23.3 units per acre.
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.13         Provide for the retention, maintenance, and development of multi-family
             residential units which convey a distinctive residential neighborhood quality.
Policies     It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
Permitted Uses, Density, and Height
1.13.1       Accommodate the development of multi-family residential units at a maximum
             density of 23.3 units per net acre on parcels of a minimum of 5,000 square feet
             and a maximum height of 30 feet (two stories) in areas designated as “RMD."
             Accommodate the development of single-family units on existing legal parcels
             of less than 5,000 square feet (I1.1, I1.2).
                                              2-23                                  5/6/08

           the use and/or site for architecture (1.53.1+), signage (1.54.1+), site design
           (1.55.1+), streetscape and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of differing uses
           (1.57+), and physical and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I1.1, I1.10, I 1.18).
1.13.3     Require that multi-family residential projects be designed to convey a high
           quality and distinctive neighborhood character, in accordance with Policy
           1.12.5 and the following modifications:
           a. maintenance of a landscaped front yard setback in accordance with
               sub-section “a,” though not necessarily to the depth or standards typical of a
               single-family neighborhood;
           b. inclusion of recessed entries and/or porches for each unit (in accordance
               with sub-section “g”) are encouraged, but not mandated; and
           c. inclusion of separate and well-defined entries to convey the visual character
               of individual identity for each residential unit, which may be developed from
               interior courtyards and common areas, rather than exterior facades (I1.1,
               I1.10, I1.18).
1.13.4     Require the provision of on-site open space amenities and design of these to be
           accessible and of sufficient size to be usable by tenants (I1.1).
                                           2-24                                   5/6/08

               HIGH DENSITY MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
These areas, designated "RH," allow higher density multiple-family housing at a maximum
density of 28 units per acre. The areas designated "RH" are located along certain portions
of Pacific Coast Highway. These areas were previously zoned commercial, but were
determined to have potential for higher density residential development. Reference should
be made to Pacific Coast Highway, Sub-Areas 5 and 6 for more details regarding the
reasons for designating these areas "RH."
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.14         Provide for the retention, maintenance, and development of high density
             multi-family residential units to provide for the housing needs of existing and
             future populations, including the children of existing residents and retired heads
             of household, and which convey a distinctive residential neighborhood quality.
Policies It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
             Permitted Uses, Density, and Height
1.14.1       Accommodate the development of multi-family townhomes, condominiums,
             and apartments at a maximum density of 28 units per net acre and a maximum
             height of 35 feet and (three stories) or 30 feet and two stories (as specified) in
             areas designated as “RH." (I1.1, I1.2).
             Design and Development
1.14.2       Require that projects be designed and developed to achieve a high level of
             quality and distinctive character, and compatibility with existing uses and
             development in accordance with the policies which pertain to the use and/or site
             for architecture (1.53.1+), signage (1.54.1+), site design (1.55.1+), streetscape
             and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of differing uses (1.57+), and physical
             and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I1.1, I1.10, I 1.18).
1.14.3       Require that multi-family residential projects be designed to convey a high
             quality and distinctive neighborhood character, in accordance with Policy
             1.13.3 (I1.1, I1.10, I1.18).

             COMMERCIAL AND INTEGRATED COMMERCIAL AND
             RESIDENTIAL MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT
Goal         It shall be the goal of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1H           Continue and enhance existing commercial districts which contribute revenue to
             the City and are compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods.
             ARTESIA BOULEVARD
             General Corridor
Artesia Boulevard is the main commercial corridor of North Redondo. It originally
developed as a typical "strip" commercial street with mostly one-story buildings with
adjacent surface parking. Many of the older buildings have parking located in the rear,
while more recent developments have parking located in the front and/or side.
Typical for a commercial street of its era, Artesia Boulevard still tends to be a collection of
small individual developments, many of which lack physical coordination with adjoining
properties. Because of this, a focus has been placed on revitalization through coordinated
improvements and development. The City is undertaking an ambitious improvement
program to create an attractive, coordinated appearance along the entire length of the
corridor.
In addition to establishing policies to assure quality design, the principal strategy for Artesia
Boulevard is to divide the corridor into four sub-areas. This has been done in an attempt to
change Artesia Boulevard from a long, largely undifferentiated corridor into distinct
sub-areas, each with its own functional and design emphasis. Each sub-area was developed
to be compatible with the prevailing character of existing development and to enhance
trends that were already occurring.
The implementation of these sub-areas should allow future development in each area to be
more coordinated and compatible, while creating a discernible pattern of diversity as one
travels the length of the corridor.
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.15         Provide for the evolutionary development of Artesia Boulevard into four
             distinct sub-areas which reflect and reinforce the existing primary activity areas
             and adjacent land uses, are oriented and accessible to the needs of nearby
             residents, and differentiated by use, density/intensity, and physical form and
             character.
                                              2-26                                   5/6/08
2-27 5/6/0
         Policies    It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
       Function and Permitted Uses
1.15.1 Accommodate land uses and provide for a physical form and scale of
       development which differentiates Artesia Boulevard into the four following
       sub-areas:
       a. East of Ruxton Lane: developed as a higher intensity transitional area to the
           Galleria at South Bay (Sub-Area 1);
       b. Phelan Lane to Rindge Lane: developed as a pedestrian-oriented
           community-serving commercial “village” (Sub-Area 2);
       c. Blossom Lane to west of Flagler Lane: developed as a mixed-use node,
           integrating residential with community-serving commercial uses (Sub-Area
           3); and
       d. Remaining areas: mix of highway- and community-oriented commercial
           uses (Sub-Area 4) (I1.1).
1.15.2 Publicly initiate and allow for the private sector development of municipal or
       shared parking lots, which incorporate bicycle storage facilities, along the street
       frontages to provide for joint use of adjacent commercial properties and allow
       for the incorporation of commercial uses into the structure along the street
       frontage (except for areas required for access) (I1.1, I1.16).
1.15.3 Provide for the continued use of existing parking lots which extend to Mathews
       Avenue and Vanderbilt Lane, ensuring their compatibility with adjacent
       residences (I1.1).
       Design and Development
1.15.4 Implement the Artesia/Inglewood Public Improvement Project, including the
       incorporation of street trees, landscape (planters), street furniture (benches, trash
       receptacles, newsracks, etc.), street and crosswalk paving, lighting, public
       signage, and other appropriate elements (I1.17).
1.15.5 Improve the design and landscape of the Artesia Boulevard median (I 1.17).
1.15.6 Install signage or other visual elements to distinctly identify the entries to the
       Artesia Boulevard commercial corridor (I1.17).
                                       2-28                                     5/6/08

1.15.7       Integrate improvements which facilitate transit use of Artesia Boulevard, such
             as bus shelters and recessed access points (I1.17).
1.15.8       Require that the renovation of existing structures or new development on sites
             where parking lots currently extend to Mathews Avenue and Vanderbilt Lane
             restrict their access to Artesia Boulevard, unless there are no feasible
             alternatives, and that areas facing, abutting, or exposed to residential areas be
             extensively landscaped to include a screen wall incorporating evergreen plant
             material (covering a majority of the wall within a one year period) (I1.1).
1.15.9       Require that projects be designed and developed to achieve a high level of
             quality and distinctive character in accordance with the policies which pertain to
             the use and/or site for architecture (1.53.1+), signage (1.54.1+), site design
             (1.55.1+), streetscape and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of differing uses
             (1.57+), and physical and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I1.1, I1.10, I 1.18).
             Sub-Area 1: Galleria at South Bay Transitional Area-East of Ruxton Lane
Compared to the rest of the Artesia Boulevard corridor, the Galleria presents a substantial
contrast in the character and scale of development. In recognition of this, the area
immediately to the west of the Galleria, designated "C-4," is intended to function as a
transitional area between the Galleria and the Artesia corridor. The area's nearness to the
Galleria Transit Station and the general higher level of activity in the vicinity makes a
higher intensity of development (1.0 maximum floor area ratio) in this area appropriate and
compatible.
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.16         Provide for the development of the parcels east of the hypothetical northern
             extension of Ruxton Lane corridor for uses which are transitional to (in type and
             scale) the Galleria at South Bay.
Policies     It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
             Permitted Uses
1.16.1       Accommodate a mix of retail and service commercial, household supply and
             furnishings, eating and drinking establishments, food sales, drug stores,
             professional offices, art and cultural facilities, overnight accommodations, and
             similar uses which serve local and regional residents on parcels designated as
             “C-4” (I1.1).
                                              2-29                                 5/6/08

            Density/Intensity and Height
1.16.2      Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 1.0 and
            height of three stories (45 feet) (I1.1).
            Design and Development
1.16.3      Require that building elevations above the second floor be set back from the
            street facing facade for the first 30 feet of property depth to minimize impacts of
            height and bulk on abutting sidewalks and streets (I1.1).
1.16.4      Establish physical and visual streetscape connections to the South Bay Galleria,
            which may include consistent street trees, signage, lighting, and other distinctive
            elements (I1.1, I1.17).
            Sub-Area 2:         Pedestrian-Oriented, Community-Serving Commercial
            Center-Phelan to Rindge Lane
This three-block section in the central portion of the corridor has been designated as an area
with a "pedestrian-oriented" design character ("C-2-PD").                     As it implies,
"pedestrian-oriented" design is intended to create an environment that will foster pedestrian
circulation among businesses once a person has arrived in the area. Pedestrian-oriented
areas are considered to be desirable in certain locations both as a means to provide diversity
in design character and to provide a different type of shopping experience and environment.
Pedestrian-orientation is accomplished through policies related to design and permitted uses.
In terms of design, buildings are to be located close to the sidewalk to provide interest and
stimulation to pedestrians, and to de-emphasize the presence of autos. Design details such
as signs and windows are also specifically geared to the pedestrian view.
In terms of uses, emphasis is placed on commercial businesses that are not strictly
destination-oriented, or uses that can generate walk-in business. Typical examples would
include book stores, apparel stores, specialty retail, restaurants and food stores. Offices,
                                            2-30                                    5/6/08
which tend to be more destination-oriented, are only allowed toward the rear or above the
ground floor of buildings.
It is important in pedestrian-oriented areas for adjoining developments to be designed in a
coordinated manner that will promote a continuation of pedestrian circulation along the
street and between the developments. Related to this, pedestrian-oriented areas usually need
to be confined to a somewhat limited area since persons are generally not willing to
circulate long distances on foot (i.e. more than a few blocks from where they have parked).
A final criteria is that an area should already possess some of the elements that are reflective
of pedestrian-orientation. In the case of this segment of Artesia Boulevard, a large
proportion of the existing buildings are situated close to the sidewalk. In addition, the
character of many of the businesses are compatible with pedestrian-oriented areas. Because
of this, future development should work together with existing development to promote and
enhance a pedestrian-oriented character.
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.17         Provide for the development of uses which predominantly serve and are
             accessible to local residents, create a distinctive pedestrian activity area of the
             City, and are compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods.
Policies     It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
             Permitted Uses
1.17.1       Accommodate a mix of commercial uses which provide for the needs of nearby
             residents (as defined by Policy 1.16.1) and enhance pedestrian activity on
             parcels designated as “C-2-PD” (I1.1).
1.17.2       Accommodate professional, finance, insurance, real estate, and other offices at
             the rear or on the second level of structures whose ground floor frontage is
             occupied by pedestrian-active retail or similar uses on parcels designated as
             “C-2-PD” (I1.1).
1.17.3       Encourage the development of outdoor dining and other similar uses which do
             not impede pedestrian circulation on the sidewalks (I1.1).
             Density/Intensity and Height
1.17.4       Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 0.5 and
             height of two stories (30 feet) (I1.1).
                                              2-31                                  5/6/08

       Design and Development
1.17.5 Require that buildings be sited and designed to enhance pedestrian activity
       along the sidewalks, including the following standards:
       a. siting of a minimum of 50% of the linear frontage of the building within
          proximity to the sidewalk to maintain a “building wall” character, except for
          areas contiguous with the structure used for outdoor dining or courtyards;
       b. assurance that the front setbacks are visually and physically accessible to
          pedestrians, except as may be required for security;
       c. incorporation of landscape (hardscape and softscape) which visually
          distinguishes the site and structure (planted beds, planters, window boxes,
          and other elements);
       d. provision of visually and physically transparent building elements
          (windows, door, etc.) along the majority of the ground elevation;
       e. incorporation of arcades and other recesses along the street elevation to
          provide visual relief and interest;
       f. extensive articulation of the building facade and use of multiple building
          volumes and planes;
       g. use of roofline and height variations to break up the massing and provide
          visual interest;
       h. visual differentiation of upper from lower floors;
       i. distinct treatment of building entrances; and
       j. use of pedestrian-oriented projecting and other signage (I1.1, I1.7, I 1.18).
                                      2-32                                   5/6/08

             Sub-Area 3: Mixed-Use Corridor-Blossom to West of Flagler Lane
This is one of several areas within the City that has been designated for "mixed use." The
mixed use designation permits commercial development by itself (and is therefore a
commercial designation), but also permits the option of constructing residential units on the
upper floors of a development with commercial uses on the ground floor. To complement
the incorporated residential units, an emphasis is placed on a "pedestrian-oriented" character
of the commercial component as described under the preceding sub-area.
The concept of mixing commercial and residential uses has been gaining in popularity in
many cities. Traditional planning practice has dictated that residential uses should be
physically separated and buffered from other types of "conflicting" uses. More recent
experience, however, has shown that when properly planned and designed, mixed use
developments can create a unique and positive environment for residents and businesses
alike.
In mixed use developments, residential units are located and designed to provide sufficient
privacy and security, while commercial uses are located and designed to provide easy
accessibility and good visibility to the public.
While separated in this manner, the two types of uses also enjoy the benefits of their mutual
proximity. For residents, they have the convenience and added dimension of having
desirable retail businesses within a short walk. For businesses, they can draw vitality from
having a "round-the-clock" source of patronage. This adds a type of "energy" to a
development that would not exist if it were strictly commercial.
There are also several other potential benefits of mixed use development. These include (1)
enhancing the opportunities for redevelopment of an area that may be currently lacking in
vitality; (2) introducing a new and interesting form of development into the city; (3)
                                            2-33                                  5/6/08
increasing affordable housing opportunities and providing an alternative type of housing;
and (4) helping to curb traffic congestion by decreasing the need for automobile trips.
This segment of Artesia Boulevard was designated for mixed use primarily because it is in
substantial need of revitalization, and mixed use is viewed as a viable means of achieving
this. Within this area only ("MU-1"), an option has also been provided for strictly
residential development, provided that the entire side of a block is developed for this use.
This is intended to provide yet another option for the revitalization of this area.
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.18         Provide for the development of local-serving pedestrian-oriented commercial
             uses and integration of multi-family residential on the upper floors or in
             intervening clusters along the corridor, provided that they are compatible with
             adjacent commercial uses.

           density of 35 units per net acre and three stories (45 feet) provided that the
           entire designated block frontage is developed for this use (I 1.1).
Design and Development
1.18.7     Require that commercial and mixed-use structures be designed to promote
           pedestrian activity in accordance with Policy 1.17.5 (I1.1, I1.7, I 1.18).
1.18.8     Require that mixed-use (commercial and residential) structures be designed to
           mitigate potential conflicts between the commercial and residential uses (e.g.,
           noise, lighting, security, and automobile access) and provide adequate amenities
           for residential occupants (I1.1, I1.7, I1.18).

1.18.11     Require that projects developed exclusively for residential use be designed and
            sited to convey a high quality character in accordance with Policy 1.13.3 (I1.1,
            I1.7, I1.18).
1.18.12     Require that sites exclusively developed for residential use provide on-site open
            space amenities which are designed and sized to be accessible to and usable by
            tenants (I1.1).
Sub-Area 4: Community- and Highway-Related Corridors-Remaining Areas
This sub-area, designated "C-2," is actually three separate segments interspersed between
the other sub-areas. This area is intended to accommodate basic "highway commercial"
development. Although this sub-area does not feature any unique standards, it helps to
create a differentiated pattern of development along the length of the Artesia Boulevard
corridor. This sub-area also provides for commercial uses such as auto-related uses and
"stand-alone" offices that are also needed to serve the full range of community needs.
Objective   It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.19        Provide for the development of uses which predominantly serve and are
            accessible to local residents and compatible with adjacent residential
            neighborhoods.
Policies    It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
            Permitted Uses
1.19.1      Accommodate a mix of retail, professional office, and similar uses in
            accordance with Policy 1.16.1 which principally provide for the needs of nearby
            residents on parcels designated as “C-2” (I1.1).
            Density/Intensity and Height
1.19.2      Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 0.5 and
            height of two stories (30 feet) (I1.1).
                                             2-36                                 5/6/08

             Design and Development
1.19.3       Require that structures sited on or within proximity to street frontage property
             lines incorporate adequate fixed and permanent landscape elements, possibly
             including planters, window boxes, or other elements (I1.1, I1.7, I1.18).
1.19.4       Require that a landscaped strip or berm, where feasible, be developed along
             property line frontages where the building is separated from the sidewalk by
             parking or an extensive setback, which shall contain trees and/or shrubs in
             addition to groundcover to provide three-dimensional visual character (I1.1,
             I1.7, I1.18).
             PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY
             General Corridor
Pacific Coast Highway is South Redondo's main commercial street and north-south artery.
Previously, almost the entire length of Pacific Coast Highway was under one commercial
zoning designation. In the development of the General Plan, one of the objectives for
Pacific Coast Highway was to differentiate sections of the corridor in terms of both the
types and intensities of uses. The intent of this strategy was to (1) provide aesthetic relief
and contrast along this long linear corridor, and (2) enhance the economic vitality of the
corridor by "breaking up" the supply of land for different uses.
The economic study prepared for the General Plan showed that there was too much
commercial development capacity in relation to forecasted demand. By changing some
portions of Pacific Coast Highway to multiple-family residential, this creates a better
balance between the supply of land and the economic demand for commercial and
residential uses.
                                           2-37                                    5/6/08
Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.20      Provide for the evolutionary development of Pacific Coast Highway into
          distinct sub-areas which reflect and reinforce the existing primary activity areas
          and adjacent land uses, are oriented and accessible to the needs of nearby
          residents, and differentiated by use, density/intensity, and physical form and
          character.
Policies  It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
          Function and Permitted Uses
1.20.1    Accommodate land uses and provide for a physical form and scale of
          development which differentiates Pacific Coast Highway into the following
          sub-areas:
          a.   East of Palos Verdes Boulevard: developed as a mixed-use node,
               integrating residential with community-serving retail and office commercial
               uses (Sub-Area 1);
          b. East side of Pacific Coast Highway, Palos Verdes Boulevard to Avenue G:
               developed as a high intensity community-serving commercial area
               (Sub-Area 2);
          c.   Avenues A through H:             developed as a low rise, low intensity
               neighborhood- and community-serving, pedestrian-oriented commercial
               “village” (Sub-Area 3);
          d. Knob Hill Avenue to Avenue A and Diamond Street to 190th/Anita Street:
               developed for community- and highway-oriented commercial uses
               (Sub-Area 4);
          e.   Garnet Street to Vincent Street: developed for higher density residential to
               “break” the continuity of the commercial corridor and provide increased
                    housing opportunities (Sub-Area 5);
          f.   Knob Hill Avenue to Ruby Street: developed for community- and
               highway-serving commercial uses or multi-family residential uses
               (Sub-Area 6);
          g. Torrance Boulevard intersection and abutting properties: developed as a
               higher intensity mixed-use node, integrating residential with
               community-serving pedestrian-oriented retail and office commercial uses
               (Sub-Area 7);
                                           2-38                                 5/6/08

            h. West side of Pacific Coast Highway, Vincent Street to Diamond Street:
                 developed as a mixed-use node, integrating residential with office and retail
                 commercial, capitalizing on its adjacency to the Civic Center (Sub-Area 8);
                 and
            i.   Anita Street/190th Street intersection: community- and highway-serving
                 commercial node (Sub-Area 9) (I1.1, I1.16).
1.20.2      Publicly initiate and allow for the private sector development of municipal or
            shared parking lots, which incorporate bicycle storage facilities, along the street
            frontages to provide for joint use of adjacent commercial properties and allow
            for the incorporation of commercial uses into the structure along the street
            frontage (except for areas required for access) (I1.1, I1.16).
            Design and Development
1.20.3      Require that projects be designed and developed to achieve a high level of
            quality and distinctive character in accordance with the policies which pertain to
            the use and/or site for architecture (1.53.1+), signage (1.54.1+), site design
            (1.55.1+), streetscape and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of differing uses
            (1.57+), and physical and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I1.1, I1.10, I 1.18).
1.20.4      Require that structures located on Pacific Coast Highway be sited and designed
            to minimize viewshed impacts from inland residential areas, as feasible (I1.1).
1.20.5      Establish and implement a comprehensive plan for the upgrade of Pacific Coast
            Highway's streetscape to incorporate street trees, landscape (planters), street
            furniture (benches, trash receptacles, newsracks, etc.), street and crosswalk
            paving, lighting, public signage, and other appropriate elements, as permitted by
            Caltrans (I1.17).
1.20.6      Install signage or other visual elements to distinctly identify the entries and
            specific districts and nodes of the Pacific Coast Highway corridor (I 1.17).
1.20.7      Integrate improvements which facilitate transit use of Pacific Coast Highway,
            such as bus shelters and recessed access points (I1.17).
            Sub-Area 1: Mixed-Use Node-Palos Verdes Boulevard and South
For a general discussion of mixed use development, see Artesia Boulevard: Sub-Area 3.
                                           2-39                                    5/6/08
This area was designated for mixed use development ("MU-3") primarily because of its
physical suitability for development of this scale. In particular, this area features lot depths
in excess of 300 feet and is adjoined to the rear by high density apartment complexes
situated at a higher elevation. Because of these factors, this area is more capable of
supporting larger scale, higher intensity development without creating undue impacts. This
fairly large area also provides a significant opportunity for the production of new affordable
multiple-family housing.
The standards for this area include a few differences from other mixed use areas. These are
(1) residential units can be developed on the ground floor of buildings located behind
buildings with ground floor commercial uses; and (2) the minimum commercial floor area
ratio of 0.3 applies only the first 130 feet of property depth. These standards were instituted
since it was not felt to be economically or physically practicable to extend commercial uses
entirely to the rear of these relatively deep sites.
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.21         Provide for the development of community-serving retail and office commercial
             and mixed-use projects integrating residential with commercial uses southeast
             of Palos Verdes Boulevard as a primary activity center of the City.
                                              2-40                                  5/6/08
Policies It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
         Permitted Uses
1.21.1   Accommodate the development of pedestrian-oriented retail, professional
         office, and related land uses as permitted by Policies 1.16.1 and 1.17.2 on
         parcels designated as “MU-3” (I1.1).
1.21.2   Accommodate residential uses according to the following standards:
         a. along the street frontage: on the second floor or higher of structures
             developed with commercial uses on the lower levels; and
         b. structures located behind street-facing mixed retail and residential buildings:
             on any floor (including the ground floor) or on the second level or higher
             with retail or parking located on the ground floor (I 1.1).
         Density/Intensity and Height
1.21.3   Permit development of sites exclusively for commercial uses to a maximum
         intensity of a floor area ratio of 1.0 and height of two stories (30 feet) (I1.1).
1.21.4   Permit the development of mixed-use structures integrating residential with
         commercial uses to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 1.5 and three
         stories (45 feet), providing that:
         a. all floor area exceeding the ratio of 0.7 is developed for residential units;
         b. the maximum residential density for “market-rate” units does not exceed 35
             units per net acre;
         c. residential densities exceeding 35 units per net acre shall be developed for
             units affordable for low and moderate income households; and
         d. a minimum floor area ratio of 0.3, applied to the first 130 feet of property
             depth from Pacific Coast Highway, is developed for commercial uses. (This
             shall not be interpreted to limit the siting of commercial uses to the first 130
             feet of lot depth) (I 1.1).
                                          2-41                                    5/6/08

       Design and Development
1.21.5 Require that commercial and mixed-use structures be designed to promote
       pedestrian activity in accordance with Policy 1.17.5 (I1.1, I1.7, I 1.18).
1.21.6 Require that mixed-use structures be designed to mitigate potential conflicts in
       accordance with Policy 1.18.8 (I1.1, I1.7, I1.18).
1.21.7 Require that new development be sited and designed to convey a “village”
       character, including the:
       a. siting of structures on common pedestrian walkways, courtyards, and other
          open spaces;
       b. incorporation of arcades and other setbacks along the street frontage;
       c. use of multiple building volumes and masses to reduce the “sense” of large
          scale “boxes” and create a visual fabric of multiple buildings;
       d. incorporation of extensive facade modulation and articulation and design
          details;
       e. use of roofline and height variations to break up massing and provide visual
          interest;
       f. use of unified architectural design styles;
       g. clear identification of building entrances;
       h. extensive use of landscape (planting beds, raised planters, containers, or
          window boxes) which provides a three-dimensional character; and
       i. use of pedestrian-oriented signage (e.g., projecting signs) (I1.1, I1.7, I 1.18).
                                      2-42                                     5/6/08

1.21.8      Require that building elevations above the second floor be set back in
            accordance with Policy 1.16.3 (I1.1).
            Sub-Area 2: High Intensity Community Commercial-East Side, Palos
            Verdes Boulevard to Avenue G
This area was designated for commercial uses ("C-4") at a higher floor area ratio (1.0)
primarily because of its relatively large parcel sizes. This should generally make it easier to
assemble sites of the size necessary to comfortably support development of this intensity.
Objective   It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.22        Provide for community- and highway-oriented commercial uses on the east side
            of Pacific Coast Highway, between Palos Verdes Boulevard and Avenue G.
                                             2-43                                 5/6/08
Policies It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:

1.22.4      Require that new development be sited and designed to convey a “village”
            character, in accordance with the requirements of Policy 1.21.7 (I1.1, I1.7,
            I1.18).
            Sub-Area 3: Low Intensity, Pedestrian-Oriented Commercial
            Village-Avenues A through H
The primary objective for this area, designated "C-2-PD," is to maintain and enhance the
modest scale, pedestrian-oriented type of development that currently exists. Along this
stretch of Pacific Coast Highway, almost all of the buildings have been built close to the
sidewalk. This situation helps to encourage pedestrian circulation along the sidewalk and
between businesses. The design and development policies for this area will assure that
future development will continue to promote and enhance the existing scale and character of
development.
                                         2-45                                  5/6/08

Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.23      Provide for community- and neighborhood-oriented commercial uses in a
          pedestrian scaled “village” environment which serves the needs and are
          compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods.
Policies  It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
          Permitted Uses
1.23.1    Accommodate community- and neighborhood-oriented commercial uses in
          accordance with Policies 1.16.1 through 1.17.2, except those which require
          large scale and volume buildings and are incompatible with the intended
          “village” character of the Avenues on parcels designated as “C-2-PD” (I1.1).
          Density/Intensity and Height
1.23.2    Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 0.5 and
          height of two (2) stories (30 feet) (I1.1).
          Design and Development
1.23.3    Require that development be sited and designed to convey a low-rise “village”
          character, including the:
          a. incorporation of arcades or other setbacks along the street frontage;
          b. extensive use of landscape (trees, shrubs, and groundcover), providing a
              three-dimensional visual character;
          c. incorporation of extensive facade modulation and articulation and design
              details; and
          d. use of roofline and height variations to break up massing and provide visual
              interest (I1.1, I1.7, I1.16).
1.23.4    Require that buildings be sited and designed to enhance pedestrian activity
          along the sidewalks, in accordance with Policy 1.17.5 (I1.1, I1.7, I 1.18).
1.23.5    Implement streetscape improvements along the sidewalks including, but not
          limited to the use of decorative/aesthetic materials and colors for crosswalks
          and/or sidewalks, distinctive public signage, street trees, street furniture, and
          similar elements (I1.17).
                                            2-46                                 5/6/08

            Sub-Area 4: Community and Highway Oriented Corridors-Avenue A to
            Knob Hill Avenue, Diamond Street to Anita Street, and Pearl Street to
            Ruby Street
These segments of the Pacific Highway corridor have been designated to continue with
low-intensity, highway-oriented commercial development ("C-2
The segment between Diamond and Anita Streets, on the east side of the street, warranted
some special consideration because of the number of small lots and odd triangular-shaped
blocks. These circumstances have made it difficult to assemble building sites of the size and
shape usually needed to facilitate new commercial development. This will continue to
constrain the area's development potential in the future.
The most readily available way to overcome these obstacles to new development is through
the use of redevelopment laws. While there has been past community resistance to the use
of redevelopment, it is also recognized that meaningful revitalization of this area will be
very difficult to achieve without it. A policy has therefore been adopted to consider the use
of redevelopment in future attempts to revitalize this area.
Reference should also be made to the Harbor/Civic Center Specific Plan, Pacific Coast
Highway Sub-Area, Zones 1 and 2, which establishes additional standards and policies for
the portion of this area between Diamond Street and Anita/Herondo Streets.
Objective   It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.24        Provide for the development of community- and highway-oriented commercial
            uses which are accessible to local residents and compatible with adjacent
            residential areas.
Policies    It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
            Permitted Uses
1.24.1      Accommodate retail and office commercial, restaurant, and other uses in
            accordance with Policy 1.16.1 on parcels designated as “C-2” (I1.1).
            Density/Intensity and Height
1.24.2      Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 0.5 and
            height of two (2) stories (30 feet) (I1.1).

1.24.4       Require that development be sited and designed to convey a low-rise “village”
             character as prescribed in Policy 1.23.3 (I1.1, I1.7, I1.18).
1.24.5       Consider the authorities of California Redevelopment Law as a mechanism to
             revitalize the parcels on the east side of Pacific Coast Highway between
             Diamond Street and Anita Street, including the aggregation and reconfiguration
             of parcels for higher economic use and improved compatibility with adjacent
             residential uses (I1.12).
             Sub-Area 5: Residential Clusters- Garnet Street to Vincent Street
The most significant change in land use designations along Pacific Coast Highway occur
within Sub-Areas 5 and 6, where the general commercial designation has been changed to
multiple-family residential ("RH"). There were several reasons for making this change.
Pacific Coast Highway has historically been zoned as a continuous commercial corridor.
The economic study prepared for the General Plan, however, indicated that there was a
surplus of commercially-zoned property along the corridor in relation to demand. This
imbalance has likely contributed to depressing the potential for new commercial
development. Reducing the amount of commercially-zoned property should help to
enhance the development potential of the property that remains commercial.
Conversely, there is a significant need for and lack of sites for new multiple-family housing
in the City. Pacific Coast Highway presents a viable location for this while avoiding the
need to increase densities within established residential neighborhoods. Based on these
factors, the portions of Pacific Coast Highway that were designated "RH" are areas where
there is currently little commercial investment and where residential and institutional uses
already exist.
In addition to enhancing opportunities for both commercial and residential development,
residential development along segments of Pacific Coast Highway will help to break up the
long, monotonous commercial corridor and add new visual interest.
Reference should also be made to the Harbor/Civic Center Specific Plan, Pacific Coast
Highway Sub-Area, Zones 4 and 5A, which establishes additional standards and policies for
this area.

Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.25      Provide for the development of residential units as “clusters,” interrupting the
          continuity of the commercial “strip” along Pacific Coast Highway and
          providing additional housing opportunities.
Policies  It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
          Permitted Uses
1.25.1    Accommodate the development of residential units (townhomes,
          condominiums, and apartments) on parcels designated as “RH” (I1.1).
1.25.2    Accommodate the development of community-serving commercial uses on the
          McCandless site adjacent to Pacific Coast Highway (I1.1).
          Density/Intensity and Height
1.25.3    On parcels designated as “RH” permit development of residential units to a
          maximum density of 28 units per net acre and three stories (35 feet) (I1.1).
1.25.4    Allow a maximum of 52.0 dwelling units per acre for senior citizen, affordable
          and/or low-moderate income housing, on the McCandless site (between
                                           2-50                                 5/6/08

            Emerald Street and Garnet Street). Notwithstanding any policy in the General
            Plan to the contrary, lots or parcels may be combined on the McCandless site
            where such combination is in conjunction with a project for senior citizen,
            affordable and/or low-moderate income housing (I1.1).
1.25.5      On a maximum of 56,000 square feet of the McCandless site adjacent to Pacific
            Coast Highway, permit the inclusion of community-serving commercial uses at
            a maximum 0.5 floor area ratio (I1.1).
            Design and Development
1.25.6      Require that residential units and sites be designed to convey a high quality
            character, in accordance with Policies 1.13.3 and 1.18.12 (I1.1, I1.7, I 1.18).
1.25.7      Require that the residential sites be designed to be compatible with adjacent
            commercial development along Pacific Coast Highway, in accordance with
            Policy 1.18.10 (I1.1).
1.25.8      Require that commercial uses on the McCandless site be designed and sited to
            ensure compatibility with on-site adjacent residential uses (I1.1, I1.7, I1.18).
            Sub-Area 6 Ruby Street to Knob Hill Avenue
For a discussion of the multiple-family residential designation ("RH"), refer to Sub-Area 5
above.
Within this three-block segment, there is a mixture of property designated for commercial
("C-2") and multiple-family residential ("RH") use. This somewhat unorthodox pattern was
arrived at after extensive input from property owners during the public hearing process.
The adopted pattern recognized the existing land use pattern and the viability of commercial
uses at corner intersections.
Objective   It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.26        Provide for the development of residential units as "clusters," interrupting the
            continuity of the commercial "strip" along Pacific Coast Highway and providing
            additional housing opportunities, and continue viable commercial land uses on
            more visible and accessible corner locations.

             Sub-Area 7: Mixed-Use Node-Torrance Boulevard Intersection
For a general discussion of mixed use development, see Artesia Boulevard: Sub-Area 3.
Pacific Coast Highway and Torrance Boulevard is the most prominent and highly trafficked
intersection in South Redondo. Taking advantage of this, this area was designated for
mixed use ("MU-3") to make this location into a focal point of activity within South
Redondo. Special attention will be given to encourage the type of design and uses that will
make the area distinctive in terms of both appearance and activity.
Reference should also be made to the Harbor/Civic Center Specific Plan, Pacific Coast
Highway Sub-Area, Zone 6, which establishes additional standards and policies for this
area.

             Sub-Area 8: Civic Center-Related Node-West Side, Vincent Street to
             Diamond Street
The designations for this one-block area are influenced by its location between the Civic
Center to the north and an area designated for multiple-family residential to the south. The
area adjacent to Diamond Street is designated for mixed use ("MU-3") with a maximum
floor area ratio of 1.0 for commercial development and 1.5 for mixed use. This is intended
to allow for higher intensity commercial and residential uses that would complement the
activity of the Civic Center.
The area extending south to Vincent Street is designated for pedestrian-oriented commercial
uses ("C-3-PD") with a maximum floor area ratio of 0.7. The pedestrian orientation is
intended to take advantage of the concentrations of people (residents, workers, and students)
within the immediate surrounding area, including a high density residential designation

From Pacific Coast Highway eastward, Torrance Boulevard has been historically developed
with highway-oriented commercial uses, including a small concentration of medical offices
between Francisca and Irena Avenues. With the exception of the mixed use node at Pacific
Coast Highway (see Pacific Coast Highway, Sub-Area 7), no significant changes are
proposed in the function or orientation of Torrance Boulevard.
Two different levels of development intensity have been established west and east of Irena
Avenue. The portion of Torrance Boulevard west of Irena Avenue has been designated
"C-3" with a maximum floor area ratio is 0.7. This is consistent with the intensity of the
existing medical offices and serves as a transition from the higher intensity of the mixed use
node at Pacific Coast Highway. The area east of Irena Avenue has been designated "C-2"
with a maximum floor area ratio of 0.5, a typical standard for general highway-oriented
commercial.
Objective   It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.30        Provide for the continued development of Torrance Boulevard as a local-serving
            commercial corridor containing a diversity of uses which are primarily oriented
            to the needs and accessible to nearby residents.

1.30.9      Implement bus shelters, benches, or other improvements which facilitate transit
            use of the corridor (I1.17).
            AVIATION BOULEVARD
The stretch of Aviation Boulevard from Aviation Boulevard south to Harper Avenue,
designated "C-2," has been historically developed with highway-oriented commercial uses,
including a number of auto-related uses. The General Plan continues to maintain the same
highway-oriented commercial function for Aviation Boulevard with the inclusion of policies
to enhance the quality and appearance of future development.

       RIVIERA VILLAGE
       General Village
                                     2-63                                    5/6/08

Riviera Village has long been one of Redondo Beach's most attractive and desirable
commercial areas. Its orientation around a central square; its collection of small shops,
restaurants, and offices; and its low-rise buildings with sidewalk frontage all serve to create
a "village" character. The intent of the General Plan is to preserve and enhance the
character of Riviera Village by reinforcing the existing scale of development and style of
design.
Despite its overall village character, portions of Riviera Village do feature differences in
orientation and intensity of development. To account for these differences, Riviera Village
has been divided into four sub-areas. This will help assure that the existing mix of uses and
development that make Riviera Village an appealing area will continue to be maintained in
the future.
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.32         Provide for the maintenance of the Riviera Village as a low-density,
             local-serving commercial district of the City, which is identifiable as a distinct
             “village-like” environment characterized by a high level of pedestrian activity.
Policies     It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
             Function and Permitted Uses
1.32.1       Accommodate land uses and provide for a physical form and scale of
             development which differentiates Riviera Village into the following sub-areas:
             a. maintenance of the Catalina Avenue frontage as the primary
                 pedestrian-oriented and scaled “core” of the village, containing commercial,
                 restaurant, and related uses and development;
             b. development of the Avenida del Norte and South Elena Avenue frontages
                 for pedestrian-oriented and community-serving uses;
             c. development of Avenue I for a higher intensity of community-serving
                 commercial activity, including mixed use developments integrating
                 residential with commercial uses along the north side of Avenue I; and
             d. development of the Palos Verdes Boulevard frontage for community- and
                 highway-oriented commercial uses (I1.1).
1.32.2       Allow for the development of expanded parking facilities on the site bounded
             by Via del Prado, Avenida del Norte, and South Elena Avenue, provided that all
             additional parking is located in a fully subterranean structure which is
                                              2-64                                 5/6/08

       prioritized for use by local employees, provides controlled access, and limits the
       hours of operation (I1.1, I1.16).
       Design and Development
1.32.3 Implement a program of public signage which uniquely identifies the entries to
       Riviera Village and key internal locations (I1.17).
1.32.4 Implement streetscape improvements along the sidewalks including, but not
       limited to the use of decorative/aesthetic materials and colors for crosswalks
       and/or sidewalks, distinctive public signage, street trees, street furniture, and
       similar elements (I1.17).
1.32.5 Maintain and enhance the kiosk at the intersection of Catalina Avenue and Vista
       del Mar as a landmark of Riviera Village (I1.17).
1.32.6 Require that any subterranean parking structure developed on the existing
       parking lot incorporate amenities at its grade elevation which establish the
       character and function of a public place, including, but not limited to, landscape
       (groundcover, shrubs, and trees), street furniture, pedestrian-scaled lighting,
       attractive paving, and other pedestrian-oriented amenities (I1.17, I1.18).
1.32.7 Require that renovation and adaptive reuse of existing structures and new
       construction respect the general design and bulk of existing structures (I1.1,
       I1.7, I1.18).
1.32.8 Require that development be designed to convey a “village” character in
       accordance with Policy 1.21.7 (I1.1, I1.7, I1.18).
                                      2-65                                    5/6/08

1.32.9       Require that projects be designed and developed to achieve a high level of
             quality and distinctive character in accordance with the policies which pertain to
             the use and/or site for architecture (1.53.1+), signage (1.54.1+), site design
             (1.55.1+), streetscape and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of differing uses
             (1.57+), and physical and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I1.1, I1.10, I 1.18).
             Sub-Area 1: Village Core-Catalina Avenue Frontages
The village character of Riviera Village is most pronounced along Catalina Avenue. With a
virtually continuous line of shops along the sidewalk and diagonal street parking, Catalina
Avenue reflects the character of a small town "Main Street." Intensity in this area,
designated "C-2-PD," is kept modest (0.5 maximum floor area ratio), pedestrian-oriented
design is required, and sidewalk activity (including outdoor dining) is encouraged.
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.33         Maintain the Catalina Avenue frontage as the primary pedestrian-oriented
             “core” of Riviera Village.
Policies     It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
             Permitted Uses
1.33.1       Accommodate the development of pedestrian-oriented community- and
             neighborhood-oriented commercial uses in accordance with Policies 1.16.1 and
             1.17.2, except food sales and uses which require large scale and volume
             buildings and are incompatible with the intended “village” character of Riviera
             Village on parcels designated as “C-2-PD” (I1.1).
1.33.2       Encourage the development of outdoor dining and other sidewalk-oriented uses
             (I1.1).
             Density/Intensity and Height
1.33.3       Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 0.5 and
             height of two (2) stories (30 feet) (I1.1).
             Design and Development
1.33.4       Require that buildings be sited and designed to enhance pedestrian activity
             along the sidewalks, in accordance with Policy 1.17.5 (I1.1, I1.18).
             Sub-Area 2: Secondary Corridors-Avenida del Norte and South Elena
             Avenue
                                              2-66                                 5/6/08

This area, designated "C-3-PD," is situated around the central parking area and shares many
of the same characteristics as Catalina Avenue. Development, however, is somewhat more
intense with a greater number of two-story buildings. Consequently, a slightly higher floor
area ratio of 0.7 has been assigned to this area.
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.34         Maintain Avenida del Norte and South Elena Avenue as pedestrian-oriented
             commercial corridors which reflect and are linked and compatible with the
             primary Village “core.”
Policies     It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
             Permitted Uses
1.34.1       Accommodate the development of pedestrian-oriented community- and
             neighborhood-oriented commercial uses in accordance with Policies 1.16.1 and
             1.17.2, except uses which require large scale and volume buildings and are
             incompatible with the intended “village” character of Riviera Village on parcels
             designated as “C-3-PD” (I1.1).
1.34.2       Encourage the development of outdoor dining and other sidewalk-oriented uses
             (I1.1).
1.34.3       Allow for the development of professional offices along the street frontage
             (I1.1).
             Density/Intensity and Height
1.34.4       Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 0.7 and
             height of two (2) stories (30 feet) (I1.1).
             Design and Development
1.34.5       Require that buildings be sited and designed to enhance pedestrian activity
             along the sidewalks, in accordance with Policy 1.17.5 (I1.1, I1.18).
             Sub-Area 3: Peripheral Frontage-Avenue I
This area, designated "C-4-PD" and “MU-3” also possesses a pedestrian orientation with
buildings situated along the sidewalk. The primary distinction of this area is that it supports
a number of multi-story office buildings. In recognition of this higher intensity of
development, the maximum floor area ratio has been established at 1.0 for commercial
developments and 1.5 for mixed-use developments.
                                              2-67                                5/6/08

Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.35      Maintain Avenue I as a pedestrian-oriented commercial corridor which reflects
          and is linked to and compatible with the primary Village “core”, and permit
          opportunities for mixed-use development projects, integrating residential with
          commercial uses, provided they are compatible with adjacent commercial uses.
Policies  It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
          Permitted Uses
1.35.1    Accommodate the development of pedestrian-oriented community- and
          neighborhood-oriented commercial uses in accordance with Policies 1.16.1 and
          1.17.2, except uses which require large scale and volume buildings and are
          incompatible with the intended “village” character of Riviera Village on parcels
          designated as “C-4-PD” and “MU-3”(I1.1).
1.35.2    Encourage the development of outdoor dining and other sidewalk-oriented uses
          (I1.1).
1.35.3    Allow for the development of professional offices along the street frontage
          (I1.1).
1.35.4    Accommodate residential uses on the second floor or higher of structures
          developed with commercial uses on the lower levels on parcels designated as
          “MU-3” (I1.1).
          Density/Intensity and Height
1.35.5    Permit development of sites exclusively for commercial uses to a maximum
          intensity of a floor area ratio of 1.0 and height of three (3) stories (45 feet)
          (I1.1).
1.35.6    Permit the development of mixed-use structures integrating residential with
          commercial uses to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 1.5 and
          three (3) stories (45 feet), providing that:
          a. all floor area exceeding the ratio of 0.7 is developed for residential
               units;
          b. the maximum residential density does not exceed 35 units per net acre;
               and
          c.   a minimum floor area ratio of 0.3 is developed for commercial uses
               (I 1.1).
                                           2-68                                5/6/08

              Design and Development
1.35.7        Require that buildings be sited and designed to enhance pedestrian activity
              along the sidewalks, in accordance with Policy 1.17.5 (I1.1, I1.18).
1.35.8        Require that building elevations above the second floor be set back in
              accordance with Policy 1.16.3 (I1.1).
1.35.9        Require that mixed-use (commercial and residential) structures be designed to
              mitigate potential conflicts between the commercial and residential uses (e.g.,
              noise, lighting, security, and automobile access) and provide adequate amenities
              for residential occupants (I1.1, I1.7, I1.18).
              Sub-Area 4: Peripheral Frontage-Palos Verdes Boulevard
This area, designated "C-4," does not share the same pedestrian-oriented characteristics of
other portions of Riviera Village, instead having more of a highway orientation onto Palos
Verdes Boulevard. Consequently, the pedestrian-oriented design standards are not applied
to this area.
Objective     It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.36          Provide for the development of Palos Verdes Boulevard as a local- and
              highway-serving commercial corridor.
Policies      It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
              Permitted Uses
1.36.1        Accommodate retail, professional office, and other community-serving land
              uses as prescribed in Policy 1.16.1 in areas designated as “C-4” (I1.1).
              Density/Intensity and Height
1.36.2        Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 1.0 and
              height of three (3) stories (45 feet) (I1.1).
              Design and Development
1.36.3        Require that extensive landscaping be incorporated along the sidewalk frontage
              in accordance with Policies 1.19.3 and 1.19.4 (I1.1, I1.18).
1.36.4        Require that building elevations above the second floor be set back in
              accordance with Policy 1.16.3 (I1.1).
                                               2-69                                 5/6/08

            NORTH CATALINA AVENUE CORRIDOR
            General Corridor
The North Catalina Corridor is an area comprised of a variety of uses in different
conditions of repair. It is generally acknowledged that the area is in considerable need of
revitalization.
The approach that has been adopted within the General Plan is to provide options for the
range and intensity of permitted uses, while also incorporating necessary standards to
ensure appropriate development. This approach is intended to provide owners with the
flexibility to undertake development projects to improve the area within the short-term
future.
Objective   It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.37        Provide for the development of the North Catalina Avenue Corridor as a
            distinct center of community-oriented and marine-related service commercial
            and light industrial uses.

Policies It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
         Function and Permitted Uses
1.37.1   Accommodate land uses and provide for a physical form and scale of
         development which differentiates the North Catalina Avenue Corridor into
         the following sub-areas:
         a. development of the Catalina Avenue frontages, between Pacific Coast
             Highway and Beryl Street, as a community- and marine-oriented services
             area containing commercial, restaurant, marine-related commerce and
             services, automobile-related, and similar uses;
         b. continuation of overnight accommodations on the site of the existing
             hotel; and
         c. development of the Salvation Army site for mixed-commercial and
             residential uses, or residential and community-serving facilities (I 1.1).
         Design and Development
1.37.2   Examine the feasibility of re-routing North Catalina Avenue coincident with
         the railroad right-of-way from approximately North Broadway Avenue to
         Herondo Street; concurrently implementing traffic control mechanisms to
         reduce the speed of traffic (e.g., angled parking, additional signalization or
         stop signs, widened sidewalks, and limited access to and from Pacific Coast
         Highway) (I 1.19).
1.37.3   Require that projects be designed and developed to achieve a high level of
         quality and distinctive character in accordance with the policies which
         pertain to the use and/or site for architecture (1.53.1+), signage (1.54.1+), site
         design (1.55.1+), streetscape and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of
         differing uses (1.57+), and physical and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I 1.1, I
         1.10, and I 1.18).
1.37.4   Design and site structures to mitigate the noise, vibration, visual, and other
         impacts attributable to the AES Redondo Beach generating facilities and
         Southern California Edison transmission corridors (I 1.1).
1.37.5   Consider the authorities of California Redevelopment Law as a mechanism to
         revitalize the parcels along the North Catalina Avenue Corridor, including
                                        2-70                                    5/6/08
            the possible aggregation and reconfiguration of parcels for higher economic
            use, pedestrian-oriented mixed-use development projects integrating
            commercial and residential uses, re-routing of Catalina Avenue, and
            improved compatibility with adjacent residential uses (I 1.12).
            Sub-Area 1: Pacific Coast Highway to Beryl Street
This is the main portion of the North Catalina Corridor that has been the focus of the
concerns stated above. The area has been designated for highway-oriented commercial
uses (“C-3” and "C-5"), with the notable addition of light industrial uses permitted to the
rear of properties on the west side of Catalina Avenue. Light industrial uses are
considered to be acceptable in this location since it abuts the AES Redondo Beach
generating plant. Allowing light industrial uses is intended to provide additional impetus
for the redevelopment of properties in the area. The City is investigating funding options
for development of parks and open space west of Catalina Avenue.
Reference should also be made to the Harbor/Civic Center Specific Plan, Catalina
Avenue Sub-Area, Zone 3, which establishes additional standards and policies for this
area.
Objectives It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.38        Develop the Catalina Avenue frontage between Pacific Coast Highway and
            Beryl Street as the primary community- and marine-oriented "core" of the
            North Catalina Avenue Corridor.
Policies    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
            Permitted Uses
1.38.1      Accommodate local-serving retail, personal and business services,
            professional offices, household supply and furnishings, eating and drinking
            establishments, drug stores, retail, automobile-related sales, car wash, and
            similar uses which serve local and regional residents throughout the area on
            parcels designated as “C-3” and "C-5" (I 1.1).
1.38.2      Permit development of parks, recreation, and open space west of Catalina
            Avenue.
1.38.3      Accommodate automobile and marine related repair on the west side of
            Catalina Avenue (I 1.1).
                                           2-71                                 5/6/08

1.38.4        Accommodate commercial storage facilities, light industrial uses, boat and
              recreational vehicle outdoor storage, and wholesale uses to the rear, along the
              AES Redondo Beach property, of commercial developments on parcels
              fronting the west side of North Catalina Avenue, unless infeasible due to
              parcel configuration or depth (I 1.1).
              Density/Intensity and Height
1.38.5        Permit development of sites exclusively for commercial and related uses to a
              maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 0.7 (I 1.1).
1.38.6        Permit the development of those portions of sites devoted to light industrial
              uses to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 1.0 (I1.1).
1.38.7        Permit the development of those portions of sites devoted to storage and
              self-storage facilities to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 1.5
              (I1.1).
1.38.8        Permit structures to be constructed to a height of two (2) stories and thirty
              (30) feet, except on the west side of Catalina Avenue between Francisca
              Avenue and Beryl Street, where the height may be allowed to increase to a
              maximum of four (4) stories and sixty-five (65) feet, as measured from datum
              line (I1.1).
              Design and Development
1.38.9        Require that commercial storage, light industrial, automobile and marine
              related sales and repair, and wholesale facilities be designed to convey the
              architectural style of a retail commercial structure and not visually or
              physically dominate the Catalina Avenue frontage (I 1.1, I 1.18).
              Sub-Area 2: Hotel Triangle Site
This is the site of the Crowne Plaza Hotel. The development was completed in 1990 with
the assistance of the City Redevelopment Agency at a comparatively high floor area ratio
of over 2.0. Since this development should remain over the life of this General Plan, the
area has been designated "C-4-PD" with a special maximum floor area ratio of 2.25 to
reflect its current use and intensity of development.
Reference should also be made to the Harbor/Civic Center Specific Plan, Catalina
Avenue Sub-Area, Zone 6A, which establishes additional standards and policies for this
area.
                                           2-72                                    5/6/08
Objective     It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.39          Provide for the retention of existing visitor-serving hotel and related
              facilities.
Policies      It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
              Permitted Uses
1.39.1        Accommodate overnight accommodations and ancillary restaurants, gift
              shops, and other related visitor-serving facilities on parcels designated as
              “C-4-PD” (I1.1).
1.39.2        Accommodate pedestrian-oriented community and neighborhood-oriented
              commercial uses in accordance with Policies 1.16.1, 1.17.2, and 1.17.3,
              except food sales and uses which require large scale and volume buildings
              and are incompatible with the intended “village” character of the North
              Catalina Avenue Corridor (I1.1).
              Density/Intensity and Height
1.39.3        Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 2.25 and
              height of five stories (60 feet). The southern portion of the site with existing
              1-story development shall be permitted a maximum of one story, 15 feet.
              The middle portion of the site with existing 3-story development shall be
              permitted a maximum of three stories, 40 feet (I1.1).
              Design and Development
1.39.4        Require that building elevations above the second floor be set back in
              accordance with Policy 1.16.3 (I1.1).
              Sub-Area 3: Salvation Army Site
This site has long housed the local operations of the Salvation Army. The Salvation
Army is currently undertaking a complete reconstruction of the site with a new chapel,
offices, operational facilities, and senior apartment units. Since these new facilities will
continue to remain for an extended time frame, the area has been designated "MU-2" to
reflect its use by the Salvation Army.
                                             2-73                                   5/6/08

Reference should also be made to the Harbor/Civic Center Specific Plan, Catalina
Avenue Sub-Area, Zone 6C, which establishes additional standards and policies for this
area.
Objective  It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.40       Provide for the continued use for residential and community-serving facilities
           or reuse for pedestrian-oriented local-serving commercial as a continuation of
           the North Catalina Avenue Corridor “village.”
Policies   It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
           Permitted Uses
1.40.1     Accommodate residential and community-serving facilities on parcels
           designated as “MU-2” (I1.1).

           commercial uses in accordance with Policies 1.16.1, 1.17.2, and 1.17.3,
           except food sales and uses which require large scale and volume buildings
           and are incompatible with the intended “village” character of the North
           Catalina Avenue Corridor (I1.1).
1.40.3     Accommodate residential uses, integrated with commercial development, in
           accordance with Policy 1.18.2 (I1.1).
           Density/Intensity and Height
1.40.4     Permit the development of residential and community-serving facilities to a
           maximum density of 35 units per net acre and height of three (3) stories (45
           feet) (I1.1).
1.40.5     Permit development of sites exclusively for commercial uses to a maximum
           intensity of a floor area ratio of 0.7 and height of two stories (30 feet) (I1.1).

           a. all floor area exceeding the ratio of 0.7 is developed for residential units;
                                          2-74                                     5/6/08

             b. the maximum residential density does not exceed 35 units per net acre;
                 and
             c. a minimum floor area ratio of 0.3 is developed for commercial uses
                 (I 1.1).
             Design and Development
1.40.7       Require that residential facilities be designed and sited to convey a high
             quality character and image in accordance with Policies 1.18.11 and 1.18.12
             (I1.1, I1.18).
1.40.8       Require that commercial and mixed-use structures be designed to promote
             pedestrian activity in accordance with Policy 1.17.5 (I1.1, I1.18).
1.40.9       Require that mixed-use structures be designed to mitigate potential conflicts
             in accordance with Policy 1.18.8 (I1.1, I1.18).
1.40.10      Require that building elevations above the second floor be set back in
             accordance with Policy 1.16.3 (I1.1).
             GALLERIA AT SOUTH BAY
In addition to the Galleria shopping mall, this area includes the commercial businesses
extending southward to 182nd Street, as well as the Levitz Furniture Store on the west
side of Kingsdale Avenue. As a whole, this area represents the largest single
concentration of commercial land in Redondo Beach, and is also unique in its regional
orientation.
The Galleria has made a very positive contribution to the economic development of the
surrounding area, and the mall will continue to serve as the linchpin for future
development of the area. The anticipated construction of a passenger station for the
future extension of the Metro Green Line in this area will further enhance its prominence
as a regionally-oriented center.
In light of the area's key economic development potential, it has been designated "CR,"
with a maximum floor area ratio of 1.0. Policies have also been adopted requiring special
attention to the design of new development to ensure proper massing relationships,
pedestrian circulation and connections, linkages between developments, and integration
with transit facilities.
                                          2-75                                   5/6/08
Policies have also been included to allow for mixed use development to provide another
option for the future redevelopment of the areas south of the shopping mall. The area is
considered to be a good potential location for properly integrated multiple-family units
because of its proximity to transit, shopping, and services.
Objective   It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.41        Provide for the continued use of the Galleria at South Bay and surrounding
            properties as a primary center of regional-serving commercial uses, and
            provide for the development of mixed-use projects integrating residential
            with commercial uses; allowing for increases in development which enhance
                                           2-76                               5/6/08
         its economic vitality and contribute revenue to the City and improve its
         character as a pedestrian-oriented activity center, while minimizing impacts
         on adjacent streets and residential neighborhoods.
Policies It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
         Permitted Uses
1.41.1   Accommodate the development of regional-serving retail commercial and
         ancillary uses, promotional/discount retail (“power centers”), restaurants,
         professional offices, furniture, household and garden supplies, and similar
         uses in areas designated as “CR” (I1.1).
1.41.2   Accommodate residential uses on the second floor or higher of structures
         developed with commercial uses on the lower levels on parcels designated as
         “CR”(I1.1).
         Density/Intensity and Height
1.41.3   Permit development exclusively for commercial uses to a maximum intensity
         of a floor area ratio of 1.0 and a maximum height of 60 feet provided that:
         a. additional development is sited and designed to achieve the character of a
             pedestrian-oriented “urban center,” in accordance with the Design and
             Development standards stipulated in Policies 1.41.5 through 1.41.9;
         b. transportation capital improvements, public transit, and demand
             management programs are implemented which mitigate the impacts of
             vehicular trips attributable to the increased development potential; and
         c. buffers and other mitigating elements are implemented which protect
             adjacent residential neighborhoods (I1.1, I1.5, I1.6, I1.8, I1.9, I1.10,
             I1.18).
1.41.4   Permit the development of mixed-use structures integrating residential with
         commercial to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 1.5 (applicable
         only to those portions of the site devoted to mixed-use) and a maximum
         height of 60 feet, providing that:
         a. all floor area exceeding the ratio of 1.0 is developed for residential units;
                                        2-77                                   5/6/08

       b. the maximum residential density for “market-rate” units does not exceed
           35 units per acre;
       c. residential densities exceeding 35 units per net acre shall be developed for
           units affordable for low- and moderate-income households; and
       d. a minimum floor area ratio of 0.3 is developed for commercial uses.
           (I1.1).
1.41.5 Notwithstanding the height restrictions stated in Policies 1.41.3 and 1.41.4,
       on that portion of The Galleria at South Bay property which lies north of the
       northern right-of-way line of the Southern California Edison (SCE)
       powerline easement, heights in excess of 60 feet, but in no case greater than
       100 feet, may be approved by the Planning Commission for additions to
       existing structures on the property, when a shade/shadow analysis is prepared
       by the applicant which demonstrates that the increased height will not result
       in adverse impacts upon adjacent land uses which do not lie upon the project
       site.
       Design and Development
1.41.6 Require that projects be designed and developed to achieve a high level of
       quality and distinctive character in accordance with the policies which
       pertain to the use and/or site for architecture (1.53.1+), signage (1.54.1+), site
       design (1.55.1+), streetscape and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of
       differing uses (1.57+), and physical and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I 1.1, I
       1.10, and I 1.18).
1.41.7 Require that new development of the South Bay Galleria and adjacent sites
       be designed to convey the “sense” of a pedestrian-oriented regional-serving
       urban center, in accordance with the standards contained in Policy 1.21.7
       (except reference to a low-rise “village”) and the following additional
       elements:
       a. reduce the impacts of height and mass by setting back and lessening the
           volume of the upper elevations of structures within 50 feet of the property
           line fronting Kingsdale Avenue; and
       b. locate new development to create visual and physical connections to
           peripheral sidewalks, sites, and buildings (I1.1, I1.10, I1.18).
                                     2-78                                     5/6/08

1.41.8       Integrate public transit facilities on the site and ensure that they are accessible
             by automobile, bicycle, and walking from peripheral residential
             neighborhoods (I1.1, I1.18).
1.41.9       Develop and implement programs of public streetscape improvements
             (landscape, street furniture, signage, pedestrian-scale lighting, etc.) which
             uniquely identify the regional commercial center and provide linkages among
             the individual parcels, including those south of the Southern California
             Edison right-of-way (I1.17).
1.41.10      Require that mixed-use structures be designed to mitigate potential conflicts
             in accordance with Policy 1.18.8 (I1.1, I1.7, I1.18).
             OTHER         HIGHWAY-             AND         COMMUNITY-COMMERCIAL
             CLUSTERS
In addition to the extended corridors and larger clusters, there are also a number of other
smaller, isolated commercial areas. These centers may be only a single store or two, or
may be small neighborhood shopping centers. These centers typically provide necessary
and convenient services to the surrounding area. Some example locations include the
northwest and southwest corners of Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Inglewood Avenue,
the northeast and northwest corners of 190th Street and Inglewood Avenue, and the
southwest corner of Beryl and Prospect Avenues.
Given the multiple locations and smaller sizes of these centers, they are addressed here
under one heading. Since they vary in their characteristics, however, these areas have
been designated "C-1," "C-2," "C-3," and "C-4," with maximum floor area ratios ranging
                                            2-79                                      5/6/08
from 0.35 to 1.0. The basic objective is to allow these centers to continue to serve the
community in their current capacity, while assuring proper design and compatibility.
Objective   It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.42        Provide for the development of highway- and community-serving retail and
            service commercial and gasoline stations in clusters at principal intersections
            throughout the City.
Policies    It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
            Permitted Uses
1.42.1      Accommodate retail and service commercial, professional offices, and
            similar uses as prescribed in Policy 1.16.1 and automobile-related service and
            fuel facilities in areas designated as “C-2” and "C-4" (I1.1).
1.42.2      Accommodate the uses permitted in “C-2” zones, except entertainment,
            movie theaters, and overnight accommodations, in areas designated as
            “C-1”(I1.1).
            Density/Intensity and Height
1.42.3      Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 0.35 and
            height of two (2) stories (30 feet) in areas designated as “C-1” (I1.1).
1.42.4      Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 0.5 and
            height of two (2) stories (30 feet) in areas designated as “C-2” (I1.1).
1.42.5      Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 1.0 and
            height of three (3) stories (45 feet) in areas designated as “C-4” (I1.1).
            Design and Development
1.42.6      Require that extensive landscaping be incorporated along the sidewalk
            frontage in accordance with Policies 1.19.3 and 1.19.4 (I1.1).
            INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
Industrial development in Redondo Beach is somewhat limited in its area and scale. The
one major industrial area is the extreme northerly end of the City north of Manhattan
Beach Boulevard. Anchored by the large TRW Space Park complex, the prevailing
                                           2-80                                    5/6/08

emphasis of this area is on high tech industries within an industrial park type of setting.
With the current reduction in the aerospace industry, however, there is an emerging trend
to diversify the variety of uses within industrial areas.
The emphasis for the northerly industrial area, designated "I-1," is to continue the same
type of development, stressing larger scale "campus-park" type of developments. Uses
different from, but compatible with traditional industrial uses are being introduced to the
area. These include warehouse retail uses, ancillary commercial uses, and amusement
centers. Vehicle sales and services with or without motor vehicle repair and hotels and
motels are also accommodated. This is also the area of the City where relatively tall
buildings (up to 110 feet in height) are permitted; however, these higher heights may
only be achieved at a considerable distance from the major surrounding streets.
There are also three other smaller areas designated for industrial development within the
City. These areas, designated "I-2," have been assigned a higher floor area ratio of 1.0
primarily because fragmented land ownership has prevented the establishment of larger
sites needed for the "campus-park" type of development advocated for the northerly
industrial area.
Reference should also be made to the Harbor/Civic Center Specific Plan, Catalina
Avenue Sub-Area, Zone 4, which establishes additional standards and policies for one
segment of the "I-2" area.
Goal         It shall be the goal of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1I           Continue and enhance existing industrial districts which provide jobs to the
             residents of Redondo Beach and adjacent communities, are uniquely
             characterized by their functional role, uses, intensity, and physical form, and
             are compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods.
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.43         Retain, enhance, and intensify existing industrial districts of the City,
             maintaining their environmental quality and compatibility with adjacent
             residential neighborhoods and commercial districts.
Policies     It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
             Permitted Uses
1.43.1       Accommodate light manufacturing, research and development, spacecraft
             manufacturing and associated aerospace operations, business park offices,
                                            2-81                                   5/6/08
       warehouse retail uses, service stations, amusement centers (located within
       500 feet of a freeway), educational and governmental facilities, and day care
       facilities. Hotels and motels and vehicle sales and services with or without
       motor vehicle repair are also accommodated on properties within 500 feet of
       a freeway. (I1.1).
1.43.2 Accommodate retail and service uses which are ancillary and supporting to
       the primary industrial and business park uses (e.g., restaurants, banks,
       photocopies, and similar uses) (I1.1).
1.43.3 Accommodate additional retail and service uses which are compatible with
       industrial and business park uses (e.g., building material sales, furniture
       stores, vehicle sales and services, maintenance and repair services,
       restaurants, banks, photocopies, and similar uses) on parcels designated as I-3
       (I1.1).
       Density/Intensity and Height
1.43.4 Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 0.7 in
       areas designated as “I-1,” with the exception that within the area bounded by
       Marine Avenue, Freeman Boulevard, Manhattan Beach Boulevard, Doolittle
       Drive, Space Park Drive, and Aviation Boulevard, the floor area ratio may be
       increased to a maximum of 1.0 on individual parcels subject to the approval
       of a development agreement containing provisions with the effect of limiting
       the cumulative floor area ratio on all affected parcels to a maximum of 0.7.
       Permit a maximum height of 110 feet, with the exception that height shall be
       limited to one (1) foot of height for each two (2) feet of property depth as
       measured from property lines of frontages along Marine Avenue, Inglewood
       Boulevard, Manhattan Beach Boulevard, and Aviation Boulevard in areas
       designated as “I-1” (I1.1).
1.43.5 Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 1.0 and
       height of two (2) stories (30 feet) in areas designated as “I-2,” except that
       antennae for public utilities and antennae for public uses shall not be subject
       to this height standard (I1.1).
1.43.6 Permit development to a maximum intensity of a floor area ratio of 0.7 and
       height of two (2) stories (30 feet) in areas designated as “I-3,” except that
       antennae for public utilities and antennae for public uses shall not be subject
       to this height standard (I1.1).
                                     2-82                                   5/6/08

       Design and Development
1.43.7 Require that projects be designed and developed to achieve a high level of
       quality and distinctive character in accordance with the policies which
       pertain to the use and/or site for architecture (1.53.1+), signage (1.54.1+), site
       design (1.55.1+), streetscape and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of
       differing uses (1.57+), and physical and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I 1.1, I
       1.10, I1.18).
1.43.8 Require that sites and buildings in the I-1 Industrial zone be designed to
       convey a “campus-park” setting, including:
       a. siting of buildings around common pedestrian walkways and public
           places (plazas, outdoor dining, and other);
       b. development of pedestrian walkways, arcades, and/or other visual
           elements to interconnect individual buildings;
       c. use of common architectural design vocabulary (materials, colors, design
           character, etc.);
       d. use of extensive landscape in open spaces and parking lots, including
           broad landscaped setbacks from principal peripheral streets;
       e. location of parking to minimize views from principal peripheral streets;
       f. use of consistent and well-designed public and informational signage; and
       g. installation of elements defining the key entry points and activity
           locations (I1.1, I1.10, I1.18).
1.43.9 Require that structures and sites be designed to convey visual interest and
       character and be compatible with adjacent uses, including:
       a. differentiation of building facades by materials, color, architectural details
           (columns, recessed or projecting windows, articulated beams or spandrels,
           etc.), offset planar surfaces, and modulated building volumes;
       b. architectural treatment of all building elevations;
       c. enclosure of storage areas with decorative screening or walls;
                                      2-83                                    5/6/08

              d. location of site entries to minimize conflicts with adjacent residential
                  neighborhoods; and
              e. mitigation of noise, odor, lighting, and other impacts (I1.1, I1.10, I 1.18).
              COASTAL-RELATED COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
The Coastal-Related Commercial ("CC") designation applies to areas of the Redondo
Beach Pier and the King Harbor Marina. The Pier and Harbor are probably Redondo
Beach's best known and most special attractions. Much of the Pier was destroyed by fire
and storm damage in 1988, and is in the process of being rebuilt under a special nautical
design theme. The Harbor continues to be a valuable facility for local boaters, and also
supports a variety of commercial businesses that benefit from and enhance the marina
setting.
The harbor and pier areas are designated as a commercial and recreational asset for both
the City and the region in the certified Coastal Land Use Plan (LUP). The LUP is
intended to allow for a wide range of regional-serving public and commercial
recreational facilities including uses such as hotels, restaurants, entertainment, retail sales
and services, and boating facilities and services. The harbor area is currently under-
utilized with large expanses of surface parking lots surrounding isolated restaurants and
other uses. The LUP encourages further expansion of coastal dependent land uses where
feasible. Expansion of hotel uses is particularly important to enhance coastal access, to
provide economic benefits making feasible the provision of improved public recreational
facilities, and to revitalize the harbor area with a pedestrian-active character.
Since the Harbor/Pier area is a major local attraction and area of activity, another major
issue is assuring a very high quality of development and design. For both the Pier and
Harbor areas, policies have been adopted requiring quality design that also enhances the
area's seaside location.
Reference should also be made to the Harbor/Civic Center Specific Plan, Harbor/Pier
Sub-Area, which establishes additional standards and policies for this area.
Goal        It shall be the goal of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1J            Provide for the continued use of the City's coastal-related recreational
              facilities as resources for the residents of Redondo Beach and surrounding
              communities; ensuring that these uses and activities are compatible with
              adjacent residential neighborhoods and commercial districts and maintain a
              high level of quality and safety.
                                             2-84                                   5/6/08
Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.44      Maintain the Redondo Beach Pier and supporting commercial, restaurant,
          entertainment, and other coastal-related uses as a recreational resource and
          amenity of the City.
Policies  It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
          Permitted Uses
1.44.1    Accommodate recreational and marine facilities and uses (fishing, surfing,
          boating, swimming, etc.), restaurants, entertainment, gift shops, and other
          coastal-related uses in areas designated as “CC” (I1.1, I1.3).
          Density/Intensity and Height
1.44.2    Permit development in accordance with the intensity limitations prescribed
          for the rebuilding of the Pier, or as modified by the City Council with public
          input to maintain adequate revenue and quality of use (I1.1, I1.3, I1.14).
          Design and Development
1.44.3    Require that projects be designed and developed to achieve a high level of
          quality and distinctive character in accordance with the policies which
          pertain to the use and/or site for architecture (1.53.1+), signage (1.54.1+), site
          design (1.55.1+), streetscape and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of
          differing uses (1.57+), and physical and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I 1.1, I
          1.10, I1.18).
1.44.4    Require that structures be designed at a uniform and high level of
          architectural design quality which reflects the unique setting of the pier on
          the coastline and enhances pedestrian-activity, including:
          a. visual and physical transparency along building exteriors;
          b. well-defined entries;
          c. variable rooflines and building heights;
          d. pronounced rooflines; and
          e. inclusion of pedestrian-oriented projecting signs (I1.1, I1.3, I1.14, I 1.18).
                                         2-85                                    5/6/08

1.44.5    Require that signage be integrated in style, materials, and placement with the
          design of the structures; minimizing their number and size (I1.1, I 1.3, I1.14,
          I1.18).
1.44.6    Provide a consistent and well-designed system of public signage, identifying
          entries and key activity locations and uses (I1.3, I1.14, I1.17).
1.44.7    Install pedestrian-oriented and scaled amenities, including benches, lighting,
          landscape, and similar elements (I1.3, I1.14, I1.17).
Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.45      Maintain King Harbor and supporting commercial, restaurant, entertainment,
          and other coastal-related uses as a recreational resource and amenity of the
          City.
Policies  It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
          Permitted Uses
1.45.1    Accommodate recreational and marine facilities and uses (boat slips and
          anchorages, fishing, surfing, boating, swimming, public boat launching
          ramps, etc.), hotels, restaurants, entertainment, gift shops, public open space,
          and other coastal-related uses in areas designated as “CC”.
          The primary permitted uses of Mole B shall be boating facilities, such as
          boating clubs, boating instruction, boat storage, Harbor Patrol, and similar
          support facilities, and public open space and recreational uses.
          Office uses may be permitted outside the tidelands as supplementary uses that
          support the success of the primary regional-serving public and commercial
          recreation uses, subject to limitations in the Harbor-Civic Center Specific Plan,
          Coastal Land Use Plan, and zoning ordinance (I1.1, I1.3, I1.13).
1.45.2    Allow the continuation and maintenance of existing residential structures
          (I1.1, I1.3, I1.13).
          Density/Intensity and Height
1.45.3    Permit development within the Harbor and Pier area in accordance with
          maximum floor area ratio standards and maximum cumulative development
          limitations established in the Harbor/Civic Center Specific Plan, Coastal
                                         2-86                                   5/6/08

       Land Use Plan, and zoning ordinance. The future intensity of new
       development which may be allowed to occur on individual parcels or master
       lease areas within the area will be determined on a case-by-case review basis,
       through the established public review process, as individual proposals are
       received (I 1.1, I1.3, I1.13).
1.45.4 Harbor development proposals shall be reviewed and considered relative to
       their individual parcel size, configuration, and location, as well as their
       compatibility with adjacent uses and their ability to attain and fulfill the
       urban and architectural design objectives specified in Policies 1.45.5 to
       1.45.11 of the General Plan. Within the maximum floor area ratio permitted,
       the actual floor area ratio granted should take into account the degree to
       which the project meets objectives for reconfiguration of development and
       siting buildings along common pedestrian promenades and public plazas and
       the degree to which the project provides high quality public amenities, public
       spaces, and/or other public improvements. Projects that meet these
       objectives to a high level may be granted a higher floor area ratio than
       projects that meet the objectives to a lesser extent. (I1.1, I1.3, I 1.13).
       Design and Development
1.45.5 Require that projects be designed and developed to achieve a high level of
       quality and distinctive character in accordance with the policies which
       pertain to the use and/or site for architecture (1.53.1+), signage (1.54.1+), site
       design (1.55.1+), streetscape and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of
       differing uses (1.57+), and physical and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I 1.1, I
       1.10, I1.18).
1.45.6 Encourage and provide incentives for the reconfiguration of parcels and
       development to create a unified seaside “village,” siting buildings adjacent to
       one another and orienting them along common pedestrian promenades and
       public plazas (I1.1, I1.3, I1.5, I1.6, I1.13).
1.45.7 Require that commercial structures be designed at a uniform and high level
       of architectural design quality which reflects the unique setting of the Harbor
       on the coastline (I1.1, I1.3, I1.10, I1.13, I1.18).
1.45.8 Require that signage be integrated in style, materials, and placement with the
       design of the structures; minimizing their number and size (I1.1, I 1.3, I1.10,
       I1.13, I1.18).
                                      2-87                                      5/6/08

1.45.9      Provide a consistent and well-designed system of public informational
            signage for the harbor, identifying entries and key activity locations and uses
            (I1.13, I1.17).
1.45.10     Install pedestrian-oriented and scaled amenities, including benches, street and
            pedestrian lighting, landscape, and similar elements (I1.13, I 1.17).
1.45.11     Install additional street trees and landscape along the Harbor Drive frontage
            and in parking lots (I1.13, I1.17).
            PUBLIC AND INSTITUTIONAL USES
The Public and Institutional ("P") designation is comprised of lands that are owned by
public agencies, special use districts, and public utilities. Although this designation
encompasses a range of different public and quasi-public uses, they share a common
thread in that these uses do not fit well under the typical standards for residential,
commercial, or industrial uses.
Since this designation includes a variety of uses with a variety of characteristics, no
attempt has been made to establish specific development standards within the General
Plan. The Zoning Ordinance, however, will implement the Public/Institutional
designation through multiple zoning districts more focused on the different classes of
public/quasi-public uses. These zones will also contain more specific development
standards.
Reference should also be made to the Harbor/Civic Center Specific Plan, Civic Center
Sub-Area; Harbor/Pier Sub-Area, Zone 1; and Catalina Avenue Sub-Area, Zones 1 and 2,
which establishes additional standards and policies for certain areas designated as "P."
Goal        It shall be the goal of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1K          Provide for public uses which support the needs and functions of the
            residents and businesses of the City.
Objective   It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.46        Provide for the continuation of existing and expansion of governmental
            administrative and capital, recreation, public safety, human service, cultural
            and educational, infrastructure, and other public land uses and facilities to
            support the existing and future population and development of the City.
Policies    It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
                                           2-88                                   5/6/08
       Permitted Uses
1.46.1 Accommodate governmental administrative and maintenance facilities, parks
       and recreation, public open space, police, fire, educational (schools), cultural
       (libraries, museums, performing and visual arts, etc.), human health, human
       services, public utility and infrastructure (transmission corridors, etc.), public
       and private secondary uses, and other public uses in areas designated as “P”
       (I1.1).
1.46.2 Allow for the reuse of public and utility properties and facilities for private
       use (and the reuse of school sites subject to the provisions of California
       Government Code Section 65852.9), with the type and density/intensity of
       use to be permitted on the site determined by:
       a. their compatibility with the type, character, and density/intensity of
           adjacent uses;
       b. objectives for the area defined by the General Plan;
       c. contribution of public benefits (e.g., affordable housing);
       d. revenue contribution to the City; and
       e. formulation and approval of a specific or development plan (I1.5, I 1.6,
           I1.7).
1.46.3 Accommodate religious facilities in residential and commercial areas of the
       City and in the portion of the industrial zone adjacent to the north side of
       Manhattan Beach Boulevard, east of Redondo Beach Avenue and provided
       that they are compatible in function, scale, and character with adjacent uses
       (I1.1, I1.7).
       Design and Development
1.46.4 Establish standards for the City and coordinate with other public agencies to
       ensure that public buildings and sites are designed to be compatible in scale,
       mass, character, and architecture with the existing buildings and pertinent
       design characteristics prescribed by this Plan for the district or neighborhood
       in which they are located (I1.18).
                                      2-89                                    5/6/08

1.46.5      Require, where the City has jurisdiction, that public sites be designed to
            incorporate landscaped setbacks, walls, and other appropriate elements to
            mitigate operational and visual impacts on adjacent land uses (I1.18).
1.46.6      Monitor the operations of public uses and facilities and periodically review
            the adequacy of and, as necessary, implement additional impact mitigation
            measures (I1.18).
1.46.7      Require that only passive secondary uses of public transmission
            rights-of-way be permitted (e.g., uses where groups of people are not
            permitted to congregate).
            TARGETED REVITALIZATION SITES
In a few areas of the City that were developed before current zoning patterns were
established, the existing uses raise issues of inconsistency with the surrounding area.
These areas were the subject of special scrutiny during the formulation of the General
Plan to determine the approach that would create the most beneficial and harmonious
land use pattern.
Goal        It shall be the goal of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1L          Promote the revitalization and more effective use of properties characterized
            by economic underutilization or uses and buildings which are incompatible
            with the district or neighborhood in which they are located.
Ruxton Lane
This area of approximately five acres is situated between the Redondo Beach Villa Tract
to the west and the Santa Fe Railroad to the east, just south of Artesia Boulevard.
Because of its juxtaposition, it became a leftover piece of land. Consequently, it was
divided into three large parcels and devoted to light industrial uses. The largest parcel
has access to Artesia Boulevard via a "panhandle" strip of property and supports a large
warehouse building.
Although the warehouse building is in good condition, the southerly end of the area is in
a somewhat deteriorated condition. Combined with the fact that the area adjoins an
established residential area across Ruxton Lane, emphasis was placed on establishing a
more appropriate and compatible use of this land.
Because of the above, this area has been designated "RMD" Residential Medium
Density. Although "RMD" has a normal maximum density of 23.3 units per acre, a
                                           2-90                                 5/6/08
special provision has been applied to this area allowing a maximum density of 40 units
per acre where low- and moderate-income units are included. This strategy is intended to
both create sufficient value in the land to make its redevelopment economically feasible,
and to provide a highly needed opportunity area for the development of new low- and
moderate-income housing.
Objective   It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.47        Provide for the revitalization and reuse of the Ruxton Lane industrial area for
            residential development.
Policies    It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
            Permitted Uses, Density, and Height
1.47.1      Accommodate the development of multi-family residential units in
            accordance with Policy 1.13.1 in areas designated as “RMD” (I1.1).
                                           2-91                                 5/6/08

1.47.2       In excess of development permitted at a maximum density of 23.3 units per
             net acre pursuant to Policy 1.47.1, accommodate the development of
             additional multi-family residential units for low and moderate income
             households, with priority given to senior citizens, at an overall maximum
             density of 40 units per net acre on parcels of a minimum of 5,000 square feet
             and height of 45 feet (three stories). Additional density above 23.3 units per
             net acre (with the exception of density bonuses mandated by state law) up to
             40 units per net acre, shall be granted by the City based on consideration of
             the type and extent of low and moderate income housing to be provided.
             This policy shall constitute fulfillment of state and city density bonus
             provisions and no additional density bonus shall be permitted (I1.1).
             Design and Development
1.47.3       Require that projects be designed and developed to achieve a high level of
             quality and distinctive character in accordance with the policies which
             pertain to the use and/or site for architecture (1.53.1+), signage (1.54.1+), site
             design (1.55.1+), streetscape and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of
             differing uses (1.57+), and physical and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I 1.1, I
             1.10, I1.18).
1.47.4       Require that multi-family residential projects be designed to convey a high
             quality and distinctive neighborhood character, in accordance with Policy
             1.13.3 (I1.1, I1.10, I1.18).
1.47.5       Require the provision of on-site open space amenities and design of these to
             be accessible and of sufficient size to be usable by tenants (I1.1).
1.47.6       Require that the site and buildings are designed to buffer the impacts of noise
             and vibration from the abutting railroad (I1.1).
Meyer Lane Area
This area, north of 190th Street and east of Meyer Lane, currently supports a mixture of
residential, commercial, and industrial uses that present some special planning
considerations. In particular, the existing industrial uses present issues in terms of their
compatibility with and intrusion into a surrounding area that is otherwise almost
completely residential. Because of this, the primary objectives for this area were to
provide for the transition of some of the existing industrial areas to residential uses, and
provide for the improvement and enhancement of the industrial areas that remain.
                                           2-92                                     5/6/08
In attempting to achieve the above objectives, a total of five different land use
designations have been applied to six different subareas. A brief discussion of these six
subareas follows.
Local-Serving Commercial (190th Street and Mary Ann Drive, "C-2"): This is a
long-established pocket of retail commercial uses. These uses are considered to be
acceptable and no changes were necessary.
Light Industrial (Mary Ann Drive, "I-2"): North of the commercial businesses at
190th Street, Mary Ann Drive is lined with small light industrial businesses. Although
bordered by residential uses on three sides, these businesses have managed to operate
without creating undue impacts.
This notwithstanding, there continues to exist concern regarding the appearance and
aesthetics of this area. The small area and the industrial nature of the businesses has
resulted in some problems with unkept properties. The strategy is to allow the light
industrial uses to continue, but to establish policies to encourage physical improvements
and upgrading of the appearance of the area. A higher-than-existing floor area ratio of
1.0 was established to encourage redevelopment and consolidation of parcels to a more
appropriate scale.
Cresta Trailer Park ("RMD"): Situated in the middle of this area is the only mobile
home park in Redondo Beach. The park contains space for 83 mobile homes and is
relatively simple in design and amenities. Since it is the only remaining mobile home
park, it is considered valuable as a place to accommodate this type of alternative,
affordable housing. The park has therefore been redesignated "RMD" Residential
Medium Density, with the specific stipulation that the site be continued for use as a
mobile home park.
Light Industrial (Meyer Lane, "I-2"): Extending approximately 500 feet northward
from 190th Street along Meyer Lane is a group of four building complexes that support a
combination of business offices and light industrial uses. These buildings continue to
exist in good condition and the uses generally operate without problems. This area was
therefore designated to continue for light industrial uses.
Multiple-Family Residential (Meyer Lane, "R-3"): This area includes three
multiple-family complexes just south of Ralston Lane, and two light industrial complexes
that are being redesignated to residential. The primary reason for the change of the
industrial uses is that the buildings in question are in poor condition and incompatible
with the surrounding area. In addition, the transition of these properties would help to
reinforce the residential character of the surrounding area.
                                           2-93                                 5/6/08
Single-Family Residential (High Lane, "R-1"): Adjacent to the west side of High
Lane is a 3.7-acre site currently occupied by a single large manufacturing use (Chic
Lingerie). Since this area is a single site of relatively large size, it would be feasible for it
to be redeveloped in the future and remove the conflict of an industrial use adjacent to
residential uses on all four sides. The site's isolation from other industrial areas has also
diminished its attractiveness for industrial use. Because of these circumstances it was
redesignated to "R-1" Single-Family Residential.
                                           2-94                                      5/6/08
Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.48      Provide for the continuation and improved compatibility among existing
          residential (mobile home park), light industrial, and commercial land uses in
          the area bounded by 190th Street, Meyer Lane, Ralston Lane, High Lane,
          Fisk Lane, and Mary Ann Drive; ensuring their compatibility with adjacent
          residential neighborhoods.
Policies  It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
          Permitted Uses
1.48.1    Accommodate light industrial uses as prescribed in Policy 1.43.1 in areas
          designated as “I-2” (I1.1).

          stories) in areas designated as “R-1” (I1.1, I1.2).
1.48.9    Accommodate the development of residential units at a maximum density of
          17.5 units per net acre on parcels of a minimum of 5,000 square feet and
          height of 30 feet (two stories) in areas designated as “R-3” (I1.1, I 1.2).
                                         2-95                                    5/6/08

1.48.10 Accommodate mobile home units at a maximum density of 23.3 units per net
        acre, or as currently exists, in areas designated as “RMD” (I1.1, I 1.2).
        Design and Development
1.48.11 Require that projects be designed and developed to achieve a high level of
        quality and distinctive character in accordance with the policies which
        pertain to the use and/or site for architecture (1.53.1+), signage (1.54.1+), site
        design (1.55.1+), streetscape and public amenity (1.56.1+), interface of
        differing uses (1.57+), and physical and functional adequacy (1.58+) (I1.1,
        I1.10, I1.18).
1.48.12 Require that light industrial uses be developed in accordance with Policy
        1.43.7 (I1.1, I1.10, I1.18).
1.48.13 Encourage the renovation and upgrade of existing industrial buildings and
        installation of street trees, unified signage, and other aesthetic improvements
        in common and public areas (I1.5, I1.6, I1.20).
1.48.14 Require that local- and highway-serving commercial uses be developed in
        accordance with Policies 1.19.3 and 1.19.4 (I1.10, I1.18).
1.48.15 Require that single-family residential uses be developed in accordance with
        Policies 1.11.4 through 1.11.7 (I1.1, I1.10, I1.18).
1.48.16 Require that low density multi-family residential uses be developed in
        accordance with Policy 1.12.5 (I1.1, I1.10, I1.18).
1.48.17 Encourage the long-term maintenance and upgrade of the trailer park;
        including the structural integrity and appearance of the mobile home units,
        landscape, common open spaces, and recreational amenities (I 1.20).
1.48.18 Install street trees and other landscape improvements along Meyer Lane and
        Fisk Lane to improve the compatibility of the light industrial uses with
        adjacent residential neighborhoods (I1.17).
1.48.19 Install street trees along 190th Street which distinctly identifies this corridor,
        and improves its visual appearance (I1.17).
                                       2-96                                    5/6/08

300 Block of South Catalina Avenue
This block, the east side of Catalina Avenue between Torrance Boulevard and Pearl
Street, has historically supported retail commercial uses. Long-standing multiple-family
residential zoning resulted in only one property (adjacent to Torrance Boulevard) being
redeveloped for residential use.
Even though this block is surrounded on three sides by residential development, the
existing commercial development is considered to be desirable and nondisruptive. The
continued use and future development of this block for commercial use (with the
exception of the residential project adjacent to Torrance Boulevard) is considered
preferable to a slow transition to residential use. The block has therefore been designated
"C-2-PD," also taking into consideration the existing pedestrian orientation of businesses
along the sidewalk frontage.
Objective    It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.49         Provide for the development of multi-family residential units, and

          uniquely identify the principal pedestrian-oriented commercial districts of the
          City, including a) Artesia Boulevard, b) Riviera Village, c) Harbor/Pier, d)
          the Avenues, and e) Torrance Boulevard-Pacific Coast Highway node
          (I1.17).
1.56.21   Establish a design program for each principal district and neighborhood of
          the City (e.g., The Esplanade) which may include signage, street furniture,
          landscape, lighting, pavement treatments, public art, and architectural design,
          with input from local community groups (I1.17).
          Overhead Utilities
1.56.22   Continue programs for the undergrounding of overhead utilities throughout
          the City (I1.17).
Issue    HOW CAN COMPATIBILITY BE ENSURED BETWEEN LAND USES
         CHARACTERIZED BY DIFFERING FUNCTIONS AND INTENSITIES?
Goal      It shall be the goal of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1O        Ensure the compatibility among the various types and densities of land uses
          to be accommodated in the City.
Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.57      Incorporate functional and physical buffers, setbacks, and other elements as
          transitions between land uses characterized by differing functions, activities,
          density, scale, and mass.
Policies  It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.57.1    Require that parcels developed for commercial and industrial uses
          incorporate buffers with abutting residential properties which adequately
          protect the residential use from the impacts of noise, light, visibility of
          activity, vehicular traffic, and risks to the property, and maintain open space
          and visual access (horizontal and vertical setbacks, structural or landscape
          enclosures, insulation, and other) (I1.1, I1.7, I1.18).
                                         2-110                                 5/6/08
1.57.2 Require that the on-site lighting of commercial and industrial uses be
       unobtrusive and constructed or located so that only the intended area is
       illuminated, off-site glare is minimized, and adequate safety is provided
       (I1.1, I1.7, I1.18).
1.57.3 Require that the elevation of all parking structures facing residential parcels
       be enclosed or controlled to prevent adverse noise and air emission impacts
       on the residences and incorporate architectural design elements, such as
       surface treatments, off-set planes, and structural articulation and landscape, to
       provide visual interest and be compatible with the residences (I1.1, I1.7,
       I1.18).
1.57.4 Require that rooftop parking adjacent to residential areas be enclosed by a
       wall or other appropriate element within an adequate distance to prevent
       adverse noise impacts on the residences, wherein the enclosed parking shall
       be within the prescribed height limit of the district in which it is located (I1.1,
       I1.7, I1.18).
1.57.5 Require that entertainment, drinking establishments, and other uses
       characterized by high activity levels provide adequate physical and safety
       measures to prevent "spill-over" impacts on adjacent properties (I1.1, I1.7,
       I1.8, I1.18).
1.57.6 Require that the renovation of existing structures or new development on
       sites served by parking lots located on adjacent residentially-zoned property
       restrict the access to such parking areas to the commercial zone frontage,
       unless there are no feasible alternatives, and that areas facing, abutting, or
       exposed to residential areas be extensively landscaped to include a screen
                                    2-111                                      5/6/08
          wall incorporating evergreen plant material (covering a majority of the wall
          within a one year period) (I1.1, I1.7, I1.18).
1.57.7    Allow parking lots by conditional use permit in residential districts where the
          lot is contiguous to or separated by an alley from the commercially-zoned
          property served by the parking lot, provided that there is no adverse impact
          on surrounding residential properties and that areas facing, abutting, or
          exposed to residential areas be extensively landscaped to include a screen
          wall incorporating evergreen plant material (covering a majority of the wall
          within a one year period) (I1.1, I1.7, I1.18).
Issue     WHAT MECHANISMS CAN BE USED TO MAINTAIN THE
          QUALITY OF THE CITY'S BUILT ENVIRONMENT?
Goal      It shall be the goal of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1Q        Ensure that buildings and properties are maintained in the City.
Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.58      Ensure that structures and sites are designed and constructed to maintain their
          long-term quality and provide for the needs of their occupants.
Policies  It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.58.1    Require that all structures be constructed in accordance with the requirements
          of the City's building and other pertinent codes and regulations, including
          new, adaptively-reused, and renovated buildings (I1.4).
1.58.2    Periodically review and update the City's building and development codes
          and regulations to ensure that they incorporate professionally accepted state-
          of-the-art standards (I1.4).
1.58.3    Require that all development be designed to provide adequate space for
          access, parking, supporting functions, open space, storage, and other
          pertinent elements (I1.1, I1.4).
1.58.4    Require that all commercial, industrial, and public development incorporate
          appropriate design elements to facilitate access for and use by the physically
          challenged (ramps, doorways, rest rooms, etc.) (I1.1, I1.4).
                                         2-112                                 5/6/08
1.58.5    Require that commercial, industrial, and public development incorporate
          design elements and facilities which facilitate the use of transportation modes
          as alternatives to the automobile (pedestrian, bicycle, public transit, and other
          (I1.1, I1.4).
Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.59      Provide for the maintenance and, as necessary, upgrade of the physical and
          visual quality and integrity of buildings and properties.
Policies  It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.59.1    Periodically monitor the conditions of buildings in the City and enforce
          pertinent building and zoning codes, when necessary (I1.23).
1.59.2    Promote programs and work with local service organizations and educational
          institutions to inform residential, commercial, and industrial property owners
          and tenants regarding methods for the maintenance and upkeep of their
          property (I1.21).
1.59.3    Provide economic assistance, as funds are available, for the improvement of
          physically deteriorated and blighted structures in the City (I1.24).
1.59.4    Consider the use of the authorities of California Redevelopment Law as a
          mechanism to precipitate revitalization of deteriorated and blighted buildings,
          properties, and uses (I1.6).
Issue     WHAT MECHANISMS CAN BE USED TO ENSURE THE
          MAINTENANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IN THE CITY?
Goal      It shall be the goal of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1R        Ensure the protection and maintenance of environmental resources.
Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
1.60      Provide that the environmental impacts of new development projects be
          identified and mitigated.
Policies  It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
                                         2-113                                  5/6/08
1.60.1     Require that proposed development be subject to review to identify its
           environmental impacts and appropriate mitigation measures in accordance
           with the California Environmental Quality Act (I1.7. I1.8, I1.9).

           measures on the City's infrastructure, services, and environment and, as
           necessary, initiate the following actions to account for the defined impacts:
           a. review and modify the locations, densities, and/or design and
               development standards contained in this Plan;
           b. implement capital improvements, public services, or other mitigation
               programs;
           c. require additional developer mitigation; and/or
           d. impose fees on new and/or existing development (as authorized by State
               of California nexus legislation) for the implementation of mitigation
               programs (I1.1).
1.60.3     Work with other public agencies to ensure that their facilities and operations
           in the City of Redondo Beach are managed in a manner to prevent adverse

1.60.5     Participate in inter-jurisdictional and regional environmental management
           and mitigation programs with adjoining cities in the region (I1.25).
2.1.5 Implementation Programs
The following indicates the programs which shall be carried out by the City of Redondo
Beach to implement the goals, objectives, policies, and standards of the Land Use
Element. Each program is preceded by the letter “I” and a number which is referenced
                                         2-114                                   5/6/08

by the pertinent policy which it implements in the preceding section. These are noted in
parentheses ( ) at the close of each policy. Notwithstanding the language in specific
implementation measures, action by the City is subject to the availability of funding and
staff.
I1.1   Revise the Zoning Ordinance
       The principal method for the implementation of a General Plan Land Use Map is
       the zoning ordinance. Policies and standards which prescribe the types of use
       permitted, their density/intensity, and design and development characteristics
       (design, property setbacks, etc.) are codified as precise requirements in the
       ordinance. The authority to zone is inherent in the police power delegated to cities
       by the State of California Constitution. The zoning ordinance consists of two
       basis elements: a) a map which delineates the boundaries of districts, or “land use
       zones,” in which similar and compatible uses developed at similar and compatible
       standards are to be permitted and b) text which explains the purpose of the zoning
       district, lists the permitted uses (as a “right” or under special conditions), and
       defines the standards for development (e.g., minimum lot size, density, height,
       property setbacks, lot coverage, parking requirements, sign design, and so on).
       The existing mapped depiction of land use zones is referred to as the “Precise
       Land Use Plan” and the textual codification of requirements is incorporated as
       Chapter 2 of the Redondo Beach Municipal Code, also titled the “Precise Land
       Use Plan.” On adoption of this updated General Plan, it will be necessary to
       revise the “Precise Land Use Plan” map and text to be consistent with the General
       Plan's policies and standards.
       It is evident, on review of the existing zoning ordinance text, that its format and
       structure are archaic and unwieldy and do not reflect “state-of-the-art” techniques
       and practices. To a large extent, this is attributable to the considerable passage of
       time since the original ordinance's preparation in the early 1960s. Subsequent
       changes have occurred as elaborations and appendages, whose cumulative effect
       over time has resulted in a complex and difficult to administer document. As a
       consequence, it is recommended that the City use the opportunity of the General
       Plan update to completely restructure and rewrite its zoning ordinance. Should
       this occur, it would be necessary for the City to modify its existing zoning
       standards and procedures so that they are consistent with the provisions of the
       General Plan on an interim basis during the six month or longer process for the
       ordinance's revision.
       The following lists the general categories of revisions which will be necessitated
       by the adoption of the updated General Plan. These are not all-inclusive and will
                                         2-115                                    5/6/08

necessitate the careful review of the specifications of each of the policies
contained in the Land Use Element and all other elements to determine the
appropriate ordinance revisions.
a.     The “Precise Land Use Plan” (or “zoning map”) will require revision to
       reflect the locations and categories of use and density delineated on the
       General Plan Land Use Map.
b.     Land use districts (as prescribed in Article 2 of the ordinance) will require
       revision to reflect the categories of use defined by the General Plan Land
       Use Map and policies.
c.     Development standards for each land use district will require revision to
       reflect the policies and standards specified for permitted uses, density and
       intensity, design and development, and other considerations. Generally,
       these include:
       (1)     Establishment of controls on the intensity of commercial and
               industrial development by the definition of a maximum floor area
               ratio. Generally, it has been assumed in the formulation of the Land
               Use Element policies that floor area ratio encompasses the gross
               building area, excluding parking structures, mechanical rooms, and
               subterranean basements not used for commercial or business
               activity. The City may elect to also exclude non-occupiable
               common building areas, such as stairways, ventilation shafts,
               arcades, and architectural projections (e.g., towers).
       (2)     Review and reconciliation of permitted residential densities (units
               per acre) and lot sizes.
       (3)     Review and revision, as necessary, of building height limitations.
       (4)     Review and reconciliation of property setbacks (horizontal and
               vertical) for land use compatibility.
       (5)     Review and establishment of requirements for buffers between
               commercial and residential uses, single-family and multi-family
               uses, and other abutting districts characterized by differing
               characteristics and functions.
       (6)     Establishment of standards to mitigate the impacts on adjacent
               properties of noise, vibration, odor, light and glare, and other
                                    2-116                                 5/6/08

     operational characteristics from the AES Redondo Beach facility,
     transmission lines, harbor operations, railroad corridor, highways,
     and other similar uses. The standards shall apply both to the source
     and receiver sites (e.g., use of sound insulation in residential
     structures abutting the railroad corridor and SCE plant).
(7)  Review and revision of landscape standards for properties, including
     front yards, courtyards, plazas, side yards, rear yards, parking lots
     and facilities, common public areas, and other prescribed locations.
(8)  Establishment of standards to enhance the pedestrian character of
     streets in selected commercial districts; including specifications for
     the type and/or location of use, architectural treatment of facades and
     building mass, siting of structures along sidewalks, incorporation of
     pedestrian amenities, and other prescribed elements. This may be
     accomplished as an “overlay” to an underlying commercial land use
     district classification.
(9)  Establishment of architectural and site design standards for all
     structures, including, but not limited to, facade treatment and
     articulation, massing/volume modulation, organization of multiple
     buildings, visual and physical transparency, and other pertinent
     elements.
(10) Establishment of architectural and site design standards for the
     development of mixed-use structures, integrating residential and
     commercial uses into a single structure or site. Considerations will
     be given to elements which ensure compatibility between these uses
     (e.g., separate entrances and parking, on-site residential amenities,
     and noise controls).
(11) Establishment of site planning and design standards for areas in
     which a “village” character is intended, involving multiple buildings
     or masses on individual or combined parcels or in low intensity and
     scaled commercial clusters. These include:
•    Pacific Coast Highway, east of Palos Verdes Boulevard
•    East side of Pacific Coast Highway, Palos Verdes Boulevard to
     Avenue G
•    Pacific Coast Highway and Torrance Boulevard intersection
•    Galleria at South Bay
•    Riviera Village
                           2-117                                  5/6/08

       •      The “Avenues” (Pacific Coast Highway, Avenue A to H)
       •      Selected segments of Pacific Coast Highway and Artesia Boulevard
d. Standards and requirements and provisions for bonus densities for the
   development of affordable housing shall be reviewed and, as necessary,
   modified.
e. Standards and requirements for adult businesses, video arcades, gasoline sales,
   automobile and truck dealerships, and other uses characterized by activities
   which could conflict with the “residential” character of the community shall be
   reviewed and, as necessary, modified.
f. Signage standards shall be reviewed and, as necessary, upgraded including
   limitations on the number, size, design, placement, materials, colors, and other
   characteristics of signs. A schedule shall be established for the amortization of
   nonconforming signs and nonconforming signs may be required to be removed
   when a property changes use or there is an expansion of existing use.
g. Parking standards shall be reviewed for their adequacy. These will consider
   opportunities for “shared” facilities and mixed-use development projects.
h. Requirements shall be reviewed and upgraded, as necessary, for the linkage of
   development with the provision of adequate transportation and utility
   infrastructure (streets, water, sewer, storm drainage, electricity, natural gas, and
   telecommunication), public services (governmental administrative, schools,
   parks, libraries, etc.), and public amenities (e.g., street trees). These will
   consider the appropriate responsibilities for developer participation and fees, in
   accordance with State nexus legislation and court cases.
i. Provisions for the compliance of local development projects with regional
   requirements for air quality (South Coast Air Quality Management Plan),
   congestion management (Los Angeles County Congestion Management
   Program), toxics and hazardous wastes (Hazardous Waste Management Plan),
   solid waste reduction (Source Reduction and Recycling Element), water and
   energy conservation, coastal protection (California Coastal Act), noise
   abatement, and other pertinent environmental controls will be specified. These
   will encompass development standards and procedures which implement
   defined requirements for local governments.

     Department.
     Schedule for Implementation
     • Interim Ordinance, within two months of adoption of the General Plan.
     • Revised Ordinance, within 18 months of the General Plan's adoption (as
        funding is available).
I1.2 Subdivision Regulations
     Subdivision regulation is an exercise of the police power of a city authorized by
     the State to control the manner in which land is divided. Like the zoning
     ordinance, it must be consistent with the General Plan. It will be necessary to
     review the City's subdivision ordinance (Chapter One of Title 10 of the Municipal
     Code) and amend it as necessary to reflect the land use goals, objectives, policies,
     and standards.
     Responsibility for Implementation
     City of Redondo Beach, Planning Division of the Community Development
     Department.
     Schedule for Implementation
     Revised Ordinance, within 18 months of the General Plan's adoption (as funding is
     available).
I1.3 Local Coastal Program
     The City of Redondo Beach's Coastal Element (defined by the California Coastal
     Act as the “Local Coastal Program, Land Use Plan) will be updated to reflect the
     revised General Plan. Other revisions may be necessary to reflect planning for the
     rebuilding of the Pier and intentions for King Harbor. In concert, it will be
     necessary to complete the (unfinished) Local Implementing Ordinance. Both
     documents shall be submitted to the California Coastal Commission for review
     and certification.
     Responsibility for Implementation
                                      2-119                                  5/6/08

     City of Redondo Beach, Planning Division of the Community Development
     Department.
     Schedule for Implementation
     Within 24 months of the General Plan's adoption (as funding is available).
I1.4 Building Code
     The City shall continue the Building code as the set of rules and regulations by
     which new construction, adaptive re-use, and renovations shall occur. The Code
     shall be reviewed to ensure its consistency with the provisions of the General Plan.
     It shall also be updated periodically to reflect changes in the Uniform Building
     Code and State legislation. At least once each three years, the City shall review
     the Code and update it as necessary to reflect conditions which are unique to the
     City.
     Responsibility for Implementation
     City of Redondo Beach, Planning Division of the Community Development
     Department.
     Schedule for Implementation
     For consistency with the General Plan: within 18 months of the General Plan's
     adoption (as funding is available).
I1.5 Specific Plans
     State law (Government Code Section 65450) authorizes cities to adopt Specific
     Plans for implementing their general plans in designated areas. They are intended
     to provide more finite specification of the types of uses to be permitted,
     development standards (setbacks, heights, landscape, architecture, etc.), and
     circulation and infrastructure improvements. They are most often used to ensure
     that multiple property owners and developers adhere to a common development
     plan or ensure that the individual phases of a long-term multi-phased development
     project are integrated and cohesive.
     Specific Plans can be initiated by the City or developers. Costs for City-initiated
     Specific Plans are, most often, reimbursed by pro-rata allocation of fees to
     developers applying for development permits in the Specific Plan area.
                                       2-120                                  5/6/08
     In concert with the preparation of the updated General Plan, a separate Specific
     Plan has been developed for the area generally encompassing the Catalina Avenue
     corridor between Pacific Coast Highway and Pearl Street, Civic Center, King
     Harbor, Redondo Beach Pier, and Pacific Coast Highway property frontages. This
     Plan (separate document) shall be considered for approval by the City apart from
     the General Plan.
     Responsibility for Implementation
     City of Redondo Beach, Planning Division of the Community Development
     Department and private developers.
     Schedule for Implementation
     • Civic Center-North Catalina Avenue Corridor-King Harbor Specific Plan:
     concurrent with adoption of the updated General Plan.
     • Others: as determined to be necessary.
I1.6 Development Agreements
     Development agreements are authorized by State law to enable a city to enter into
     a binding contract with a developer which assures the city as to the type, character,
     and quality of development and additional “benefits” which may be contributed
     and assures the developer that the necessary development permits will be issued
     regardless of changes in regulations.
     This ensures that a developer of a multi-phased project who has established
     financing on conditions negotiated with the city would not be adversely affected
     by subsequent, more restrictive regulations. This, in turn, enables the city to exact
     a higher level of performance, quality, and contributions than would normally
     accrue through the entitlement process.

                                       2-121                                   5/6/08

I1.7 Development Review
     New development and enlargement of existing structures, except single-family
     residences are subject to review according to their adherence with City of
     Redondo Beach standards and regulations and General Plan policy and issuance of
     a Development Permit. Certain projects, consistent with zoning, are considered as
     “ministerial” and are subject to approval by the Director of Community
     Development. Others are subject to discretionary review, including those which
     must receive Conditional Use Permits or variances and are subject to review by
     the Planning Commission and formal public hearings. In particular, development
     review is essential for the following:
     a. Determination of the appropriateness and extent of bonus densities for
         affordable and seniors housing units.
     b. Review of mixed-use development projects (integrating residential and
         commercial).
     c. Review of projects in districts in which more restrictive design and
         development standards are imposed to maintain or achieve a special quality or
         to control large scale projects (e.g., Riviera Village, the “Avenues,”
         Torrance-PCH intersection, North Catalina Avenue, pedestrian-oriented areas,
         TRW, and Galleria at South Bay).
     d. Review of the appropriateness and imposition of controls on “high-impact”
         developments (arcades, etc.).
     e. Review of projects located in “high-impact” areas (e.g., adjacent to the AES
         Redondo Beach plant).
     f. Review of modifications of existing development which is “non-conforming”
         due to its use, density, and/or design. This will include the consideration of the
         replacement of structures involuntarily destroyed.
     The decisions of the Planning Commission can be appealed to the City Council.
     In preparing the implementing zoning ordinance for this Plan, the City should
     re-evaluate these regulations for their adequacy in providing effective public
     review and comment on proposed development projects. As necessary, the
     thresholds for review should be revised to reflect the potential impacts of a project
     based on type of use, size, location, trips generated, infrastructure demands, or
     other appropriate criteria.
                                         2-122                                  5/6/08

     Responsibility for Implementation
     City of Redondo Beach, Planning Division of the Community Development
     Department.
     Schedule for Implementation
     Review and modification of development review requirements: in concert with
     the preparation of the revised zoning ordinance, within 18 months of the adoption
     of the updated General Plan.
I1.8 Environmental Review
     The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that the
     environmental effects of a project must be taken into account when considering
     zone changes, development permits, specific plans, and development agreements.
     This involves the review of all projects submitted by an applicant or initiated by
     the City and determination of their potential for significantly affecting the City's
     and region's environmental resources (by an “Initial Study”). If it is found that
     significant impacts may occur, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) must be
     prepared.
     The EIR presents an overview of the environmental setting of the project, assesses
     how that environment will change on introduction of the project, prescribes
     changes to the project which must be made to mitigate any impacts found to be
     significant, and identifies and evaluates the impacts of any alternatives. The
     “environment” of Redondo Beach to be evaluated consists of the composite of
     existing physical elements; including natural environmental components (air
     quality, geology/seismicity, groundwater, etc.) and man-related components
     (circulation and traffic, infrastructure, public services, etc.). Economic impacts are
     not considered part of the environment, according to CEQA. This does not
     preclude the preparation of separate “Fiscal” or “Economic” impact analyses.
     However, they are not part of an EIR.
     On completion of an EIR, it is made available for public review and comment. At
     least one public hearing must be conducted by the Planning Commission on the
     draft EIR. Comments received must be responded to and addressed in the Final
     EIR.
     Environmental review occurs in concert with the Development Permit process.
     No discretionary permit can be approved without, first, satisfactory completion of
     the environmental review process. This may involve the preparation of a complete
                                         2-123                                   5/6/08

     EIR, “Focused” EIR if found that only a limited number of resources may be
     impacted, “Supplemental” EIR if the project is a revision of an earlier project or
     time has passed and conditions have changed, or “Negative Declaration” if the
     project is determined by the City to have no significant effects.
     Where mitigation actions are specified during environmental review, a plan
     (“Mitigation Monitoring Plan”) must be prepared which specifies the manner in
     which the development project will be monitored to determine whether these
     actions were implemented and effective. This plan must be approved by the City
     in concert with the certification of the EIR.
     Redondo Beach's environmental review procedures are specified in Chapter 3 of
     Title 10 of the Municipal Code and should be reviewed for consistency with the
     goals, objectives, policies, and standards contained in this Plan.
     Responsibility for Implementation
     City of Redondo Beach, Planning Division of the Community Development
     Department.
     Schedule for Implementation
         • Procedures: in concert with the preparation of the revised zoning
            ordinance, within 18 months of the adoption of the updated General Plan.
         • Environmental review documents: on a case-by-case basis.
I1.9 Traffic Impact Review
     As a component of the environmental review process, or separately, the City shall
     require the conduct of an analysis defining the traffic impacts and mitigation
     measures for new development and the adaptive re-use of existing structures. A
     threshold (i.e., number of trips) should be established above which such analyses
     would be required. The analyses will be subject to public and Transportation
     Commission review.
     Projects classified as “regionally-significant,” as determined by the Los Angeles
     County Transportation Commission criteria, shall be subject to review for their
     impacts on designated regional highways and compliance with the Los Angeles
     County Congestion Management Plan (CMP), when adopted. This may include a
     fee contribution for the mitigation of impacts on the regional highway network.
                                        2-124                                5/6/08

      within 18 months of the adoption of the General Plan.
      • Projects: on a case-by-case basis.
I1.10 Architectural Design Review
      The goals, objectives, policies, and standards contained in the Land Use Element
      mandate a high level of architectural and site design performance in the City of
      Redondo Beach. To this end, it is encouraged that one or more professionals who
      are trained in architectural, landscape, and/or urban design be retained on City
      staff. This person or persons would be responsible for meeting with development
      applicants and explaining to them the design goals, objectives, policies, and
      standards of this plan and how they will be interpreted by the City. Specific visual
      examples of projects which meet these requirements should be presented.
      This will enable the City to be pro-active in design, rather than the normally
      reactive stance of the development review process. In addition, it is recommended
      that one or more members of the Planning Commission be trained in the same
      design professions. This would enhance the credibility of the formal design
      review of discretionary projects by the Commission; basing decisions on objective
      training as well as subjective “lay” viewpoints.
      Responsibility for Implementation
      City of Redondo Beach, policy position of the City to be established by the City
      Council as a “goal” or ‘target” for employment and Commission guidelines.

I1.11 General Plan Monitoring and Update
      The City shall review, revise, and update the General Plan periodically. This
      should include a) an update of baseline data, analyses, and issues to account for
      current conditions; b) evaluation of the policies and programs contained in this
      Plan according to their effectiveness in achieving the Plan's goals and objectives;
      and c) revision of the policies and programs to increase their effectiveness, where
      necessary, and to account for current issues and legislation. Public input shall be
      actively solicited in the update. In addition, the Plan shall be monitored annually
      for its effectiveness in mitigating defined issues and achieving its goals and
      objectives. The Planning Commission shall report these findings to the Mayor and
      City Council.
      Responsibility for Implementation
      City of Redondo Beach, Planning Division of the Community Development
      Department, Planning Commission, and City Council
      Schedule for Implementation
          • Monitoring Reports: once each year.
          • General Plan updates: periodically.
I1.12 Redevelopment
      The State of California, through the Community Redevelopment Law (Health and
      Safety Code Sections 33000 et. seq.) authorizes a city to undertake redevelopment
      projects to revitalize blighted areas. An adopted plan provides additional tools
      beyond those traditionally provided by planning law to a city to effectuate
      productive change.
      These include the use of tax increment revenues (i.e., amount of additional tax
      revenue above a “frozen” base generated by increased property valuations
      resulting from new development in the Project Area), property acquisition,
      consolidation of small parcels, joint public-private partnerships, clearance of land
      and resale to developers, and relocation of tenants. Twenty percent of the tax
      increment revenue, in most cases, is to be used to increase and improve the
      community's supply of low and moderate income housing. The use of California
      Redevelopment authorities considerably facilitate the process of creating joint
      partnerships with the business community to cure existing problems and create
      new jobs.
                                        2-126                                   5/6/08

      Redevelopment Plans may be adopted with respect to areas in which the
      conditions of physical, economic, and/or social blight predominate. At a
      minimum, it is recommended that the City of Redondo Beach consider the use of
      State-authorized redevelopment activities for the revitalization and more effective
      use of the parcels on the east side of Pacific Coast Highway between
      Anita/Herondo Street and Diamond Street and to stimulate conversion of the
      Ruxton Lane industrial area for residential uses. If private market activities are
      unsuccessful in attaining desired improvements in the North Catalina Avenue
      corridor, it is suggested that redevelopment also be considered here.
      Any application of the redevelopment authorities should minimize the acreage and
      uses to be encompassed in the Project Area. Residential areas should be excluded
      unless it is the intent (as on Pacific Coast Highway) to convert these to another
      use. Redevelopment actions should be targeted to the few, relatively modest
      projects which can be demonstrated to be economically feasible and effectively
      stimulate further revitalization.
      Responsibility for Implementation
      City of Redondo Beach, Department of Community Development.
      Schedule for Implementation
      • Feasibility studies for the redevelopment of Pacific Coast Highway (Anita/
          Herondo-Diamond) and the Ruxton Lane industrial area: within two years of
          the adoption of the General Plan, unless adequate funding is not available.
      • Other areas: as required.
I1.13 King Harbor Operations
      Development in King Harbor shall continue to be administered by the City of
      Redondo Beach Harbor Department and subject to input by the Harbor
      Commission and approval of the City Council. Contractual leases between the
      City and leaseholder define the type of development permitted on each parcel and
      duration/tenure of the leasehold. Such leaseholds are negotiated by the Harbor
      Department and are subject to review and input of the Harbor Commission, who
      acts as an advisory body. Final approval of the lease is the responsibility of the
      City Council.
      Development projects on the leasehold properties are submitted to the Harbor
      Department, whereupon they are reviewed for their consistency with zoning by the
                                         2-127                                 5/6/08

I1.14 Redondo Beach Pier Operations
      Development on the Redondo Beach Pier shall continue to be administered by the
      City of Redondo Beach Harbor Department and subject to input by the Harbor
      Commission and approval of the City Council. The type, amount, and design
      character of development to be permitted on the reconstructed Pier is defined by
      the Redondo Beach Pier Master Plan. Contractual leases between the City and
      leaseholder define the type of development permitted on each parcel and
      duration/tenure of the leasehold. Such leaseholds are negotiated by the Harbor
      Department and are subject to review and input of the Harbor Commission, who
      acts as an advisory body. Final approval of the lease is the responsibility of the
      City Council.
      Development projects on the leasehold properties are submitted to the Harbor
      Department, whereupon they are reviewed for their consistency with zoning by the
      Department of Community Development. This review will expand upon the
      criteria historically used to encompass the Pier Design Manual and additional
      design and development standards contained in this General Plan.

I1.15 Inter-Agency Coordination
                                       2-128                                5/6/08
Development in the City of Redondo Beach impacts and is impacted by the
actions of adjacent municipal jurisdictions, utility districts (e.g., Southern
California Edison Company), school districts, service providers, and “superior”
governmental agencies (e.g., County of Los Angeles and the California
Department of Transportation). As a consequence, it is essential that the actions
of each jurisdiction which impact one another be closely coordinated. Agreements
and procedures for coordination need to be continued or established where they do
not currently exist. This will become increasingly important as the State of
California moves to establish state-wide and regional policy and administrative
mechanisms to address the issues of growth (e.g., congestion management, air
quality, solid waste, and traffic) which may impact the City's local decision
authorities over time.
Among the many and diverse concerns which should be addressed are the
following:
a. Land use compatibility on the City's periphery and interface of streets and
    traffic; with the Cities of Hawthorne, Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach,
    Lawndale, and Torrance.
b. Regional transportation (Pacific Coast Highway and Artesia Boulevard) and
    public transit; with the California Department of Transportation, Los Angeles
    County Transportation Commission, Southern California Association of
    Governments, and Santa Fe Railroad.
c. Development of the harbor, pier, and coastal properties; with the California
    Coastal Commission, State Lands Commission, California Department of Fish
    and Game, United States Army Corps of Engineers, and Regional Water
    Quality Control Board.
d. Development and operations of electrical generating and transmission
    facilities; with the Southern California Edison Company.
e. Provision and maintenance of other public and quasi-public utilities; Southern
    California Gas Company, General Telephone Company, California Water
    Company, Western Waste Industries, County of Los Angeles Flood Control,
    and Century Cable.
f. Provision of schools; with the Redondo Beach School District and South Bay
    Union High School District.
g. Regional air quality; with the South Coast Air Quality Management District.
                                   2-129                               5/6/08

      h. “Fair share” provision of affordable housing units; with the Southern
          California Association of Governments and State of California Department of
          Housing and Community Development.
      i. Provision of social services; County of Los Angeles, State of California, and
          local service providers.
      Responsibility for Implementation

I1.16 Capital Improvements Program
      The City of Redondo Beach maintains a Capital Improvements Program (CIP)
      which provides for the construction and upgrade of streets, storm drains (not under
      the responsibility of Los Angeles County Flood Control), municipal buildings, and
      other public physical facilities. It defines the specific improvements to be
      accomplished annually and allocates budget for these. Normally, the CIP is
      revised no less often than every five years and is subject to approval by the City
      Council.
      Responsibility for Implementation
      City of Redondo Beach Public Works Department.
      Schedule for Implementation
      a. Program: update every five years.
      b. Implementation: each year, as funding is available.
I1.17 Urban Design Improvement Program
      The Plan provides for the implementation of streetscape and other urban design
      improvements throughout the City's commercial corridors. These include the use
      of consistent street trees, furniture (benches, trash receptacles, etc.), and signage.
      In key activity and pedestrian-oriented districts, a program of more extensive
      improvements are proposed including the use of entry and district signage and
                                         2-130                                    5/6/08

      monuments, pedestrian-oriented lighting, “aesthetic” crosswalk and sidewalk
      paving, expanded landscape, and other elements. Locations designated for such
      improvements include:
      a. Artesia Boulevard (consistent with the Artesia Boulevard Improvement Plan).
      b. Pacific Coast Highway and Torrance Boulevard intersection.
      c. Riviera Village.
      d. Galleria at South Bay and surrounding parcels.
      e. Civic Center and adjacent properties.
      f. Redondo Beach Pier-King Harbor area.
      g. Entries along the City's key arterials (Torrance Boulevard and Pacific Coast
         Highway).
      For each area, a comprehensive urban design master plan shall be prepared. At a
      minimum, this will specify the improvements to be implemented, pertinent design
      and development standards, their costs, and a financing program. The latter may
      be accomplished as a condition of and integrated with the development of private
      projects (e.g., Pacific Coast Highway and Torrance intersection and the Galleria at
      South Bay) or by the establishment of an Assessment District (e.g., Artesia
      Boulevard).
      Responsibility for Implementation
      City of Redondo Beach, Planning Division of the Community Development
      Department.
      Schedule for Implementation
      Urban Design Master Plans: within five years of the adoption of the updated
      Municipal Code, as funding is available.
I1.18 Formulate Architecture, Site, and Landscape Design Guidelines and Standards
      Architecture, site, and landscape design guidelines shall be established for
      development throughout the City. These should define the salient design
      characteristics which are necessary to ensure that new development and renovation
                                        2-131                                 5/6/08

      of existing structures attains the high quality which is desired in the City and does
      not adversely impact the character of existing districts which exhibit special
      design qualities. For example, in the “Avenues” area of the City, the design
      guidelines should prescribe standards for the height, massing, scale, articulation,
      and setbacks of structures to continue the single-family character that distinguishes
      much of the existing development in this unique neighborhood. In designated
      “pedestrian-oriented” commercial districts, the guidelines should be formulated to
      promote pedestrian activity, such as siting structures in proximity to public
      sidewalks, maintaining visual transparency of the ground floor elevation, and
      incorporating architectural design elements which provide visual interest.
      In general, the guidelines/standards should be more precise in those areas which
      currently exhibit a distinctive architectural and planning character, such as the
      “Avenues” and Riviera Village, or are intended to establish a special sense of
      place, such as Artesia Boulevard. The guidelines should specify the overall
      characteristics of development desired, such as scale, massing, siting, facade
      articulation, and amenity. Restricted and specific design idioms, such as “Spanish
      Colonial Revival,” are considered inappropriate for the City and should not be
      used.
      The guidelines shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission and adopted by the
      City Council.
      Responsibility for Implementation
      City of Redondo Beach, Planning Division of the Community Development
      Department.
      Schedule for Implementation
      Within three years of the adoption of the updated Municipal Code, as funding is
      available.
I1.19 Land Development/Parcel Re-Configuration
      A study shall be conducted, in concert with any redevelopment planning activities,
      to determine the feasibility of re-routing Catalina Avenue between Beryl Street
      and the Pacific Coast Highway intersection approximately coincident with the
      railroad right-of-way and Francisca to Herondo. This would facilitate the re-use
      of the parcels currently located along this segment of Catalina Avenue for an
      integrated mixed-use commercial and residential “village.”
                                         2-132                                   5/6/08

I1.20 Interface with Property Owners and Developers for Property Maintenance
      The City shall establish programs to encourage property owners to maintain and
      upgrade, as necessary, the quality of existing buildings in the City. This may
      include:
      a. periodic visual surveys of the conditions of the City's districts and
          neighborhoods, identifying sites which exhibit substantial inadequate
          maintenance;
      b. contact of the owners or tenants of sub-standard properties to encourage their
          remedial actions;
      c. provision of technical assistance (at City Hall) to the property owners and
          tenants regarding the techniques by which properties can be maintained and
          upgraded; and
      d. assistance in the solicitation of low-interest loans for the upgrade of
          sub-standard properties.
      Responsibility for Implementation

      Expanding upon the prior implementation strategy, the City shall work with local
      contractors, developers, and schools to establish a program to educate the public
      regarding the techniques which may be employed to maintain and upgrade
      properties. These may be structured as classes presented to local homeowners,
      business, and/or community organizations, and/or on cable television.

3.2 UTILITIES
A key component in planning for the future development and growth of an area within
the context of a General Plan is ensuring that the various utilities (public and private)
operating in the local area and region are capable of providing services at the levels and
in the locations necessary to support the demand generated by future land uses and
activities. State of California Office of Planning and Research guidelines prescribe that
the General Plan contain “policies and plan proposals for the development, improvement,
and timing of major sewer, water, and drainage facilities” as well as “policies, plan
proposals, and standards for the location of pipelines and facilities for the transmission of
electricity.”
The following section inventories and describes the existing jurisdictions, facilities, and
operation of the critical utilities (i.e., sanitary sewer, storm drainage, water, electricity,
natural gas, and telecommunications) that are provided within the City of Redondo
Beach. The section also inventories and describes several specific utility-related
infrastructure components that do not generally exist in all cities, but do exist in the City
of Redondo Beach. These infrastructure components include the Groundwater
(Seawater) Intrusion Barrier and the various Petroleum Extraction/Pipeline Facilities.
3.2.1 Sanitary Sewer Service
Sanitary sewer service is provided in the City of Redondo Beach through a coordinated
multi-jurisdictional system containing different facilities, some of which are
operated/maintained by the City of Redondo Beach Public Works Department and some
of which are operated/maintained the County of Los Angeles Sanitation Districts. For
the county’s planning and operational purposes, the city actually falls within two
geographically separate but equivalent districts: 1) County Sanitation District #5, which
includes all of North Redondo Beach; and 2) the South Bay Cities Sanitation District,
which includes all of South Redondo Beach.
Sewage is collected through the network of city and county sewer mains located below
virtually every street in the city and pumped towards the east through pump stations into
centralized larger “trunk lines” to be treated at the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant
(part of the county's Joint Outfall System, which consists of six treatment plants and four
submarine outfalls). This plant is operated and maintained by the Los Angeles County
Sanitation Districts, and is located in the City of Carson, approximately five miles east of
the city. This plant serves communities throughout the entire South Bay, as well as
communities located as far east as Downey and as far north as Inglewood.
Based on residential per capita population totals and net built square footage totals for all
commercial and industrial space city-wide, it is estimated that the average daily sewage
                                               3-54
                                                                                        9/1/93

generation rate for the City of Redondo Beach totaled approximately 14.5 million gallons
per day (mgd) in 1989 (Source: Rosenberg and Associates, 1990).
The Joint Water Pollution Control Plant in Carson, California is currently treating sewage
at a 12-month average flow of 382 million gallons per day (mgd); the plant has a design
capacity of 385 million gallons per day (mgd), and a peak flow capacity of 770 million
gallons per day (mgd). The plant's operational capacity is expected to increase in the
future, as a result of the expected 1992 completion of the San Jose Creek Treatment Plant
expansion, which currently diverts its daily excess sewage flow to the Joint Water
Pollution Control Plant.
All sewage processed at the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant in Carson receives
advanced primary treatment, 200 million gallons per day (mgd) (or 52 percent of the
total) receives additional secondary treatment. The treated sewage is disposed into the
ocean at submarine outfalls located at White's Point off of the Palos Verdes Peninsula.
Existing Facilities
The entire City of Redondo Beach sewer system includes approximately 550,000 linear
feet (or approximately 104 miles) of sewer main, and approximately 1,750 manholes.
The majority of the system is composed of 8-inch diameter sewer mains with some
10-inch, 12-inch, and 15-inch sewers (including the larger collection “trunk lines”). In
addition, the local system contains a series of 6 pump stations owned, operated, and
maintained by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts (Figure 18).
Analysis indicates that approximately 90 percent (totaling 495,000 linear feet) of the total
sewer main length in the city is operated and maintained by the City of Redondo Beach
Public Works Department. The remaining ten percent (totaling 55,000 linear feet) is
operated and maintained by the County of Los Angeles Sanitation Districts (Figure 18).
The various sewer mains operated and maintained by the County of Los Angeles
Sanitation Districts are concentrated in five specific areas of the city:
(1) A main running northwest to southeast parallel to and due south of the San Diego
      (405) Freeway right-of-way between Marine Avenue and Manhattan Beach
      Boulevard in North Redondo Beach;
(2) A main running north to south, originating at Marine Avenue and bisecting the
      southern half of the TRW complex running along Doolittle Drive, east along
      Manhattan Beach Boulevard, south along Rindge Lane, east along Bataan Road,
      south along Vail Avenue, east along Curtis Street, and south along Mackay Lane,
      terminating into the main at its intersection with Mathews Avenue;
                                              3-55
                                                                                      9/1/93


(3) A main running west to east, beginning at Pruitt Drive running due south of 184th
      Street to the City of Torrance boundary and connecting into Hawthorne Boulevard
      in the City of Torrance;
(4) A main running north to south, beginning at the City of Hermosa Beach boundary
      due east of Francisca Avenue, running south and following Francisca Avenue,
      turning southwest following Beryl Street, turning south following Broadway,
      turning southwest following Carnelian Street, turning south following Catalina
      Avenue, turning southwest following Diamond Street, turning south running under
      the Harbor/Pier parking structure, turning east following Torrance Boulevard,
      turning south following the Esplanade, turning east up Avenue “D” to rejoin
      Catalina Avenue, turning south following Catalina Avenue, and terminating into a
      city sewer line at South Elena Avenue; and
(5) A series of mains serving the old “Clifton Heights” area of the city, that was
      formerly under sole control by the County of Los Angeles, but was annexed by the
      City of Redondo Beach in the early 1980's. This area includes all the sewer mains
      serving a “reverse L-shaped” area approximately 15-acres in size, roughly bounded
      by Knob Hill Avenue to the north, the City of Torrance boundary to the east,
      Avenue “F” to the south, Prospect Avenue to the west, Avenue “D” to the south,
      and Pacific Coast Highway to the west.
System Status
The Preliminary Sewer Master Plan, prepared in January, 1990 for the City of Redondo
Beach Public Works Department by consultant Donald G. Rosenberg & Associates,
Incorporated, determined that the overall condition of the City’s system (i.e., quality of
the physical condition of the pipes, etc.) is above average; no significant leakage or
caving problems have been experienced or reported.
The report has also concluded that the City's sewer system is currently operating at
approximately 70 percent of the capacity projected at the ultimate buildout of the city
under the existing General Plan. This analysis further translated into a conclusion that
approximately 100,000 linear feet of sewer main (or 15 percent of the entire system)
would be operating at or above design capacity by the year 2020 (based on buildout
under existing zoning). These areas have been identified and highlighted (Figure 19).
These impacts will be similar to those experienced under a full buildout of the maximum
land use and building densities allowed under the Land Use Plan of the updated General
Plan.
                                           3-57
                                                                                     9/1/93


Planned Improvements
Within the findings of the aforementioned sewer master plan study, a list of the ten most
critical sewer main facilities to be supplemented with parallel sewer mains for additional
capacity were compiled and recommended (two of which are major county trunk lines)
(Table 46).
Because of the high cost of such capital improvements, an additional development fee
should be considered by the City to underwrite the cost of these necessary replacements.
A nexus study should be performed to determine the appropriate amount of money per
dwelling unit (for residential construction) or per square foot (for commercial or
industrial construction) that could be reasonably assessed to new development within the
City for this purpose.
3.2.2 Storm Drainage Service
Existing System
Storm drainage service within the City of Redondo Beach is provided through a
cooperative multi-jurisdictional system with different facilities, some of which are
operated and maintained by the City of Redondo Beach Public Works Department, and
some of which are maintained by the County of Los Angeles Department of Public
Works Flood Control District.
In general, the storm drainage pattern of the city includes a network of storm drainage
catch basins at street level and pipes under streets that collect and carry storm and excess
water from the city in three general patterns (Figure 20):
(1) Storm water that is collected and drained from the north and northeast portions of
      North Redondo Beach is carried out of the city through the city and county pipe
      system and drains into the major regional drainage facility of Dominguez Channel
      to the east;
(2) Storm water that is collected and drained from the southern portion of North
      Redondo Beach and all of South Redondo Beach is carried and drained into the
      Pacific Ocean through one of the thirteen different drainage outfalls that are located
      along the southwestern shoreline of the city; and
(3) Water that is collected in one of the five different sumps or sump pumps located
      throughout the city that is force-pumped back into and through the system and
      drained through one of the ocean drainage outfall pipes.
                                             3-59
                                                                                       9/1/93


The existing storm drainage system serving the City of Redondo Beach includes a total of
approximately 29.1 miles of gravity flow storm drain and 0.3 miles of forced flow storm
drain. These drains are located sporadically throughout the city, with approximately
one-third of the entire city's streets served and underlain by storm drains. The pipes
range in diameter from 18 inches to 96 inches, depending on location and anticipated
maximum flow.
The majority of the storm drains are located in North Redondo Beach; the elevated
topography of portions of South Redondo Beach is such that the eastern half of that area
of the city has better natural drainage, and is not as intensely served by storm drainage
infrastructure.
Approximately 25 percent of the storm drainage system is owned, operated, and
maintained by the City of Redondo Beach Public Works Department; the remaining 75
percent of the system is owned, operated, and maintained by the Los Angeles County
Department of Public Works Flood Control District.
In addition to the pipes and drainage system, there are three city-operated sumps and
pump stations and two city-operated independent sump pumps that collect excess and
storm water into sumps. This excess water is then pumped up into gravity flow drains
which carry the water out to the Pacific Ocean through one or more of the
aforementioned drainage outfalls. The locations of these sumps and sump pumps include
(Figure 20):
(1) A sump and sump pump located in the eastern center of North Redondo Beach
     within the Mathews Parkette at the northwest corner of the intersection of Green
     Lane and Mathews Lane;
(2) A large sump and sump pump (the Wylie-Steinlart sump) located in the southeastern
     portion of North Redondo Beach, roughly bounded by Artesia Boulevard (the City
     of Manhattan Beach boundary) to the north, Ford Avenue to the east, and Goodman
     Avenue to the west;
(3) A large sump and sump pump located in the far southeastern portion of South
     Redondo Beach within the Massena Parkette, roughly bounded by Massena Avenue
     to the west, Avenue “H” to the north, and the City of Torrance boundary to the east;
(4) An independent sump pump located in the center of South Redondo Beach, within
     the low-lying area of the Redondo Union High School athletic fields, roughly
     bounded by Vincent Street to the south, Prospect Avenue to the east, and Del Amo
     Street to the north; and
                                            3-62
                                                                                     9/1/93

(5) An independent sump pump located in the far southeastern portion of South
      Redondo Beach at the base of South Irena Avenue directly abutting the City of
      Torrance boundary to the east.
In addition to the inland storm drainage system, the harbor and harbor basin area of the
City (located in the northwestern area of South Redondo Beach and including the various
marinas located in the City) are protected from coastal flooding and damage related to
storm-generated flooding by a large rock/stone material rip-rap breakwater wall.
The breakwater extends out like a large arm extending out to the west due south of the
terminus of Herondo Street, and curving to the south approximately 3,000 linear feet
(over one half of a mile), serving as a protective wall between the open and exposed
portions of Santa Monica Bay and the Pacific Ocean and the structures, areas, and boats
located in the northern coastal area of the City.
In the 1930's a small breakwater facility was installed to protect the harbor area from
flooding and storm-related damage. In the mid 1950's the existing large breakwater
facility (at a height of 14 feet above the mean low water level) was constructed; in 1963
portions of the facility were elevated to a height of 20 feet above the mean low water
level. There is also a project currently underway between the City of Redondo Beach
and the United States Army Corps of Engineers to elevate the height level of the
remainder of the existing breakwater to 20 feet above the mean low water level, to extend
the southern portion of the breakwater approximately 150 linear feet, and to raise the
southern portion of the breakwater to a height of 16 feet above the mean low water level.
These improvements will further enhance the ability of the breakwater to protect the
harbor area from flooding and storm-related damage.
Prior to any of this protection, significant damage had occurred to a number of major
structures and areas of the harbor. Even recently (within the last five years), particularly
violent weather systems have caused storm-related damage to the Portofino Inn and the
Municipal Pier structures.
The roadways and structures along Harbor Drive and the Esplanade, located due east of
the public beach area extending almost the entire length of South Redondo Beach, are
also protected from coastal-related damage and flooding. These areas are elevated
approximately eight feet above the level of the beach area, and are further protected by a
concrete block retaining wall running along the length of the Esplanade.
System Status/Planned Improvements
Overall, the city’s storm drainage system is in good physical and operational condition.
One major issue that has arisen, due to the lack of storm drainage facility coverage
throughout the entire city, is the continued incidence of long standing “nuisance” or
                                             3-63
                                                                                       9/1/93

excess water generated by common day-to-day domestic activities [i.e., washing of
vehicles, irrigation of lawns or planting areas, etc.]. Because of the lack of drainage
facilities in some areas of the city, this water remains and pools in curbside gutters for
long periods of time until it evaporates naturally, and thus, can become a moderate public
safety and health hazard.
The City of Redondo Beach Department of Public Works is presently making
incremental improvements to the system with monies budgeted from the city’s General
Fund to improve this situation.
In addition, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works Flood Control Division
has three storm drainage improvement projects currently in differing planning or study
stages that will impact the City of Redondo Beach. These capital improvements would
be funded by future Los Angles County bond financing projects. These include (Figure
21):
(1)     The Vincent Street Drain Project: this project will add a new gravity-forced
        drainage line that will serve to drain the sump and pump station within the
        Redondo Union High School athletic fields, will drain and run west, serving
        Vincent Street to Broadway; will drain and run north, serving Broadway from
        Vincent Street to Beryl Street; will drain and run west, serving Beryl Street to
        Harbor Drive; and will drain and run south just west of Harbor Drive, joining and
        draining through an existing outfall pipe into the Pacific Ocean off of Mole D in
        the harbor/pier area.
        This new drain will serve to supplement the existing drain running from the
        athletic field sump down Diamond Street and along Broadway, Beryl Street, and
        Harbor Drive to the same ocean outfall.
(2)     The Knob Hill Coast Drain Project: this project will add a new gravity-forced
        drain running and draining north to south along Pacific Coast Highway from
        Avenue “A” to Avenue “G,” running and draining west along Avenue “G” to the
        Esplanade, running and draining north along the Esplanade, and connecting and
        draining through the existing outfall pipe into the Pacific Ocean parallel to Avenue
        “F.”
        This drain will serve to supplement the system in the southern end of the city
        adjacent to Pacific Coast Highway which are currently underserved by storm
        drainage and subject to sporadic flooding and extensive standing “nuisance”
        water.
                                             3-64
                                                                                        9/1/93


               (3)     The Doris Coast Pump Station Project: this project will add
        improvements on the City of Torrance side of the Avenue “H” sump pump, but
        will also include improvements on the Redondo Beach side of the system. These
        improvements will include the construction of a gravity-forced storm drain (with
        catch basins) running from and serving the Avenue “H” sump pump, running and
        draining west along Avenue “G” and connecting into the future Knob Hill Coast
        Drain at the intersection of Avenue “G” and Pacific Coast Highway. This drain
        will enhance drainage from and disposal of water from the Avenue “H” sump
        pump, and will also serve to supplement the system in the residential areas of the
        southern end of the city adjacent to Pacific Coast Highway.
These areas are currently underserved by storm drainage, and are subject to sporadic
flooding and extensive standing “nuisance” water.
As previously mentioned, there is also a project currently underway between the City of
Redondo Beach and the United States Army Corps of Engineers to elevate the height
level of the remainder of the existing breakwater to 20 feet above the mean low water
level, to extend the southern portion of the breakwater approximately 150 linear feet, and
to raise the southern portion of the breakwater to a height of 16 feet above the mean low
water level. These improvements will further enhance the ability of the breakwater to
protect the harbor area from flooding and storm-related damage.
3.2.3 Water Service
The City of Redondo Beach receives its water service from the California Water Service
Company (CWSC), an investor-owned public utility whose operations are regulated by
the State of California Public Utilities Commission (PUC). The California Water Service
Company has been providing water service to the community since 1927.
For operational and maintenance purposes, the City of Redondo Beach is classified
within the Hermosa-Redondo District, an area containing all of the City of Hermosa
Beach, all of the City of Redondo Beach, and an 800-acre portion of the City of Torrance
located directly south and southwest of the City of Redondo Beach.
Existing Conditions and Facilities
The Hermosa-Redondo District contains a total of 209 miles (1.1 million linear feet) of
water main supplying and distributing all of the water to the district. The City of
Redondo Beach contains 136.8 miles of water main (65 percent of all the district's
mains); the City of Torrance contains 28.6 miles of water mains (14 percent of the
district's mains), and the City of Hermosa Beach contains 43.6 miles of water main (21
percent of all the district's mains). Unfortunately, all usage data compiled for the water
                                             3-66
                                                                                     9/1/93

service district are compiled for the area as a whole, and cannot be broken down into
figures for the individual cities.
All water supplied to and used in the City of Redondo Beach comes from one of two
sources:
(1) Water purchased by the California Water Service Company from the larger, regional
      Metropolitan Water District. This water is pumped into the city through four
      Metropolitan Water District connector lines, two that are located in the far north end
      of North Redondo Beach (one near the intersection of Inglewood Boulevard and
      Manhattan Beach Boulevard and one near the intersection of Freeman Boulevard
      and Manhattan Beach Boulevard and two that are located outside of the City of
      Redondo Beach but are connected through mains into the city (one near the
      intersection of Redondo Street and Manhattan Beach Boulevard in the City of
      Manhattan Beach and one near the intersection of 242nd Street and Walnut Street in
      the City of Torrance) (Figure 22); and
(2) Water pumped up from local groundwater sources by the California Water Service
      Company through a series of three wells located in the far north end of North
      Redondo Beach (one near the intersection of Felton Lane and Vanderbilt Lane, one
      near the intersection of Felton Lane and Graham Avenue, and one near the
      intersection of Blaisdell Avenue and Inglewood Avenue (Figure 22).
Approximately 85 percent of the water supplied to and used in the City of Redondo
Beach is purchased from the Metropolitan Water District, while approximately 15
percent is pumped up from groundwater sources through wells in the city.
Existing water facilities within the City of Redondo Beach also include:
• The 136.8 miles of California Water Service Company water mains serving the city.
    The water mains are located running below virtually every street in the city,
    branching off into connections to distribute water to residences and businesses. The
    diameters and materials of the mains running under the streets range from the 2-inch,
    to 4-inch, to 6-inch, or 8-inch cast iron and asbestos lined concrete pipes; larger
    10-inch or 16-inch cast iron and asbestos lined concrete mains which connect into the
    storage reservoirs or Metropolitan Water District supply lines located within the city.
    Pressure rates in the mains range from approximately 40 pounds per square inch (psi)
    to 120 pounds per square inch (psi).
• A series of three California Water Service Company reservoirs (containing a total of
    seven storage tanks). The total storage capacity of these tanks at any one time is 14.5
    million gallons of water. The specific geographic locations of these reservoir

              reservoir contains two storage tanks with capacities of 3.5 million gallons
              and 3.5 million gallons respectively, for a total storage capacity of 7.0
              million gallons.
      -       There are also two California Water Service Company reservoirs, Reservoir
              #6 and Reservoir #9, that are technically located within the City of
              Hermosa Beach (due east of the intersection of Harper Avenue and Ormond
              Lane) but serve the City of Redondo Beach. This reservoir contains five
              storage tanks with a total storage capacity of 6.0 million gallons.
   • A series of 11 pump stations scattered throughout the City of Redondo Beach (five
      in North Redondo Beach and six in South Redondo Beach) that pump the water
      through the distribution system and keep the water pressure at correct rates

The California Water Service Company reports that it is presently meeting all of the
districts existing water service needs. Although the vast majority of the systems pipes are
in better than average conditions (even some of the older cast iron pipes that are more
than 60 years old), the company is currently carrying out a program to replace its 2-inch
and 4-inch mains with standard 6-inch main.
In addition, the California Water Service Company is replacing 2,610 feet of 6-inch main
on Curtis Street and Herrin Street and 1,040 feet of 6-inch main on Hill Street. The cost
of these improvements is absorbed by being billed back to the customers incrementally
through their monthly utility bill.

3.2.4 Electricity Service
Electric service to the City of Redondo Beach is provided exclusively by the Southern
California Edison Company (SCE). For operational and maintenance purposes, the City
of Redondo Beach is encompassed within Edison's Southern Region, which includes the
South Bay/South County area bounded by Inglewood on the north, Long Beach on the
south, and the 605 freeway on the east.
Existing Facilities
The primary existing Southern California Edison Company facility located within the
City of Redondo Beach is the main regional power generation plant located on a 41-acre
parcel in South Redondo Beach, roughly bounded by Harbor Drive to the west, Herondo
Street to the north, the abandoned railroad right-of-way due west of Francisca Avenue
and North Catalina Avenue to the east, and Beryl Street to the south (Figure 23). The
plant is currently operating at approximately 30 percent capacity, with only four of the
eight generators “on-line.”
Southern California Edison also operates four neighborhood high-voltage substations in
the city. Victoria Substation (Blossom Lane and 190th Street) and Ditmar Substation
(Vanderbilt Lane and Flagler Lane), serve north Redondo Beach. Redondo Substation
(Pacific Coast Highway and Beryl Street) and Topaz Substation (Knob Hill Avenue and
Prospect Avenue) serve south Redondo Beach (Figure 23).
The vast majority of electrical infrastructure within the city is distributed through wires
running along above-ground wooden poles. This distribution system originiates from
neighborhood substations which receive power from larger transmission substations
located outside of the city. The transmission substations are supplied power in-part by
transmission lines on above-ground metal "towers" located within turfed rights-of-way.
The Edison transmission corridors in north Redondo Beach contain metal towers carrying
electricity generated at the El Segundo Generating Station and also electricity transmitted
from Edison's La Fresa Substation in Torrance. The towers on the right-of-way generally
paralleling Herondo/190th Streets transmit electricity generated at the Redondo
Generating Stations (Figure 23).
Planned Improvements
Recently, the city has engaged in the process of securing funding and working with the
Southern California Edison Company to remove the unsightly above-ground service
poles and wires and locate them below-ground. The first priority of the project was to
remove the above ground utilities along the Artesia Boulevard commercial corridor,
which was completed in 1991. As additional funds for this purpose become available,
the City of
                                            3-71
                                                                                      9/1/93


Redondo Beach Public Works Department and Southern California Edison Company will
prioritize and undertake similar projects in other areas of the city.
                                             3-73
                                                                            9/1/93
The City of Redondo Beach Public Works Department is now requiring that new
commercial and multi-family residential projects built in the city provide underground
electrical utility service to their sites. This incremental process will, over time,
significantly increase the amount of the city served by underground utilities and relieved
of the visual blight of above ground poles and wires.
3.2.5 Natural Gas Service
Natural gas service to the City of Redondo Beach is provided exclusively by the Southern
California Gas Company. For operational, maintenance, and planning purposes, the City
of Redondo Beach is classified within the South Coastal Division. This Division
includes all communities west of the Harbor (110) Freeway from San Pedro north to the
Ventura County line. The city is further classified into the 182nd Street Division, whose
jurisdiction includes all of the City of Redondo Beach and the City of Torrance.
Existing Facilities
The vast majority of natural gas infrastructure and facilities within the City of Redondo
Beach are the series and networks of underground pipelines that distribute the gas to the
various residential, commercial, and industrial land uses throughout the area. These
pipelines run up and down below virtually every street in the city, with diameters ranging
from 12-inch trunk lines running down major streets to 4-inch supply lines running down
smaller streets and serving residential neighborhoods.
System Status/Planned Improvements
At this time, the Southern California Gas Company reports that the infrastructure and
supply system serving natural gas to the City of Redondo Beach is in good working order
and has the capability to the serve the city's future needs relative to natural gas supply
and capacity. For these reasons, no major improvements or upgrades, above those
normally scheduled under the gas company's ongoing plan for the replacement of older
infrastructure are presently scheduled for the system.
3.2.6 Telecommunications Services
As with most urbanized areas, the City of Redondo Beach is fully served by modern
telecommunications services. Telecommunications services available within the City of
Redondo Beach fall into two general categories: 1) telephone service; and 2) cable
television service.
                                             3-74
                                                                                      9/1/93
Telephone Service
As a result of legislation and actions including the federal deregulation of telephone
services and the mandated “break-up” of the Bell Telephone Company, telephone service
and equipment in the City of Redondo Beach are available through a number of different
providers.
Overall, the licensing and regulation of the different providers and overseer of these
services is the State of California Public Utilities Commission (PUC). The dominant
public (coin-operated) and private telephone provider in the City of Redondo Beach area
is the General Telephone and Electric Company (GTE).
Basic hookups to residences and local telephone service in the city are provided through
General Telephone and Electric Company (GTE). Individual users of the telephones then
have a myriad of selections available to them regarding their actual choice of service
options and long distance telephone service providers.
Businesses who desire public (coin-operated) telephone service in or around their
establishments arrange for the infrastructure (telephone and booth or station) and service
hook-up and pay a one-time installation fee (approximately $150.00) and monthly charge
(approximately $35.00) to the provider.
Cellular (or mobile) telephone service is also available throughout the City, provided to
individual users by a number of service companies licensed and monitored by the State of
California Public Utilities Commission (PUC). The City has little or no control over the
provision of cellular telephone service, other than oversight and approval authority over
the siting and operation of any cellular transmission antennas proposed to be located
within the City limits. The siting and design of these facilities are subject to the City's
conditional use permit review and approval process.
Cable Television Service
Cable television service within the City of Redondo Beach is provided exclusively by the
Century Cable Company, a national privately-owned cable television franchise
corporation. Century Cable Company has been providing cable television service to the
City of Redondo Beach since 1973, with local offices located at 2925 West 182nd Street
in Redondo Beach.
Century Cable Company currently serves approximately 14,930 subscribers (including
residential household, businesses, and restaurant/bar establishments) city-wide, offering a
34 channel menu, with one locally-originating community channel (i.e., broadcasting
local government and public interest programming and notices).
                                            3-75
                                                                                      9/1/93

The company estimates that it has approximately 110 linear miles of cable wiring
distributed across the city; approximately 85 percent of the service is wired above-ground
along telephone poles, while approximately 15 percent of the services are wired below
ground.
Century Cable Company's fixed franchise agreement term with the city has recently
expired; the company is now working and operating under a six month interim contract
until such time as the new longer-term franchise is awarded.
3.2.7 Groundwater (Seawater) Intrusion Barrier
Because of its low-lying coastal setting directly adjacent to Santa Monica Bay and the
Pacific Ocean, the southern half of the city experiences two geologic-related conditions
that do not occur in the northern half of the city and do not occur in most cities. These
conditions include:
(1) Being underlain by groundwater aquifers that are a valuable source of local and
      regional domestic water; and
(2) Having the potential of nearby saltwater sources (Santa Monica Bay and the Pacific
      Ocean) intruding into (i.e., seeping underground) and contaminating the local
      groundwater sources.
In order to prevent this occurrence and protect the condition of these local groundwater
sources, the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts Flood Control Division installed
and maintains a saltwater intrusion barrier (crossing through the southern half of the
City).
The intrusion barrier, formally known as the West Coast Basin Barrier Project, is a series
of several hundred freshwater injection wells, running north to south for approximately
eight miles down the coast from a point just south of Los Angeles International Airport in
El Segundo to the north to the northern tip of Palos Verdes to the south. The wells
follow North Prospect Avenue in the City of Hermosa Beach and Prospect Street in the
City of Redondo Beach. The majority of the barrier wells were installed in the mid
1960's and were built entirely through bonds issued by the Los Angeles County
Sanitation Districts.
The freshwater is pumped into the ground through the wells, forms a barrier (or wall) of
high-pressure freshwater that seals out any seawater which may attempt to seep and
intrude past the line of wells into the valuable local groundwater aquifers located to the
east. Approximately 45 of the freshwater injection wells are currently located within the
City of Redondo Beach. The depth of the wells drilled in the city differ, generally
ranging from approximately 270 feet below sea level in the northern half of South
                                            3-76
                                                                                      9/1/93
Redondo Beach to approximately 830 feet below sea level in the southern half of South
Redondo Beach. Additional freshwater injection wells are added over time, as necessary,
to keep the pressure and levels of freshwater at sufficient levels to keep out the seawater.
3.2.8 Petroleum Extraction/Pipeline Operations
Although petroleum extraction has, in general, declined markedly over time in the South
Bay and the City of Redondo Beach, a number of small oil wells still operate in the city
and distribute petroleum within and outside the city through a series of underground
pipelines.
At present, the three primary and highly visible petroleum extraction wells that remain
active within the City of Redondo Beach include:
(1) The Standard Pacific Oil facility, located in the northwestern portion of South
      Redondo Beach, roughly bounded by North Gertruda Avenue to the north, North
      Francisca Avenue to the west and south, and North Catalina Avenue to the east.
(2) The Petro-Lewis Oil facility, located in the southeastern portion of South Redondo
      Beach (within Alta Vista Park), roughly bounded by Julia Avenue to the east,
      Camino Real to the north, South Juanita Avenue to the west, and Serpentine Street
      to the south. This facility has an underground pipeline that runs east up Camino
      Real and then runs north under Prospect Street, eventually tying into the major
      Southern California Edison petroleum pipeline running adjacent to Anita Street; and
(3) The Titan Oil facility, located in the northwestern portion of South Redondo Beach
      (within the Harbor/Pier complex), at the northwestern intersection of Harbor Drive
      and Portofino Way. This facility is approximately one-half of one acre in size, and
      is in the process of having all of its wells removed/capped and its operations closed.
In addition to these extraction facilities, a significant number of underground petroleum
distribution pipelines, owned and/or operated by the various existing petroleum
production and distribution companies serving other areas of the region run throughout
the City.
As previously mentioned, the Southern California Edison Company also runs
underground petroleum pipelines that supply fuel to the existing electricity generation
plant in South Redondo Beach. These pipelines are primarily located within and under
the existing turfed Southern California Edison rights-of-way that include the elevated
high-tension electricity transmission wires and support standards.
                                               3-77
                                                                                        9/1/93
Future Improvements
Although these facilities, overall, have operated and continue to operate safely and
“trouble-free” their long-term monitoring and maintenance (relative to pressure levels,
leaks, etc.) continues to be a relevant concern. The significant numbers and length of
pipelines running throughout different areas of the city (a number of them within
residential neighborhoods), their age, and their operation by a host of different and
independent private companies and entities all contribute to raise questions about the
means through which these pipelines are operated and maintained.
Two means of improving the situation have been suggested by the City of Redondo
Beach Public Works Department (the first task has already been initiated by the
department):
(1) Developing and maintaining an accurate and updated catalogue and inventory of the
      locations, details (dimensions, materials, etc.), owner/operator, and contents of each
      well and pipeline running within the city.
(2) Adopting an ordinance which would require a formal inspection and monitoring of
      all petroleum extraction and transportation facilities in the City.
Implementation of these two suggestions would be expected to significantly decrease the
existing safety hazards associated with the present “laissez-faire” monitoring and
oversight of these wells and pipelines.
3.2.9 Goals, Objectives, and Policies
The following lists the goals, objectives, and policies for each of the fundamental utility
services provided and available within the City of Redondo Beach. The overall intent of
these goals, objectives, and policies is to 1) maintain and/or improve the level and quality
of utility services provided to existing and future residents, business people, and visitors
to the community, and 2) ensure that the construction and operation of new or upgraded
utility services keep pace with the amount of additional development that is projected to
occur in the city over the life span of the updated General Plan (to year 2010).

6.1.7     Pursue, through the Public Works Department, the creation and adoption of
          an ordinance that would establish a mandatory sewer impact fee (per unit or
          per square foot) for new development projects (above and beyond the
          existing sewer connection fees presently charged by the city and the
          county) to finance the capital improvements within the sanitary sewer
          system that have been or will be identified as necessary in the future to
          support such additional development.
6.1.8     Review and modify local sewer connection fees and monthly service
          charges, as necessary, to ensure that adequate amounts of fees and charges

6.1.10    Examine the feasibility and potential for the use of reclaimed water for
          irrigation and cleaning purposes, in both public and private facilities.
6.1.11    Wherever applicable and feasible, the City of Redondo Beach shall require
          that major water users in the community install systems for the collection of
          and use of reclaimed water as an irrigation and cleaning source.
Issue     STORM DRAINAGE SERVICE
Goal      It shall be the goal of the City of Redondo Beach (in cooperation with the
          Los Angeles County Department of Public Works Flood Control Division)
          to:
6B        Establish and maintain adequate planning, construction, maintenance, and
          funding for storm drainage facilities to support and serve the various land
          uses and intensities of development in the city and protect public health and
          safety; upgrading existing deficient systems and expanding the system,
          where necessary. The services shall be provided and system operated in an
          ecologically-sensitive manner.
Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach (in cooperation with
          the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works Flood Control
          Division) to:
                                         3-80
                                                                                   9/1/93
6.2      Ensure the provision of a comprehensive and modern system of storm
         drainage facilities that will adequately collect, convey, and remove/dispose

3.3 SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING
3.3.1 Solid Waste Management
The City of Redondo Beach (including all residential, commercial, and industrial land
uses) currently generates approximately 83,100 tons of solid waste per year
(approximately 228 tons per day). This amount of solid waste is expected to increase
proportionately in the future relative to the increase of the City’s residential population
and expansion of commercial/industrial activity.             Solid waste collection and
transportation in the City is currently provided by a private refuse collector, managed and
overseen by the City of Redondo Beach Public Works Department. This mirrors the
region-wide and nationwide trend of the privatization of numerous community services
and utility services, as feasibility and efficiency merits.
Western Waste Industries is the specific private solid waste collector presently under
formal contract to the City of Redondo Beach to service residential, commercial, and
industrial properties in the community. The one exception to this exclusive service
arrangement is TRW, which has been specifically excluded from the agreement with
Western Waste because they are such a large generator of refuse (over 50,000 cubic yards
annually).
In practice, the local garbage trucks pick up the solid waste from the source locations
(homes, and businesses) and transport it to refuse transfer stations, where larger trucks
haul the collected refuse to a range of different landfills across the region (Figure 24).
Western Waste Industries operates its transfer station out of Carson which hauls the
refuse to either the Chaquita Canyon, Ben K. Kazarian/West Covina, and Puente Hills
landfills. A small portion of Redondo Beach's refuse is taken to the Southeast Resource
Recovery Facility (SERFF), a waste-to-energy facility located in Long Beach.
Each of the aforementioned landfills serving the region (and the City of Redondo Beach)
will eventually be required to close after reaching their licensed capacities. Operational
permits may be granted, however, which extend the life of the landfills beyond the dates
given below. The latest projected closure dates of the respective landfills are as follows:
             Landfill                  Closure Date         Potential Capacity
             BKK West Covina           December, 1995       17 million tons
             Chaquita Canyon           November, 1999       28.9 million tons
             Puente Hills              October, 1993        70 million tons
                                               3-95
                                                                                        9/1/93


The primary issue facing the City of Redondo Beach in the area of solid waste disposal
and management, much like the region and the country, is that of the long-term life
span/availability, and environmental safety of our present system of primary solid waste
removal (i.e., dumping into landfills).
Currently approximately ninety percent (90%) of solid waste in the State of California is
dumped into the various landfills serving the State. All other related issues (i.e., number
of companies permitted or contracted to collect solid waste in the City, length of
contracts, etc., are secondary, and actually more in the line of practical implementation at
the “ground-level” on a day-to-day basis).
In addition, the State Legislature, through Assembly Bill 939, The California Integrated
Waste Management Act of 1989, mandated that all cities prepare, adopt, and submit a
comprehensive solid waste management plan to the county within which they are located
by January 1, 1992.
The plan must address and detail each individual community's efforts and intended
policies in the areas of waste characterization, source reduction, recycling, composting,
solid waste facilities, education/public information, funding, special wastes, and
hazardous wastes. The law also mandates that communities meet certain specific
identified targets for percentages of waste reduction and recycling over specified time
periods (25 percent by 1995 and 50 percent by the year 2000).
In an effort to effectively meet this mandate, the City of Redondo Beach City Council has
appointed a 7-member Resource Conservation Commission, who, under the auspices of
the Department of Public Works, are assisting the City in developing and adopting this
plan.
3.3.2 Recycling
The Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act of 1986 requires that all
convenience zones (any area within one-half mile from a grocery store) must have at least
one recycling facility. As of January 1, 1988 a fee of $100.00 per day was to be assessed
to each business in the convenience zone for non-attainment.
Pursuant to this State law, the City of Redondo Beach amended its municipal code in
order to conditionally permit recycling facilities in commercial and industrial zoning
districts.
Reverse vending machines and bulk reverse vending machines are permitted in
commercial and industrial zones following a non-discretionary approval. Small recycling
collection facilities are permitted under a conditional use permit. Larger recycling
                                             3-97
                                                                                       9/1/93

collection and processing facilities require a conditional use permit and site plan review
and approval.
In addition to these local zoning code amendments permitting convenience zone
recycling facilities, the City of Redondo Beach is currently implementing and continuing
to develop a progressive “curbside” recycling plan relative to single family residential
structures that will be expanded to include multi-family buildings in 1992.
For the single-family residential program, Western Waste provides two thirteen gallon,
orange-colored bins to each dwelling unit, in order to assist in the implementation of the
recycling program. One of the bins is used for glass, plastic and metal containers, while
the other bin is used for the collection of mixed waste paper products, including
newspaper. Western Waste picks up the recycling bins once per week with their regular
trash collection. Latest available figures indicate that City-wide, residents participating
in the program are presently recycling approximately nineteen percent (19%) of all
household waste.
The provision of recycling services to commercial/industrial properties is addressed in
the Integrated Solid Waste Management Plan, and provided for in the exclusive waste
removal contract.

          securing responsible long-term solutions for solid waste removal. These
          solutions may include, but, not be limited to: a) the securing of additional
          capacity and life span for existing operational landfills; b) the construction
          and operation of new solid waste landfills; and c) the construction and
          operation of “waste-to-energy” facilities.
7.1.2     The City of Redondo Beach (principally through the Department of Public
          Works) shall continue to analyze and interpret solid waste generation rates,
          waste removal practices, and other events and trends related to solid waste
          generation and removal, to further increase the effectiveness and efficiency
          of its removal and increase the potential and practice of solid waste
          management/reduction and recycling programs.
7.1.3     The City of Redondo Beach (principally through the Department of Public
          Works) shall continue to encourage, support, and monitor the efforts and
          activities of the City’s Environmental and Utilities Commission relative to
          solid waste removal and management and the creation and adoption of a
          comprehensive solid waste management plan. This body was appointed by
          the City Council to develop, adopt, and implement the City of Redondo
          Beach Solid Waste Management Plan, as mandated by the State Legislature
          in Assembly Bill 939.
7.1.4     The City of Redondo Beach shall implement a solid waste/recycling
          education and information dispersal campaign/program at the local level, in
          order to supplement those currently instituted by state and regional
          governments and non-profit organizations through the various television and
          print media.
Recycling
Goal      It shall be the goal of the City of Redondo Beach to:
7B        Increase the public awareness of the need to, and the means through which
          individual citizens, property owners, and business people in the community
          can successfully participate in local recycling programs.
Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Redondo Beach to:
7.2       Increase the range and amount of solid waste that is recycled throughout the
          community, in accordance with all applicable state and local requirements,
          while achieving the resultant environmental and financial benefits and
          advantages of such activities.

                                                                                   9/1/93

Policies    It shall be the policy of the City of Redondo Beach to:
7.2.1       In an effort to increase the rate and efficiency of recycling resources and
            collection facilities available to the community, the City of Redondo Beach,
            through its revised Municipal Code, shall continue to permit the siting and
            construction of reverse vending machines in commercial and industrial
            zones, shall continue to permit small recycling collection facilities in these
            zones through a conditional use permit process, and shall continue to permit
            large recycling collection and processing facilities through conditional use
            permit and site plan review procedures and approvals.
7.2.2       The City of Redondo Beach (principally through the Department of Public
            Works) shall continue to analyze and interpret solid waste generation rates,
            waste removal practices, and other events and trends related to solid waste
            generation and removal, to further increase the effectiveness and efficiency
            of its removal and increase the potential and practice of solid waste
            management/reduction and recycling programs.
7.2.3       The City of Redondo Beach (principally through the Department of Public
            Works) shall continue to encourage, support, and monitor the efforts and
            activities of the City’s Environmental and Utilities Commission relative to
            integrated waste management activities. This body was appointed by the
            City Council to develop and implement the City of Redondo Beach Solid
            Waste Management Plan, as mandated by the State Legislature in Assembly
            Bill 939.
7.2.4       In the interim, the City should continue to proactively encourage, engender,
            and monitor its existing “curbside” recycling plan, neighborhood and group
            recycling plans and efforts, recycling by larger property owners and
            commercial and industrial businesses to increase the amount of participation
            and range of materials that are presently being recycled.
7.2.5       The City of Redondo Beach shall, as feasible and appropriate, require that all
            new or remodeled multi-family residential, commercial, and industrial
            developments develop and submit a formal “recycling plan,” designating
            where and through which means materials will be stored for recycling
            purposes. The City Department of Public Works shall assist the City
            Community Development Department in reviewing these plans.
3.3.4 Solid Waste Management and Recycling Implementation Programs
The following presents the respective programs which shall be carried out by the City of

                                             3-100
                                                                                     9/1/93

and policies contained within the Solid Waste Management and Recycling Section. Each
implementation program is followed by a number or numbers indicating the pertinent
policy or policies which it is intended to help implement. Notwithstanding the language
in specific implementation measures, action by the City is subject to the availability of
funding and staff.
    • Representatives of the City of Redondo Beach Department of Public Works shall
       review relevant journals and technical reports, shall attend public agency
       presentations and professional seminars, and shall regularly contact and meet with
       representatives of local, regional, state, and federal government agencies and
       private solid waste removal purveyors in an attempt to monitor ongoing and
       evolving solid waste removal and management technology and policies, and assist
       in the pursuit of responsible, long-term solid waste removal and management
       (Policy 7.1.1).
    • Representatives of the City of Redondo Beach Department of Public Works shall
       continue to collect, monitor, analyze, and interpret data and events related to local
       solid waste generation, removal, and management. The findings of these efforts
       shall be used to improve local solid waste removal and management and improve
       source reduction activities and recycling efforts, in an effort to ensure local
       compliance with the adopted local Solid Waste Management Plan (Policy 7.1.2,
       7.2.2).
    • Representatives of the City of Redondo Beach Department of Public Works shall
       provide technical support, encouragement, and assistance to the City of Redondo
       Beach Environmental and Utilities Commission, as staffing and budgetary
       conditions allow, to assist this body in carrying out their intended role in the area
       of solid waste removal and management (Policy 7.1.3, 7.2.3).
    • Representatives of the City of Redondo Beach Department of Public Works and
       the City of Redondo Beach Environmental and Utilities Commission shall expend
       all reasonable efforts to assure that a comprehensive and legally-adequate City of
       Redondo Beach Solid Waste Management Plan is created and adopted, in
       accordance with the provisions of Assembly Bill 939. It shall also be a primary
       responsibility of these bodies to ensure that the Plan is updated, as necessary, to
       reflect evolving conditions and continues to conform with future local, regional,
       state, and federal regulations and legal requirements (Policy 7.1.3).
    • As staffing and budgetary conditions allow, representatives of the City of
       Redondo Beach Department of Public Works shall create educational and public
       informational programs to better inform the community about the issues and
       responsibilities related to solid waste removal and management. Such efforts shall
       include, but not be limited to: pamphlets and newsletters, speaking appearances or
                                             3-101
                                                                                       9/1/93

  presentations before local school, business, and community groups, and “seminar”
  format presentations that can be broadcast on a regular basis on the local cable
  television government access channel (Policy 7.1.4).
• The revised City of Redondo Beach Municipal Code shall contain specific
  provisions including: 1) permitting the siting and construction of reverse vending
  machines in local commercial and industrial zones; 2) allowing the siting and
  construction of small recycling collection facilities in these zones (through the
  conditional use permit process); and 3) allowing the siting and construction of
  large recycling collection and processing facilities (through the conditional use
  permit and site plan review process), in order to increase the rate and efficiency of
  local recycling efforts (Policy 7.2.1).
• Prior to and in addition to formal adoption of the City of Redondo Beach Solid
  Waste Management Plan, the City of Redondo Beach Department of Public Works
  shall continue to manage and monitor the existing local “curbside” recycling
  program. This effort shall include ongoing meetings with and presentations before
  local businesses, property owners, and resident or community groups to increase
  awareness of the need to recycle, and visits or inspections to monitor and further
  ensure compliance and performance in these areas by the targeted “recyclers”
  (Policy 7.2.4).
• The City of Redondo Beach shall, as feasible and appropriate, include a provision
  for the inclusion and review of mandated formal “recycling” plans in the
  environmental and site plan review and approval process of all new or remodeled
  multi-family residential, commercial, and industrial development proposals. This
  component shall be incorporated into the overall development and environmental
  review and approval process (potentially through a provision within the revised
  City of Redondo Beach Municipal Code). These “recycling” plans must
  specifically designate where and through which means materials will be stored,
  separated, and processed for recycling purposes (Policy 7.2.5).

emissions, it does not specify how climate

guidelines are certified by the California

Suggestions from community members to
address congested traffic intersections
included:
•    additional lanes
•    roundabouts
•    one-way couplets
•    reversible lanes
•    additional turn lanes
•    extended turn lanes
•    signal synchronization
•    signal timing
•    smart lights
•    left-turn signals
•    left-turn prohibitions
Additional community recommendations for
improving vehicular circulation included
grade separation for the railroad line at
Inglewood Avenue and Manhattan Beach
Boulevard, adding more public parking near
Artesia Boulevard, fixing potholes, and
improving enforcement of speed limits.

Parking Near Transit
Establishing parking maximums around
transit investments is an indispensable
strategy for maximizing transit ridership.
When a destination’s parking supply is
scarce, visitors are discouraged from
arriving by car. Alternately, if drivers are
accommodated, transit ridership will be
compromised. By setting a lower maximum
number of parking spaces for land uses
within a half mile of transit stops, the City
helps to ensure a proper return on their
transit investments.
This off-street parking lot near Harbor Drive in Redondo
Beach is priced 24 hours a day.
Pricing and Duration of Parking
To ensure the economic vitality of
businesses in Redondo Beach, public
parking must be priced to balance adequate
turnover and availability for all types of uses
in the area. If turnover is inadequate,
customers will be unable to find parking.
Maintaining a parking occupancy rate of
85% or less guarantees that there will be
sufficient vacant spaces for arriving drivers.
Dynamically adjusting the price of parking
based on observed demand is the most
effective and efficient means of arriving at
85% occupancy or less. When the price of
parking is too low or the duration too long,
parking spaces are monopolized by drivers
who park for extended periods. When
parking is priced for turnover at 85%
occupancy, people will park only as long as
necessary and the maximum number of
customers will be able to utilize available
parking.

in specified transit zones.
4. Beach Cities Transit & Visitor Information
Kiosks: create one or more kiosks with
information for using Beach Cities Transit
5. Beach Cities Transit Wi-Fi Service Pilot
Program: initiate a pilot program on Beach
Cities Transit Line 109 to provide Wi-Fi to
riders
6. Integrated Bicycle Master Plan: develop a
bicycle master plan and invest in bicycle
infrastructure and marketing
The Sustainable City Plan includes several
indicators to evaluate the success of its
transportation goals:
•    traffic congestion
•    alternative mode usage
•    public transit ridership
•    abundance of bicycle lanes, paths, and
     storage
•    accessibility of public transit
Together, these six transportation goals and
their performance indicators work towards a
more sustainable transportation system for
Redondo Beach.
Realization of these transportation and land
use goals will be dependent on a number of
implementable steps, including:
•    Funding within the City’s annual
     operating budget
•    Funding within the City’s five-year
     Capital Improvement Program
•    Availability of sub-regional, state, and
     federal funding
•    Cooperative efforts with neighboring
     jurisdictions

                                                     Class II Bike Lanes
                                                     Bike lanes provide painted striping within the
                                                     paved area of highways. Bike lane stripes
                                                     are intended to promote an orderly flow of
                                                     traffic by establishing specific lines of
                                                     demarcation between areas reserved for
                                                     bicycles and lanes for motor vehicles.

                        Prepared by:
                        The Lightfoot Planning Group
                        Under the Direction of:
                        City of Redondo Beach

                        Services Department
3.4.3 Recreation and Parks Element
The availability of public parkland and recreational facilities greatly influences the
quality of life in the City of Redondo Beach. Not only does recreation contribute to the
health and well-being of residents, it builds a sense of community by creating low-cost
opportunities for physical, social, and cultural interaction.
Redondo Beach is a premier coastal community offering many outstanding recreational
opportunities. The City has two miles of beach frontage, an active harbor and fishing
pier, the recently renovated Performing Arts Center, three senior centers, and a multitude
of parks providing one-of-a-kind recreational facilities and classes. Redondo Beach is a
place of regional interest, attracting permanent residents and visitors alike.
This updated Recreation and Parks Element sets forth policies and implementation
measures to enhance the unique characteristics of the City and its coastline. Such
policies support ongoing maintenance and facilitate expansion and improvement of
parkland, recreational facilities, and programs. The goals, objectives, and policies
established in the City’s previous Recreation Element have been updated based on
changes in the parks and recreation facilities and programs inventory. Other factors,
such as updated demographic data and projections, a current public needs assessment, an
evaluation of facility deficiencies, improved relations with stakeholders, and the
consideration of alternative funding measures have also been taken into account in
formulating recommendations that will shape the future of the recreational experience in
Redondo Beach.
Planning for additional recreational facilities and parkland in the City is becoming
increasingly difficult because Redondo Beach is well established and has few vacant
parcels. As the overall City population continues to grow, the dilemma of where and
how to expand will be compounded. As Redondo Beach approaches build-out,
optimizing existing resources will become essential.
Two departments and one Commission are responsible for operation, maintenance, and
oversight of the City’s parks and recreation facilities and programs. The Recreation and
Community Services Department manages the City’s parkland and recreation facilities
and programs. The Department’s administrative offices are located at 320 Knob Hill
Avenue, adjacent to the Knob Hill Community Center. The Public Works Department
maintains City parks and facilities. The Department’s administrative offices are located
531 North Gertruda Avenue. The Recreation and Parks Commission serves as an
advisory body to the Recreation and Community Services Department and Public Works
Department, and reports to the City Council. The Commission is comprised of seven
appointed members who review proposed uses and development in zoning areas
classified as Parks, Recreation and Open Space (PRO).
This Element provides the Recreation and Community Services Department with
measures to maximize the use of existing resources, as well as expand upon available
opportunities through creative financing measures and cooperative relationships with
other City departments and local agencies and organizations.
                                           3-116

    The Element is organized to first describe and categorize existing park and recreation
    resources and current conditions within the community. Second, there is a discussion of
    future needs and funding considerations. Third, goals, objectives, and policies are
    provided within five major categories: Coastal Zone, Parkland, Recreation Facilities,
    Recreation Program, and Funding Mechanisms. Fourth, there is an Implementation
    Program.
    Overview of Parkland and Recreation Facilities System and Inventory
    The City of Redondo Beach presently contains a total of 35 public parks, open space
    areas, and recreation sites, occupying approximately 155.08 acres (0.24 square miles) of
    land. Park and recreation areas represent approximately 3.8% of all land area in the
    City. Exhibit 1 summarizes these park and recreation resources.

Four of the recreation and park facilities are located on surplus school sites encompassing
18.43 acres of land, and leased by the City from the Redondo Beach Unified School District.
Two of these surplus sites contain community facilities without parkland. In addition, the
David K. Hayward Community Center is a small stand-alone recreation facility on City-
owned land. The Center is adjacent to the North Branch Public Library in northern Redondo
Beach.
All of the park and recreation sites are overseen by the Recreation and Community Services
Department and maintained by the Public Works Department, with the exception of the
County beach. The beach is 36.2 acres and is managed and maintained by the County of
Los Angeles.
The City of Redondo Beach recreation and parks system has been organized into five main
categories. Resources in each category are discussed in detail in the following section.
    •   Parkland -

Parkland
The parkland system in the City of Redondo Beach consists of four park classifications:
Regional Parks, Community Parks, Neighborhood Parks, and Parkettes. There are a total of
30 parks that range in size from 20.6 acres to .07 acres in size. Each park serves a specific
function in the City to create balanced opportunities for recreation activities. The City’s
park system offers a wide variety of park types, uses, settings, and recreational opportunities
for specific segments of the population. Recreation uses at parks are defined as either active
or passive. Active recreation requires physical participation such as sports activities.
Passive recreation involves relative inactivity such as picnics, sitting, and strolling.
This Element establishes a hierarchy of parks with corresponding standards and
characteristics that can be used for the development, expansion, and improvement of
existing parks and recreation areas. Although until 1996 the National Recreation and Park
                                             3-118

Association (NRPA) had minimum standards for a park system, NRPA has determined that
park standards will ultimately vary given the location and dynamics of each city. It is
difficult to apply generalized standards to every individual park or facility. Instead, the City
has created other standards to help determine optimal acreage for future parks, and
appropriate park amenities.
Exhibit 2 is an overall inventory and assessment of the parkland system, including parks,
parkettes, playfields, and other recreational areas in the City of Redondo Beach. Parkland
and recreational facilities are listed at the top of the matrix, and each is assessed according to
the quantity of athletic fields/courts and other facilities in the upper half of the matrix.
Under the first column, there may be more than one facility listed in a row. When this is the
case, the park includes either one or more of the listed facilities.
The central portion of the matrix is an assessment of each park and recreation area in the
City, and includes four sections: site, furniture, landscaping, and buildings. Each section
contains items that are considered necessary for a usable and high quality park or recreation
area. However, it should be noted that all such items are not necessary at all types of
recreation areas. The overall condition of each recreation facility is evaluated according to
the four sections at the bottom of the matrix.
Exhibit 3 maps the general location of each park and school in the City.
Following Exhibit 3 is a detailed description of the City’s parkland inventory.

Regional Parks
There are three Regional Parks in the City of Redondo Beach: Hopkins Wilderness Park,
Seaside Lagoon, and Veterans Park. Regional parks in Redondo Beach are public parks or
preserves that are usually natural-resource oriented and serve the greater metropolitan area.
In Redondo Beach, non-residents visit these parks more frequently than residents. Regional
parks vary in size to accommodate desired uses. Seaside Lagoon is 3.6 acres; Veterans Park
is 7.49 acres; and Wilderness Park, an inland natural preserve, is 11 acres.
Regional parks offer large areas for passive recreation and may also include regional
recreational facilities that complement natural resources. They attract park users from a
wider surrounding area than other types of parks, given a beachside location and/or special
features such as a saltwater pool or wilderness habitat recreation area. Two of the three
regional parks in Redondo Beach, Seaside Lagoon and Veterans Park, are located at the
coast. The third, Wilderness Park, is located in the southeastern portion of Redondo Beach.
Hopkins Wilderness Park
1102 Camino Real
                                  Hopkins Wilderness Park, commonly referred to as
                                  Wilderness Park, is an 11-acre natural preserve with four
                                  ecological habitats: forests, meadows, streams, and ponds.
                                  The park features the following amenities:
                                      • Campgrounds with support facilities
                                      • Visitor Center
                                      • Amphitheater with fire pit
                                  Other amenities include picnic areas, restrooms, and parking
                                  on site. Wilderness Park is open until 4:30 p.m. throughout
                                  the week, except for Wednesdays, when the park is closed.
                                  Day and overnight camping is permitted with reservations.
                                  The Visitor Center was developed through a federal grant to
be used as a conservation, camping, and training center to bring the wilderness experience to
residents in urban areas. The Center is used only for nature-related recreation classes and
camps such as a summer day camp for 8-12 year olds provided through the Recreation and
Community Services Department.
Wilderness Park is a community favorite, particularly with families who have young
children. Residents enjoy panoramic views of the South Bay*, walking on trails, and the
natural habitat provided at the park.
    * Throughout the Element, any reference to the “South Bay” includes the following cities: Gardena,
      Hawthorne, Hermosa Beach, Inglewood, Lawndale, Manhattan Beach, Palos Verdes Estates, Rancho
      Palos Verdes, Redondo Beach, Rolling Hills, Rolling Hills Estates, and Torrance.
                                                 3-122

Seaside Lagoon
200 Portofino Way
Seaside Lagoon is a 3.6-acre saltwater, sand-bottom swimming facility within King Harbor.
The lagoon is heated by the nearby power-generating plant, and is open Memorial Day
through Labor Day for general admission. Parties can be scheduled at the facility April
through October. The facility contains:
    • sand beach
    • volleyball courts (two)
Seaside Lagoon also offers showers, restroom
building, concession building, play equipment for 2-12
year olds, picnic area, and luau shelter. A trained
lifeguard is on duty. Parking is provided at the
adjacent City-owned three-acre parking lot. The
Lagoon accommodates public swimming and water
play, staffed day care in the summer for 6-12 year
olds, and occasional private special events and parties.
The nearby Sea Laboratory also conducts various types of recreation classes here.
Seaside Lagoon is a unique City asset. The park is heavily used during the summer months
and is so popular, some residents have requested extending the hours of operation and
expanding the facility to accommodate off-season events.
Veterans Park
309 Esplanade
                                       Veterans Park is a 7.49-acre multi-use park adjacent to
                                       and directly above the beach promenade. The park
                                       includes:
                                           • Community Center
                                           • Senior Center
                                           • Bandshell
                                       Other amenities include play equipment for 2-12 year
                                       olds; a Veterans Memorial; restrooms; and a passive
                                       area with picnic tables, barbeque facilities, and
                                       pathways leading to panoramic views of the beach, pier,
and harbor area. The park provides a link between the beach promenade, pier, and
Esplanade. There is an on-site metered parking lot. A farmer’s market takes place weekly
on Harbor Drive, directly below the park. The City and other entities host events at the
park, including holiday festivities, a free concert series at the bandshell, and movie nights at
the Community Center and bandshell. The Senior Center has been renovated and expanded
and includes activity/dining rooms, kitchen, restrooms, and outdoor patio with shuffleboard
courts. Senior activities are held daily at the Center throughout the year. Listed on the
National Register of Historic Places, the Community Center is a 1930 historic building that
was the former Redondo Beach Main Library. The Center is currently leased exclusively to
a food catering and full-service special events company.
                                              3-123

Veterans Park is one of the most popular and heavily used parks in the City because it is
located near the beach and at the terminus of several transit lines. The park attracts users
from throughout the region. Residents enjoy the various programs and events that are held
at this park. However, some park improvements could be made. For example, the historic
library could be better utilized as a community resource. Other concerns include limited
parking and the recurrent presence of transients in the park.
Community Parks
According to the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA), the optimal size for a
community park is between 20 and 50 acres, but its actual size should be based on the land
area required to accommodate desired uses. Due to resource availability, parks in Redondo
Beach that are typically 6 to 15 acres in size are classified as Community Parks. One
exception is Dominguez Park which is 20.6 acres. Dominguez Park is classified as a
community park because of the types of facilities located there and its service area.
Community parks are generally larger in size than neighborhood parks, and provide a
greater range of recreational amenities.           A community park may serve several
neighborhoods within a radius of one half to three miles. Community parks contain
facilities for passive and/or active recreational uses. On-site parking is usually provided and
is intended to accommodate commuter clientele. Lack of undeveloped lands in Redondo
Beach will make it difficult to site new community parks. Where feasible, improving and
expanding existing community park areas and facilities will be necessary in the future.
The City has five community parks totaling 54.97 acres, with an average size of 10.99 acres
(478,724 square feet) per park. All community parks in the City have restroom facilities,
picnic areas, on-site parking, and playgrounds for 2-12 year olds. Each park appeals to a
variety of users, participating in both active and passive recreation activities. Each
community park also features a unique amenity, whether it is the Performing Arts Center,
Playhouse, dog park, or Historical Museum. The parks are distributed relatively evenly
throughout the City.
Alta Vista Park
801 Camino Real
Alta Vista Park is a 10.15-acre park located adjacent to Alta Vista School. Julia Street
separates the park from the school area. The City and
the Redondo Beach Unified School District (RBUSD)
share the use of school athletic fields. Together, the
recreation area at Alta Vista Park and Alta Vista
School covers a total of 19.42 acres and includes the
following:
    • Alta Vista Community Center
    • multi-use Julia Field
    • lighted tennis courts (eight)
    • indoor racquetball courts (two)
    • lighted baseball/softball fields (three)
                                              3-124

    • lighted soccer field
Other amenities at Alta Vista Park include a pavilion with picnic and barbeque area, play
equipment for 2-12 year olds, on-site parking, and restrooms. Bleachers, batting cages, and
a concession building are located near the baseball fields on the School property. The
Recreation and Community Services Department offers youth and adult tennis lessons,
children’s dance classes, youth summer sports camps, cooking classes, and exercise classes
at the Alta Vista Park and Community Center. Various sports leagues also use the athletic
fields on a seasonal basis.
Since the City built the Community Center and improved the park, residents have been
generally pleased with the facility. Although some residents have expressed concern about
the infrequent use of the indoor racquetball courts, Alta Vista Park is heavily used,
particularly the athletic fields and tennis courts. The City and RBUSD continue to improve
recreation facilities on both properties. For example, the School District, working with the
Public Works Department, recently repaired buckling asphalt and a few trees near the
concession stand area that had been a continuing problem for users. Resurfacing the tennis
courts and providing additional storage space for sports leagues are improvements needed in
the near future at both the park and school sites. Overall, Alta Vista Park rates as a well
maintained and heavily used park in the City.
Glenn M. Anderson Park
2229 Ernest Avenue
                                           Simply called “Anderson Park,” this multi-use park
                                           is 6 acres and is adjacent to Lincoln School.

                                               • half-basketball court
                                           There is also play equipment for 2-12 year olds, a
play fountain, a picnic area, and restrooms at this park. Anderson Park appeals to many
types of users. Community uses at the park and adjacent school grounds include: senior
activities, scout meetings, tennis lessons, child development classes, children’s dance
classes, sports league play, exercise classes, and youth sports camps. The City leases the
Senior Center from RBUSD on an annual basis. The Center is in operation seven days a
week, including evenings, and accommodates the South Bay Adult Day Care Program, the
South Bay Adult School post-stroke class, and community programs. There have been
requests to enlarge the restrooms and remodel the kitchen at the Center. Although Anderson
Park is a popular park, older facilities such as the Scout houses, Annex, and Modular
Building are in disrepair and in need of upgrading or replacement. Many residents have
expressed interest in a new community center. The City has completed preliminary
planning for a new center; however, construction funding has not been made available to
date. New park furniture and additional on-site parking are other improvements that could
enhance the quality of the park.

Aviation Park
1935 Manhattan Beach Boulevard
Aviation Park totals 14.6 acres, and is located on the former Aviation High School campus
at the intersection of Aviation and Manhattan Beach Boulevards. The park is adjacent to an
industrial/office park that houses Northrop Grumman Corporation, among other businesses.
The City holds a 99-year lease with the RBUSD on most of the site. A small portion of the
site is City-owned.
Aviation Park contains the following facilities:
    • Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center
         (RBPAC)
    • gymnasium with two basketball/volleyball
         courts, three exercise rooms, dance studio,
         locker room and restrooms
    • lighted track and football field
In addition, the park contains play equipment for 2-12
year olds, and a large parking lot to accommodate
RBPAC patrons and park users.
The park and Performing Arts Center, located in a redevelopment area, have been
substantially improved since the City took over the site in the 1980s. The RBPAC, formerly
the Aviation High School auditorium, is now a state-of-the-art, 1,450-seat regional theater
with a professional civic light opera company. Theater improvements completed as of 2004
include redesign of the building; addition of a new lobby, public restrooms, box office and
staff offices; house and acoustical improvements; and new sound and lighting systems.
Park/site improvements include new play equipment, landscaping, and parking. The
gymnasium has also been improved. Additional improvements planned for the site include
additional greenspace/landscaping, replacement of the track with a running trail, new field
and bleachers, and new signage and theater marquee.
The Aviation track and field and gym facilities are heavily used by members of the
community and by Northrop Grumman employees. Community recreation classes/programs
offered at these facilities include gymnastics and tumbling, adult and youth dance, adult and
league basketball, and league volleyball. Northrop Grumman also leases the three gym
exercise rooms for its employees, and has exclusive use of the basketball/volleyball courts
11:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. weekdays. The track is popular because it is the only lighted track
with restroom facilities open to the public in Redondo Beach.
Residents have made the following requests/recommendations for changes to the park: (1)
provide lighted outdoor basketball courts, (2) make the exercise rooms available to the
public, (3) provide adequate lighting at the tot lot, and (4) consider replacing the tot lot with
a higher demand recreational facility (park is used most frequently by adults). Some park
users have also opposed the City’s planned changes to the track.
                                             3-126

Dominguez Park
200 Flagler Lane
Dominguez Park is a 20.6-acre park at the corner of
Flagler Lane and 190th Street. Through a license
agreement with SCE, a portion of this multi-use park
is within the Southern California Edison Company
(SCE) right-of-way. Dominguez Park is the largest,
most centrally located, and one of the most heavily
used parks in Redondo Beach. The park includes the
following recreation facilities:
    • Heritage Court with Historical Museum
    • T-ball field
    • dog park
    • baseball field with concession/restroom building
There is also play equipment for 2-12 year olds, an exercise circuit/par course, batting cages,
picnic areas, and restrooms.
Dominguez Park features the City’s only off-leash and fenced dog park. It is also the only
dog park in the surrounding area, with the nearest dog parks located in San Pedro and El
Segundo. Built in 1993, this three-acre dog park includes separate fenced areas for large and
small dogs, and is heavily used by the community. The Friends of the Redondo Beach Dog
Park organize and sponsor events, address public concerns, and work with the City to
maintain this facility.
Heritage Court, a Victorian-style courtyard with rose garden, picket fence, fountain,
walkways and arbors, is another unique amenity at Dominguez Park. The Court features
two historic Redondo Beach homes, the Queen Anne House and the Morrell House, which
were saved from demolition and relocated to Dominguez Park. The Queen Anne House
serves as the Redondo Beach Historical Museum. Hours of operation for the Historical
Museum are Saturday and Sunday, 1:00 – 4:00 p.m. The Museum features several rooms
illustrating the City’s rich history with artifacts, photographs, and other items of interest.
Residents have expressed concerns that the historic homes are not adequately maintained
and need to be refurbished. Residents who frequent the park have also requested additional
restrooms and parking, and replacement of the par course with another park facility. Staff
indicated, however, that the par course was funded with grant money and cannot be removed
per grant requirements. It should be noted that a large portion of Dominguez Park is located
on a former landfill site, so opportunities for development of major new facilities are
limited.
Franklin Park
807 Inglewood Avenue
Franklin Park is a 6.85-acre multi-use park with the following major amenities:
    • basketball court
    • Redondo Beach Playhouse
                                               3-127

    • Community Center
There is also play equipment for 2-12 year olds, expansive passive open space with
meandering pathways and picnic areas, restrooms, and
on-site parking. The eastern 3.62-acre portion of the
property is owned and maintained as parkland by the
City. It is zoned as Parks, Recreation, and Open Space
(P-PRO). The western 3.23-acre portion of the property
is a former school site that the City is leasing for 99
years from RBUSD. It is zoned as School Facility (P-
SF).     In 1997, the school’s cafeteria and some
classrooms were converted into the 125-seat Playhouse.
The City’s youth theater program operates out of the
Playhouse. Recreation programs at Franklin include adult art classes, adult dance classes,
and children’s sports classes. Residents have noted that this park is Redondo’s “best-kept
secret.” Overall, the park is in good condition; however, some of the buildings need
improvements.
Neighborhood Parks
Neighborhood Parks in the City of Redondo Beach are typically 1 to 5 acres in size, with the
exception of Perry Allison Playfield, which is less than 1 acre. The optimal size for a
neighborhood park according to NRPA guidelines is 5 to 10 acres. Neighborhood parks are
pedestrian-oriented, and are within a quarter to half-mile or within minimal biking/walking
distance of park users. The neighborhood park system serves the recreational needs of the
immediate and surrounding neighborhoods. Neighborhood parks are designed to provide
passive and/or active recreation uses. The facilities provided are a function of the recreation
requirements in a neighborhood and the larger facilities available elsewhere in the
community.
There are nine neighborhood parks in the City of Redondo Beach totaling 16.11 acres. Two
playfields are included in this park classification. The average size is 1.79 acres (77,972
square feet) per park. Although five of these parks contain play equipment, most of the
parks are passive in nature. Dale Page Park includes other active recreation uses such as
basketball and handball courts.
Andrews Park
1801 Rockefeller Lane
                                     Andrews Park is 1.61 acres with primarily passive
                                     recreation uses. The park is adjacent and connected to a
                                     senior housing development. Andrews features new
                                     play equipment for 2-12 year olds and an extensive
                                     picnic area. Andrews Park appeals primarily to the
                                     elderly and to families with young children.
                                            3-128

Czuleger Park
North Catalina Avenue & Diamond Street
Formerly known as “Plaza Park,” Czuleger Park is 3.27
acres located at the western terminus of Diamond Street,
between North Catalina Avenue and King Harbor. Czuleger
Park serves as a public view corridor to the ocean, and
includes passive recreation areas such as a vista point,
sloping green space towards the harbor, meandering
pathways, and seating areas. This park is also configured to
link the harbor’s facilities, and to provide public access to
the harbor from Catalina Avenue and adjacent multi-family
developments. The upper portion of the park is bordered on the north and south by “The
Village” condominiums. The lower portion of the park is a plaza area with built-in seating,
directly above the harbor’s walkway and underground public parking facility. Both bike and
pedestrian paths run through Czuleger from Catalina Avenue, providing a connection to the
bike and pedestrian paths within the harbor area. Visitors use the park for its scenic walk to
King Harbor and the Redondo Beach Pier.
Dale Page Park
2507 Robinson Street
Dale Page Park is 1.17 acres, located in a Southern
California Edison Company right-of-way. There is
access from Robinson Street and Beland Boulevard on
both ends of the park. Dale Page contains the
following recreation amenities:
    • basketball courts (two)
    • handball courts (two)
This park also includes play equipment for 6-12 year
olds, picnic area, and restrooms. Dale Page Park is in
good condition, with new play equipment installed in 2000. However, restroom-building
improvements are needed. This is one of the least used parks in the City, most likely due to
unlighted courts and absence of athletic fields.
Fulton Playfield
529 Earle Lane
                                             Fulton Playfield is a 1.32-acre unlighted
                                             baseball/softball field. It is directly below Coast
                                             Christian School and direct access is provided
                                             from the field to the school. The City has
                                             regraded and made other improvements to
                                             Fulton Playfield to create a usable athletic field
                                             3-129

for sports activities. New sports and park amenities, including a baseball backstop,
decomposed granite walkway, drinking fountains, benches, and landscaping have been
installed. South Redondo Little League uses the sports field for practices. It is well
maintained and in good condition.
Lilienthal Park
2481 190th Street
Lilienthal Park is a 1.44-acre rectangular park, stretching
north from Lilienthal Lane to 190th Street to the south.
Lilienthal is located in a primarily low-density residential
neighborhood, at the edge of the City near Torrance. It is a
primarily passive recreation use park with older play
equipment for 2-5 year olds, pathways, seating areas, and a
restroom building. Although the landscaping and restroom
building are well maintained and in good condition,
Lilienthal Park has been described as underutilized. The
City plans to replace the play equipment in 2004. Residents have requested additional
facilities at this park.
Moonstone Park
Western terminus of Marina Way, Mole B
Moonstone Park is an underdeveloped and
underutilized 1.64-acre park in King Harbor.
It is bordered by a jetty, parking area, and
driveway leading to the Harbor Patrol at the
end of Mole B. The park is used for passive
recreation and includes a bench and minimal
landscaping. A portion of this park is used by the Outrigger Canoe Club to conduct classes
and for storage. The park has prime views of boats in the harbor area and Wyland’s
“Whaling Wall” mural. Moonstone Park could be better utilized if it were to include a well-
designed picnic area, play equipment, more visible access, and improved boating facilities.
Perry Allison Playfield
190th Street & Cluster/Blossom Lanes
                                    Perry Allison Playfield is a relatively narrow, 0.62-acre
                                    unlighted multi-use sports field. It is located off 190th
                                    Street, between Cluster Lane and Blossom Lane. There
                                    are not permanent sports facilities at the field, but Perry
                                    Allison is occasionally used for soccer and other informal
                                    sports activities. There is opportunity to improve this
                                    area with another recreational use since it is less
                                    frequently used than other parks or playfields.
                                             3-130

Perry Park
1801 Rockefeller Lane
Perry Park is a thriving, 3.86-acre multi-use park. The following facilities are available at
the park:
    • Senior Center
    • Teen Center
    • Morris Scout House
    • multi-use field
    • lighted basketball courts (two)
This park also features a concession building, batting cages, play equipment for 2-12 year
olds, restrooms, and a picnic area. Perry Park was substantially improved in 2002 and has
increased in popularity, particularly with the local
community.        The Senior Center was partially
remodeled and includes a kitchen, large multi-purpose
room, and an office/card room, which are heavily
used. The Teen Center, renovated in 1999, includes a
TV lounge, pool and other game tables, and a kitchen.
Planned activities for 12-16 year olds are sponsored by
the Recreation and Community Services Department.
The park is a strong draw for a variety of users,
including seniors, children, and adults. The lighted
basketball courts are frequently used because there are
few lighted courts in the City. One of the concerns at the park is the lack of parking during
peak-use periods.
Vincent Park
630 Vincent Street
Vincent Park is 1.18 acres adjacent to Redondo Union High School. It is located in the
center of Vincent Street, which “balloons” into this
oblong park. The roadway bisects the park. The high
school and residential units border one half of the park.
This area consists of a sloping turfed area with mature
trees. The other half of the park is bordered by
residential units, and contains play equipment for 2-12
year olds. Parking is limited for park users due to
permit parking that surrounds the park area. Vincent
Park is used primarily by children and by some
neighborhood residents for passive recreation.
Parkettes
The Recreation and Community Services Department defines parkettes, sometimes referred
to as “mini-parks” or “vest-pocket parks,” as small parks that are less than 1 acre in size.
The NPRA guideline for mini-parks is between 2,500 square feet (.06 acres) and 1 acre in
                                             3-131

size. Parkettes serve local neighborhoods, with users typically living within walking
distance or less than a quarter-mile away. Given the small area of parkettes, active
recreation amenities are typically limited to play equipment. These small parks may serve
any age group, depending on the characteristics of the surrounding area, but most are
commonly used by children.
There are 13 parkettes in the City of Redondo Beach totaling 2.28 acres with an average area
of approximately 0.18 acres (7,841 square feet) each. Each parkette has either been given a
name from the roadway on which it is located, a noteworthy individual, or “Sister City” with
the City of Redondo Beach. All parkettes are listed in the following table under their most
commonly used names:

Parkettes are a valuable recreation resource in the City, adding green space and
beautification in neighborhoods. Parkettes are intended to be used by those residing in the
immediate neighborhood and typically do not attract users from outside the service area.
Residents understand that parkettes cater to local neighborhoods and are of value to the City.
When asked, the biggest complaint from residents is that the parkettes with older play
equipment are underutilized. Some people have requested restrooms at parkettes. However,
the size of these parks limits adding this type of facility. The City is in the process of
improving most of its parkettes with upgraded play equipment, new park monument signs,
and new park furniture such as benches and picnic tables. Mathews Parkette was upgraded
in 2003, and features new hardscape, landscape, play equipment, and Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) improvements. Improvements at Massena Parkette are underway,
including new signage, hardscape, landscape, play equipment, furniture, and ADA
improvements. Work is expected to be complete at Massena Parkette in winter, 2004.

Community Centers, Senior Centers, and Meeting Facilities
The City of Redondo Beach operates a variety of facilities for meetings, recreation classes
provided by the Recreation and Community Services Department, senior activities, teen
activities, and private rentals. Community Centers consist of a building or set of rooms
provided for users to gather for recreational, educational, and other activities. These
facilities are available to a broad age range. A Senior Center or Teen Center is a form of a
community center, but primarily for the use of senior citizens or teens, respectively. Most of
the City’s community centers are located within parks, near schools, or near other City
facilities.
The City of Redondo Beach currently operates five community centers, three senior centers,
one teen center, and several meeting facilities. Recreation and cultural facilities that can be
used for meetings include the Scout Houses, the Redondo Beach Playhouse, Aviation
Gymnasium, the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center (for large corporate meetings),
Wilderness Park Visitor Center (if purpose of meeting is nature-oriented), and outdoor
covered picnic areas at various parks. The Main Library also provides meeting rooms. In
addition, a number of classes provided by the City’s Recreation Program are held at private
facilities in the City such as private gyms, commercial buildings, and the King Harbor Yacht
Club. The following chart lists the City’s community centers, senior centers, and teen
center.

Southern California Edison Company Rights-of-Way
There are two corridors of Southern California Edison Company (SCE) rights-of-way
comprising 54.2 acres of land located within the City of Redondo Beach. These rights-of-
way are occupied by overhead electrical transmission lines supported by metal towers, and
also include underground pipelines. One transmission corridor runs in an east-west direction
and connects to the SCE power-generating plant. The second transmission corridor runs in a
north-south direction from the northern end of the City to
Rockefeller Lane, at which point it turns due east, and
continues towards the eastern end of the City.            A
majority of the Southern California Edison transmission
line rights-of-way are zoned as Public & Institutional -
Right-of-Way (P-ROW).
It is recognized that these rights-of-way are set aside,
developed, and operated for the purpose of maintaining
SCE’s transmission facilities. However, as a fiduciary
responsibility to its ratepayers and shareholders, the company allows secondary uses of the
land in order to maximize all financial opportunities. As a result, private entities utilize
portions of the rights-of-way through license agreements for many purposes, including
commercial landscape plant propagation.               SCE also permits secondary open
space/recreational uses to lessen the impacts of the right-of-way on residents. As long as
                                            3-134

such uses do not interfere with utility functions, SCE may issue a grant of a license to the
City of Redondo Beach.
The City is currently licensed to maintain 17.11 acres of SCE right-of-way corridors, which
it has developed and beautified with turf. These open and flat areas are used extensively by
adjacent neighborhoods for informal recreation purposes. The City is also licensed to use a
portion of the SCE right-of-way that falls within Dominguez Park, and a 1.17-acre section
comprising all of Dale Page Park.
Bikeways
There are currently five miles of bikeways within the City of Redondo Beach which fall into
Class I and Class II CalTrans bicycle path categories. The Class I bicycle path extends
along the beach area promenade as part of the South Bay Bikeway. North of Torrance
Boulevard, there is a Class II bike lane extending through King Harbor and then along
Harbor Drive. Other short segments of Class II bicycle lanes run along the southernmost
segment of the Pacific Coast Highway, Flagler Lane, Diamond Street, and Grant Avenue.
Bikeways are not equally distributed between north and south Redondo Beach.
Additionally, the City’s bikeways do not connect with one another, or with bicycle paths in
adjacent cities. Opportunities for expansion of the City’s bicycle circulation system are
limited due to the inability to widen existing streets and the need to retain on-street parking
                                 in most areas. However, the City is currently considering
                                 implementation of a plan for a new bicycle route in north
                                 Redondo Beach that runs from 190th Street to the Metro Rail
                                 Green Line station on Marine Avenue and to Northrop
                                 Grumman Corporation. The new facility would become a
                                 segment of the future Bay Cities Regional Bikeway, which
                                 would ultimately create a commuter and recreational bike
                                 route from Torrance to El Segundo. This project is
                                 supported by a grant from the Los Angeles County
                                 Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a local
                                 transportation tax. The proposed bikeway consists of a
combination of all three Class categories along existing streets and parallel to or within
portions of the Southern California Edison Company rights-of-way. The addition of this
route will enhance bicycle circulation in north Redondo Beach and provide a transportation
alternative to long-distance commuters.
Supplemental Parkland/Facilities, and Recreation and Meeting Facilities
In addition to the variety of public parkland and recreation facilities described above, a
number of supplemental public and private parklands, meeting facilities, recreation facilities,
and recreation resources in and outside of the City are available to residents of Redondo
Beach. Given the City’s lack of available land, supplemental recreation resources play a key
role in providing additional facilities for residents. These supplemental resources also serve
as valuable adjuncts to the overall recreation system in the South Bay community.
                                              3-135

Coastal Zone Public Recreational Resources
The Coastal Zone is located west of Pacific Coast Highway in the City of Redondo Beach.
King Harbor, the County beach, and Municipal Pier are three public recreational resources
in the Coastal Zone that greatly supplement the City’s park and recreation system.
Historically, Redondo Beach has been a popular resort town. Today, the City prides itself as
a well-established coastal community, enjoying two miles of Southern California’s
coastline. King Harbor, the County beach, and Municipal Pier are focal points along the
City’s waterfront. All three coastal resources are invaluable and should be maintained and
improved to provide the maximum amount of recreational opportunities for both residents
and visitors. These resources, along with enhanced or additional recreation amenities, have
the potential to offer a substantial amount of recreation and leisure activities in the Coastal
Zone.
Revitalizing the Coastal Zone will ensure a more usable and appealing coastline by
recapturing residents and visitors. A sense of place should be recreated along the coastline
to regain the recreation activity levels and amenities that once popularized Redondo Beach
in the South Bay region.
County Beach
The Los Angeles County-owned beach covers approximately two miles in Redondo Beach
and is 36.2 acres in size. As in most coastal communities, the beach is a principle
recreational focus, particularly for the younger population. This natural resource includes
parking, restrooms, lifeguard facilities, volleyball courts, shower facilities, and other related
beach facilities. Against the bluffs, a concrete promenade stretches along the length of the
beach. This pedestrian path comprises a portion of the California Coastal Trail that runs
from Oregon to Mexico. The promenade is striped for two-way pedestrian and bicycle
traffic and is heavily used. Many residents and visitors also use the Esplanade directly
overlooking the beach area. Residents accessing adjacent high-rise units, along with
visitors, typically create beachfront traffic congestion. The beach is the most frequently
visited recreation area in the City.
Municipal Pier
The Municipal Pier is another focal point of the City’s coastline. The Pier is located
between the marina and beach, and includes a commercial area and public fishing area with
related facilities. Commercial establishments are located on the Pier, as well as in Pier
Plaza. The Pier and Pier Plaza cover approximately 8.5 acres. Surface parking and an
underground parking garage are adjacent to the Pier and are used to access the pier, beach,
and harbor.
King Harbor
King Harbor includes approximately 1,400 boat slips and covers approximately 48 acres of
land area. Recreational amenities include a private boat hoist available for public use,
                                              3-136

private boat marinas, Seaside Lagoon, and Moonstone Park. Several restaurants, hotels, and
other commercial recreation facilities make King Harbor a unique recreation resource within
the region. While highly successful as a regional tourist attraction, development of the
harbor area has created some traffic congestion in the summer months.
Private Meeting Facilities
In addition to the facility rentals available through the City of Redondo Beach at various
parks and community centers, several hotels in Redondo Beach have meeting room space
available to the public.
    •   Best Western Redondo Beach Inn, 1850 South Pacific Coast Highway

Recreation Resources Outside of Redondo Beach
Because communities in the South Bay region function interdependently, nearby recreation
facilities are taken into consideration when assessing the public’s access to and need for
recreational opportunities. Parks and recreation facilities located in nearby Hermosa Beach,
Manhattan Beach, Torrance, and Palos Verdes Estates help meet some of the recreational
needs of Redondo Beach residents. The following partial list provides a sample of resources

Recreation Program System and Inventory
The Recreation and Community Services Department offers a variety of recreation classes,
programs, and activities designed to serve all age groups. Classes require registration fees
paid to the City of Redondo Beach and, in some cases, material fees paid to instructors
during initial class sessions. The fees vary according to the type and duration of the activity
that is offered. Some services are free or with voluntary donations, such as the after-school
playground program and several senior activities. Information for the inventory of classes
and recreational opportunities discussed in this Element comes from the Summer and Fall
2003 City Newsletters, and in-person and phone interviews with the public and City Staff.
Course offerings are grouped into eleven activity categories. Where certain activities do not
fit into the following categories, they are classified and discussed under “Other Activities”
on page 3-146.

     Art classes are primarily offered at the Franklin Community Center and Perry Park, and
     include drawing, painting, photography, stained glass, and mosaics. The majority of art
     classes are offered for adults and seniors.
     Child Development courses are very popular classes for parents of 2 to 5 year old
     children. Classes involve hands-on preschool preparatory activities for young children,
     and are all located in the park facility buildings at Anderson Park.
     Dance classes include a variety of dance styles from ballet/jazz to dance team to swing
     to line dancing. Twelve percent of all recreation classes are dance, a variety of which
     are available to each age group. Overall participation is relatively low; however, the
                                               3-141

senior dance classes are well attended. Dance classes are offered at several park
facilities and community centers throughout Redondo Beach.
Drama classes are offered at the Redondo Beach Playhouse, which produces up to four
plays each year. Classes are geared toward two age groups: adults and youth, ages 6 to
17. On an annual basis, these classes have medium to high participation. In addition,
several summer camp programs focus on drama activities. These are discussed under
“Other Activities.”
Education classes include pre-school story time, adult book clubs, cooking for youth
and adults, a dog obedience course, and a selection of informational and computer
courses for seniors. These courses are offered at the various community and senior
centers, as well as the Main and North Branch libraries. Relatively few education
classes are offered.
Fitness classes for adults are extensive, and include aerobics, weight training, body
sculpting, running, martial arts, and yoga. There are also fitness classes for new
mothers, and Tae Kwon Do for junior youth and teens. The classes are offered at a
variety of locations, including local community centers, senior centers, parks, and
private clubs and studios contracted by the City.
Music classes are offered primarily for young children, although there is one guitar class
designed for ages 9 to 14, and there is one piano class and one guitar class for adults.
The children’s classes, some of which are open to parents, provide a basic introduction
to music. A few classes are held at the Franklin Community Center and the Yamaha
Music Center, which is a private music studio in Torrance.
Special Services and Events entail social assistance programs and recurring annual
events. Social assistance programs provide numerous volunteer opportunities, as well as
important services to Redondo Beach residents. Available volunteer programs include
the Citizens Emergency Response Training Program through the Redondo Beach Fire
Department, Citizen Police Academy Training, and the Domestic Violence Advocacy
Team through the City’s Police Department. The majority of special services and events
are available to the senior and disabled adult population. Special Services for seniors
include classes for healthy living and recovery such as blood pressure and post-stroke
socialization. Special events for seniors include the Health Fair, DMV Day (during
which seniors may renew their drivers’ licenses), income tax assistance and legal
assistance.
Social Programs include entertainment activities for families and persons in all age
groups. Some activities, such as theater events at the Redondo Beach Performing Arts
Center, are offered on a regular basis. Others are annual programs such as summer
concerts and movie nights at Veterans Park. The teen center at Perry Park offers a
limited number of social activities for the junior youth and teenage groups. Many of the
City’s social programs are offered for seniors, and include ongoing senior center
                                         3-142

     functions such as the lunch program, potlucks and parties, games, and special events.
     These programs typically take place at the three senior centers in Redondo Beach, which
     are located at Anderson Park, Perry Park, and Veterans Park. Other senior social
     activities include picnics and trips.
     Sports is the most widely offered activity category in the teen and adult age groups.
     Outdoor sports classes offered through the City of Redondo Beach include golf,
     swimming, tennis, basketball, baseball and volleyball leagues, surfing, and sailing.
     Indoor sports opportunities include ice-skating, ice hockey, basketball, gymnastics and
     tumbling. Sports classes are offered at various gyms, parks, and private facilities
     throughout Redondo Beach and adjacent cities.

Many classes are customized for specific age groups. Therefore, this section categorizes the
classes as follows: children (0-7 years), junior youth (8-12 years), teens (13-17 years),
adults (18+ years), seniors (50+ years), and all ages. The following is a discussion of class
type, distribution, and participation rates per age group. Evaluation of participation rates
was based on registrations during the Summer and Fall 2003 quarters, as well as feedback
from coordinators and registration administrators who have first-hand experience with
annual registration trends. Taking the average number of registrants for two quarters in each
class, and dividing that number by the maximum class capacity of each class determined
participation rates. Participation rates are considered “high” if participation rates reach 85-
100% of the class capacity, “medium” if they reach 68-84% of class capacity, and “low” if
they reach 50-67% of class capacity. Final participation values are estimates because they
have a tendency to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. In some cases, a
participation rate could not be determined because classes were too new to track for multiple
quarters.
Children (0-7 years)
Although not large in quantity, there are several categories of classes available to children
ages 0 to 7. These classes include child development courses for preschool-aged children,
art, cooking, dance, music, and sports (i.e., tumbling, swimming and tennis). Some of these
children’s classes also allow parent participation. All of the children’s classes are offered in
multiple-week sessions every quarter. Registration for child development and sports classes
has been historically high, with dance and music classes somewhat less utilized.
                                             3-143

Junior Youth (8-12 years)
A variety of classes is open to the junior youth age group, including swimming, ice hockey,
tennis, gymnastics, sailing, dance, cooking, and guitar. Many of the classes for this age
group are limited to the Fall and Summer Quarters. Summer day camp programs include
junior drama camp, surf/volleyball camp, Breakwater Day Camp, Wilderness Camp,
basketball camp and soccer camp. The all-day Summer Playground Program is also offered
at Alta Vista School, Lincoln School, and Perry Park.
Participation in the outdoor sports programs, summer camps, and drama classes is high, with
less interest in indoor activities such as guitar, ice sports, and Center Stage Dance classes.
Nonetheless, the dance program was recently expanded to include Hip-Hop and Jazz during
the Fall Quarter for registrants ages 14 and up. Monitoring and evaluating participation
rates within the dance program for this age group is recommended once the new classes
have been instituted for at least one year.
Although many of the classes available to the junior youth age group are not offered
regularly throughout the year, they fill a significant need for activities during summer school
breaks. The few ongoing classes that are offered during all four quarters of the year have
attracted enough interest to be maintained and even expanded in the future.
Teens (13-17 years)
There are relatively few classes offered for the teenage group, approximately 13 to 17 years
old. Programs and classes include sailing camp, drama camp, ice-skating, dance, tennis,
swimming, and surfing. Most of these classes are offered for only one quarter during the
year. Summer classes and sailing classes offered throughout the year have the highest level
of participation in this age group. The Perry Park Teen Center is also available to this age
group. The center offers supervision and organized activities in the afternoons and evenings
five days a week for drop-in users. Typical activities include pool, air hockey, video games,
and basketball tournaments. Interested teens are encouraged to lead peer-run activities such
as art and dance. The teen center has a medium to high level of participation throughout the
year, which fluctuates according to breaks during the school year. The limited number and
types of activities available to the teenage group are highly utilized, particularly during the
summer months when students are out of school.
Adults (18+ years)
The greatest quantity and variety of classes are provided for the adult population on an
ongoing, quarterly basis. Class categories include art, education, dance, fitness, games,
music, and sports, including league sports. The fitness and sports courses tend to be the
most popular, particularly body sculpting, fitness, aerobics, weight training, lap swimming,
surfing, tennis, beach volleyball, and all of the league sports.
Eight sessions of golf are offered at the Palos Verdes Golf Course in Palos Verdes Estates
and the Mulligan Golf Practice Center in Torrance. However, most sessions of golf have
historically had low participation rates, possibly because of their locations outside Redondo
Beach. Nine sessions of sailing are offered at King Harbor, but most have shown low
participation rates in the adult age group. More recently, several new sessions of art have
been added to the City’s activity program that are too new to evaluate participation rates.
                                              3-144

With the exception of Late Night Sports (LNS), there is not currently a large-scale City-
sponsored program designed specifically for young adults, ages 18 to 25. However, most of
the classes listed under the Adult Classes section of the quarterly newsletter are open to
individuals 18 years and older. The adult classes are offered at a variety of locations
throughout Redondo Beach and adjacent cities, at community centers, parks, private gyms,
and studios. Given the extensive number and types of classes available, adult classes are
offered to the greatest number of participants in the City.
Seniors (50+ years)
Activities for seniors are sponsored by three Senior Clubs within the City, and are managed
by the Senior and Family Services Division of the Recreation and Community Services
Department. Senior involvement in the clubs is notably high, with approximately 1,200
annual members throughout the City. Membership dues at each club range from $5.00-
$6.00 per person, per year. Annual membership is optional, and many of the classes
available to seniors do not require membership in a club. The following graph summarizes
senior club membership within the City.

The senior centers offer a multitude of classes and activities that cater to the needs of the
senior population which they serve. The senior programs are available to anyone aged 50
years or older, although it is estimated that the average age of a senior participant is 76. As
with the other age groups, there are many classes available to seniors that fall primarily
under the activity categories of art, dance, education, fitness, and games. All of the classes
are offered either quarterly, or on an ongoing basis. There is a medium to high participation
rate in every class offered to seniors.
There are also a number of regular special services and events available through the Senior
and Family Services Division. Special services for seniors include blood pressure clinics;
weight training groups; homeowner and renter assistance; income tax assistance; transit pass
sales; information and referral service; and hearing, vision and stroke support groups. Many
of these special services are provided at the Senior Administration Office/Community
Resources Center located at 320 Knob Hill Avenue. There are also many special events
throughout the year, such as the annual Arts & Crafts Fair, dance parties, DMV Day, Health
Fair, Spring Round About Open House, and Summer Picnic. Each special event offers
unique opportunities to socialize and obtain valuable information about health and senior
living. The Senior Services office also produces and makes available an Answer Book
Guide to regional community services programs.
                                              3-145
With the exception of the Teen Center Program at Perry Park, the Senior Program is the only
recreation program with social activities offered on an ongoing basis. In other words,
activities are not interrupted by quarterly breaks, as are the majority of other recreation
classes. For example, the Senior Lunch Program is offered year round on alternate days at
the Perry Park and the Veterans Park Senior Centers (five days a week total). The cost is a
$2.50 donation per meal. The Senior Lunch Program began as a pilot program in 1992, and
is very popular and well-attended. The senior centers also offer numerous potlucks and
birthday party celebrations on a regular basis.
Staffing for the Senior and Family Services Division is extremely limited, given the large
number of classes and activities offered. The entire division has only two full-time staff
members, and a handful of senior part-time assistants (most working 10 hours per week).
The Division could not operate without the help of the approximately 275 senior volunteers
who donate their time to planning and orchestrating the activities at each club. Volunteering
provides additional social outlets for active seniors who want to be involved in the
community. The senior program is highly successful and available to senior club members,
residents, and non-residents.

Other Activities
There are other recreational activities and services offered by the City and various entities
within and around the Redondo Beach area that contribute to the recreational opportunities
available to Redondo Beach residents. The following are descriptions of activities offered
by the City of Redondo Beach, the Redondo Beach Unified School District (RBUSD), non-
profit organizations, and private clubs and studios.
Summer Camp Programs
The City of Redondo Beach offers a variety of traditional summer day camp programs for
youth ages 6 to 16. These theme-based camps are held at various public facilities
throughout the City, providing athletic, artistic, and social opportunities for youth during
summer breaks. Camp activities include sailing, basketball, volleyball, soccer, surfing,
swimming, and drama. In addition, Camp Wilderness at the Hopkins Wilderness Park, and
                                             3-146
Breakwater Day Camp at Seaside Lagoon, are day camp programs that combine education
with hands-on experiments, games, and field trips. Fees for the summer camp programs
range according to the length of each session. Participation rates are notably high. Many
believe that these summer camps are instrumental in keeping South Bay area youth engaged
in productive activities during summer vacation.
Non-Custodial Child Care Services
The City of Redondo Beach offers an After-School Playground and Library Program that is
managed by the Recreation and Community Services Department. The program is offered
at eight elementary school and two junior high school sites. Each site has an activity-based
theme such as playground, library, and study time. Children served at the elementary
schools range from 6 to 12 years old. At the junior high schools, children up to 14 years old
are eligible to participate in the after-school program. The After-School Playground and
Library Program is offered at each site five days a week during the school year. The
recommended donation is $20-$40 per month per child.
During the summer quarter, an all-day Summer Playground Program is available at Lincoln
School, Alta Vista School, and Perry Park. The ten-week summer program is designed for
children and junior youth ages 6 to 12, and is offered five days a week. The cost of the
Summer Playground Program is $200 per child. The fee can be pro-rated for shorter terms.
The After-School Playground and Library Program and the Summer Playground Program
are excellent resources for Redondo Beach families.
Sports Leagues
There are sports leagues sponsored by the City, as well as non-profit sports leagues available
to Redondo Beach residents. While the City-sponsored leagues are offered for adults, the
private leagues are designed primarily for youth. City sponsored leagues include men’s and
women’s slo-pitch baseball, and co-ed volleyball and basketball for adults 18 years and
older. Participation in the league sports program is high, and at times interested teams must
be turned away. Teams with 75% of players living or owning property in Redondo Beach
have registration priority over teams composed of non-residents. Teams meet for practice
and to play games at Alta Vista Park, Anderson Park, Aviation Park, and Adams School.
Because City league teams are self-appointed and managed, it is each team’s responsibility
to attend all games and collect participation fees. City fees per team range from $245 to
$420 per quarter, in addition to forfeit deposits and game official fees.
Non-profit sports leagues involve national, regional, and local organizations such as the
American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO), Redondo Beach Youth Basketball (RBYB),
American Youth Football, Redondo Beach Youth and Cheerleading, Little League, Sunset
Youth Baseball, and Redondo Beach Youth Volleyball. Non-profit leagues are managed
independently, and fees vary according to program and required sporting equipment.
Participation in non-profit sports leagues is estimated to be high among youth in Redondo
Beach.
The City of Redondo Beach and the Redondo Beach Unified School District (RBUSD) have
informal agreements for use of sports fields for adult sports. The City rents sports fields at
Alta Vista, Anderson, and Adams schools. Currently, the City allows private youth sports
organizations to use of these facilities free of charge. Private youth sports organizations use
                                              3-147

both City and School District sports fields and courts. Usage varies among the private youth
sports organizations. Due to budget shortfalls, effective January 1, 2004, RBUSD
established a lighting fee for adult sports leagues and private organizations that use facilities
outside those designated in agreements with the City.
Some users, although appreciative of the sports fields provided in Redondo Beach, have
indicated that the fields are limited in number and quality in comparison to those in other
cities. Due to limited availability of facilities, locations for “pick-up” and other spontaneous
recreational games are difficult to find. Nonetheless, league sports are another valuable
recreational resource heavily utilized by residents of Redondo Beach and the South Bay
region.
Junior Lifeguard Program
The County of Los Angeles offers various Junior Lifeguard programs in the South Bay
region. The programs provide training to youth in aquatic safety, first aid, rescue
techniques, beach and pool activities, physical fitness, and lifeguard operations. Courtesy,
respect, discipline and good sportsmanship are emphasized. The Junior Lifeguard Program
in Redondo Beach began in the late 1990s. Program participants meet in late June through
July at the beach area between Avenue A and Knob Hill Avenue. There is a medium level
of participation at this location.
Boy and Girl Scouts of America
Additional growth and guidance opportunities for youth are available through Boy Scouts of
America and Girl Scouts of the USA, which are two national non-profit organizations.
Participation in Boy Scouts of America and Girl Scouts of the USA by residents of Redondo
Beach is estimated to be comparatively high.
Redondo Beach is located in the Pacifica District of the Los Angeles Area Council for Boy
Scouts. Of the 180 units comprising the Pacifica District, 28 operate out of Redondo Beach
and currently (2004) serve 684 youths between the ages of 7-18.
Girl Scout troops in Redondo Beach are part of the Angeles Girl Scout Council. There are a
total of 54 troops, which include the northern and southern divisions of Redondo Beach,
representing girls between the ages of 5-17. The 2003-04 year-end average for registered
Girl Scouts in Redondo Beach is 650 girls.
Both Boy and Girl Scout troops meet at a variety of locations throughout the City, including
schools, churches, service organization facilities, the two City-owned Scout Houses at
Anderson Park and the City-owned Morris Scout House at Perry Park. Usage by troops at
each Boy and Girl Scout House at Anderson Park is estimated to be 30 hours a week. Girl
Scout usage of the Morris Scout House at Perry Park is estimated to be up to 32 hours a
week. If it is available during the morning and early afternoon hours, the Morris Scout
House can also be used by other senior services community groups. Girl Scout Area
Leaders and the City’s Senior and the Family Services Division coordinate scheduling for
this facility.
                                               3-148

Late Night Sports
Late Night Sports (LNS) is a peer support group for high school and college-aged teens and
young adults (ages 14 to 25) in the South Bay region. It consists of Saturday night
basketball games and life skills classes, giving youth a safe and healthy alternative to
substance abuse, delinquency, and crime. Life skills topics include how to thrive under
pressure, effective goal setting, and conflict resolution. Average participation ranges from
80 to 100 persons between 8:00 pm and 11:30 pm, which is considered a high participation
rate. LNS is located at the Rolling Hills Preparatory School Gymnasium (RHP Gym) in
Torrance, which has three indoor courts for simultaneous multiple games. LNS operates on
an ongoing basis throughout the year and is sponsored by the South Bay Youth Project and
South Bay Coalition.
Sea Laboratory
The Sea Laboratory (“Sea Lab” or “Lab”), located at 1021 North Harbor Drive, is a unique
community resource that promotes environmental education and conservation. It is a non-
profit program of the Los Angeles Conservation Corps, operating in partnership with other
service programs and agencies including Americorps, the City of Redondo Beach, and
Southern California Edison Company.
With its focus on education and marine life, Sea Lab provides opportunities for a variety of
interests including biology, conservation, research, education, theater, volunteer, and
entertainment. Sea Lab participates in large-scale and national promotions, hosting events
such as the Los Angeles Environmental Fairs and annual Earth Day celebrations. The Lab
offers school and group programs for youth, teacher training workshops, and public tours,
and is available for lease to private parties.
Sea Lab facilities include an outdoor aquarium, touch tanks, an aquaculture facility, and
beach access to tide pools. The Lab also has a traveling education component. During the
summer quarter, a day camp program is offered for youth between the ages of 9 and 12. In
addition, other services such as water quality testing and coastal clean-up days originate
from the Sea Lab. Plans are underway to expand the Lab to include a native plant nursery.
The Sea Lab has a large volunteer and internship program. Anyone may apply. Internships
are offered to students who are 18 to 24 years old. The Lab currently hosts more than 40
volunteers and interns each week. There are also opportunities for private sponsors to get
involved to help fund the Sea Lab. The Sea Lab is an important community-based program
and an outstanding activity resource in the City of Redondo Beach.
South Bay Adult School
The South Bay Adult School is governed by a Joint Powers Agreement between the RBUSD
and the Manhattan Beach Unified School District (MBUSD). The school offers open
enrollment for anyone over 18 years old. Participants do not have to live in the South Bay
region to attend classes; however, the school is a noteworthy educational resource for
Redondo Beach residents. Classes are offered at 14 locations, seven of which are in
Redondo Beach. Some classes are held in facilities managed by the Recreation and
Community Services Department. Other classes such as swimming are held at public
schools, including Redondo Union and Mira Costa High Schools. The South Bay Adult
School offers three categories of classes:
                                               3-149

    •    Mandated Classes: English as a Second Language (fully funded by the State of California),
         High School Diploma Program, and Citizenship. Classes are free with several scheduling
         options, including distance learning.

         not receive State funding; they are fully supported by the fees paid by registrants. Teachers
         are community experts who design their own curricula.

    • Health and Safety Education (i.e.,                        wine tasting)

    • Home Economics (i.e., sewing)
These classes are offered on a per semester basis with fees ranging from $19 to $120,
although most classes cost between $30 and $60. The South Bay Adult School program is
easily accessible to the public with low-cost classes, a widely distributed schedule, and
online registration.
Beach Cities Health District
                                   The Beach Cities Health District (BCHD) is a public health
                                   agency that serves residents of Redondo Beach, Manhattan
                                   Beach, and Hermosa Beach. BCHD offers a wide range of

individuals.
Torrance-South Bay YMCA
The YMCA is located in the City of Torrance, at 2900 W. Sepulveda Boulevard. It is a
family-oriented fitness and activity club that strives to enrich the quality of life for youth,
families, and communities through character building principles and the Judeo-Christian
doctrine. This recently expanded, modern facility features cardiovascular and weight rooms,
a running track, a climbing wall, an indoor basketball court and gymnasium, an indoor
swimming pool, an aerobics/dance room, two racquetball courts, and a range of unique

Some of the classes, including junior lifeguarding, basketball, cheerleading, karate,
swimming, and Brazilian dance require additional registration fees. As a non-profit
organization, the YMCA relies on membership fees and donor support to ensure that its
programs and facilities are of high quality and accessible to all. It also hosts several annual
fundraising events. The YMCA programs are designed to foster health and well being in
individuals, families, and communities. The programs serve as an important recreational
supplement to City-sponsored programs available to residents of Redondo Beach and the
South Bay region.
Private Studios and Clubs In and Nearby Redondo Beach
In addition to City and non-profit programs and facilities, there are several private gyms,
studios, and clubs available in and around Redondo Beach. These private entities offer
additional classes and activities to Redondo Beach residents. The following is a table

In addition, the adult book club meets informally two times per month at Catalina Coffee in
Redondo Beach.
Redondo Beach Educational System
In Redondo Beach, public schools make a significant contribution to recreation and parks
opportunities available to the public. Public schools offer extra curricular activities for
youth, providing supplemental recreational opportunities within the City that have not been
quantified in this Element. Many schools in Redondo Beach formally extend after-school
use of their facilities to private organizations and community groups through agreements
under the Civic Center Act. In addition, when facilities are not in use by schools or
organized groups, school playgrounds and playfields become an informal recreational and
open space resource to residents in local neighborhoods.
In the late 1970s and 1980s, more than 35% of school sites within Redondo Beach were
closed, due to substantial demographic shifts and a corresponding decline in school
enrollment. Since then, some surplus school sites have been vacated and permanently or
temporarily converted to alternate uses, while several others are being leased to the City for
recreational purposes. The leased sites help fulfill recreational needs within the City and, in
some cases, have become important resources to local user groups and the surrounding
South Bay region.
Prior to 1993, the provision of local public education was under the jurisdiction of two
separate local school districts, the Redondo Beach City School District (RBCSD), and the
South Bay Union High School District (SBUHSD). RBCSD served grades kindergarten
through eight (K-8) within the City of Redondo Beach, and SBUHSD served grades nine
through twelve (9-12) within the Cities of Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, and Manhattan
Beach. In 1993, a petition and ballot measure was approved for the creation of a single
unified school district within the City of Redondo Beach. Since July 1, 1993, the Redondo
Beach Unified School District (RBUSD) has maintained jurisdiction over all primary and
secondary public schools in the City. The district offices are located at 1401 Inglewood
Avenue in Redondo Beach. Today, RBUSD consists of 12 operating public school sites,
comprised of eight elementary schools, two middle schools, and two secondary schools.
Local public school enrollments can serve as indicators for Census projections and possible
shifts in overall recreational needs within a city when growth trends are monitored over
time. Local school inventories, enrollment trends, and projections will be discussed in
depth.
Community Use of School Facilities
Many of the public schools in Redondo Beach make their gyms, sports fields, and
classrooms available to community groups for recreational and social uses. Local clubs and
sports organizations interested in using school facilities must apply for a special use permit
at least three weeks prior to their event. Applicants must meet criteria outlined in District
Board Policy 1330: provide insurance and a $250 deposit, and sign an agreement stating
                                             3-153
they will not interfere with school activities. Fees for the use of school facilities are based
on the type of user group, age of user group, and the degree to which the group promotes
school-related activities.
Effective January 1, 2004, RBUSD modified its facility use fee schedule. The new schedule
requires previously exempt non-profit community youth groups and organizations to pay for
sports field lighting. The lighting fee is based on actual rate of use plus two cents per
kilowatt-hour. Many non-profit community youth groups and organizations indicated the
lighting fees would greatly impact their ability to use the school facilities, and could
potentially affect their ability to provide community services at no or low-cost.
Surplus School Sites
Since the 1980s, several surplus school sites have been permanently or temporarily
converted to a variety of alternate uses.
    •   In 1980, Cleveland School, south of the intersection of the Pacific Coast Highway
        and Catalina Avenue, was sold and redeveloped as a commercial center.
    •   In 1994, McCandless School, located at 110 South Pacific Coast Highway, was
        converted to a senior housing development. A 60-year ground lease is in place to the
        developer through June 26, 2055.
    •   In 1991, Andrews School, located east of the intersection of Aviation Boulevard and
        Artesia Boulevard, was converted to a senior housing development. In the process,
        the School District executed a 60-year ground lease to the developer through March
        31, 2048.
    •   Upon unification of the RBUSD in 1993, the former Edison School site, located
        southwest of the intersection of Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Inglewood Avenue,
        became the headquarters of the South Bay Adult School (SBAS). SBAS is a joint
        program of the RBUSD and the Manhattan Beach Unified School District
        (MBUSD). RBUSD has been designated the “operating district.” In addition, three
        classrooms are leased to the Los Angeles County Office of Education for use as a
        special education facility. The lease is a year-to-year agreement, and the RBUSD
        does not have plans to change the use of the facility at this time. If Los Angeles
        County were to terminate the lease, the South Bay Adult School would absorb the
        surplus classrooms to provide additional classes.
Numerous other school sites, or portions of sites, have been leased and/or sold to the City
for recreational purposes.
    •   Aviation Park, located in the northwest corner of the City, is part of the former 40-
        acre Aviation High School site. Prior to 1980, Aviation High School was one of
        three high schools that made up the former SBUHSD. However, it was closed due to
        declining enrollment. In June of 1984, voters approved a ballot measure that
        addressed future use of the high school property. Essentially, the outcome involved
        three major components. First, in 1985, 11.4 acres of the campus was rezoned to
        Parks, Recreation and Open Space (P-PRO). A 99-year lease was executed between
                                              3-154

  the SBUHSD and the City of Redondo Beach for the 11.4-acre area to be used for a
  park. Upon unification of the former SBUHSD in 1993, the leased area became the
  assignment of the RBUSD. The 99-year lease is still in effect and is legally valid
  and enforceable. It stipulates that the 11.4-acre parcel may be used only for public
  recreation. In January 2003, the City completed expansion and renovation of the
  Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center (former Aviation High School auditorium)
  on the site, which has become a popular regional theater. Second, the Redondo
  Beach Parking Authority purchased 3.2 acres from the School District in the
  southwest corner of the site to be used as a parking lot. Third, the remaining portion
  of the property was sold and developed as the adjacent business park.
• The City of Redondo Beach has leased an approximate 0.5-acre site north of Lincoln
  School and adjacent to Anderson Park from the South Bay Union High School
  District since 1959. In 1982, the building on the site was renovated, expanded, and
  dedicated by the SBUHSD as a senior center. After school district unification in
  1994, the City entered into a new one-year lease agreement with RBUSD for use of
  the site. The lease stipulates that the site is limited to civic purposes, with first
  priority granted to senior citizens and senior-related activities. Maintenance, repair,
  and desired improvements are the City’s responsibility. The lease expires on June
  30, 2005. To date, the Board of Education has not made a decision about use of the
  facility upon expiration of the lease.
• The City holds a 99-year lease on the former Franklin School site (total site,
  including park, is 6.85 acres), located northeast of the intersection of Inglewood
  Avenue and Fisk Lane. The lease expires January 2085, at which time the City may
  extend for an additional 55 years, unless the District has a demonstrable need to use
  the site for a public school. As part of the lease agreement, the City dedicated two
  unrelated parcels of land to the School District and was required to assist with
  processing for the redevelopment of the former Andrews and McCandless school
  sites.
  The City operates a 3.62-acre multi-use park (Franklin Park) at this site. The
  remaining 3.23-acre portion of the site, containing the former school buildings, is
  used in part for City programs and is subleased in part to Coast Christian School. In
  1977, the City converted the school cafeteria into a 125-seat playhouse. Franklin
  Playhouse and several of the adjacent classrooms are now used for City-sponsored
  drama classes and theatrical performances.
• A portion of the former Fulton School, located southeast of the intersection of
  Rindge Lane and Ripley Avenue, was first leased by the local School District to
  Coast Christian Schools for operation of a day care facility and elementary school in
  May 1985. The lease stipulates a year-to-year rental agreement. The remaining
  1.32-acre portion of the site was sold to the City of Redondo Beach. The City
  constructed Fulton Playfield, consisting of a baseball diamond and associated park
  improvements, on the site. Today, the park is utilized by residents for passive
  recreation, and sports organizations for baseball and softball activities. Coast
  Christian School also has direct access to the playfield.
• The City leases the former Patterson School site, located at 320 Knob Hill Avenue,
  from the School District. Since 1983, the City has used part of the 3.3-acre site to
  house the Department of Recreation and Community Services. Department offices
                                        3-155

         at the site include Senior and Family Services, Housing Assistance, Job Training,
         and South Bay Youth Project, as well as Recreation and Parks Administration. The
         City uses the former school cafeteria for special events/activities and for private
         rentals. The City subleases the remaining portion of the site to Cal State Dominguez
         for adult education classes, and to Carden Dominion, a private pre- and grade school.
         In addition to monthly payments to RBUSD, the Patterson lease requires the City to
         provide bi-monthly mowing and quarterly fertilizing of the turfed playfields at six
         public elementary schools. The City is also required to conduct annual striping of
         parking lot lines at twelve school sites. The lease with RBUSD expires on June 30,
         2006, and the Board of Education has yet to make a determination on the extension
         of the lease.
School Inventory, Enrollment Trends and Projections
RBUSD consists of 10 primary schools serving grades kindergarten through eight (K-8) and
two secondary schools, Redondo Union High School and Redondo Shores High School,
serving grades nine through twelve (9-12). Redondo Shores High School is a continuation
school for junior and senior students, ages 16 through 18. The table below provides
statistics on each of the 12 operating schools in the RBUSD. The general location of each
school is illustrated in Exhibit 3 on page 3-121.

In the past, local school districts were able to estimate the maximum capacity of each school
site based on maximum classroom occupancy standards. However, today there are other
factors that make establishment of maximum school capacities less easy to determine. For
example, RBUSD is participating in a voluntary State-wide student achievement program,
known as Classroom Size Reduction (CSR), which grants funding incentives to schools
limiting class sizes in grades kindergarten through third (K-3). Statewide participation in
the program has increased dramatically since the program’s inception in 1996.
                                                3-156

RBUSD first applied to CSR in 1996. This has resulted in an ongoing shortage of classroom
space. Although primary school class sizes in the RBUSD may be well below maximum
classroom occupancy standards, many have reached the CSR maximum, making analysis of
RBUSD school capacities convoluted. RBUSD officials have stated that Jefferson
Elementary School is rapidly approaching its maximum regulated capacity, as are other
schools in south Redondo Beach. To further intensify the growing shortage of classroom
space, RBUSD has not identified available land adjacent to these existing school sites for
school expansion. Nor has the District conducted an analysis to determine the optimum
utilization of existing sites. Additionally, when projecting and planning for future education
needs, the School District has to take impacting factors such as State and federal regulatory
standards into account.
The following history of public school enrollment from 1992-93 through 2003-04 depicts a
steady increase in the Redondo Beach school population, though the rate of growth has
slowed since 1990-00. However, this upward trend is not merely a function of local
demographic growth. During this period, there were a number of changes in the local public
school system that greatly impacted student enrollment.

Upon unification of the School District in 1993, district enrollment in Redondo Beach
increased by over 35%. Also, as part of the district unification, Redondo Shores High
School (formerly Pacific Shores High School) was founded and annexed from the
Manhattan Beach Unified School District (MBUSD) into the RBUSD.
More recently, effective in 2003-04, the MBUSD rescinded an agreement that had been in
place for ten years, known as “The Interdistrict Attendance Agreement for High School
Pupils Residing in North Redondo Between Manhattan Beach Unified School District and
Redondo Beach Unified School District.” Effectively, students residing in a particular
geographic area of north Redondo Beach no longer have the choice to attend either district.
                                               3-157

As a result, RBUSD estimates an influx of approximately 100 additional students in each
freshman class at Redondo Union High School over the next three years.
Although school enrollment rates continue to increase annually, RBUSD projects that the
District has entered a low-growth phase that will remain relatively level in the upcoming
years. In light of this, it is not likely that additional surplus school sites will become
available for new uses in the near future.
Population Projections and Parkland Standards
Population growth and changes in concentrations of density have a direct impact on
recreation and park facilities within a city, particularly when the amount of
parkland/recreation facilities does not increase proportionately. The table below provides
the 1980, 1990, and 2000 U.S. Census data for population and housing in the City of
Redondo Beach.
                    City of Redondo Beach Population and Housing Data
    Year        Population      Increase % Increase Housing Units      Increase % Increase
    1980          57,102            --            --          25,867       --        --
    1990          60,167          3,065         5.4%          28,220     2,353     9.1%
    2000          63,261          3,094         5.1%          29,543     1,323     4.7%

In the ten years between the 1990 and 2000 Census counts, the total population in Redondo
Beach increased by 5.1%, with the 5-14, 45-59 and over 75 age groups experiencing the
most growth. During this same period, the 25-44 age group experienced a deceleration in
population growth. This growth deceleration is correlated to the aging population of “baby
boomers” (those born between 1943 and 1957), who in the year 2000 were approximately 43
to 57 years old.
Every three years, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) publishes a
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) Trend Projection. The following table summarizes
SCAG population and housing projections for the City of Redondo Beach for 2010 and
2020.
                 City Redondo Beach Population and Housing Projections
    Year        Population      Increase      % Increase Housing Units Increase % Increase
    2010          65,917          2,656          4.2%          31,843    2,300     7.8%
    2020          69,659          3,742          5.7%          35,448    3,605    11.3%
Source: Draft SCAG 2004 Regional Transportation Plan Trend Projection
Similar to the forecast for Redondo Beach public schools, overall population growth through
2010 is expected to continue, but at a slower rate than observed between 1990 and 2000. By
the year 2010, the “baby boomer” population will be approximately 53 to 67 years old. The
projected decline in the rate of public school enrollment may also be related to this “baby
                                                3-158

boomer” phenomenon: as this group ages, they will have fewer babies, subsequently
affecting the number of school-aged children. It is important to consider the aging “baby
boomers” when planning for new and upgraded recreation and park facilities in Redondo
Beach, and particular attention should be given to senior facilities, programs, and services.
Redondo Beach is a mature coastal city and as its population increases, it will continue to
face the challenge of providing a proportionate amount of parkland/recreation facilities.
Parkland Standards
In the early 1990s, the National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) established a
parkland standard of 6.25 to 10.50 acres of developed open space per 1,000 persons. This
standard could have easily been applied to relatively young cities that had available open
space to develop as their populations increased. However, it soon became evident that the
standard was not always appropriate for mature and/or built-out communities. Other factors,
such as size, location, and operating budget were also found to affect a community’s ability
to provide parkland.
Therefore, in 1996, the NRPA recommended that communities establish their own parkland
standards, as opposed to adhering to a national, “one-size-fits-all” approach. Standards are
set based on the individual characteristics of a community, including age, population
composition, location, available resources, etc. In Redondo Beach, an older urban
community, a customized standard is appropriate given the built-out nature of the City.
The California Subdivision Map Act, another source for parkland standards, includes a
section specifically related to park and recreation facility development in California
communities. This section, the Quimby Act, was established in 1965 to address California’s
increasing urbanization and the need to protect and preserve open space for growing
communities. The Quimby Act sets forth guidelines for developer exactions and in-lieu fees
that may be used by cities for parkland development. The Act establishes a parkland
standard of three acres per 1,000 persons and, in some instances, a standard of up to five
acres per 1,000 persons.
Given that the NRPA recommends local and regional flexibility regarding parkland
standards and that the Quimby Act standards best reflect California community conditions,
the recommended City of Redondo Beach parkland standard is three acres per 1,000
persons.
In 1990, the estimated open space/parkland to population ratio in the City of Redondo Beach
was 2.995 acres per 1,000 persons. In 2000, the estimated ratio dropped to 2.45 acres per
1,000 persons. The 2004 SCAG RTP trend projection for the year 2010 (65,917 persons),
combined with the City’s existing park inventory (155.08 acres) will yield a parkland to
population ratio of 2.35 acres per 1,000 persons. This reflects a projected overall open
space/parkland deficit of 42.85 acres in 2010, based on the new recommended City standard.
                                            3-159

Public Input Program
A Public Input Program was conducted to obtain information about the public’s current and
future needs related to parks, recreational facilities, and programs provided by the City.
Public input was obtained via focused interviews and public workshops.
A series of confidential focused interviews was conducted during a two-month period.
Interviews were limited to approximately 35-45 minutes each, and approximately 60
individuals were interviewed. Residents, members of special interest groups, organizations,
leagues and clubs, recreation program instructors, members of the Redondo Beach Unified
School District, City Staff, and current and former City Councilmembers and
Commissioners were included in the interview process.
Three pubic workshops were scheduled as part of the Public Input Program. The workshops
were advertised to the public through a variety of sources. The first two were held at the
Alta Vista Community Center, 715 Julia Street, and the third workshop was held at the Perry
Park Senior Center, 2301 Grant Avenue. The third public workshop was approximately 1.5
hours and included an introduction and description of the Element Update process,
interactive group discussions regarding the strengths and weaknesses of specific recreation
topics, and prioritization of recreation issues. There were approximately 40 attendees at the
third workshop. To compensate for the lack of participation at the first two workshops,
additional individuals were interviewed.
The Public Input Program helped identify community needs and other issues related to City
parkland and recreation facilities and programs. The following is a summary of the input
received in alphabetical order by topic.
    •   Beach & Pier
        Participants in the Public Input Program indicated that the County beach is a
        recreational resource the community consistently enjoys. Participants felt fortunate
        to live near one of the “biggest parks a City can have.” Walking, biking, swimming,
        and surfing are recreational activities residents participate in at the beach.
        Participants requested a few improvements to further enhance residents’ pleasurable
        experience at the beach. Such improvements include beautifying the bluffs,
        increasing the quantity of trash containers, and providing an adequate and safe
        distance between the bike and pedestrian paths on the promenade. Some participants
        commented on the amount of cruising traffic on the Esplanade, and recommended
        widening the sidewalk and bicycle path for pedestrians and narrowing the roadway
        for motorists to reduce vehicular traffic.
        Participants believed that more non-residents than residents take advantage of the
        Municipal Pier. Some felt that the pier has a strong regional and tourist draw and is
        less a venue for locals. Participants suggested that the Pier could be made more
        attractive to residents by installing informative/educational exhibits; providing
        additional parking, especially during the summer months; and creating a higher
        quality mix of commercial uses on the Pier, though tenant mix is controlled by
        Master Lessees. There was strong interest in continuing summer concerts at the Pier.
                                              3-160

• Bikeways
  Participants in the Public Input Program had concerns regarding two sets of
  bikeways in the City: an existing bikeway along the coast and a proposed bikeway
  in the Southern California Edison Company (SCE) right-of-way. Many participants
  expressed concern that the bikeway along the coast is not easily accessible. They
  indicated there is not a direct path of travel for cyclists from Hermosa Beach to
  Redondo Beach. In addition, some felt the bike path through King Harbor is
  challenging and sometimes dangerous for both cyclists and pedestrians. Some
  participants noted that although the bike path could be better designed through the
  marina, boaters have resisted and have discouraged the City from locating a bike
  path through the harbor area.
  The City received a grant in 1997 from the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) to
  construct a bike path in the SCE right-of-way. The majority of the right-of-way is
  located parallel to Phelan Lane in northern Redondo Beach, and then follows
  Rockefeller Lane eastward towards The Galleria. Some participants expressed
  concern with the public safety and utility of this proposed bikeway, particularly at
  intersections where conflict between bicyclists and motorists is potentially high.
  Participants suggested that speed tables or “speed bumps” might remedy this
  problem. However, the Fire Department indicated that traffic calming measures at
  intersections could cause delays for emergency vehicles. Some participants felt that
  the proposed route will not be utilized. Participants also reported that residents who
  live adjacent to the SCE right-of-way have repeatedly opposed any recreation use in
  this area because they believed there might be potential security issues. Residents
  have recommended alternative bike paths on the street, but these were rejected by a
  majority of bicyclists for safety reasons. Overall, participants agreed that adding
  bike paths through the City should be a priority to encourage alternate forms of
  transportation.
• Financing
  Participants in the Public Input Program were aware of the City’s budget constraints,
  particularly in regard to funding parks and recreation. However, some participants
  stated that the City is not “thinking outside the box.” They believed that creative
  financing is necessary to produce the right mix of funding to fuel public projects.
  Some participants felt that park and recreation spending is not distributed evenly
  throughout the City or among certain segments of the population. Participants
  suggested the following mechanisms to finance the parks and recreation system in
  Redondo Beach: state and federal grants, Quimby fees, corporate sponsorships,
  partnerships, bonds, programs such as Adopt-a-Park and Public Enterprise; and user
  fees (particularly for non-residents). Participants indicated that Anderson Park
  improvements, Aviation Park improvements, a skateboard park, and a teen center in
  south Redondo Beach are projects that should receive high priority in the City’s
  Capital Improvement Program (CIP).
• King Harbor
  Many participants in the Public Input Program indicated that they valued the marina.
  Some participants requested improvements to further increase the appeal of this City
  resource. They felt the harbor should be a destination point. Participants suggested
                                       3-161

  that more recreational opportunities be made available for the general public
  including areas for picnicking, trails, and/or a promenade along the edge of the
  marina. Participants felt that additional facilities, such as a museum, skateboard
  park, and athletic fields should be constructed to attract visitors and residents. In
  addition, participants suggested integrating more greenspace in the harbor.
  Moonstone Park is one of the few parks in the harbor area, but participants stated
  that it is underutilized and should be improved. Participants reported that boaters
  have recommended creating a dog park at this park. In contrast, Seaside Lagoon is a
  very successful facility in King Harbor. Because of its popularity, participants
  would like to see the Lagoon enlarged, longer operating hours, more off-season
  events, a better snack facility, and a larger and more secure storage facility.
  One of the most challenging concerns in the harbor area is the need for a public boat
  launch ramp. Participants had mixed opinions regarding potential locations for this
  facility. Participants also recommended improving Harbor Drive to accommodate
  other modes of transportation such as bicycles. Participants indicated that currently
  there are conflicts between pedestrians, bikes, and vehicles on this roadway. There
  was also a concern with the gated entrance to Mole B. Participants felt the gate
  should be eliminated to improve public access to Moonstone Park and other facilities
  in the harbor. Finally, participants requested additional guest boat slips.
• Maintenance
  Participants in the Public Input Program agreed that the City is adequately
  maintaining parks and recreation facilities despite the lack of municipal funds and
  staffing. They also agreed that maintenance in Redondo Beach has significantly
  improved over the years. Participants noted that the City has updated parks and
  facilities over the last several years with new lighting, signage, and improvements to
  meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. Some participants believed
  that although newer parks comply with ADA standards, some older parks do not.
  Participants reported that Perry Park, Dominguez Park, and Alta Vista Park are a few
  of the parks that were most recently and significantly improved. As a result, they felt
  that these parks have become increasingly popular among residents and are heavily
  used.
  City Staff indicated that internal communication among all departments involved
  with parks projects could be improved. City Staff also noted that the Parks and
  Facilities Maintenance Division is understaffed and additional resources are needed
  for routine maintenance. Participants and City Staff agreed that in order to address
  this issue, the City should coordinate and share resources with other entities such as
  the Redondo Beach Unified School District.
  Participants in the Public Input Program noted occasional concerns with cleanliness
  at heavily used restroom facilities. Some participants requested that park fences,
  where they exist, be removed to make the parks more user-friendly. However, Staff
  indicated that the City receives numerous requests to install park fences as protective
  barriers. Participants also commented that facilities at older parks should be
  upgraded. In general, participants felt that the City takes better care of recreation
                                         3-162

  facilities than does the School District. They indicated the school fields and other
  facilities maintained by the School District are not properly maintained for frequent
  use by sports leagues and organizations.
• New Parkland & Recreation Facilities
  The majority of residents who were interviewed said they believed additional
  parkland and recreational facilities would benefit the City. However, participants
  acknowledged that Redondo Beach is fairly built-out and that very little vacant land
  remains for park development. Participants requested that the City prioritize
  greenspace acquisition in the harbor area. A number of sites and buildings were
  suggested during the Public Input Program as potential locations for new parkland
  and/or recreation facilities, including the AES power plant site, City yards, the
  former Camacho’s restaurant, the octagonal building near the harbor, and vacant
  occupancies on the pier.
• Parks
  Participants in the Public Input Program were typically pleased with the amount and
  types of parks in the City. They felt the park system caters to all ages and types of
  users. Participants stated that the City’s facilities are valuable and should be
  carefully maintained. Some said it is also important to maximize the use and
  potential of all parks; provide additional greenspace in south Redondo Beach; add
  more lighted sports fields; address parking problems at Anderson, Aviation, and
  Dominguez Parks; replace underutilized park amenities; and prioritize parks and
  recreation resources. Many adult participants indicated that they had used City of
  Redondo Beach parks when their children were younger, but that more recently, time
  limitations and busy lifestyles prevented them from taking advantage of the City’s
  park system. Participants recommended the following parkland additions and
  improvements: extending Greenbelt Park from Hermosa Beach into Redondo Beach,
  protecting unobstructed ocean views from Czuleger, and maintaining existing parks
  over constructing new parks.
• Public Safety
  Overall, participants in the Public Input Program indicated that parks and other
  recreation facilities in Redondo Beach are perceived as safe areas. Participants were
  not concerned with many public safety issues. The few safety issues that were
  discussed during interviews included: occasional car burglaries at Dominguez Park,
  minor alcohol problems at adult sporting events and at Seaside Lagoon, and
  transients whose presence and individual activities can deter some people from using
  parks.
• Recreation Facilities
  Participants in the Public Input Program reported that the recreation facilities in
  Redondo Beach are used extensively by individuals and organizations. For example,
  they indicated the three senior centers in the City are heavily used and need only
  minor improvements. Participants agreed that these senior centers adequately serve
  the needs of the senior population and that another center is not needed. A few
  participants requested the following facilities: additional barbeques and receptacles
  for disposal of barbeque coals at parks, a model airplane flying field, and a
                                       3-163

  permanent facility for the sailing program in the harbor. Other participants,
  particularly the elderly, requested a heated public swimming pool for water therapy
  purposes. Participants expressed mixed opinions about whether or not the City needs
  another swimming pool given there are swimming facilities located at Seaside
  Lagoon, the public high schools, and the private gymnasiums in the City and
  surrounding area. Participants suggested that the City coordinate with some of these
  entities and inform the public of the availability of swimming facilities in the
  Recreation and Community Services Newsletter and on the City’s website.
  A majority of participants in the Public Input Program felt the City should construct
  a skateboard park. Participants of all ages believed this facility should be a high
  priority for the City, particularly given the damage to public and private properties
  caused by skateboarders. Participants suggested potential sites for the skateboard
  park, including the AES power plant site, the City Parks Yard below Dominguez
  Park, and the SCE Rights-of-Way. A second teen center and another multi-purpose
  community center are two other facilities requested by participants. Most
  participants felt a teen center is needed in south Redondo Beach and recommended
  two potential sites: the racquetball facility at Alta Vista Park and the City Parks
  Yard below Dominguez Park.                   Finally, although there are various
  community/meeting facilities in Redondo Beach, participants noted that there is not a
  single facility that provides a combination of classrooms, ample storage space, and
  meeting rooms. Participants reported that non-profit groups would like to meet in a
  facility without a fee or at least for a nominal fee. Staff indicated that the Hayward
  Community Center is available for use by qualifying community and non-profit
  organizations free of charge.
• Recreation Programs & Events
  Overall, participants in the Public Input Program spoke very highly of the Recreation
  and Community Services Department and indicated that Staff is very responsive to
  the recreation needs and requests of the community. Participants stated that the
  quarterly recreation program newsletter is a valuable resource. However, they
  believed it could be more effective if it were advertised in several sources, including
  distribution to residents of adjacent cities. Some participants presented the idea of
  creating a “welcome to the neighborhood brochure” to introduce new families to
  City activities and resources, park facilities, and recreation programs.
  Interviewees noted that the Beach Cities Health District has a great facility with a
  variety of health services and fitness classes, though some consider membership to
  be expensive. Some reported that there is not much overlap with City classes and
  programs because the Health District coordinates its course programming and
  scheduling with those of the City and the South Bay Adult School. Participants
  agreed that coordination should continue between the City and other agencies
  providing recreation activities.
  Participants indicated their appreciation of City-sponsored special events, such as
  outdoor movies and the summer concert series. They believed these kinds of events
  appeal to families and to all ages, and many hope they continue. Some participants
  noted that the weekly Farmer’s Market at Veterans Park is popular and suggested
                                         3-164

  other types of markets for the harbor area. They believed that this would be another
  way to attract residents to community functions. Participants recognized that special
  programs are dependent upon the City budget, even though they may be relatively
  inexpensive to operate. The community-wide special events offered through the
  Senior and Family Services Department were also highly regarded by participants.
• School District Relations
  Many interviewees in the Public Input Program acknowledged that the City’s
  relationship with the Redondo Beach Unified School District is critical to the
  operation of the recreation and parks program. However, several interviewees
  expressed opposing views regarding public use of school facilities. Some
  interviewees believed that School District facilities are presently underutilized and
  that they should be readily available for additional public uses. For example, most of
  the public schools have fencing and gates around the sports fields, leaving only the
  play areas available for public use. These participants recommended more
  cooperation with the School District to increase facility usage by outside groups.
  Other interviewees indicated that the School District is trying to accommodate recent
  budget constraints, which limits the District’s ability to provide free use of its
  facilities to the public. In addition, some interviewees mentioned that the School
  District has a responsibility to plan for projected increases in student enrollment. At
  some point in the future, accommodating more students may limit the availability of
  school facilities to the public altogether.
  Participants reported that as of January 1, 2004, basketball courts at the Adams and
  Parras Middle Schools would no longer be lit by the School District without
  reimbursement from users. Participants felt that although there are other basketball
  courts available, they are poorly lit. Interviewees believed that City programs and
  league sports would be greatly impacted by lighting fees. They reported that sports
  leagues are looking for cost-saving alternatives such as practices before dark and
  shorter sports seasons. However, interviewees indicated that if leagues cannot raise
  enough money to pay for lighting through fundraisers, some programs will be
  cancelled before the end of the 2004 season. Some interviewees mentioned that
  cost-sharing negotiations between the School District, City, and Southern California
  Edison Company are well underway.
  Many participants in the Public Input Program indicated that they had observed
  political tension between the School District and the City during development of the
  former Heart of the City Specific Plan. Interviewees reported that as of February 1,
  2004, the School District has a new Superintendent. Participants indicated that
  during the interview process for the Superintendent position, an idea was brought to
  the table to create a master partnership between the School District and the City.
  Participants stated that the School District is considering a League of California
  Cities model program that would facilitate communication between the City and
  School District through a series of mediated workshops. Although many
  interviewees noted that relations with the School District have been poor in the past,
  there was a general consensus among all participants that this relationship has
  recently improved. Interviewees expressed their hopes that the two entities would
                                         3-165

  continue to work to achieve open communication to avoid possibilities of
  misinformation in the future.
• Senior-Related Issues
  Participants in the Public Input Program felt that the City has a very strong and
  active senior recreation and social services program that relies heavily on the use of
  the three senior centers and the administration facility at Knob Hill Avenue. Some
  participants commented that all centers could use more maintenance and assistance
  with set-up for various programs. Participants were generally dissatisfied with the
  number of standard and disabled parking spaces at each senior center. Some
  participants believed that the older Anderson Park Senior Center is not being
  improved because it is in its last lease-year from the School District. They expressed
  concern over the necessity to relocate the Anderson senior programs in the event that
  the School District takes back the building. Not a single participant wanted to see a
  reduction in the number of senior programs or facilities.
  Many Public Input Program participants felt that shared-ride transportation services
  for seniors to and from parks, senior buildings, and adjacent cities could improve.
  Participants listed Dial-a-Taxi (formerly Dial-a-Lift) and the WAVE as available
  transportation services, though some believed the WAVE is not physically accessible
  for seniors with limited mobility. However, Dial-a-Taxi specifically serves persons
  with temporary or permanent disabilities. Additionally, one interviewee estimated
  that the WAVE accommodates approximately 100 wheelchairs each month in
  ridership, and stated that the WAVE may be restricted in its ability to respond to all
  requests due to the limited number of WAVE buses on the road.
• Southern California Edison Company Rights-of-Way
  The City is licensed to use approximately 17 acres of land within Southern California
  Edison (SCE) Company rights-of-way. Some participants in the Public Input
  Program wanted to see additional rights-of-way areas made available to the City for
  public use. However, they acknowledged that some of these rights-of-way are
  licensed by SCE to commercial entities. Many participants agreed that it is
  challenging to find a common ground between the City, SCE, residents, and other
  rights-of-way lessees, although in recent months the conflicts over the best use of the
  land seem to have subsided. Participants recommended that the City continue to
  search for alternative and shared uses of the rights-of-way.
• Youth-Related Issues
  Some participants in the Public Input Program felt that the Youth Commission
  should play a more influential role in the City, be more frequently engaged in special
  projects, and be asked to provide more input on current issues. Participants
  suggested expanding the Youth Commission to include grade school youth. They
  also recommended developing a Youth Element of the General Plan. Interviewees
  indicated that student surveys conducted by the Youth Commission at local public
  schools are valuable tools for obtaining youth input, and they felt surveys should be
  conducted more frequently and at additional schools. In order to accomplish this,
  interviewees stated that a more cooperative partnership should be fostered with the
  School District.

Future Recreation and Park Needs (2004-2014)
The following is a discussion of future recreation and park needs and priorities based on
analysis of the following information:
    • Inventory of existing parkland, recreation facilities, and recreation programs
    • Public parkland acreage per population ratios
    • Public Input Program
    • Distribution of existing public parkland and recreation facilities
    • Current and projected population, age composition, and growth trends
General themes derived from analyzing this information are presented below.
General Themes:
    1. There is a deficit of parks and recreational facilities in the City.
                Additional parks and recreation facilities are needed to adequately serve the
                current and future populations of Redondo Beach. The City is approaching
                build-out, and there are few available vacant parcels remaining to develop
                new parkland or recreational facilities. It will be necessary to supplement the
                existing inventory with other types of recreational resources.
    2. Ongoing park and facility maintenance/rehabilitation will play a crucial role in a city
        with limited opportunities to develop new parkland.
                Improving the quality and preserving the existing inventory of recreation
                resources will contribute to the level of service and quality of the leisure
                experience available to residents. The condition and types of park facilities
                should be evaluated periodically. Facilities should be rehabilitated and
                modified as demographics change.
    3. The City should continue to capitalize on its prime coastal location to the maximum
        extent possible.
                There are opportunities west of Pacific Coast Highway, particularly in the
                marina and at the beach, to create a vibrant leisure experience for residents
                and visitors. Creating an enhanced waterfront with trail connections to
                neighboring coastal cities could heighten the appeal of one of the City’s top
                attractions--the beach area.
    4. It is essential for the City to identify and pursue alternative revenue sources for
        future capital improvement projects.
                Residential development fees will not be available to fund most park and
                recreation projects after build-out. The City will need creative and effective
                financing mechanisms.
A list of the community’s recreation-related needs is presented in Exhibit 5. Each need has
been rated as high, moderate, or low priority as follows:
                                              3-167

Priority Rating 1 (high):
    − Participants in the Public Input Program frequently rated the need as a high priority.
    − Addressing the need will help the City achieve the recommended standard of three
        acres of parkland for every 1,000 residents.
    − Addressing the need will maintain or improve the quality of the recreation
        experience for a large number of residents in the City.
    − Addressing the need will result in the development of a desirable recreational
        resource that is currently lacking in the City.
    − This need is related to a State or federal mandate (i.e., the Americans with
        Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990).
Priority Rating 2 (moderate):
    − Participants in the Public Input Program identified the need, but did not rate it as a
        high priority.
    − Addressing the need will potentially enhance recreational opportunities and quality
        of life for Redondo Beach residents.
Priority Rating 3 (low):
    − Participants in the Public Input Program rated need as a low priority.
    − Addressing the need will eventually improve the quality of the parks and recreation
        system in the City.

   All needs have been incorporated into the policies in this updated Element (refer to Section
   3.4.5 Goals, Objectives, and Policies). Ultimately, implementing the collection of these
   policies will fulfill the Element’s goal of improving the recreation and parks system in the
   City of Redondo Beach.
   Funding Mechanisms for Parks and Recreation Facilities and Programs
   Redondo Beach residents are generally satisfied with current recreation programs and
   existing facilities. However, projected demographic shifts will directly impact recreation
   preferences and parkland uses. The City will continue to be challenged to provide adequate
   recreation and park resources to serve its increasing population, because there is a shortage
   of available vacant land for parkland acquisition and expansion.
   The City of Redondo Beach should continue to locate and acquire additional open space and
   parkland, while pursuing ongoing funding and generating revenue streams from current park
   and recreation facilities. Improvement of existing park and recreation resources, and
   expansion of the City’s parkland inventory will require implementation of new funding
   strategies. The City of Redondo Beach should consider the following strategies to
   effectively enforce all recreation and park funding mechanisms:
        • Ensure the existing recreation and park system is being utilized to its maximum
            capacity;
        • Determine the best use of existing resources, and adapt underutilized resources to
            new uses in a proactive fashion;
        • Perform periodic evaluations of recreation facilities in order to identify and respond
            quickly to changing community needs;
                                                    3-172

    •    Implement creative, flexible solutions for allocating parkland and modernizing
         facilities;
    •    Provide balanced funding strategies while maintaining a baseline of ‘fee-free’ access
         to park and recreation resources.
Parkland Dedication and In-Lieu Fees
Development impact fees are used in many cities to help fund park, recreation facility and
other infrastructure development. The fees have been popular in the State since the passage
of Proposition 13, which reduced property tax revenues to local governments. Impact fees
are typically imposed on new residential and/or commercial development in a community.
Fee revenue must be used to mitigate the impacts the additional residents or businesses will
have on existing infrastructure. Additionally, the fees must accurately and proportionately
reflect the cost of mitigating the impacts to which they are related.
The Quimby Act (Government Code Section 66477) of the California Subdivision Map Act
authorizes communities in the Sate to exact land development. The fees are directly related
to the impacts of such development on park and recreation facilities. The Quimby Act
provides a formula for determining the amount of land dedication or impact fee based on the
number of new residents in the development, the cost of parkland in the community, and the
jurisdiction’s parkland acreage standard.
Requirements for park dedication fees in the City are identified in Article 14, Chapter 1,
Title 10 of the Redondo Beach Municipal Code. The current impact fee, $400/unit, was
adopted in 1972 and has never been modified. This fee is extremely low in comparison to
impacts fees levied by other cities in the South Bay.
In order to provide the City with an adequate funding mechanism for parkland and
recreation facilities development, the Quimby Act should be implemented to the fullest
extent possible. In comparison to the current Park and Recreation Facilities Fee, the
Quimby Act calculation formulas would substantially increase the impact fees collected by
the City.
Other Funding Mechanisms
As Redondo Beach grows, the City will be challenged to finance development and
maintenance of new parks and recreation facilities to meet the growing needs of residents.
The City should explore the following options to supplement existing resources for parks
and recreation facilities and programs:
    •    Consider public/private partnerships when appropriate. Encourage public parkland
         development and/or facility operations by private enterprises.
    •    Promote corporate sponsorship, naming rights, and exclusive use agreements. Allow
         businesses to sponsor special events. Lease park facility naming rights, and
         negotiate fee structures with user groups and other organizations in exchange for
         exclusive facility use or other incentives.
                                               3-173

• Establish corporate endorsement programs through the use of company placards on
  municipal vehicles and other City property. The placards would not necessarily be
  advertisements, but could take the form of public endorsements, such as “Northrop
  Grumman Supports Redondo Beach Youth,” or “ABC Organization Works for a
  Clean Redondo Beach.”
• Provide opportunities to increase revenues through concessionaire programs. This
  could be accomplished through negotiations with private management companies to
  assume operations and maintenance activities at sports facilities and large venue City
  parks, through exclusive agreements with vendors at special or municipal sponsored
  events, and through citywide concession leases.
• Renew a cooperative alliance with the Redondo Beach Unified School District.
  Jointly identify locations of future school sites or school facility improvements that
  would facilitate adjacent park acquisition and development of subsequent
  park/school complexes.
• Evaluate the feasibility of entering into joint-use agreements and joint ventures with
  other cities, public entities, and private organizations to provide supplemental
  recreational activities and programs for Redondo Beach residents.
• Establish a Joint-Powers Authority for management and allocation of parkland and
  open space resources throughout the City. A non-profit Joint-Powers Authority
  could be created to form a partnership of major recreation oriented stakeholders in
  the South Bay region. This authority would be made up of representatives from local
  jurisdictions, as well as corporate user groups and other organizations. This body
  would help facilitate the sharing of recreation and park resources of member cities
  and organizations. In essence, this funding mechanism would enlarge the recreation
  and parkland ‘pie’ to include Redondo Beach in a larger parkland inventory and
  funding network.
• Continue to seek out and pursue federal, state, and private foundation support to
  assist in acquisition, development, and programming of park and recreation
  resources. Maintain existing outreach for funding sources from federal programs
  such as Federal Land & Water Conservation Fund, ISTEA and TDA funds; and park
  bond and trail grants offered by the State of California and Los Angeles County.
  Explore other Federal and State grant programs such as: Urban Park & Recreation
  Recovery from the National Park Service; Coastal Zone Management Program.
  Various State grants are periodically available from: Department of Boating and
  Waterways, California Arts Council, State Attorney General’s ‘Crime and Violence
  Prevention Center,’ Department of Water Resources and the State Integrated Waste
  Management Board. Private funding sources to consider are ‘Greenprinting L.A.’
  from the Trust for Public Land; State Coastal Conservancy, Habitat Conservation
  Fund and the private foundation, The Parks Company. Investigate other grants from
  private corporations such as Starbucks, Microsoft, and Chevron Oil, funneled
  through local offices.
                                       3-174

• Encourage public and private support from recreation-oriented community clubs and
  organizations to provide subsidies for users who cannot afford user and registration
  fees. Explore methods to secure funding from private donors, gifts and estate
  bequests.
• Audit and assess park user fees and program registration fees to ensure they are
  economically self-sustaining. Determine if fees are comparable to those of other
  jurisdictions in the South Bay region and make adjustments accordingly. Consider a
  fee increase for users who are not residents of Redondo Beach.
• Establish a non-profit foundation to fundraise for parks and recreation facilities and
  programs. The foundation could: (1) solicit philanthropic and other entities for non-
  profit grants not ordinarily available to public agencies; (2) solicit private
  contributions of real estate, stocks, and other gifts through wills, bequests, and
  endowments; (3) solicit annual cash donations from residents, local businesses and
  other stakeholders; and (4) promote and sponsor special events to generate funding
  for park and recreation operations.
• Increase the allocation of City funds to enhance park and recreation operating
  budgets.
• Continue to promote participation of community volunteers in recreational programs,
  special events, and other civic projects to offset budget costs and to supplement City
  park and recreation staff positions.
• Utilize Real Estate Certificates of Participation (COPs) to provide occasional
  infusions of capital for park and facility development and expansion. COPs enable a
  jurisdiction to borrow money against its own expected revenues from the State or
  large financial institutions. COPs are generally purchased in amounts between $2.5
  and $25 million, and are similar to tax-exempt bonds. However, this financing
  mechanism requires only City Council approval; it is not subject to voter approval.
  Identifying ongoing project cash flows as a revenue source can be problematic when
  using COPs.

3.4.6   Implementation Programs
Recreation and Parks Section
•   Implement the Quimby Act (Government Code Section 66477, Subdivision Map Act)
    to provide funding for parkland and recreation facilities. Require by ordinance the
    dedication of local park acreage, the payment of fees, or some combination of both
    for park and recreation purposes, as authorized by the Quimby Act (Policies 8.2a.1,
    8.2b.1, 8.2b.12, 8.2e.1).
•   Implement the following to increase recreational opportunities and the quantity of
    parks, recreation areas and facilities in the City (Policies 8.2a.1, 8.2a.2, 8.2a.6,
    8.2b.1, 8.2b.11, 8.2b.12, 8.2c.1, 8.2e.2):
        Acquire new parkland on a proactive basis as property and funds become
        available, and as opportunities arise, consistent with the objectives and policies
        set forth in this Element and with the City’s Statement of Financial Principles.
        Convert public and quasi-public property into parkland and recreation facilities to
        minimize costs associated with acquisition and development of new
        parkland/facilities.
        Encourage public involvement and work cooperatively with specialized user
        groups to identify, acquire, design, and develop parkland to ensure community
        needs are met.
        Increase the quantity of parks in park deficient areas of the City, particularly in
        northern (north of Artesia Boulevard) and in southern (south of Knob Hill
        Avenue) Redondo Beach.
        Evaluate development of parkettes and playfields in areas where development of
        larger community and neighborhood parks is infeasible or impractical.
        Develop a program that encourages private owners and public agencies to sell,
        dedicate, donate or lease at minimal cost surplus land that is suitable for
        recreational use.
        Support the acquisition and improvement of parkland through private donations,
        establishment of tax benefits, living trusts, etc.
        Evaluate compatible secondary uses in public utility easements. Bikeways,
        walking trails, passive and/or active recreation should be considered potential
        secondary uses in the Southern California Edison (SCE) Company rights-of-way.
        At a minimum, beautify existing utility and other underutilized public rights-of-
        way.
                                             3-181

      Determine if the following sites/buildings can be used for the development of new
      parkland and/or recreation facilities. Target and prioritize sites for acquisition
      based on demographics and community need. Expansion and acquisition of
      property adjacent to existing facilities shall be given priority over the acquisition
      of entirely new sites:
      Land:
      o Underutilized Perry Allison Playfield

      the highest standard of care for recreation and park facilities, particularly park
      restrooms.
      Explore partial assumption of facilities maintenance and operations with
      responsible civic groups, service clubs, or other non-profit organizations.
      Monitor the demand for and utilization of park and recreation facilities (i.e.,
      racquetball court building in Alta Vista Park, shuffleboard courts at Veterans Park
      and Anderson Park Senior Centers). Replace or upgrade underutilized facilities as
      appropriate.
      Evaluate the quality, quantity, and types of park and recreation facilities in the
      City. As appropriate, add facilities such as permanent storage areas to
      accommodate park users (i.e., league and club sports, other organizations).
      Formulate guidelines and standards to reduce maintenance, energy, and water
      costs in future park and landscape improvement design.
• Implement the following measures to monitor and address public safety concerns at
  parks and recreation facilities (Policy 8.2b.3):
      Enforce local laws and incorporate citizen involvement in programs to prevent
      and control vandalism of park property.

      Install additional landscaping, hardscape, fencing, lighting, and signage.
• Identify and redesign public areas that could be used as sites for family gatherings,
  picnics, and informal or impromptu games. Installing additional picnic areas and
  restructuring such spaces with articulated ground surfacing, pathways, lighting,
  benches, and ADA improvements would provide additional opportunities for passive
  recreation and public gatherings throughout the City (Policy 8.2b.11).
• Conduct a study to determine the actions and expenditures necessary to achieve
  conformance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of
  1990, as related to recreation areas. As funding and other resources permit, take all
