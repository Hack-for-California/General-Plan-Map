  RS or PD zone. Additional zones may be consistent for transitional or interim land uses consistent with General Plan

                                C. GOALS AND POLICIES
GOALS:         COMMUNITY FORM
Goal 1         Define Roseville’s overall identity and character by the following attributes:
               a.      Distinction from other communities through quality of development and the
                       high level of services provided its citizens.
               b.      A commitment to preserving its small town attributes and cultural heritage,
                       and a dedication to promoting a strong sense of community, while
                       preserving individual neighborhoods and promoting a prosperous business
                       community.
               c.      Continuing to be a family oriented community, which offers opportunities to
                       pursue various lifestyles.
               d.      Residential development that includes clusters of high to low densities
                       balanced with large expanses of open space.
               e.      Ensuring high standards of public safety.
Goal 2         While recognizing that the automobile is the primary form of transportation, the City
               of Roseville should make a commitment to shift from the automobile to other
               modes of transportation.
Goal 3         In partnership with private interests, the City of Roseville will promote the creation
               of a town center offering government services, social and cultural activities, and
               commercial opportunities in Central Roseville. Roseville will also encourage the
               creation of additional social, cultural and commercial satellite opportunities
               throughout the community.
Goal 4         Through the designation of special study areas and revitalization efforts, the City
               of Roseville will promote the preservation, revitalization and enhancement of its
               business district and existing neighborhoods.
Goal 5         Design new development to be integrated, connected and related to existing
               development areas within the City.
Goal 6         Roseville will strive to be a balanced community with a reasonable mix of land
               uses, housing types and job opportunities.
Goal 7         Roseville will promote and encourage the availability of a variety of goods and
               services, and will take measures to retain a positive business climate in the City.
Goal 8         Maintain a strong commitment to an open governmental process which stresses
               accessibility of City officials (e.g. staff, committees, commissions, elected officials)
               and opportunities for citizen participation.

              and well-designed residential development.
 5.           Promote land use patterns that result in the
              efficient use of urban lands and preservation of

              Conservation Element.
 6.           Through development approvals and City

              program, parks and recreation programs, etc.)
              assure that all portions of the community are linked
              and integrated.

 4.          Uphold the City’s Affordable Housing Goal by
             requiring 10% of all new development to be
             affordable to very low, low-income and middle
             income households. The breakdown of the
             affordable units will be, at a minimum 40% for
             rental to very low and 40% for rental to low-
             income households. The remaining 20% may be
             reserved for middle income purchase or
             distributed among the rental obligations.
             Variations in affordable housing ratios may be
             approved through a Development Agreement
             where the following criteria are met:
                  a. A need has been identified for a specific
                       affordable housing type (very low, low or
                       middle-income) and the project meets
                       this need;
                  b. The project does not rely on or obtain City
                       subsidies; and
                  c. Units proposed within this criteria would
                       allow for individuals to stay within their
                       units as their future income grows.
 5.            The City may approve a project that is identified
               as having a negative fiscal impact on the City if
               overriding findings are made that the project
               benefits outweigh its impacts. Such benefits may
               relate to the provision of affordable housing,
               significant open space or recreation facilities, job
               creation or other public benefit.
 6.            Maintain land use patterns, intensities and
               densities that promote a positive business climate
               (e.g. supply of business professional, commercial

interface with respect to design. How land uses
function in relation to each other is determined by
more than their physical proximity. As an
example, the General Plan identifies land use
goals and policies, which seek to reduce service
related vehicular trips by promoting the location
of service uses nearby and accessible to
residential uses. Both uses, and the connections
between them, need to be designed so that they
function efficiently, inviting, convenient, safe and
comfortable, if they are to be utilized and achieve
the stated intent.
The emphasis of the Community Design
Component is on the development of a design
framework that reflects the City’s goal of high
quality, community-wide design. To assist in
achieving this goal, policies that address
aesthetics and function, the integration of the built
and the natural environments, art in public places,
and community character have been developed.
The application of these design principles will
help to establish an aesthetically pleasing city
and a distinct community identity.

GOALS:          COMMUNITY DESIGN
Goal 1          Achieve a consistent level of high quality aesthetic and functional design through
                the development of, and adherence to, superior design concepts and principles as
                defined in the Community Design Guidelines.
Goal 2          Encourage, promote and support the maintenance and expansion of a wide range
                of programs that serve to increase public understanding, appreciation and
                enjoyment of cultural and artistic forms, and the display of artistic expression in
                public spaces to contribute to the cultural experience and the sense of place and
                community.
Goal 3          Encourage the planning and building of a city which sensitively integrates open
                space and natural resources, and promotes compatibility within and between the
                natural and the urban environments.
Goal 4          Emphasize the preservation and enhancement of historically and culturally
                significant buildings, native oak trees, woodlands and other significant features, as
                a primary element in defining Roseville’s community character.

   • Conduct land planning that provides a
     balance of commercial, service, residential,
     recreational, open space, employment, and
     educational uses.
   • Evaluate and participate in growth proposals
     outside corporate boundaries and the Sphere
     of Influence that have the potential to affect
     the City.
   • Plan and promote revitalization opportunities
     within the existing City.
   • Work in partnership with Placer County and
     other local public agencies to plan for
     development in areas adjacent to Roseville
     that expands public services, facilities, and
     jobs/ housing opportunities for Roseville/
     South Placer residents and businesses.
The General Plan recognizes the potential that
the City may determine the need or desire to
expand in the future. The Growth Management
Component includes a specified process and
principles that will need to be met and followed if
and when the City determines it is appropriate to
expand its land use allocation or boundaries.
Such expansion will require an amendment to the
General Plan and full environmental review.
The Growth Management Component focuses on
the development of performance standards
rather than artificial time lines or growth rates for
future development. This approach has resulted
in goals and policies that emphasize performance
(e.g. maintaining levels of service, providing
adequate park acreage, financing needed school
facilities, etc.) rather than on specific dates,
growth rates, or build-out of existing plans. The
performance standards provide the criteria for
planning and managing growth by requiring the
mitigation of growth impacts and the provision of
both tangible and intangible benefits to the
community.

                                  C. GOALS AND POLICIES
GOALS:         GROWTH MANAGEMENT
Goal 1         The City shall proactively manage and plan for growth.
Goal 2         The City shall encourage a pattern of development that promotes the efficient and timely
               provision of urban infrastructure and services, and preserves valuable natural and
               environmental resources.
Goal 3         Growth shall mitigate its impacts through consistency with the General Plan goals and
               polices and shall provide a positive benefit to the community.
Goal 4         The City shall continue a comprehensive, logical planning process, rather than an
               incremental, piecemeal approach.
Goal 5         The City shall encourage public participation in the development of and monitoring of
               growth management policies and programs.
Goal 6         The City shall manage and evaluate growth in a regional context, not in isolation.
Goal 7         Potential population growth in Roseville must be based on the long-term carrying capacities
               and limits of the roadway system, sewer and water treatment facilities, and electrical utility
               service, as defined in the Circulation Element and the Public Facilities Element.
Goal 8         Growth and development must occur at a rate corresponding to the availability of desired
               facilities' capacity and the attainment of defined General Plan levels of service for public
               activities.
Goal 9         Growth should be managed to minimize negative impacts to existing businesses and
               residents within the City.
Goal 10        Growth should be planned in a way that addresses the appropriate interface between City
               and County lands.
Goal 11        New growth should be designed to meet the Guiding Principles.
Goal 12        The City shall use growth management as a tool to maintain the City’s identity, community
               form, reputation in the region, to maintain high levels of service for residents, and to
               influence projects outside the City’s boundaries that have the potential to affect the quality
               of life and/or services that are provided to residents.
Goal 13        New development shall be consistent with the City’s desire to establish an edge along the
               western boundary of the City that fosters: a physical separation from County lands through
               a system of connected open space; a well-defined sense of entry to City from west;
               opportunities for habitat preservation and recreation; and view preservation corridors that
               provide an aesthetic and recreational resource for residents.

              a. Present and planned land uses in the area;
              b. Present and probable need for public facilities
                   and services in the area;
              c. Present capacity of public facilities and
                   adequacy of public services;
              d. Existence of any social or economic
                   communities of interest in the area; and
              e. Open space and agricultural lands.

Continue to pursue a regional approach to
planning and growth. This will include
coordination with other governmental agencies,

discuss growth issues and develop a coordinated
approach for guiding growth. The City will seek
early consultation with applicable agencies for
major projects proposed either within or outside
Roseville. The intent of this consultation will be to
coordinate planning efforts between jurisdictions
and minimize the impacts of growth to Roseville
and the surrounding region. These efforts will
include coordination with LAFCO on issues of
sphere of influence and annexations. (Policies G

             RELATIONSHIP TO SPECIFIC PLANS
Both existing and future specific plans play a predominant role in Roseville’s planning efforts. Each element
of the General Plan references and provides policies relating to specific plans. It is anticipated that these
plans will be a primary mechanism in implementing the goals and policies of the General Plan. Given their
prominence, it is important to clarify the relationship between the General Plan and specific plans.
As is described in the Existing Conditions and Projections Component of this Element, the City currently
has fourteen specific plans. These plans have been utilized to comprehensively plan Roseville’s growth
areas. The current plans consist of the:
     •   Southeast Roseville Specific Plan (SERSP);
     •   Northeast Roseville Specific Plan (NERSP);
     •   Northwest Roseville Specific Plan (NWRSP);
     •   North Central Roseville Specific Plan (NCRSP);
     •   Del Webb Specific Plan (DWSP);
     •   Highland Reserve North Specific Plan (HRNSP);
     •   North Roseville Specific Plan (NRSP);
     •   Stoneridge Specific Plan (SRSP);
     •   West Roseville Specific Plan (WRSP);
     •   Riverside Gateway Specific Plan (RGSP);
     •   Downtown Specific Plan (DTSP);
     •   Sierra Vista Specific Plan (SVSP)
     •   Creekview Specific Plan (CSP) and
     •   Amoruso Ranch Specific Plan (ARSP)
Additional specific plans may be utilized in potential future growth areas.
The specific plans are consistent with, and are hereby incorporated by this reference, as a component of
the Land Use Element of the General Plan. Specific plan land uses are reflected on the General Plan land
use map. The specific plans establish detailed polices and implementation programs for portions of the
City, consistent with the Goals and Polices established in the General Plan. The specific plans utilize
General Plan Land Use designations, but may create new categories which further General Plan policy.
These categories may be more specific or tailored to a particular situation. The General Plan includes the
Specific Plan areas and all its policies apply to the areas.
Copies of all of the City’s specific plans can be obtained through the Development Services Department in
the Civic Center at 311 Vernon Street or online at: www.roseville.ca.us.

Functional Classification underscores the need

comprehensive designation of all roadways
throughout the City. It includes a functional

type of roadway.
Level of Service (LOS) expresses the City's
targeted level of mobility during the life of the
General Plan. Its policies and implementation
measures reflect the City's desire to maintain
uncongested traffic operations (LOS "C" or better
at 70% of the signalized intersections during the
a.m. and p.m. peak periods) on its roadway
system for all hours of the day. The level of

to be evaluated where the City may consider a

4. Improvement Standards
     (Ongoing)
Continue to refine and improve the improvement
standards for the City's roadway system. The
design standards shall reflect functional
classification and include the following elements:
•    Right-of-way requirements
•    Roadway cross-sections        including land-
     scaping and bikeways
•    Signalization and access control
•    Intelligent Transportation Systems
•    Land use compatibility, orientation and
     design standards
•    Vehicle and pedestrian safety
•    Bicyclist safety and access
•    Safe access to schools
•    Transit improvements
Exceptions to the standards may be necessary
but should be kept to a minimum and should be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis.             The
improvement         standards      address    how
amendments can be approved. (Policy 3)
5. Truck Routes
     (Ongoing)
Enforce, evaluate and, as circumstances warrant,
update the truck route system to ensure safe and
efficient routes through the City.

will remain 24 City intersections that will function
at less than LOS “C” during the AM peak hour and
47 City intersections that will function at less than
LOS “C” during the PM peak hour. This level of
intersections operating at below LOS “C” during
the PM peak hour is within the City’s level of
service policy.
New roadway widths are planned to
accommodate projected year 2035 PM peak hour
traffic volumes at a level of service “C” or better,
although a number of existing roadways will
require widening, as part of the City’s CIP, to
improve operating capacity in the year 2035. In

based on the criteria identified in this section.

conditions are referenced in Table III-3A.
The City should continue to strive to provide level
of service (LOS) "C" at all locations in Roseville.
However, there may be locations where the City
may decide that the impacts and/or costs of the
required improvements exceed the benefits of
having LOS "C" for all hours of the day.

                                 C. GOALS AND POLICIES
GOALS:    LEVEL OF SERVICE
Goal 1    Maintain an adequate level of transportation service for all of Roseville's residents and
          employees through a balanced transportation system, which considers automobiles,
          transit, bicyclists, and pedestrians.
Policies: Level of Service                                       Implementation Measures
1.        Maintain a level of service (LOS) "C" standard at a    -Capital Improvement Program/
          minimum of 70 percent of all signalized                  LOS Criteria
          intersections and roadway segments in the City         -Development Review Process
          during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Exceptions to     -Specific Plans
          the LOS “C” standard may be considered for
          intersections where the City finds that the required
          improvements are unacceptable based on
          established criteria identified in the implementation
          measures. In addition, Pedestrian Districts may be
          exempted from the LOS standard.
     2.    Strive to meet the level of service standards         -Capital Improvement Program

           improvements.                                         - Bicycle Master Plan
3.        Work with neighboring jurisdictions to provide         -Capital Improvement Program
          acceptable and compatible levels of service on the     -Development Review Process
          roadways that cross the City's boundaries.             -Specific Plans

4.        Secure adequate funding for all components of the      -Capital Improvement Program
          City's transportation system to ensure level of        -Development Review Process
          service policy is maintained.                          -Specific Plans
                                                                 -Transportation Funding
     5.    Enable the City to designate a Pedestrian District    - Strategies for Pedestrian Districts
           over a geographic area for the purpose of             - Development Review Process
           implementing measures that promote pedestrian         - Specific Plans

           and resultant air pollution emissions that contribute
           to climate change. In these districts, the City
           recognizes that pedestrian travel takes a higher
           priority than automobile travel, which could reduce
           the vehicular level of service.

Roseville is located within the Sacramento Valley
Air Basin (SVAB) portion of Placer County which
is designated as a non-attainment area under the
California Ambient Air Quality Standards
(CAAQS) and the National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS).
The Placer County Air Pollution Control District
(APCD), in cooperation with the Sacramento
Area Council of Governments (SACOG), has
identified Transportation Control Measures
(TCMs) that demonstrate the region’s ability to
come into attainment with the CAAQS and
NAAQS. The TCMs are 1) of specific value to the
County's efforts to attain compliance with the
Federal and State air quality standards and (2)
considered to be workable and feasible at this
time in Placer County, given the County's
population distribution, annual VMT, and
emission reduction needs. The TCMs include:
•    Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
     programs such as:
     o    Area wide carpool/ vanpool matching
          assistance
     o    City or county trip reduction ordinances
     o    Employer-sponsored         carpool    and
          vanpool programs
     o    Staggered work schedules, flexible work
          hours, compressed work week and
          telework programs
     o    Park and ride lots
•    Provision of bikeway and bicycling support
     facilities
•    Enhancement of pedestrian facilities and the
     pedestrian environment
•    Public awareness campaign such as Spare
     the Air
•    “Smart Growth” land use concepts
These measures are outlined in the “Sacramento
Regional 8-Hour Ozone Attainment and

The popularity of the bicycle has grown and will
certainly increase in the City of Roseville for both
recreational and transportation/commuter uses.
This growth in popularity is due to many factors:
social and economic as well as new City and
regional programs, such as the Sacramento Area
Council     of     Governments        Blueprint    as
implemented by the City of Roseville’s Smart
Choices for Roseville policy document.
There is renewed interest in physical fitness and
better health among a large portion of the
population that has fueled the popularity of the
bicycle. Bicycling is also a "clean" form of
transportation that appeals to a large and growing
part of the population. In addition, the bicycle is
gradually proving itself in many communities to
be a viable alternative to automotive
transportation, often being used in conjunction
with transit service. The current and projected
growth of the City and the rest of South Placer
County will necessitate the development of safe
and efficient facilities to handle current and long-
range increases in bicycle usage.
Demand for safe and convenient routes for
recreational and transportation-related bicycling
is growing. The City’s Bicycle Master Plan
provides a prioritized list of bike routes and paths
to systematically expand and improve Roseville’s
bikeway system. The Plan ultimately provides a
blueprint for a bikeway system that will make

                      C.      GOALS AND POLICIES
GOALS: AIR QUALITY
Goal 1 Improve Roseville's air quality by:
           a) Achieving and maintaining ambient air quality standards established by
               the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air
               Resources Board; and,
           b) Minimizing public exposure to toxic or hazardous air pollutants and air
               pollutants that create a public nuisance through irritation to the senses
               (such as unpleasant odors).
Goal 2 Integrate air quality planning with the land use and transportation planning
       process.
Goal 3 Encourage the coordination and integration of all forms of public transport while
       reducing motor vehicle emissions through a decrease in the average daily trips
       and vehicle miles traveled and by increasing the commute vehicle occupancy
       rate by 50% to 1.5 or more persons per vehicle.
Goal 4 Increase the capacity of the transportation system, including the roadway
       system and alternate modes of transportation.
Goal 5 Provide adequate pedestrian and bikeway facilities for present and future
       transportation needs.
Goal 6 Promote a well-designed and efficient light rail and transit system.
Goal 7 While recognizing that the automobile is the primary form of transportation, the
       City of Roseville should make a commitment to shift from the automobile to
       other modes of transportation.
                                                                       Roseville General Plan

The broad scope of issues addressed in the Open
Space and Conservation Element overlap with
other elements of the General Plan. Table V-1
reflects the relationship of open space and
conservation issues to other General Plan
elements. The Open Space and Conservation
Element should be used in combination with the
other elements to insure full implementation of all
General Plan resource-related policies.
There are no prime farmlands or agricultural
operations generating significant principle
income in Roseville. The Al Johnson Wildlife
Area includes rice and dry farming and a small
area within the West Roseville Specific Plan
contains prime farmland within a pistachio
orchard. Developing greenfield areas contain
farmland of local importance mainly used as
grazing land. In addition, mineral resources,
consisting of sand and gravel, are limited and no
mineral extraction operations currently exist or
are anticipated to exist in the City during the
planning period. Therefore, no policies relating to
agricultural or mineral resources have been
included in the Open Space and Conservation
Element. Should the City decide to expand in the
future, policies relating to these issues may need
to be considered.

4.  Require all new development to provide linkages to
    existing and planned open space systems. Where
    such access cannot be provided through the
    creation of open space connections, identify
    alternative linkages.
5.  Provide access to public open space resources
    except in those areas determined by the City to be
    sensitive to human presence.
6.  Take into account consideration of natural habitat
    areas in developing linkages and in preserving
    open space areas. Identify alternate sites for
    linkages where sensitive habitat areas have the
    potential to be adversely impacted.
7.  Maximize opportunities for preservation and
    maintenance of open space resources, including
    establishment of private open space areas.

development review process. The completed
surveys, as well as the compilation of a
comprehensive natural resource inventory for the
City, will be used to evaluate individual projects.
The potential loss of Roseville's natural areas
from development pressures represents a threat
to these sensitive habitats. The City will be
challenged in balancing resource preservation
with development needs. Woodland, riparian and
wetland preservation efforts will focus on
avoidance first, with compensation utilized when
avoidance is not feasible. The goal of such
efforts is to ensure a no-net loss of significant
resources and, when necessary and appropriate,
to pursue off-site resource preservation at
locations proximate to the City so as to provide
benefit to City residents. Preservation efforts will
require close coordination with the California

Regional Water Quality Control Board, U.S. Army

    COMMON PLANT AND WILDLIFE SPECIES FOUND IN THE ROSEVILLE AREA
I. Grassland Environments
     Plant Species: Wild oat, wild barley, bromes, tarweed, fescues, foxtail grass, clovers, popcorn
     flower, lupine brodiaea, owls clover, goldfield, and larkspur. Few trees are supported in these
     grassland habitats due to limited soils, lack of moisture, predominance of shallow hardpan, and past
     grazing activities.
     Wildlife Species: Mammals such as the broad-footed mole, San Joaquin pocket mouse, Western
     harvest mouse, deer mouse, house mouse, California ground squirrel, pocket gopher, blacktailed
     jackrabbit, striped skunk, badger, and coyote; birds such as the ring-necked pheasant, common barn
     owl, burrowing owl, short-eared owl, rufous-crowned sparrow, lark sparrow, red-winged blackbird, and
     Western meadowlark; and, reptiles and amphibians including the common king snake, Western garter
     snake, Western rattlesnake, gopher snake, racer, Western toad, Western spade-foot toad, slender
     salamander, and Pacific tree frog.
II. Oak Woodland and Riparian Environments
     Plant Species: Oaks are the most visually dominant plant species found in the oak woodlands and
     riparian areas. A majority of the oaks are interior live, blue, or valley oaks. Other tree species found
     include digger pine, California buckeye, Fremont cottonwood, sycamore, willow, and black walnut.
     Understory species include buckbrush, coffeeberry, poison oak, yerba santa and blackberry.
     Wildlife Species: Mammals such as the gray fox, coyote, opossum, California myotis, big brown bat,
     Western gray squirrel, brush mouse, and spotted and striped skunks; birds such as the red-tailed hawk,
     turkey, mourning dove, California quail, white crowned sparrow, Anna's hummingbird, scrub jay,
     mockingbird, turkey vulture, black-shouldered kite, barn owl, Northern pygmy owl, Western screech
     owl, acorn woodpecker, Nuttals woodpecker, downy woodpecker, Northern flicker, yellow-billed
     magpie, bushtit, plain titmouse, wrentit, Bewick's wren, white-breasted nuthatch, American robin,
     European starling, rufous-sided towhee, brown-headed cowbird, house finch, lesser goldfinch, and
     American goldfinch; reptiles and amphibians including the alligator lizard, gopher snake, common king
     snake, Western garter snake, ringneck snake, aquatic garter snake, Western rattlesnake, racer, slender
     salamander, arboreal salamander, Western toad, Western spade-foot toad, Pacific tree frog, and bull
     frog; and, fish including the Sacramento squawfish, bluegill, green sunfish, Sacramento perch, brown
     bullhead, mosquito fish, and minnows. Some of the watercourses in the City are intermittent, which
     limits fisheries, but there are seasonal occurrences of the various fish species listed above. Federally-
     listed Chinook Salmon and Central Valley Steelhead are found in both Linda and Dry Creeks, and
     Secret and Miners Ravines, and salmon fingerlings have been planted in Miners Ravine in the past by
     the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
III. SEASONAL WETLAND ENVIRONMENTS
     Plant Species: Mesa mint, popcorn flower, navarretia, toad rush, goldfields, coyote thistle, and wolly
     marbles. Plant species of special concern include Bogg's Lake hyssop, dwarf downingia and vernal
     pool brodiaca.
     Wildlife Species: Crustaceans and insects are the predominant invertebrates that occur in this habitat,
     including: federally endangered vernal pool tadpole shrimp, and federally threatened vernal pool fairy
     shrimp, water fleas, clam shrimp, seed shrimp, rotifers, dragonflies, water beetles, mosquitoes,
     mayflies, water bugs, water boatmen, water striders, and back swimmers. Several migratory bird
     species also utilize seasonal wetlands for varying periods of the year, including mallards, killdeer,
     greater yellowlegs, least sandpipers, common snipe, and great blue heron.
                                                                                        Roseville General Plan

GOALS:    VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE
Goal 1    Preserve, protect, and enhance a significant system of interconnected natural
          habitat areas, including creek and riparian corridors, oak woodlands, wetlands,
          and adjacent grassland areas.
Goal 2    Maintain healthy and well-managed habitat areas in conjunction with one
          another, maximizing the potential for compatible open space, recreation, and
          visual experiences.
Goal 3    Protect special-status species and other species that are sensitive to human
          activities.

9.  Limit the access of pedestrians and cyclists to vernal
    pool and wetland areas so that access is compatible
    with long-term protection of these natural resource
    areas.
10. Manage public lands with special-status species to
    encourage propagation of the species and
    discourage non-indigenous, invasive species.
11. Habitat preservation and mitigation for woodlands,
    creeks, riparian and seasonal wetland areas should
    occur within the defined boundaries of the impacting
    projects where long-term resource viability is feasible
    and desirable consistent with applicable state and
    federal permits.
12. Consider the use of City property for habitat
    preservation and mitigation requirements resulting
    from development proposals when such efforts do
    not conflict with existing resources, recreational
    opportunities, or other City goals, policies, or
    programs.

    and     community        organizations     to   explore
    opportunities for regional mitigation banking.

agricultural and urban uses, can impact
groundwater levels. In addition, pollutants found
in urban run-off can leach into aquifers impacting
groundwater quality.
Monitoring and protection of groundwater
resources is important to the maintenance of
adequate groundwater supplies and quality.
Streambeds and other areas where recharge
potential is high should be explored for
preservation to ensure groundwater levels.
Maintaining high water quality within the creek
systems will also help to keep contaminants out
of the aquifer.
B. OUTLOOK
For the most part, measurements of water quality
within the Roseville area indicate no major
sources of pollution are present. However, some
concern has been expressed about groundwater
quality in portions of the City. Two wells, neither
of which are connected to the City's domestic
water system, have shown signs of contaminants.
Because Roseville does not rely on groundwater
as a primary domestic water source, this has not
been a major issue in the past. As development
increases, concerns about surface water quality
and groundwater supply and quality are likely to
increase.
The City has and will continue to comply with
Environmental Protection Agency stormwater
management regulations as enforced by the
State Water Resources Control Board and the
Regional Water Quality Control Board. These
regulations include requirements for National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
Phase II permits. Roseville promotes the use of
cost-effective urban run-off controls, including
Best Management Practices, to reduce pollutants
from entering the waterways. These practices
include the use of oil and sand separators, grassy
swales, detention ponds, vegetative buffers, and
other source control, housekeeping, and
treatment measures.
Plans to protect the City’s water resources and
water quality include the development of
standards for urban run-off, monitoring of
groundwater, and protection of waterways and
recharge areas.

designated open space resources.              Such
mechanisms may include, but are not limited to,
dedication, fee-title purchase, donations, transfer
or purchase of development rights, and credits
against park dedication requirements. If it is
determined by the City that an open space
resource is not desired for public ownership, the
City may designate the preservations of such
resource in private ownership. A decision not to
seek public ownership may occur when the
resource is not desired for public access and
where public management and maintenance
could not be efficiently accommodated. In such
cases, the permanent preservation of the

    Assessment
    (Existing)
The Parks and Recreation Needs Assessment
was completed in 2013.
The Parks and Recreation Needs Assessment
should be updated a minimum of every three
years and/or with any significant modification to
the city’s land use allocation. The Plan will be
used to ensure continual review and updating of
recreation facility standards and/or trends/gaps in
recreational amenities. Periodic survey of City-
administered recreation programs should also be
conducted by the Parks, Recreation & Libraries
Department in order to evaluate the content and
popularity of programs being offered. (Policies 4,

Private recreation facilities in Roseville consist
primarily of fitness/racquet clubs, recreation
areas in multi-family developments, or other
commercial recreation businesses such as
entertainment centers or water parks. Although
private recreation opportunities are considered
an important part of the City’s overall recreation
system, the focus of the General Plan policies are
on public park and recreation facilities. This is due
to the limited public access that private facilities
normally provide.

                                        PARK DEFINITIONS
Neighborhood Park
A neighborhood park can be generally defined as a landscaped park designed to serve a concentrated
population or neighborhood. They are often developed as a recreation facility with a balance of
passive/informal/self-directed and active/formal/programmable recreation areas serving all ages. Typical
improvements are play areas, picnic tables (covered or uncovered), athletic fields, multi-use turf, hard
courts, natural areas, pathways, security lighting and in some cases, unique or single-purpose amenities.
Park improvements shall consider a one hour to one and one half hour stay per visit.
Typical Preferred size range: three (3) acres up to five (5) acres
Neighborhood/School Park
School park areas are facilities developed on or adjacent to school land and available for City use. Facilities
would focus on clustering active ball fields whenever possible in order to alleviate impacts to neighborhood
parks and to provide more cost effective maintenance practices. The facilities may be jointly used, and/or
developed. They are often developed as an active/formal/programmable recreation facility serving all ages.
Typical facilities may include play areas, athletic fields (lighted or non-lighted), picnic areas, hard courts,
game courts, joint off-street parking, pathways, and security lighting. Shared or joint use could facilities
could include swimming pools, gymnasiums, hard courts, sports courts, and specialty elements..
Restrooms may be included, but are not required. The facilities could be subject to use restriction and/or
maintenance agreements defined in a specific joint-use agreement with the City. The multi-use of school
and park facilities is also addressed in the school component of the Public Facilities Element.
Typical size range: 5.5 acres up to 10 acres.
Community /City-Wide Park
Community/city-wide parks are designed to accommodate a wider variety and higher intensity of
recreational uses than neighborhood parks, and are frequently identified as unique recreational centers
serving the entire Roseville population. These facilities are designed to “cluster” active sport elements to
accommodate city-wide or regional needs such as tournaments, special events and or tourism to provide
more cost effective maintenance practices. These parks may include unique recreational amenities such
as plazas, town centers, large specialty type recreation facilities, swimming pools, libraries, community
centers, outdoor areas, competitive sports complexes, tennis courts, sports courts and sports lighting,
concessions, nature centers, large children’s play areas, large group picnic facilities, trail systems, transit
stops, outdoor amphitheaters, water-oriented facilities for boating, swimming and fishing, restrooms, and
park and ride within parking lots. Community/city-wide facilities may be stand alone or located adjacent to
schools.
Typical size range: 4 acres to over 200 acres.
Additional Definitions and Standards include:
Landscape Areas
Landscape areas are generally defined as linear public corridors (i.e. roadway landscaping and corridors,
and other landscape frontage )that provide visual relief along major roadways (arterials and collector) and
are significant connections within the City between parks, schools, neighborhoods, businesses and
shopping areas. Typical components are usually sidewalks, trees, turf, shrubs, and ground covers
designed by using berms and slopes. Landscape areas may also include street furnishings, walls/fencing,
city boundary markers, , lighting and signs. No developed parkland credits would be applied to these areas.
                                                                                        Roseville General Plan
                                                     VI-11                      Parks and Recreation Element

Paseos
Paseos are provided to promote walking and biking by establishing connectivity between residences, parks,
schools, local businesses, trail systems and or other connections. They may include similar landscaping
components such as sidewalks, plant materials, and bike/pedestrian trails. Paseos vary in width between
25-100 feet depending on the intended use and location. Paseos are open to the surrounding neighborhood
by maintaining a street frontage to one side ensuring that paseos are not hidden. This allows visibility by
residents and City for security access. No developed parkland credits would be applied to these areas.
Greenways
Greenways are defined as wide, usually linear, landscape corridors. They usually consist of very simple
landscaping features such as turf, trees, shrubs, or no landscaping at all, and usually include sidewalks,
and bike/pedestrian trails. They typically link streets together to provide opportunities such as walking or
biking, and they may be a prominent component of a Class 1 bike path system. They differ from paseos in
that they can be undeveloped, may imply transportation and movement, and usually have greater widths
and lengths. While containing some characteristics of open space areas they may contain some formal
landscaping features and irrigation. No developed parkland credits would be applied to these areas.

                  Area
         i Parks may be less than three acres (.5acres if existing and one acre or greater if planned), The
City’s preference is that Neighborhood parks be planned at three acres or greater to ensure adequate space
for programmed recreation needs.
The City will maintain flexibility in applying the above standards to best meet the parks and recreation needs
of the community. Neighborhood or Citywide credit towards meeting the standards may be considered for
non-traditional public lands if it can be determined that it adds a needed recreational value and as defined
in Table VI-5.

                     PARK CREDIT IMPLEMENTATION CHART
Neighborhood and city-wide park credits are applied at a one acre of active/formal/programmable or
passive/informal/self-directed recreation land per one acre of credit towards the nine acre/1,000
population standard. To the extent possible, neighborhood parks should seek to provide
passive/informal/self-directed recreational opportunities; while school/park and city-wide parks should
focus on active/formal/programmable recreation. Of the nine acre/1,000 population park standard, six
acres are dedicated toward developed recreation. Typically, the six acres are applied as three
acres/1,000 population for neighborhood parks and three acres/1,000 population for city-wide parks.
Credits applied to each type of developed parkland shall consider identified gaps and community needs
between active/formal/programmable and passive/informal/self-directed recreation and access to such
recreational opportunities in the adjacent or surrounding areas. Therefore, the six acres of developed
parkland could consider application of parkland credits as two acres of neighborhood and four acres of
city-wide park land (or a combination thereof) equaling a total of 6 acres total of developed parkland,
where applicable.
Open space may be granted full credit not to exceed the three acre/1,000 land to population standard if
they provide some form of recreational value. Recreational value is defined as a measure of public
accessibility and recreational improvements. This may include bike paths along creekways or along golf
courses, vernal pools with walking, picnicking and interpretive signage, etc. The dedication of open
space lands in excess of three acres/1,000 population would not be applied toward the remainder of six
acres/1,000 population for developed parkland.
The ability to receive credit, and the amount of credit given, will be determined by the City on a case by
case basis dependent upon: recreational value; accessibility and potential benefit to the community of
the land or improvements; and the benefit generated to the City as a whole. Park credits for park lands
are typically considered at the specific plan stage. Credit shall only be granted where provisions are
included to ensure that the credited lands or facilities remain at their intended credited use on a long-
term basis.
The following nontraditional public lands may be considered by the City to receive partial park credit
toward the open space component of the standard:
     •  Floodways
     •  Wetlands
     •  Oak Woodlands
     •  Riparian Areas
     •  Public Greenbelts or Greenways
     •  Public Golf Courses
     •  Unique Natural, Historical or Cultural Resources
     •  Powerline/PUE
     •  Detention Basins

play a vital part in growth development. It is the
intent of this component to specify conditions for
provision of these services to outlying areas in a
manner that does not compromise the quality of
life for the citizens of Roseville.
In reviewing each component's goals and policies
as contained in the Public Facilities Element, it is
evident      that    success      in the   overall
implementation of the element is contingent upon
effective monitoring and reporting of growth in
relation to public service levels.
It is an underlying goal of the entire Public
Facilities Element that adequate services be
provided for residents and enterprises and
that new development contribute its fair share
toward the provision of these services and
facilities.

B. OUTLOOK
Roseville's civic facilities have recently
undergone significant changes resulting from the
implementation of various plans. These include
the City's Civic Center Master Plan, the
Corporation Yard Master Plan, and the
development and Planning of neighborhood
facilities within the specific plan areas.
The Civic Center at 311 Vernon Street was
dedicated in May 2002. Its construction was a
result of implementation of the Civic Center
Master Plan reflecting a commitment to retain
primary City administrative functions in the
Downtown area.
Upon full implementation of the plan, the City Hall
Annex will no longer be used for City
administrative functions. Future potential uses
may include public meeting space, offices, and
development by the private sector.
Increased demand for services will occur in
neighborhoods located away from the City center
as well. Anticipating future residential need of
community facilities will allow for population
expansion without diminishing the opportunities
for enrichment in Roseville's outlying areas. The
fourteen Roseville specific plans each designate
areas for neighborhood level recreational
facilities and other multi-purpose meeting
facilities. This may be accomplished through joint
use facilities/agreements between the City and
the school districts.

9.    California Library Services Act
      and the Library of California Act
      (Existing)
The State of California encourages networking
among libraries implementing the provisions of
the California Library Services Act and Library of
California Act. The acts promote resource-
sharing among all types of libraries (public,
school, academic, and business).
The City should continue to actively pursue State
funding and support for inter-library resource
sharing programs through this legislation (PLS
Policy 3)
10. Libraries as a Multi-Functional
      Facility
      (On going)
The idea for shared facilities is growing as many
communities seek to maximize resources, and
consolidate educational and cultural centers. The
library has evolved in the past 20 years to serve
as a community gathering space, educational
center, and cultural hub. Being able to fulfill a
diversified complement of services keeps the
community engaged and ensures that services
remain vibrant.
11. Dedications, Fees and Exactions
      (Ongoing)
Require, as a condition of project approval,
dedication of land for needed facilities or the
payment of appropriate fees and exactions to
help offset municipal costs of facilities expansion.

System that facilitates resource-sharing among
regional libraries. (PLS Policy 3)

                            C. GOALS AND POLICIES
GOALS:    SCHOOLS
Goal 1    The provision of adequate school facilities is a community priority. The school
          districts and the City will work closely together to obtain adequate funding for
          new school facilities.         If necessary, and where legally feasible, new
          development may be required to contribute, on the basis of need generated,
          100% of the cost for new facilities.
Goal 2    The City and the school districts enjoy a mutually-beneficial arrangement in the
          joint-use of school and public facilities. Joint-use facilities shall be encouraged
          in all cases unless there are overriding circumstances that make it impossible
          or detrimental to either the school district or the City's park and recreation
          facilities/programs.
Goal 3    School facilities shall be available for use in a timely manner.
Goal 4    The City will work with all school districts within the region to provide
          educational opportunities for all students.

                determined to be feasible, a joint-use agreement
                will be pursued to maximize public use of
                facilities, minimize duplication of services
                provided, and facilitate shared financial and
                operational responsibilities.

GOALS:    ELECTRIC UTILITY
Goal 1    Maintain a municipal electric utility that provides an efficient, economical,
          and reliable electric system.
Goal 2    Provide electric services to all existing and future Roseville development
          areas through the City's Electric Utility. The provision of services by another
          provider may be considered where it is determined that such service is
          beneficial to the City and its utility customers or the provision of City
          services is not feasible.
Goal 3    Maintain adequate resource reserves consistent with industry standards,
          sound utility planning, and applicable contracts.
Goal 4    Aggressively pursue cost-effective and environmentally safe alternative
          sources of energy and energy conservation measures.

                         C. GOALS AND POLICIES
GOALS:    WASTEWATER AND RECYCLED WATER SYSTEMS
Goal 1    Participate in a cooperative regional approach to wastewater treatment and
          discharge in order to maintain a system that adequately services planned
          growth within the City.
Goal 2    Provide wastewater services to all existing and future Roseville
          development through the City's wastewater utility. The provision of services
          by another provider may be considered when it is determined that such
          service is beneficial to the City and its utility customers or the provision of
          City services is not feasible.
Goal 3    Actively pursue the use of recycled water where appropriate and expand
          recycled water distribution system to deliver and meet estimated City
          demands for landscape irrigation.
Goal 4    Meet State of California and EPA water quality standards for the discharge
          of treated wastewater, as well as meet State of California quality standards
          for the production of recycled water.

GOALS:    SOLID WASTE, SOURCE REDUCTION & RECYCLING
Goal 1    Provide a healthy, safe, and economical system for solid waste collection and
          disposal.
Goal 2    Provide solid waste collection and disposal services to all existing and future
          Roseville development through the City's Solid Waste Utility. The provision of
          services by another provider may be considered where it is determined that such
          service is beneficial to the City and its customers or the provision of City services is
          not feasible.
Goal 3    Continue to participate in local and regional approaches to source reduction,
          material recovery, recycling, and solid waste disposal.

A. SETTING
The City of Roseville is confronted with the
challenge of meeting the water and energy
demands of its current residents while securing
adequate resources to meet new development
requirements in the face of rapid growth.
The quality and quantity of water supplies have
become increasingly important as this limited
resource continues to be stretched through
development in California. Although present
customer needs are being met, changes in supply
and demand have brought water conservation
strategies to the forefront of resource
management practices.
Roseville recognizes the regional implications of
resource allocation, as well. While Roseville has
experienced        major      growth,     surrounding
communities are not exempt from similar growth
experiences. Potential changes in the distribution
of electricity and water based on increased
demand region-wide is a factor that figures
prominently into the City's conservation plan.
This component identifies the goals and policies
through which the City can minimize the
consumption of water and electrical energy.B.
         OUTLOOK
The prospects for growth in Roseville and the
surrounding region necessitate planning for the
future allocation, preservation, and enhancement
of the City's electric and water resources.
Additionally, Roseville's regional location and
climate make drought a factor in water resource
planning.
In conjunction with policies that encourage
seeking out new sources of electricity and water,
Roseville shall assume a lead role facilitating
resource conservation and protection. It shall
provide information, incentives, and programs
that permit growth to occur without endangering
the quality of life for the City's current electric and
water customers.

                      EXTENSION OF CITY SERVICES
The format of the extension of the City Services Component varies from the remainder of the Public
Facilities Element. The focus is the extension of City public utility services, defined as water, electric, and
wastewater, to properties outside the City limits. A significant constraint to development in much of
unincorporated Placer County is the lack of urban services, particularly water and wastewater. The issue
of extending City services has arisen, and will likely continue to arise, in the future. For this reason, it is
important that the City articulate its intent.
Findings that will need to be made for the City to extend services have been identified. These findings are
organized by the type of service (electric, water, wastewater, recycled water, and solid waste) and whether
the extension is requested for development that is built at the time of the request (existing development) or
is planned for the future (new development). In each case, the findings differ slightly. This is to account
for the differing circumstances and the differing controls the City has over each service.
Some of the primary issues associated with the extension of City services that the findings address include:
impacts on the service levels of existing customers within Roseville; who pays the cost of the extension;
and, potential growth management considerations. The findings contained in this component should be
considered in combination with the goals and policies of the remainder of the Public Facilities Element and
the Growth Management Component of the Land Use Element.

       existing development outside the City limits if the Council finds that:
         a) There are overriding benefits to the City of Roseville for providing service;
         b) The property owner pays the full cost of the extension of service; and
         c) The extension of service does not adversely affect the level of service experienced by utility
              customers within the City limits.
B. NEW DEVELOPMENT
The following describe, for each utility, the conditions necessary for permitting the extension of electric
water, wastewater, recycled water, and solid waste service to new development outside the City limits.
ELECTRIC
1.   The City Council may approve the extension of electric service to new development outside the City
     limits if the Council finds that:
     a) There are overriding benefits to the City of Roseville for providing service;
     b) The property owner pays the full cost of the extension of service; and,
     c) The extension of service does not adversely affect the level of service experienced by utility
         customers within the City limits.
                                                                                       Roseville General Plan

Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan. On July 20, 2005,
the Roseville City Council initially adopted the
Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan in compliance with
federal regulations. The plan was adopted at the
conclusion of the following public process: nine
months of public meeting with an ad hoc Steering
Committee, an on-line survey of Roseville
residents, two public workshops on natural and
human-caused hazards, and a special workshop
of the City Council on May 31, 2005 to discuss
the Plan contents.
The City’s Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan describes
the type, location, and extent of all natural
hazards that can affect the City; describes the
City’s vulnerability to these hazards; and includes
a mitigation strategy that provides the City’s
blueprint for reducing the potential losses. The
City’s Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan is subject to
Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) review and certification every five years.

geologic hazards may occur. This information is
to be used in city and county hazard mitigation
plans and incorporated into general plan safety
elements. According to the California Geological
Survey’s Seismic Shaking Hazards maps of
California (1999), the Sacramento Region has a
low probability of experiencing significant ground
shaking. The shaking hazard maps show the
level of ground motion that has one chance in 475
of being exceeded each year, which is equal to a
ten percent probability of being exceeded in 50
years. These maps are not intended for site-
specific hazards analysis, but only provide a
regional perspective of earthquake hazard in
California.
Landslide Hazard Identification Program -
This act directs the State Geologist to identify and
map hazardous landslide areas for use by
municipalities in planning and decision-making
on grading and building permits. Three factors
that characterize landslide hazard areas include
significant slope, weak rocks, and heavy rains.
This program focuses on urban areas and growth
areas that exhibit these characteristics. Roseville
and the surrounding Sacramento region are not
identified as areas prone to landslide hazards.
Therefore, the region has not been included as a
part of this study program.
B.        OUTLOOK
While the potential for seismic and geologic
hazard occurrences in Roseville is not high, the
soil and geologic characteristics of the City
continue to play an important role in determining
safety procedures.         Current policies and
ordinances reflect the City's ongoing obligations
to protect lives and property and include ongoing
monitoring of seismic activity and periodic
updating of plans for emergency events.
Continued implementation of these polices and
enforcement of City ordinances and General Plan
policies will ensure that efforts are maximized in
protecting the safety of Roseville's citizens from
potential geologic and seismic safety hazards.

E.        FLOODPLAIN
DESIGNATIONS
Clear policy on how floodplain areas are defined
and regulated is very important in effectively
dealing with flood protection. Several different
designations have been used to define
floodplains in Roseville, including zoning and land
use designations for floodplain areas, local flood
hazard areas, 100-year FEMA floodplain areas,
and the City’s Regulatory Floodplain. It is the
intent of the General Plan to establish clear
direction to ensure consistent application of
floodplain policy in the City.
Policy relating to the designation of the floodplain
recognizes that there are differences between the
infill area and the remainder of the City. Infill
areas were developed prior to modern floodplain
mapping and policies, and consequently there is
existing infill development within the floodway
fringe. As a result, floodplain policy for the Infill
Area is slightly more flexible to account for
existing development and to retain some
development potential for those undeveloped but
entitled properties within the floodplain, assuming
compliance with the specified restrictions.

FLOODPLAIN DESIGNATION POLICY
OBJECTIVES:
In the City of Roseville, floodplain policy focuses on two primary objectives: 1) To minimize the potential
for flood damage by providing for the safe movement of flood waters through the City; and, 2) To preserve,
protect, and enhance the natural habitat, open, and recreational values found along Roseville's floodplain
and creek environments. The goals, policies, and implementation measures within this Element focus
primarily on the safety objective. It is intended that these policies be utilized in combination with the policies
contained within the Open Space and Conservation Element to ensure full implementation of the objectives
stated above.
REGULATORY FLOODPLAIN DESIGNATION:
The City of Roseville shall designate the City’s Regulatory Floodplain on its land use map in accordance
with the best available floodplain information as determined by the Public Works Director. The Regulatory
Floodplain assumes that the watershed has been fully developed without mitigation. The floodway fringe
is defined as that area along the boundary of the floodplain that, if totally obstructed, would not result in
more than a one foot rise in the water surface elevation. The floodway constitutes the remainder of the
floodplain area and is typically where flood waters have the most velocity.
Where the City’s Regulatory Floodplain information does not exist, or where it is determined that the City’s
Regulatory Floodplain does not represent the best available information, new floodplain information shall
be generated by the project proponent. New floodplain information shall generally be developed: 1)
Consistent with the build-out development assumptions used to develop the City’s Regulatory Floodplain;
and, 2) In compliance with the most recent Placer County Floodplain Manual.
FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS:
Development within the City’s Regulatory Floodplain shall be regulated as follows:
1.     INFILL AREAS
       No development is permitted within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted by the
       City within the regulatory floodway fringe. Such development shall be limited to that falling within the
       assumed cumulative one-foot rise in the water surface elevation.
2.     REMAINDER OF THE CITY (Specific Plans, and the North Industrial Area)
       No development is permitted within the City’s Regulatory Floodplain (floodway and floodway fringe).
       Exceptions may be considered by the City for unusual conditions on a case-by-case basis if the
       encroachment is limited to only the floodway fringe and would not result in any off-site increase in the
       water surface elevation.
The above designations are schematically reflected in Figure VIII-3.
ESSENTIAL SERVICES EXCEPTIONS:
On-site increases in the water surface elevation and/or fill within the regulatory floodplain, including the
floodway, may be permitted by the City on an exception basis if associated with essential facilities and
services such as roads, infrastructure, and detention facilities subject to the following criteria:
                                                                                         Roseville General Plan
                                                      VIII-19                                              Safety

•   No feasible 1 alternatives exist that would eliminate or reduce the need for fill and/or an increase in the
    water surface elevation and would result in a lesser impact to the environment.
•   The facility has been designed to result in the minimum amount of fill and impact necessary to achieve
    its intended purpose and results in no off-site increase in the water surface elevation.
SECONDARY CHANNELS AND TRIBUTARIES:
Generally, piping of storm water in a watershed that is less than 300 acres is encouraged for ease of
maintenance and for public health and safety reasons.
Channels and tributaries are defined where the existing drainage area is between 300 and 640 acres.
These areas may be permitted to be channelized or modified to better serve the needs of the area.
•   The modification to the channel or tributary would not result in any off-site increase in the water surface
    elevation.
•   The channel or tributary to be modified is determined to have less than significant vegetation, habitat,
    visual, recreation, or other open space value.
•   If allowed to be channelized, the created channels should be designed to: 1) Provide adequate open
    space to safely accommodate the 100-year flow; 2) Reflect cross-sections and contours similar to the
    natural channel with gentle side slopes and be unlined; 3) Be compatible with the adjacent system and
    provide transitions as appropriate; 4) Be an integral part and amenity to the area;, 5) Incorporate habitat
    enhancement, mitigation, and other resources; and 6) Be designed to reduce the need for maintenance.
•   If allowed to be piped, the 100-year flow must be able to be safely accommodated over land assuming
    a blocked pipe and must comply with all other provisions of the City of Roseville Improvement
    Standards.
1 Feasible is defined as capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable
period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors

arrive on scene (14 responders); this
performance standard measures the adequate
concentration of resources.
B.        OUTLOOK
Existing and planned fire stations and companies
will help in meeting the the Department’s
response time goals. All future fire stations will
need to be evaluated, planned (timing), located,
and staffed to ensure that the response time
standard is achieved.
Fire Department staff will continue to promote
progressive      and     sound      fire   protection
engineering techniques for all new development.
The Fire Department will pro-actively enforce the
fire and life safety provisions set forth by
California State law, regulations, and local codes
and ordinances.
The City will continue to utilize the Development
Agreement process in new planned development
areas as a source of revenue to pay for new fire
facilities and equipment as long as the funding is
available. Alternative funding sources will be
evaluated and sought in the future.

equipment or high voltage electric lines.
However, the actual field experienced from an
appliance can be much greater than from a power
line due to distance. In any case, the relationship
between intensity and any health effects has not
been proven by research of EMFs.
Electric and electromagnetic fields are not solely
a product of human activity. They are an
essential part of nature, found in all living things.
The human body, for example, uses these fields
to operate the nervous system. Electricity is an
integral part of nature, whether of technological or
natural origin.
Scientists have yet to establish which factors are
most important when determining the effects of
EMFs. Two important factors to consider are
shield capability and distance as they relate to
weakening the fields. EMFs consist of an electric
field and a magnetic field. Only the electric field
can be shielded by objects, such as buildings or
trees. The magnetic field is able to pass through
most common objects without being affected.
While burying power lines greatly decreases
electric fields, the procedure's effect on magnetic
fields largely depends on the design and loading
of the underground cable. Additionally, the
strength of an EMF drops sharply with distance.
Therefore, burying power lines may increase the
magnetic field by bringing it closer to adjacent
development.
In addition to EMF concerns, other factors limit
use within electrical transmission line easement

limitations. As a result of all of these factors, the
City has adopted a policy to limit the use of areas

                          C. GOALS AND POLICIES
GOALS:    NOISE ELEMENT
Goal 1    Protect City residents from the harmful and annoying effects of exposure to
          excessive noise.
Goal 2    Protect the economic base of the City by preventing incompatible land uses
          from encroaching upon existing or planned noise-producing uses.
Policies: Noise - Transportation Noise Sources               Implementation Measures
1.        Allow the development of new noise-sensitive       - Maximum Allowable Noise
          land uses (which include but are not limited to       Exposure for Transportation
          residential, schools, and hospitals) only in areas    Sources
          exposed to existing or projected levels of noise   - Development Review Process
          from transportation noise sources which satisfy    - Noise Level Contour Maps
          the levels specified in Table IX-1. Noise          - Noise Ordinance
          mitigation measures may be required to reduce      - California Vehicle Code
          noise in outdoor activity areas and interior       - Riverside Gateway Specific Plan
          spaces to the levels specified in Table IX-1.      - Downtown Specific Plan
          Recognizing that in increasingly urban areas it
          is difficult to maintain suburban noise
          standards, and in order to facilitate the City’s
          goals to encourage reinvestment and economic
          development in the Riverside and Downtown
          Specific Plan areas, the City may elect to allow
          new noise-sensitive land uses on a case by
          case basis in proximity to transportation
          sources. Noise mitigation, including an
          acoustical analysis, would be required to
          reduce interior space noise levels to the
          standards specified in Table IX-1. Exterior noise
          levels would require mitigation to the extent
          feasible using building orientation, construction
          and design features; however ultimately, noise
          levels may exceed the noise standards
          identified in Table IX-1.
2.        Require new roadway improvement projects to        - Maximum Allowable Noise
          be mitigated so as not to exceed the noise            Exposure for Transportation
          levels specified in Table IX-1 at outdoor activity    Sources
          areas or interior spaces of existing noise-        - Development Review Process
          sensitive land uses.                               - Noise Level Contour Maps

                                                             - California Vehicle Code
                                                                           Roseville General Plan
                                          IX-9                                     Noise Element

3.        Evaluate new transportation projects, such as     - Maximum Allowable Noise
          light and heavy rail, using the standards            Exposure for Transportation
          contained in Table IX-1. However, noise from         Sources
          these projects may be allowed to exceed the       - Development Review Process
          standards contained in Table IX-1 if the City     - Noise Level Contour Maps
          Council finds that there are special overriding   - Noise Ordinance
          circumstances.
4.        Require an acoustical analysis where:             - Maximum Allowable Noise
                                                               Exposure for Transportation
          a.    Noise sensitive land uses are proposed in
                                                               Sources
                areas exposed to existing or projected
                                                            - Development Review Process
                noise levels exceeding the levels specified
                                                            - Requirements for an Acoustical
                in Table IX-1;
                                                               Analysis
          b.    Proposed transportation noise source
                projects are likely to produce noise levels
                exceeding the levels specified in Table IX-
                1 at existing or planned noise-sensitive
                uses.
          An acoustical analysis shall be required as part
          of the environmental review process so that
          noise mitigation may be considered in the
          project design.
5.        Work in cooperation with Caltrans and the         - Development Review Process
          Union Pacific Transportation Company to           - Interagency Cooperation
          maintain noise level standards for both new and
          existing projects in compliance with Table IX-1.
Policies: Noise - Fixed Noise Sources                       Implementation Measures
6.        Allow the development of new noise-sensitive      - Development Review Process
          uses (which include, but are not limited to,      - Noise Level Contour Maps
          residential, school, and hospitals) only where    - Noise Ordinance
          the noise level due to fixed (non-transportation) - Noise Level Performance
          noise sources satisfies the noise level              Standards
          standards of Table IX-3. Noise mitigation may     - Riverside Gateway Specific Plan
          be required to meet Table IX-3 performance        - Downtown Specific Plan
          standards.
          Recognizing that in increasingly urban areas it
          is difficult to maintain suburban noise
          standards, and in order to facilitate the City’s
          goals to encourage reinvestment and economic
          development in the Riverside and Downtown
          Specific Plan areas, the City may elect to allow
          new noise-sensitive land uses on a case by
          case basis in a mixed-use environment. Noise
          levels would require mitigation to the extent
          feasible using building orientation, construction
                                                                         Roseville General Plan
                                          IX-10                                  Noise Element

         and design features; however ultimately, noise
         levels may exceed noise standards identified in
         Table IX-1.
7.       Require proposed fixed noise sources adjacent     - Development Review Process
         to noise-sensitive uses to be mitigated so as not - Noise Level Contour Maps
         to exceed the noise level performance             - Noise Ordinance
         standards of Table IX-3.                          - Noise Level Performance
                                                              Standards
8.       Require an acoustical analysis where:             - Development Review Process

Standards contained in Table IX-3 for reviewing

exposed to fixed noise sources. These standards
are also to be used for evaluating potential
impacts of proposed new fixed noise sources
upon nearby noise-sensitive uses.
Where a noise-sensitive land use is proposed
near a fixed noise source, such as an industrial
facility, noise measurements will be performed to
determine whether existing and/or future noise
levels due to that source will exceed the
standards of Table IX-3 within the property line of
the proposed use. Similarly, where a fixed noise-
producing use such as an industrial facility is
proposed near an existing or future noise-
sensitive use, a noise analysis will be prepared to
ensure that the noise produced by that use will
not exceed the standards of Table IX-3 within the
property line of the noise-sensitive use. (Policies

A. Be the responsibility of the applicant.
B. Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of environmental noise assessment
   and architectural acoustics.
C. Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and locations to
   adequately describe local conditions and the predominant noise sources.
D. Estimate existing and projected (20 years) noise levels in terms of Ldn or CNEL and/or the
   standards of Table IX-3 and compare those levels to the adopted policies of the Noise Element.
   Noise prediction methodology must be consistent with the methods identified in the document
   entitled Existing Noise Environment (See Appendix).
E. Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the adopted policies and
   standards of the Noise Element. Where the noise source in question consists of intermittent
   single events, the report must address the effects of maximum noise levels in sleeping rooms in
   terms of possible sleep disturbance.
F. Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measures have been implemented.
G. Describe a post-project assessment program that could be used to monitor the effectiveness of
   the proposed mitigation measures.

E. GENERAL PLAN
     CONSISTENCY
State law requires that “the general plan and
elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated,
internally consistent, and compatible statement of
policies.” The purpose of requiring internal
consistency is to avoid policy conflict and provide a
clear policy guide for the future maintenance,
improvement, and development of housing within
the city. All elements of the Roseville General Plan
have been reviewed for consistency in coordination
with the update to the Housing Element and were
found to be consistent with the other elements of
the Roseville 2025 General Plan..
In addition, per Assembly Bill (AB) 162
(Government Code Section 65302), the City will
evaluate and amend as appropriate the Safety and
Conservation elements of the General Plan to
include analysis and policies regarding flood
hazard and management information.

EVALUATION OF 2008–2013 HOUSING ELEMENT
This component of the Housing Element examines goals, policies, implementation measures, and specific programs included in the 2008 Housing
Element to determine their effectiveness.
City of Roseville staff has determined that the goals, policies, implementation measures, and specific programs included in the 2008 Housing
Element are appropriate and effective in providing sound housing and community development planning on a regional basis and for the City of
Roseville. The City will continue to utilize these measures in an effective and efficient manner during the upcoming 2013–2021 Housing Element
planning period.
The City’s aggressive affordable housing programs continue to utilize as many affordable housing tools as possible to help meet the goals it has
established.
Unless otherwise specified, any program not implemented will continue to be an important potential source for affordable housing assistance and
will remain in the Housing Element for possible future use. These programs may be implemented if the need for the program exists and sufficient
resources are available.

Handyperson Program
The City initiated funding for the Handyperson Program in 1999 as a result of
public input, which identified a need for such a program in Roseville. The
Handyperson program provides grants to seniors in need of minor home repairs,
such as installation of grab bars, repair of minor plumbing leaks, etc. The
Program is administered by Seniors First. Senior homeowners may be referred
to the Housing Rehabilitation Program for assistance if repairs exceed the scope
of the Handyperson Program.
The Handyperson Program is promoted on the City’s website, through the use of
Program brochures and Senior Resource Guide for Placer County.

order to assist middle and low-income first time homebuyers purchase homes.
The City has assigned its single family bond allocation to the California Rural
Home Finance Mortgage Authority (CRHMFA) to apply for funding for
jurisdictions in Placer County. In recent years, the first time homebuyers within
the City have been unable to use the Program since Roseville home prices
exceed program price limits. With the decline of housing prices the program may
once again become available to qualified Roseville homebuyers.
Mortgage Credit Certificate Program (MCC) The program provides qualified first
time homebuyers with a federal tax credit based on a percentage of mortgage
interest paid each year. Since 2000 the City has not offered the MCC program,
opting to participate in the Rural Gold Program through the collaboration of the
CRHMFA and other Placer County jurisdictions.

City’s Housing Division staff also actively promotes the Density Bonus Program

The City’s Density Bonus Program is consistent with State Government Code
Section 65915–65918. The Density Bonus Program provides for a minimum 20%
to a maximum 35% density bonus in the maximum number of dwelling units, in
addition to incentives and/or concessions. The concessions and/or incentives
may include reduction in zoning standards, development standards, design
requirements, mixed use zoning, financial assistance or any other incentive that
would reduce costs of the developer.
A developer may qualify for a density bonus and additional incentives and/or
concessions if the developer agrees to construct and maintain a minimum of:
          Ten percent (10%) of the units affordable to lower income households;
          Five percent (5%) of the units affordable to very low income
           households;
          A senior housing development;
          Ten percent (10%) of the units in a condominium project affordable to
           moderate income households.
The density bonus is increased on a sliding scale depending on the type and
number of affordable units up to a maximum 35% density bonus. The number of
concessions/incentives granted by the City also increases based on the number
and type of affordable units to be constructed.
The developer must enter into an Affordable Housing Development agreement to
secure the affordable units for a minimum of 30 years prior to issuance of
building permits or prior to final map approval.

COMMUNITY PROFILE
A. POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
Population Growth
According to the California Department of Finance, the population total for the City of Roseville is
122,062. When looking at the US Census, the City’s population has risen steadily over the last ten years,
increasing 32.2% from 80,565 in 2000 to 118,223 in 2010. Roseville’s population growth began in the late
1980s, due mainly to a strong economy and development in the City’s specific plan areas.

Age Characteristics
Although population growth strongly affects total demand for new housing, housing needs are also
influenced by age characteristics. Typically, different age groups have distinct lifestyles, family
characteristics, incomes, and housing preferences. As people move through each stage of life, their
housing needs and preferences also change. Age characteristics are therefore important in planning for
the changing housing needs of residents.
                                                                                                          Roseville General Plan
                                                              X-47                                    Adopted Housing Element

Housing needs often differ by age group. For instance, most young adults (under 34) are single or starting
families. Housing needs for younger adults are addressed through apartments or first-time
homeownership opportunities. Middle-aged residents (34–64) may already be homeowners, are usually in
the prime earning portion of their careers, and thus tend to seek larger homes. Seniors (65+) often own a
home but, due to limited income or disabilities, may need assistance to remain in their homes.
According to the 2010 Census, a little more than half (51.7%) of the population is working age, between
20 and 59 years of age, and a little more than one-quarter (26.9%) of the population is school age or
below, between 0 and 19 years of age. The population 60 years and over represents the remaining
percentage of 21.5%.The age distribution for Roseville is presented in Table X-3.

B. HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Household type and size, income levels, and other household characteristics determine the type of
housing needed by residents. This section details the various household characteristics affecting housing
needs.
Households Type and Size
A household refers to the people occupying a home, such as a family, a single person, or unrelated
persons living together. Family households often prefer single-family homes or condominiums to
accommodate children, while non-family households generally occupy smaller apartments or
condominiums.
Table X-5 displays household composition as reported by the 2010 Census. In the City of Roseville,
families comprised 68.9% of all households, of which 35.1% have children under 18 years of age. The
average household size was 2.62 persons.

Overcrowded Housing
The US Census defines overcrowding as more than one person per room in a housing unit. The Census
includes living rooms, dining rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, finished attics and basements, recreation and
family rooms, permanently enclosed porches, and rooms used for offices in the definition of a “room.”
According to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data, 0.7% of Roseville’s owner-
occupied households and 3.8% of renter-occupied households were overcrowded (more than 1 person
per room). Generally, overcrowding reflects a household’s inability to afford a larger housing unit
Overcrowding does not appear to be a significant problem in Roseville. However, it can be assumed that
those households living in an overcrowded situation are most likely lower-income households that cannot
afford to rent market-rate, adequately-sized units that meet their space needs.

Household Income
Along with housing prices and rents, household income is the most important factor affecting housing
opportunities in Roseville. Housing choices such as tenure (owning versus renting), housing type, and
location are dependent on household income. On the other hand, household size and type often affect
the proportion of income that can be spent on housing.
For the purpose of evaluating housing affordability, housing need, and eligibility for housing assistance,
income levels are defined by guidelines adopted each year by the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD). For Placer County, the area median income (AMI) for a family of four in
2012 was $76,100.
        Extremely Low Income             Up to 30% of AMI ($0–$22,850)
        Very Low Income                  30–50% of AMI ($22,851–$38,050)
        Low Income                       50–80% of AMI ($38,051–$60,900)
        Moderate Income                  80–120% of AMI ($60,901–$91,300)
        Above Moderate Income            Above 120% of AMI (more than $91,300)

Extremely Low-Income Households
In 2012, the median income for a household of four in Placer County was $76,100. Households that earn
30% or less than the county’s median income are considered “extremely low-income.” To estimate the
number of households in this income category, the City looked at the total number of households that fell
into the extremely low income range, which was $0– $22,850 (based on a household of four in 2012).
Because the income ranges in the 2010 Census do not correspond identically with the extremely low-
income range, the City looked at the number of households earning less than $24,999. Based on this, it
was determined that there are approximately 5,973 (13.3% of all households) existing extremely low-
income households in Roseville. Of those, 2,325 (38.9%) are owner-occupied households and 3,648
(61.1%) are renter-occupied households.
Overpayment
State and federal housing law defines overpayment as a household paying more than 30% of gross
income for housing expenses. Housing overpayment is especially problematic for lower-income
households that have limited resources for other living expenses. For renters, housing costs include rent
and utilities paid by the tenant. For owners, housing costs include mortgage payment, taxes, insurance
                                                                                      Roseville General Plan

and utilities. According to HUD’s definition, housing is not affordable, and a cost burden occurs when
households pay more than 30% of their income for housing costs and a severe cost burden occurs when
households pay more than 50% for housing costs.
Table X-8 shows to what extent occupied housing units (households) are overpaying for housing cost by
their income category in the City of Roseville. Of the lower-income households in the city, 9,654 (23.4%)
were overpaying for housing.

D. HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
This section describes the housing characteristics and conditions that affect housing needs in Roseville.
Important housing stock characteristics include housing type, tenure, vacancy rates, age, condition, cost,
and affordability.
Housing Type
According to the 2008–2010 American Community Survey, 75.7% of the city’s housing stock was made
up of single-family homes, 23.2% was multi-family units, and the remaining 1.0% was mobile homes.

Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner versus renter) can be affected by many factors, such as housing cost (interest
rates, economics, land supply, and development constraints), housing type, housing availability, job
availability, and consumer preference.
Table X-13 details housing tenure in Roseville according to the 2010 Census. Almost three quarters of
Roseville households were owner-occupied (74.3%), leaving a little more than one-quarter renter-
occupied (25.7%).
                                                                                     Roseville General Plan

Source: 2010 Census
Vacancy Rate
Vacancy rates of 5% to 6% for rental housing and 1.5% to 2.0% for ownership housing are generally
considered to be optimum. A higher vacancy rate may indicate an excess supply of units and a softer
market, and result in lower housing prices. A lower vacancy rate may indicate a shortage of housing and
high competition for available housing, which generally leads to higher housing prices and diminished
affordability.
Table X-14 shows the occupancy status of the housing stock according to the 2010 Census. The City of
Roseville had a rental vacancy rate of 6.8% and an ownership vacancy rate of 2.3%. Both of these rates
fall slightly above the “optimum” rate as discussed previously.

Condition of Housing Stock
There are several ways to assess the condition of housing stock and estimate the need for housing
rehabilitation, including the age of housing stock, estimates obtained from experts within the city, or
surveys. As a general rule in the housing industry, structures older than 30 years begin to show signs of
deterioration and require reinvestment to maintain their quality. Unless properly maintained, homes older
than 50 years require major renovations to remain in good condition. If not properly and regularly
maintained, housing can deteriorate and discourage reinvestment, thereby depressing neighboring
property values and impacting the quality of life in a neighborhood. Maintaining and improving housing
quality is an important goal for the City.
In September 2012, the City undertook a housing conditions windshield survey of units built prior to 1980
and looked at a few select neighborhoods (reference Figure X-1 for each neighborhood surveyed), which
included homes built within any time frame, to assist with determining the condition of housing stock. The
City’s survey methods were consistent with both US Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) and California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) guidelines. The
windshield survey included only an exterior assessment of the condition of the roof, siding, windows, and
foundation. Interior conditions were not inspected.
                                                                                      Roseville General Plan
                                                   X-53                            Adopted Housing Element

The condition of housing was assessed by an exterior survey of quality, condition, and improvement
needed. Each residential structure was scored according to structural criteria established by the
HCD. There are five structural categories (foundation, roofing, siding, windows, and electrical).
Based on scores assigned to the five categories, each housing structure was rated as being in
sound or dilapidated condition, or in need of minor, moderate, or substantial repairs (defined on the
next page).
The majority of units, 337 units (73.26%), were found to be in sound condition, with 119 units
(25.87%) in need of minor and moderate repair. Only 4 units (0.87%) were in need or substantial
rehabilitation or dilapidated condition (see Figure X-1).
According to the 2008–2010 American Community Survey (ACS), approximately 20.8% of the city’s
housing stock was built prior to 1980 and 8.3% prior to 1960.
Looking at the ACS and the 2012 housing condition survey results, it is safe to assume that
approximately 25% of the housing stock is in need of some type of rehabilitation.
Definition of Housing Conditions
Sound – A unit that appears new or well maintained and structurally intact. The foundation should
appear structurally undamaged and there should be straight roof lines. Siding, windows, and doors
should be in good repair with good exterior paint condition. Minor problems such as small areas of
peeling paint and/or other maintenance items are allowable under this category.
Minor – A unit that show signs of deferred maintenance, or which needs only one major component,
such as a roof.
Moderate – A unit in need of replacement of one or more major components and other repairs, such
as roof replacement, painting, and window repairs.
Substantial – A unit that requires replacement of several major systems and possibly other repairs
(e.g., complete foundation work, roof structure replacement and re-roofing, as well as painting and
window replacement).
Dilapidated – A unit suffering from excessive neglect, where the building appears structurally
unsound and maintenance is nonexistent, is not fit for human habitation in its current condition, may
be considered for demolition, or at minimum, major rehabilitation will be required.
Through this survey, the City was able to identify specific rehabilitation needs and formulate efforts
to meet such needs. Based on the windshield survey, approximately 119 units (25.9%) of those
surveyed (460 units) were in need of rehabilitation.
Housing Rehabilitation
The Roseville Housing Rehabilitation Program provides a means to preserve Roseville’s housing stock
affordable to lower-income households. The Housing Rehabilitation Program assists low-income, owner-
occupied households with deferred loans up to $100,000 for health and safety repairs and general
property improvements, and provides $5,000 grants to elderly and disabled owner-occupied households
to address health and safety repairs. Over the eight-year planning period, an estimated 120 households
(15 per year) will be assisted with the Housing Rehabilitation Program during 2013–2021.
The City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program maintains an ongoing waiting list of low-income, owner-
occupied households in need of housing rehabilitation and completes an average of 15 rehabilitation
projects each year.

Housing Cost and Affordability
One of the major barriers to housing availability is the cost of housing. In order to provide housing to all
economic levels in the community, a wide variety of housing opportunities at various prices should be
made available. Housing affordability is dependent on income and housing costs.
Housing affordability is based on the relationship between household income and housing expenses.
According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the California
Department of Housing and Community Development, housing is considered “affordable” if the monthly
housing cost is no more than 30% of a household’s gross income.
Sales Prices
The median sales price for homes in Roseville for the period from July 2012 to September 2012 was

increase of 22.2% compared to the prior year. Sales prices have depreciated 25.5% over the last five

Housing Affordability
Table X-17 provides the affordable rents and maximum purchase price, based on the HCD income limits
for Placer County. As shown in Table X-17, the maximum affordable rent for a very low-income four-
person household is $950 monthly. As shown in Table X-16, two-bedroom apartments were renting for
$768 to $2,600 and three-bedroom apartments were renting for $884 to $2,515, meaning that very low-
income households would be able to afford some two- and three-bedroom apartments.
The median sales price for single-family homes in Roseville is slowly increasing. From July 2012 to
September 2012, the median sales prices in the city were $315,000 for a four-bedroom home, $246,000
for a three-bedroom home, and approximately $170,500 for a two-bedroom home (Table X-15). The
maximum affordable sales price for a four-person household is $133,926 for a very low-income
household, $213,149 for a low-income household, and $319,165 for a moderate-income household. This
indicates that all income categories would be able to afford two-, three-, and four-bedroom homes in
Roseville.

use of only one bedroom (or two if a live-in aide is
required). The HCV rental assistance Shared
Housing option does not take into account the

CMU          Commercial Mixed Use District. The Commercial Mixed Use district is intended to promote a variety of commercial uses types and the flexible
             siting of other uses that are typically considered to be compatible with commercial development. It is the intent of the CMU zoning district to establish
             a mix of uses, which will be accompanied by overlay zones, to ensure that different commercial uses will be successfully integrated into desirable,
             cohesive commercial districts. The CMU zoning district shall always be applied in conjunction with either the DS (Development Standards) or SA
             (Special Area) overlay zones.
HD           Old Town Historic District. The Old Town Historic district is intended to be applied to the original commercial core of Roseville to acknowledge its
             historic and architectural significance. The HD zoning district is intended to ensure that new land uses and development within the district further the
             rehabilitation, revitalization, and preservation of the architectural, aesthetic, historic, and economic health of the district. Each parcel within a Historic
             District shall be subject to the specific historic district design guidelines contained within the City’s Community Design Guidelines as adopted by the
             City Council from time to time. Whenever a design review permit is required for development of a parcel within the Historic District zone, the Historic
             District guidelines shall apply.
Industrial Zones
M1           Light Industrial District. The Light Industrial district is intended to designate areas appropriate for light industrial uses such as manufacturing,
             processing, assembly, high technology, research and development, and storage uses. The use types permitted within the M-1 district do not include
             outdoor manufacturing but may include limited outdoor storage and the emission of limited amount of visible gases, particulates, steam, heat, odor,
             vibration, glare, dust, and noise. These uses may be compatible operating in relatively close proximity to commercial and residential uses.
M2           General Industrial District. The General Industrial district is intended to designate areas suitable for a broad range of industrial uses, including
             manufacturing, assembly, wholesale distribution, and warehousing.
MMU          Industrial Mixed Use District. This district is intended to promote a variety of industrial use types and the flexible siting of uses that are typically
             considered to be compatible with industrial development. It is the intent of the MMU zoning district to establish a mix of uses, which will be
             accompanied by overlay zones, to ensure that different industrial uses will be successfully integrated into desirable, cohesive industrial districts. The
             MMU zoning district shall always be applied in conjunction with either the DS (Development Standards) or SA (Special Area) overlay zones as
             described in Chapter 19.18.

Development Standards
The City of Roseville regulates the type, location, and scale of residential development through its Zoning
Code. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
residents, as well as preserve the character and integrity of neighborhoods. Additional development
standards, including, setbacks, and maximum coverage requirements, are similar to those in other
communities and are not considered a constraint to the development of affordable housing.

Provisions for a Variety of Housing
Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available through
appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of various types of
housing for all economic segments of the population. This includes single-family housing, multi-family
housing, manufactured housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters, and transitional housing, among
others. Table X-33 provides a summary of the permitted housing types by zone.

ultimate goal of moving homeless persons to permanent housing as quickly as possible. Assistance in the
Supportive Housing Program is provided to help homeless persons meet three overall goals: (1) achieve
residential stability; (2) increase their skill levels and/or incomes; and (3) obtain greater self-determination
(i.e., more influence over decisions that affect their lives). The City will regulate supportive housing as a
residential use, provided supportive services are ancillary to the primary use.
The City’s current zoning has not acted as a constraint to the provision of transitional or supportive
housing. As required by SB 2, the City recognizes transitional and supportive housing as a residential use
subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone
and without any discretionary action.
Zoning for Emergency Shelters
The City has identified the MP Industrial/Business Park zoning district as appropriate for emergency
homeless shelters by right and without discretionary action. According to data obtained from the City’s
Planning Department, six parcels are zoned MP Industrial/Business Park (see table below) and may be
suitable for an emergency homeless shelter, as the sites are vacant or underutilized. Any of the six
parcels identified by the Planning Department include sufficient capacity to accommodate the unmet need
for homeless individuals (see Table X-34). (See Figure X-2, located at the end of this section, for site
locations.)

The Industrial/Business Park uses in the City pursuant to the Zoning Ordinance consist of the following
types of uses: light manufacturing, research and development, warehousing, business parks and offices,
supporting retail, financial and restaurants, personal services, and similar types of uses.
Parcels zoned MP are centrally located and convenient to major transportation, schools, the downtown
area, and other services.

Permit Processing Procedures and Timeline Estimates
Development review procedures exist to ensure that proposals for new residential development comply
with local regulations and are compatible with adjacent land uses. Table X-35 provides typical local
development timelines. Shown below are processing times for single-family and multi-family projects.
Single-Family Projects
For single-family dwelling production building permits, the time frame for review of a production building
permit is 2–3 weeks. Master plan reviews take approximately 2–3 months
For single-family dwelling custom homes, the time frame for these reviews is 6–12, weeks depending on
the complexity of the custom home and applicant’s promptness in responding. No master planning is
involved.
Multi-Family Projects
For a multi-family development, the plan review time frame between City and applicant is approximately
8–16 weeks.

D. SUBSIDY CALCULATION (PURCHASE)
In the City’s recent HOME application for funding for the first time homebuyer program, it was determined
that a subsidy of approximately $150,000 will be necessary to bring the market price of a 3
bedroom/2bath single family detached home affordable to low- income homebuyers at 80% of the area’s
median income per the following assumptions:
       Average market value of the home is $344,600.
       Financing of 1st mortgage of $190,000 at 6.25% interest.
       Purchase home is a resale property within the City limits.
       No underlying Mello-Roos or Lighting/Landscape District assessments.
