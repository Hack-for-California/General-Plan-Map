   2. 0 LAND USE ELEMENT
   2. 1     Land Use Element
                     The Land Use Element is a guide to future land use within Calexico and
                     affects many of the issues addressed in the other General Plan elements.
                     The Land Use Element identifies the type and location of future land uses
                     within the City. The specific land uses and their location within the
                     community in turn affect the remaining General Plan elements. For
                     example, the location and type of land uses outlined in the Land Use
                     Element affect the circulation system that is identified in the Circulation
                     Element. Likewise, the land uses identifed in the Land Use Element
                     reflect the community' s goals and vision for its future form and character.
                     In addition to land uses, the Land Use Element also addresses how growth
                     will occur, with special attention given to the public services and facilities
                     and how they will be funded. Implementation of the Land Use Plan will
                     also assist in creating a balance between jobs and housing within the City.
                     A balance between jobs and housing allows people to live and work within
                     the same community, and often within the same neighborhood.
   2. 1. 1   Establishing a Vision
                     The Vision for community lancl use will guide the growth of the Calexico
                     area in an efficient, coordinated manner in order to provide for high
                     quality and balanced land use in the unique Imperial Valley setting. The
                     General     Plan Advisory Committee (" GPAC",             see  Appendix     A)
                     participated in a process of looking to the future for Calexico and
                     establishing a vision for the community. The Land Use Element is
                     responsive to the Vision of the City of Calexico as formulated by the
                     GPAC because it:
                     a.       opens up additional opportunities for our families to have a choice
                              in living environments and satisfies a diversity of housing needs.
                      7       has the potential for establishing andlor reviving the downtown
                              area' s economic opportunities.
                     c.       recognizes the short- term growth opportunities towards the east
                              near Bowker Road and the long-term opportunities toward the
                              Eastern International Border crossing.
                     d.       recognizes the growth opportunities towards the wesdnorthwest
IJ                            where potential    commercial    development could occur along
                              Dogwood and Cesar Chavez Roads to capitalize on traffic re-
                              routed at the border crossing and Imperial Valley Mall traffic.
                     e.       recognizes the short-term growth opportunities towards the north
                             near Heber Road and long-term opportunities toward Interstate 8.

                                                                                   2. 0 Land Use
                  f.      explores     potential   options   and   configurations    for   future
                          development at key entry points to the City.
                  g.      reinforces public and private uses already established, many of
                          which are oriented to various types of services for the citizens.
                  h.      expands the economic base in areas that are readily accessible to
                          workers located throughout Calexico.
                  i.      maintains a balance of land uses through the creativity that can be
                          applied to mixed- use projects.
                  j.      contributes to economic development potential by adding a broader
                          choice of housing opportunities to a diversity of income levels.
                  k.     allows City agencies to work together to achieve a common goal of
                         joint use of facilities in the future and identifies the need for more
                         mixed- use communities.
                  0       identifies the opportunities to expand the downtown area towards a
                         mixed land use designation and opportunity to re- visit the building

                         communities to seasonal occupants.
                  n.      identifies the need to add schools to the northwest portion of the
                         City.
                  o.     explores opportunities to expand the Sphere of Influence in areas
                         where services can be provided and provide long-term benefit to
                         the City.

                  p.     examines the opportunity of incorporating a fully functional
                         hospital for the existing Calexico and providing additional
                         emergency facilities to support and serve future growth.
                  q.     explores the opportunity to expand the Calexico International
                         Airport for more public and commercial use.
                  r.     increases     the   City' s  regional   outlook   and   identifies   the
                         opportunities and constraints in regional plans and programs that
1                        may affect the City.
                  The visioning statements, above, are summarized below and discussed in
                  Section 1. 2 of the General Plan. They become the overall direction for the
                  City and the main objectives of the General Plan:
                  1.     To create mixed use developments, allowing and encouraging
                         residents to be able to live, work and shop within their community;
                  2.     To transition and expand the economic and job base in Calexico
                         from agriculture to other job sources;
                  3.     To guide the development of areas within the City and the sphere
                         of influence;
     City of Calexico General Plan                                                           2- 2
                                                                                          2. 0 Land Use
                     4.       To oversee the development of roadway and infrastructure systems
                              that will address existing deficiencies and accommodate projected
                              future needs;
                              To promote commercial, residential and industrial development
I                             that will capitalize on the City' s location near Mexico;
                     6.       To continue to promote the development of quality housing for all
                              segments of the population;
                              To   ensure    that residents  are   provided    a  safe  and    healthful
                              environment in which to live and work;
                              To preserve those amenities that makes Calexico an attractive
                              place to live and work.
  2. 1. 2 Existing Issues and Land Use Disfribution â€”2004
                     Calexico is affected by several forces that are unique to its location
                    adjacent to the international border with Baja California, Mexico. The City
                    continues to relate to Mexicali, just a cross the border, as a boon to
                    commercial activity in Calexico, but now is feeling the pressure of
                    commuters who bring their children to private schools in Calexico,
                    wealthy Mexican residents who are buying homes in Calexico because of
                    safety concerns in Mexicali, and trucking and the potential for commercial
                    trade due to the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement
                       NAFTA") since the 1992 General Plan was published. In addition to
                    impacts associated with Mexico, Calexico and other cities in the Imperial
                    Valley are now experiencing unprecedented growth due to the higher cost
                    of housing in San Diego and other counties along coastal California.
                    A recent article by Lori Weisberg in the San Diego Union- Tribune
                    reported that regional demographers predict that Imperial County' s
                    population will double by 2030 and that 20,000 new homes could be built
                    in the next ten years ( 2004). There is need for housing and employment in
                    the Imperial Valley, due in large part to the lack of affordability of home
                    ownership in the San Diego metropolitan area. Weisberg' s article
                    illustrated numerous examples of people who commute daily from cities in
                    the Imperial Valley to the San Diego area.
                    According to an Albert A. Webb Associates windshield survey and aerial
                    photography conducted in March 2004, the City of Calexico had
                    approximately 2, 060 acres of existing residential, 290 acres of commercial
                    uses, 255 acres of industrial uses, and the remaining acreage within the
                    City consisted of vacant, parks, schools, and agricultural/ open space uses.
                    Urban development and agricultural production in Calexico is entirely
                    dependent      upon   water   imported   from    the  Colorado     River.   As   the
                    population of the southwest continues to grow, the competition for limited
1                   water    supplies   will   escalate. The   Imperial   Irrigation District, which
                    supplies water to Calexico, has initiated an agreement to divert some of its
                    water allocation to other urbanized areas of southern California.
       City of Calexico General Plan                                                                2_3

   2. 1. 3    Cultural Resources
                       The City of Calexico' s history is linked to the community through its
                      historic sites and structures as well as the living history of its residents.
                       Sites of significant historic or cultural value should be identified and
                      preserved as a means to educate and foster a stronger sense of community.
                       Through the active use of historic buildings, collection of aral histories
                      and display of art and information about Calexico' s past, the incorporation
                      of cultural resources into the arts and culture of the community will unify
                      and beautify the City.
   2. 1. 4    Future Land Use
                      In order to capitalize upon its proximity to Mexico, the City should
                      continue to provide opportunities for maquiladora uses or " sister"- plants to
                      locate in the City. Additionally, the City should make use of the business
                      park overlay that will allow the City and future developers the flexibility
                      to regulate the uses allowed that would most benefit the City and
                      alternative land design opportunities that may not be available under
                      typical   land use designations. Encourage commercial development to
                      support Calexico' s growing residential areas, in the downtown area for
                      pedestrians from Mexicali and local residents, and highway commercial
                      uses that capitalize on the substantial number of border crossings each
                      year. Land uses need to respond to the eastern border crossing and
                      revisions to the main border crossing that will redirect automobile, truck
                      and pedestrian traffic.
                      To promote possible job creation in the region, Calexico should work with
                      the County of Imperial,      and California, United States and Mexican
                      governments to support the Silicon Border project planned for a             15
                      square- mile area located west of Mexicali just south of the border near
                      Mount Signal. The Silicon Border project is proposed to compete with
                      semiconductor manufacturing centers in Asia. Calexico can support the
CJ                    proposed project by working to create a skilled labor force, evaluating
                      future uses of the Airport Expansion Overlay area, and possible future
                      expansion of the City' s Sphere of Influence to the west. Long-term, the
                      Silicon Border project will include a border crossing station which could
                      facilitate land development on the U. S. side of the border which would
                      likely need to be served by Calexico.
   2. 1. 5    Land Use Plan
                      The General Plan' s Land Use Plan for Calexico is one of the most
                      important documents for the control of the direction of development that
                      the City has. Figure LU- 1 shows the General Plan land use designations
                      within the City Limits and Sphere of Influence (" SOI"), which are
                      expected to build out within the next 20 years. Some areas within the SOI
                      are designated Residential Specific Plan (" RSP"). This is a mixed use
                      designation and Table LU- A sets the maximum number of residential units

     1               December of 2005, enough became known about Caltrans needs for the
                     Jasper/ SR- 98 realignment and several proposed projects, that RSP- 3 and
                     RSP- 4 designations were replaced by specific land uses, as proposed.
                                                             TABLE LU-A:

                  significant increase in traffic.
                     Figure LU- 2, Future Land Uses, illustrates the arrangement of land uses
                     that may occur as the City develops over time. The " long- term"                                       line
                     shown on Figure LU- 2 and elsewhere throughout the General Plan and
                     Environmental Impact Report represents the ultimate direction and build-
                     out the City might expect in the long-term future. The Future Land Use
                     Plan ( Figure LU-2) does not establish specific required time frames for the
                     phasing of future development but can serve to guide development and
                     infrastructure improvements over the next approximately 50 years. The
                     Near-,      Mid- and Long-term labels have been used for ease of discussion
                     and descriptions. The Near-term SOI is the same as the current approved
                     SOI for the City of Calexico.
                     Table LU-B, General Plan Land Use Summary, summarizes the land uses
C  I                 within the Sphere of Influence (" SOI") shown on Figure LU- 1. Table LU-
                     B shows a total population within the SOI of between 85, 340 and 98, 260
                     residents, based on assumptions described in subsequent paragraphs. If the
                     U. S. Census rate of growth, 44 percent between 1990 and 2000, is applied

                   The estimated General Plan population projections shown in Tables LU- B
                   and C were developed using the following assumptions: a household size
                   of 425 people per household per the City' s 1999 General Plan Housing
                   Element; residential development at the maximum density allowed in the
                   General Plan for each type of residential use; and the build- out for areas
                   designated " Residential Specific Plan" based on a formula that includes
                   net developable land divided among low density residential, medium
                   density residential, high density residential and commercial uses. If
                   specific land use information about a future specific plan was known by
                   the City at the time of this update, the known information was used for
                   population projection and services needs. The " formula" was applied to
                   RSP areas with no known development proposals. Generally, the RSP
                   acreage was assumed to include 10 percent commercial/ public facilities
                   uses, 20 percent parks and schools, and 60 percent residential ( 50 percent
                   LDR, 15 percent MDR, 5 percent HDR).

  3.0 CIRCULATION ELEMENT
1 3. 1   Introduction
                    The    Circulation  Element    defines  plans   for the  various   methods     of
                    transportation on the City streets for automobiles, truck traffic and public
                   transit as well as pedestrians and bicyclists. The purpose of the Circulation
                    Element is to ensure adequate access throughout the City through the
                    improvement and maintenance of the transportation system.
                    Circulation and transportation planning relate closely to land use planning. If
                    streets and transportation are not in place to serve the desired land use, the
                   desired development will be severely impaired. The design of the circulation
                    system strongly influences the distribution of land uses throughout the City.
                    Streets and public access are the primary motivator in the determination of
                   how much density/ intensity an area can accommodate. The location and size
                   of the existing and planned street system in Calexico is one of the foremost
                   determinants in measuring the community's ability to accommodate increased
                   growth.
  3. 2 Existing Conditions
                   The circulation system in the City of Calexico is oriented to the automobile.
                   The system is dominated by Imperial Avenue/ Highway I l l which travels
                   north/ south, and Birch Street/ Highway 98 which travels east/west. Figure C- 1
                   shows the Existing Circulation System within the City.
                   Within the east and west sides of the City, traffic circulates with ease.
                   Congestion is not a problem. The problem is that access openings along SR-
                    111 allow vehicular traffic to cross Imperial Avenue/Highway l 11 in an effort
                   to get to either the eastern or western side of town. The primary obstacle to a
                   free-flowing traffic system is the outdated and inadequate system of 4- way
                   stop signs along Imperial Avenue, as well as the congestion created by the
                   International Border Crossing. Once northbound traffic reaches and passes the
                   traffic signal at Birch Street and Imperial Avenue/ Highway             lll,  the
                   congestion    almost disappears.    Southbound traffic has no relief once        it
                   proceeds down Imperial Avenue on their way to either downtown Calexico or
                   Mexico. The fact that downtown abuts the International Border does tend to
                   worsen the problem. A secondary hindrance to east/ west traffic is the railroad
                   track which generally parallels Highway 111. Currently, no grade separated
                   crossings of the tracks exist within the City.
                   Safety issues relating to crossing Highway 111 affect both pedestrians and
                   vehicular traffic. Recent efforts to alleviate accidents and congestion include
                   the closure of Jasper Road at Highway 111 until a signal light is installed; and

                                                                                     3. 0 Circulation
                    the installation of a raised median from the U. S. and Mexico International
                    Border to St" Street to prevent crossings of the highway.
                    Two other issues affect existing traffic conditions within the City. The first is
                    created by truck traffic. Truck traffic to/from Calexico businesses and through
                    truck traffic on major and secondary arterial streets, and collector and local
                    roads creates unsafe conditions and traffic congestion. A second traffic impact
                    is caused by the location of school sites. Due to the proximity of some school
                    sites immediately opposite each other on major and secondary arterials,
                    congestion is a problem during morning drop- off and afternoon pick-up times.
  3. 2. 1 Existing Roadways
            Imperial Avenue/ Highway 111
                   Imperial Avenue/ Highway 1 l 1 is the primary north/ south arterial in the City
                   of Calexico. The roadway basically divides the City in half. All traffic that
                   travels north to Interstate 8 or south into Mexico, travels on this roadway. The
                   traffic is so substantial that Imperial Avenue ( within the City limits south of
                   Birch Street) is usually jammed with not only through traffic, but also with
                   north/ south local traffic, and automobiles that are trying to get from one side
                   of town to the other. The fact that there are only two traffic signals on this
                   portion of the roadway contributes greatly to the congestion. Many four-way
                   stop signs also contribute to constant stop and go traffc, both heading in and
                   out of Mexico. To ease this situation closest to the border, a raised median
                   was built between Second Street and Fifth Street, thus eliminating cross traffc
                   at Third and Fourth Streets. The stop signs at Third and Fourth Streets were
                   removed for north/ south traffic. Traffic control personnel assist with traffic
                   flow through this area during peak traffic times.
           Traffic Signals along mperial Avenue
                   Although quite expensive, signalization is the easiest way to alleviate the
                   congestion on Imperial Avenue. With the creation of a system that enables
                   vehicles to travel between the border and Birch Street with the fewest possible
                   delays would dramatically reduce the congestion on Imperial Avenue in the
                   City. Traffic tends to flow smoothly into and out of the City via Birch Street,
                   and considering its inadequacies as a primary easdwest thoroughfare, the
                   trouble spots are few and manageable.

              Birch Street (State Route 98)
                      Birch Street/ State Route 98 is classified as a State Highway and is a primary
                      east/ west arterial in the City of Calexico. SR 98 currently provides two lanes
                      of travel in each direction east of its intersection with 011ie Avenue. West of
                      011ie Avenue, Birch Street becomes a two- lane ( one in each direction) road
                      forming a bottleneck which when combined with a lack of left turn lanes at
                      Cezar Chavez Blvd., aggravates congestion within the area. Caltrans plans to
l_ J                  upgrade Birch between Highway 111 and David Navarro Avenue to a four-
                      lane highway. There are no bike lanes or bus stops provided and curbside
                      parking is prohibited.
                      SR- 98 east of SR- 111 is currently two lanes in each direction between SR- 111
                      and Encinas Ave. This section of roadway currently experiences significant
                      congestion. East of Encinas Avenue to Bowker Road, SR- 98 is a 4- land
   J
                      divided road. From Bowker Road easterly, SR- 98 varies between one and two
                      lanes in each direction. According to the Caltrans District l 1 website, SR-98
                      is planned to be widened and/ or realigned between SR- 111 and SR- 7 from
                      two lanes to four lanes ( six lanes in some locations). A portion is planned to
                      be realigned northerly to coincide with portions of the Jasper Avenue right- of-
                      way.
              Second Street/ Anza Road
                      Second Street, which becomes Anza Road east and west of the City, is one of
                      the major east/ west cross town arterials near the southern edge of the City,
                      parallel to the International Border. In the section west of Imperial Avenue,
                      there are two lanes in each direction. As the street enters the Central Business
                      District, the street narrows to one lane each way with angular parking along
                      most of the segment between Paulin and Heber Avenues where it is only one-
                      way in the eastbound direction. Second Street is one of only three easbwest
                      arterials that enable traffic to cross the railroad tracks located west of
                      Highway 111. As the cross- street located closest to the U. S./ Mexico border,
                      Second Street is impacted most when queues ( lines) of autos form waiting to
                      be processed at the border. The Calexico/ Mexicali Border Transportation
                      Study, June 2000, by Katz, Okitsu &         Associates states that the impact to
                      Second Street is substantial as a result of delays at the border.
              Cole Road
                      Cole Road is classified as a Collector on the Imperial County Circulation
                      Element. Cole Road is the most northern of east/west roadway within the City
                      limits. Cole Road currently is constructed as a two- lane undivided roadway
                      from west of the City limits to Enterprise Boulevard. At Enterprise Boulevard
                      it transitions into a four- lane undivided roadway between Imperial Avenue
                      WestlScaroni Road and SR 111. East of SR 111, Cole Road is currently
                      constructed as a four-lane divided roadway between SR 111 and M. L. King
                      Avenue. It then transitions back into a four- lane undivided roadway east of M.

                   L. King Avenue to Bowker Road. Curbside parking is prohibited along both
                   sides of the roadway and bus stops are provided along the portion of Cole
                   Road    between   SR   I11   and  Yourman     RoadJRockwood        Avenue.    The
                   intersection of Cole Road and Highway 1 l 1 is controlled by a traffic signal. A
                   frontage road on either side of Highway 111 leads into Cole Road. Traffic
                   congestion is a concern on Cole Road, and with its improvements has become
                   a major commercial and industrial arterial, relieving some of the pressure on
                   Birch Street.
          Jasper Road
                   Jasper Road is an unclassified east/west roadway that forms the northern City
t                  limit of Calexico. Jasper Road is currently constructed as a two- lane
                   undivided roadway. No bike lanes or bus stops are provided and curbside
                  parking is prohibited. In the future, the City will request that Caltrans realign
                   and reroute SR 98 from Birch Street to the Jasper Road alignment between
                   Bowker Road and Dogwood Road. Jasper would then become a 6- lane
                  highway.
          Dogwood Road
                  Dogwood Road is a north/ south roadway located along the western edge of
                  the City' s Sphere of Influence. It connects from Highway 98 north to
                  Brawley. Dogwood Road is currently a two- lane undivided road in the vicinity
                  of Calexico.
u
           Kloke Road
                  Kloke Road is a north- south roadway that connects Jasper Road with Grant
                  Street. Currently constructed as a two- lane undivided roadway, Kloke Road is
                  an important north- south roadway on the western side of the City.
          Cesar Chavez
                  Caesar Chavez Boulevard is currently an unclassified two- lane roadway that
                  parallels the Union Pacific Railroad tracks. Caesar Chavez Boulevard runs
                  northwest from Second Street to SR 98 through a predominantly industrial
                  area. According to the Calexico West Border Station Expansion/ Renovation
                  Feasibility Study, CannonDesign 2005, the terminus of Cesar Chavez Blvd, at
                  Second Street is directly opposite the entry/exit point of the vacated
                  commercial port which is proposed to be converted into the passenger car
                  point of entry between Calexico and Mexicali. Due to this location, Cesar
                  Chavez Blvd. is proposed to serve as the primary, or an additional, entrance
                  roadway to/ from Mexico through the proposed Calexico West Border Station.
                  Although this may serve to alleviate some of the traffic congestion near the
                  border, the intersection of Cesar Chavez Blvd. and Highway 98 may need to
                  be upgraded and/ or Cesar Chavez Blvd. may need to be extended northward
                  to Cole Road.

1                  Currently a two- lane undivided arterial, Andrade/ Meadows Road runs north
                   from Second Street to Heber Road. Andrade/ Meadows Road provides an
                   important north- south link in the eastern portion of the City.
1          Bowker Road
                   Bowker Road is currently constructed as a north- south two- lane divided

                   the eastern portion of the City' s Sphere of Influence.
1 3.2.2 Existing Transit System and Planned Trails
                   The Imperial Valley, including the City of Calexico, is served by Imperial
                   Valley Transit ( ICT), an inter-City fixed route bus system. The ICT system is
                   administered by the County Department of Public Works, operated by
                   LAIDLAW TRANSIT SERVICE INC., and subsidized by the Imperial Valley
                   Association of Governments ( IVAG). According to IVAG' s 2005- 2006
                   Transit Finance Plan, June 2005, the bus service has " ten ( 10) wheelchair
                   accessible 40 ft. transit buses and two ( 2) wheelchair accessible minibus.
                   Service is provided from 6: 00 AM until approximately 1 l: 00 PM weekdays,
                   and 6: 00 AM to 5: 00 PM on Saturdays, within the areas classified as the
                   Primary Zone: a North- South axis through Brawley, Imperial, El Centro,
                   Heber and Calexico, and from 6: 00 AM until 6: 00 PM in the Secondary
                   Zones; outlying cities and communities of Niland, Calipatria, Westmorland,
                   Seeley and Holtville." Calexico also has a Dial- A- Ride demand response
                   service which is subsidized by IVAG and administered by the City of
                   Calexico. This demand response service is available to seniors and persons
                   with disabilities seven days a week.
                   In late 2003, the City adopted the City of Calexico Bicycle Master Plan. The
                   network of trails and lanes described in Chapter 6 and all of the Bicycle
                   Master Plan is incorporated by reference as an integral part of the City' s
1                  Circulation Element. Figure G1. 5, Proposed Bicycle Network, shows the
                   bicycle and multi- use trail/ lane system.
  3. 3 Level of Service
                   The Circulation Element has been developed in recognition of the need to
                   relieve existing congestion and to provide a circulation system that can
                   accommodate future anticipated growth. Levels of Service ( LOS) standards
                   are used to assess the performance of a street or highway system and the
                   capacity of a roadway. An important goal when planning the transportation
                   system is to maintain acceptable levels of service along the federal and state
                   highways and the local roadway network. To accomplish this, the California

                                                                                                                  3. 0 Circulation
                    Imperial, and the other local agencies adopt minimum levels of service to
                    determine future infrastructure needs.
                    Traffic analysis uses the Level of Service ( LOS) system of categorization to
                    evaluate the project area roadway intersections. Traffic engineers use this
                    LOS system of categorization to describe how well an intersection or roadway
                    is functioning. The LOS measures several factors including operating speeds,
                    freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and average vehicle delay at
                    intersections. The LOS approach uses a ranking system, similar to education,
                    with level ` A' being best and level ` F' being worst. Table C- A, Level of
                    Service ( LOS) Standards, describes LOS levels in terms the average driver
                    can understand. The LOS is related to the volume-to- capacity ratio ( V/C). To
                    determine the V/C ratio, the average daily traffic ( ADT) volume on a
                    particular roadway link is divided by the capacity of that same section or
                    roadway.
                    The circulation system of the City of Calexico is primarily composed of a
                    system of arterial and collector roads with two state routes traversing the City.
                    Currently, the majority of vehicle delay occurs at the signalized intersections
                    because vehicles are stopped to allow cross traffic to clear. Each intersection
                    with such congestion problems needs to be evaluated in a detailed traffic study
                    at the time that development in the area or roadway improvements are
                    proposed.         With the programmatic                   level of information              available     in the
                    General        Plan,   LOS along roadway segments can be evaluated and the
                    roadways sized to accommodate future traffic needs which is the purpose of
                    the Circulation Element.

    3. 3. 1  Tra   c Sfudies
                    The City of Calexico conducted a traffic study ( Appendix E) as part of the
                    2005 General Plan update. The objectives of the study were to determine the
                    future traffic volumes in the City of Calexico and its Sphere of Influence, to
 J                  determine whether the City' s required level of service standard will be
                    maintained at General Plan buildout year, and if not, what proposed roadway
                    classifications will be necessary to maintain said level of service. The study
                    was conducted in order to           make recommendations for the Circulation
                    Element and research available options on alleviating congestion along
                    Imperial Avenue and other primary/major roadways, as well as anticipating
                    and accommodating future growth allowed by the 2005 General Plan.
                    Due to Calexico' s unique proximity to the U. S./ Mexico border and the traffic
                    congestion challenges that proximity raises on both local and regional levels,
                    many traffic analyses have been completed over the years. Most recently,
                    IVAG     commissioned     the     Greater Calexico  Area   Arterial   Needs    and
                    Circulation Analysis, June 2005. Past studies addressing the border crossing
                    traffic   issues   include:   U. S.    GSA   Calexico   West    Border     Station
                    Expansion/ Renovation Feasibility Study,       2002- 2003;  the  Calexico    West

                    Element ( Caltrans District I 1),  2002.
IJ                  Traffic studies are also required by the City for major development projects
                    and even small projects that pose traffic/ congestion issues ( see Circulation
                    Element Policies which follow).
   Circulation System

J  3. 4. 1 Classi cation of Streets
                    The circulation system consists of five standard street classification types:
                    highway, primary arterial, majar arterial, secondary arterial, and collector and
                    other smaller local roads. The General Plan Circulation Element plans for the
                    secondary roads, arterials, and highways but does not address the collector
                    and local roads. In addition, the City is bisected by two State Routes that are
                    considered freeways or expressways in some locations. Standard General Plan
                    Street Classifications are identifed in Table C- B and typical General Plan
                    Recommended Roadway Cross Sections of the Circulation Element roadways
                    are illustrated in Figure C- 2. The Recommended General Plan Circulation
                    Element planned roadway system is illustrated in Figure C- 3 with roadway
                    classification information Circulation Element Roadways shown in Table C-
                    C.
                    Any classification of street can be designed as divided or undivided roadway.
                    Divided roadways have the ability to incorporate turning lanes to improve the
   City of Calexica General Plan                                                                  3- 11
                                                                                                         3. 0 Circulation
                    through carrying capacity of the roadway. Further, divided roadways may
                     incorporate raised medians to restrict access from driveways and adjacent
                    roads. These types of roadways are the most efficient since conflicts or
                     intersections are minimized permitting traffic speed to be more constant.
                    Undivided roads are less efficient than divided roadways, though they may
                    incorporate the same number of through lanes as divided roadways. They also
                    require less right- of-way because they have no left-turn lane or raised median.

                    Although the opening of the eastern border crossing for commercial traffic has
                    improved the situation somewhat, truck traffic is still a safety and congestion
                    issue within Calexico. To alleviate some of the issues caused by truck traffic
                    on non- industrial secondary, collector and local streets, the Circulation
                    Element establishes truck routes to serve major industrial and commercial
                    areas of the City and to move trucks that do not have designated stops in
                    Calexico to better be directed through the City. Figure C- 4 shows the Interim
                    and Ultimate Truck Routes within Calexico. The " interim" routes would be
                    used until SR- 98 is realigned to the Bowker, Jasper, Dogwood alternative
                    alignment, then the ultimate truck routes could be established.

I
  3. 5 Design Standards
  3. 5. 1  Interstate Highways
                    Interstate highways are intended to carry unimpeded traffic between major
                   traffic generators such as large commercial,       industrial, recreational,   and
                    residential areas. These highways, in general, are part of the overall regional
                    circulation system. The Calexico area is served by Interstate 8, located about 5
                   miles north of the planning area.
  3. 5. 2   Freeways, Expressways, and Highways
                    The freeway, expressway and highway classifications consist of four to eight
                   travel lanes with limited or no vehicular access to the roadway through
                   driveways and streets. The roadway is divided by a raised or striped median
                   with separate left turn lanes. Generally, highways intersect other highways at
                   approximately one- half mile intervals. Intersections with freeways and
                   expressways are spaced further apart and may consist of interchanges. These
                   roadways are expected to carry the majority of the through traffic between
                   adjacent communities and the freeway system. When built to maximum
                   design standards, these roadways are striped for two, three, or four lanes in
                   each direction, with shoulders, painted or raised medians, and left-turn lanes at
                    intersections ( highways and expressways only). Table C- D shows the
                   maximum capacity for all roadway types in Calexico. " Maximum capacity"
                   refers to the physical capacity of the roadway only and does not represent the
                   desired or required LOS on any roadway. Caltrans and the City of Calexico
                   desire a LOS C, which is calculated based on maximum capacity.
  3. 5.3    Primary Arterial
                   Primary arterial roadways are designed to have four travel lanes with limited
                   vehicular access from driveways and streets. The roadways usually have a
                   raised or painted median with separate left-turn lanes, and intersect with other
                   primary roadways, major arterials, and secondary arterials at approximately
                   one- eighth mile intervals. Primary roadways carry large volumes of through
                   traffic and collect traffic from limited secondary roadways. Primary roadways
                   are designed for two travel lanes in each direction with raised or painted
                   medians,     shoulders where right-of-way permits, and left-turn lanes at
                   intersections. When built to standard, this roadway classification has a
                   maximum capacity of 37, 500 vehicles per day ( see Table C- D).
  3. 5.4   Major Arterial
                   Major arterial roadways are planned as four lane undivided roadways with
                   partial control of access. Major streets move moderate volumes of through
                   traffic and serve as routes for local traffic to connect with highways and
                   primary arterials. They serve as access routes for local residents to reach
                   activity areas in the City, and may also provide direct access to commercial
  City of Calexico Genera[ Pian                                                                  3- 18
                                                                                                                         3. 0 Circulation
                        properties. This classification of roadway is striped for two travel lanes in
                        each direction, with on- street curbside parking and left-turn lanes at major
                        intersections. The maximum capacity for limited secondary highways is
                        25, 000 vehicles per day ( see Table C- D).
3. 5.5 Secondary Arterial
                        Secondary arterial roadways are planned as two lane undivided roadways with
                        limited      access.       These       roads      serve      more       local     traffic     from       residential,
                        commercial, and industrial areas and feed into the arterial system. Secondary
                        arteriats provide a necessary connection to the major traffic carriers and have
                        a typical maximum capacity of 17, 500 vehicles per day ( see Table C- D).

         These roadway capacities are approximate figures only, and are used at the General Plan level. They are affected by such
       factors as intersections ( numbers & configuration), degree of access control, roadway grades, design geometrics ( horizontal
          vertica] alignment standards), sight distance, level of truck and bus Vaffic, and level of pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
       Average daily traffic (ADT) is used in this modei application as a long range planning tool to assist in determining roadway
       highway classification ( number of thru lanes) needed to meet tra     c demand.
3. 6      Goal, Objectives, and Policie
3. 6. 1     Goal
                        The circulation system should promote the safe, efficient movement of people,
                        goods and vehicles, and protect and enhance the environmental quality of
                        Calexico.
3. 6. 1. 1     Land Use and Circvlation
Objective 1
                        Land use should be planned in conjunction with the circulation so that it does
                        not overburden the City's existing and/ or planned circulation system.

                             The City should monitor the impact of development proposals as well
                             as intra- and inter-City land uses on circulation to ensure that the
                             circulation system is not overburdened.
                    c.
                             The City shall work with Calexico Unified School District and other
                             private or public educational institutions to site schools in such a way
                             as to reduce traffic congestion problems at key drop-off and pick-up
                             hours to benefit both the safety of the students and other local
i                            residents.
                             Industrial land uses should be located and site planned to encourage
                             the use of designated truck routes and discourage truck traffic from
                             using non- industrial secondary, collector, and local streets.
                    e        Commercial, civic uses, schools, and services should be located near
                             enough to residential areas to allow for and encourage pedestrian

    3. 6. 1. 2 Streef Nefwork and Standards
   Objective 2
                    The General Plan shall establish a system of street classifications and set
                    standards for each.
   Policy 2
                    a.       The City shall utilize Level of Service (       LOS)   as    a  measure    of

                            transit service and provide effective transit use as the City grows.
                     f.     To    assist international  pedestrians   that need    or want   to  reach
                            destinations within Calexico, public transportation should be routed to
                            easily pick up consumers and/ or students within walking distance of
                            the border. Destinations should include major retail centers such as
                            Wal- Mart, Las Palmas, and Price Center for those who may want to

I 4. 0 PUBLIC FACILITIES/ SERVICES ELEMENT
  4. 1 Introduction
                   A Public Facilities/ Services Element is not one of the state- required
                   elements for inclusion in a General Plan. Typically, many of the issues
                   discussed herein have significant overlap with other elements. However,
                   the City of Calexico is committed to providing adequate public facilities
                   and services to its residents, and thus feels compelled to address these
                   issues in greater detail. The adequacy of public facilities and services is
                   key to providing the City' s residents with the ability to attain a high
                   quality of life. Since the adoption of the last General Plan by the City in
                    1992, the population of Calexico has grown by more than 50% and is
                   expected to continue to grow. It is important to provide adequate public
                   facilities and services to existing residents as well as provide them for new
                   developmentâ€” these facilities and services are essential for quality urban
                   living and the framework for new development.
                   Public facilities and services are responses by institutions to basic human
                   needs such as safety, health, education, and worship. They include police,
                   hospitals, schools, churches, and safe drinking water. Public facilities and
                   service are provided by all levels of government as well as other public
                   and quasi- public organizations. The degree to which these basic types of
                   needs are met helps to define the character and identity of a community.
                   This element addresses sewer facilities, water systems, and storm drain
                   facilities. It will also address public services in the form of health care,
                   library,    education,   and  police   and   fire   protection.        Other    public
                   facilities/ services such as parks and recreation are discussed in Element
                   6. 0 of this General Plan. A key component of the discussion and policies
                   herein are implementation mechanisms to finance the reyuired capital
                   improvements.
  4. 2 Existing Conditions
  4.2. 1 Public Facilifies
  4.2. 1. 1 Sewers
                   The City' s sewer system is segmented into three " zones" defined, as such,
                   by into which of the three sewer interceptors they discharge. As stated in
                   the current Service Area Plan, as a result of the flat topography, most of
                   the sewer lines are constructed at minimum slope and the interceptors are
                   fairly deep, some as much as 20 feet. Also, the flat topography
                   necessitates the construction of many small lift-stations to provide
                   adequate flow. All sewage flows to the activated sludge wastewater
                                                                                                           4- 1

                                                                           4.     al;        l 3' s.;'â‚¬  v.,
                     treatment plant located north of Calexico International Airport and south
                     of the New River. Treated effluent is deposited into the New River.
                     The maximum daily flow capacity for the existing sewage treatment
                     facility is 4. 30 million gallons per day ( mgd). The City operates currently
                     with an average daily flow (" ADF")         of 2. 7 mgd.  Although rain is rare in
                     Calexico, peak wet weather flows (" PWWF")                currently exceed plant
                     capacity at 4. 9 mgd. By 2015, growth is projected such that flow demand
                     will exceed capacity with an ADF of 5. 0 mgd. Bond funding is being put
                     in place now to rectify deficiencies and accommodate future needs. By
                     2010 the treatment plant should be upgraded to a capacity of 8. 5 mgd
                     which will accommodate projected ADF and PWWF at least through
                     2015. Ultimate build-out for the treatment facility ( 2030) according to the
                     2005 Service Area Plan is 18. 4 mgd. However, an accurate assessment of
                     sewage capacity and subsequent policies requires an updated sewer master
                    plan and Service Area Plan updates every five years.
   4.2. 1. 2 Potable Water
                     Calexico receives all of its potable water from the Calexico Water
CI                  Department. The Calexico Water Department purchases its raw water
                    from Imperial Irrigation District ( IID) which acquires its water from the
                    Colorado River via an open canal system. Currently, 2% of IID water is
                    divided among Calexico and other Imperial Valley cities. According to the
                    current Service Area Plan, the raw water from the canal is pumped
                    through a 42- inch pipe into the City' s 25 million gallon reservoir. Three
                    pumps transfer water via a 36- inch pipe from either the reservoir or the
                    canal to the City' s treatment facility and have a maximum daily capacity
                    of 18 mgd. The existing treatment plant has a capacity of 16 mgd. Treated
                    water is transferred and stored in three above ground tanks. These tanks
                    have a combined capacity of 8 million gallons. There is a proposal to build
                    an 6 million gallon tank near Cole Road and Highway 98 to serve current
                    needs and future growth in the City' s Sphere of Influence. As with the
                    sewers, a sufficient assessment of water requirements can only be made
                    within the framework of a 5- year Service Area Plan.
   4. 2. 1. 3 Storm Water
                    Storm water drainage in the City currently utilizes a combination of piping
                    into the New River and discharge through IID main and lateral drains. Due
                    to the precariousness of this arrangement, detention basins are used to
1                   control the amount of water that is discharged into IID canals. The IID
                    canals were originally designed only to handle agricultural runoff, and as
                    such, IID limits the amount of storm water that is discharged into them to
                    prevent downstream flooding. There are also numerous unresolved water

                    quality issues regarding the New River and ultimately the Salton Sea ( the
                    water body to which the river and the canals drain) which prohibits simply
                    diverting all storm runoff from new developments to the river. Currently,
                    there is no lead flood control agency to ensure compliance with the
                    various regulations associated with storm water discharge into the New
                    River or any type of stream bed alterations necessary to accommodate new
                    capacity. A current 5- year Service Area Plan is necessary for an accurate
                    and detailed storm water assessment.
  4. 2. 1. 4 Public Buildings
                    Public buildings are an important part of the City of Calexico. Typically,
                    public buildings refer to those owned by the City, but are also made up of
                    buildings owned by the County of Imperial and IID. Public buildings are
                    used   primarily   as  places  of public     meeting,      assembly,    or   public
                    information. An example of a public building in Calexico is City Hall.
                    Public buildings may also be important socially or culturally, serving as
                    sources of civic pride and enrichment. See Figure PF- 1.

  4. 2. 2. 1 Health Care
                    The City of Calexico currently does not have an operational hospitaL The
                    Heffernan Memorial Hospital officially closed in 1997 after a long history
                    of financial troubles and diminished quality of care issues. The City has
                    five privately- operated medical facilities: Clinicas del Pueblo, Inc., Valley
                   Family Care Centers, Pioneers Health Center, Imperial Valley Women' s
                   Clinic, and the Calexico Medical Center. Residents of Calexico use El
                    Centro Regional Medical       Center and the Pioneers Health Center in
t                  Brawley for hospital services.      The     Heffernan    Hospital      District    and
                   Pioneers    Health    Memorial   Healthcare      District    have     developed      a
                   partnership and have opened an urgent care facility at the site of the
                   former Heffernan Memorial Hospital. The City of Calexico had a% 2 cent
                   sales tax in place for ten years, but its extension was not approved by the
                   voters in November of 2005. The tax expired on March 31, 200b. The
1                  Heffernan Hospital District now has a plan to phase development of a new
                   medical complex and funds the staffing of a second ambulance unit for he
                   City of Calexico Fire Department.
  4. 2. 2. 2 Libraries
                   The Camarena Memorial Library currently serves the City of Calexico
                   along with a branch location at William Moreno Junior High School. The
                   branch library operates with very limited hours. The Camarena Memorial
                   Library has a collection of over 70, 000 books, periodicals, and other
                   materials housed in 12, 000 square feet. This Library has special

                 collections on Imperial Valley history and Caesar Chavez. Other facilities
                 at the library include internet access, word processing equipment, copy
                 machines, and meeting rooms. The Library also offers a variety of
                 bilingual ( English    and   Spanish)   community     programs         and   classes
                 including: adult literacy tutoring, summer programs, teen                 programs,
                 internet training, and Families for Literacy for children under 5.
                 The Library has a current staff of 4 full- time and 4 part-time workers. The
                 existing facilities are at capacity. The Library Board recognizes the need
                 to expand the main library to 24, 000 syuare feet and eventually build
                 another branch library. Included in the main library expansion would be
                 facilities for arts/ crafts, more   computers,  additional    staff,     and   small
                 conference rooms.
                 Additional library facilities available in the City of Calexico are provided
                 by the San Diego State University Imperial Valley Campus. The
                 university library serves approximately 900 students and contains over
                  110, 000 books and other materials.

  4. 2. 2. 3 Education
                   The City of Calexico is served by the Calexico Unified School District
                    CUSD). CUSD currently has nearly 9, 000 students in 6 elementary
                   schools, 1 high school, 1 continuation high school, 2 junior high schools,
                   and one adult education center. ( See Figure PF- 2.) Table PF- A names the
                   facilities shown on Figure PF- 2. There are 500 certificated personnel and
                   400 staff employed by CUSD. The District was recognized in 1994 by the
u
                   National Association for Bilingual Education and boasts about a 75%      rate
                   of students continuing on to some type of post-secondary education. The

                   CUSD has had to cope with tremendous growth and has had issues of
                   overcrowding. Other schools in Imperial Valley have changed to the
                   multi- track year-round schedule to help mitigate overcrowding from
                   burgeoning student populations. CUSD, however, has not been able to
                   change from a traditional school year due to the significant number of
                   students from families of migrant farm workers. Approximately 23%      of all
                   students enrolled in CUSD schools are from migrant families. CUSD has
                   determined that switching to a year-round school year would make it
                   impossible for these students to attend school.
                   CUSD expects to see significant growth in student population; enrollment
                   is predicted to double in the next ten years. With this amount of growth,
                   the district expects to need an additional 9 to 12 new schools in the next

                   0 to 12 years. In an attempt to prepare for this expected growth as well as
                 better serve the needs of current residents, voters in the City approved
                 Measure J in March of 2004. Measure J approved the floating of a$ 30
                 million general obligation bond for the remodeling of existing schools and
                 the construction of new ones. Currently there are plans to renovate
                 Calexico High School, build Caesar Chavez Elementary School ( new),
                 and possibly construct a new junior high school. In addition, the District
                 would like to develop a vocational arts high school program.

  4. 2. 2.4 Police
                   The City of Calexico receives law enforcement services from the Calexico
                   Police Department. The City' s police station is located at 420 E. 5`" Street
                   with substations at Nosotros and International Parks, and near Meadows
                   Avenue north of SR- 98, see Figure PF- 1.     As of April 2005, there are 43
                   sworn officers working for the department ( however, the City is budgeted
                   for 48 officers), for a staffing ratio of approximately 1. 3 officers per 1, 000
                   residents. The majority of officers work on a beat system which means
                   that they are assigned to patrol a certain section of the City. The current
                   Service Area Plan estimates that the existing police stations will be
                   adequate to accommodate the department' s future growth of personnel
                   through the year 2020. There is, however, a proposed joint-use fire/ police
                   station to be located in the northeast area of the City that will serve
                   proposed new development in that area and maintain quick response time.
  4. 2. 2. 5 Fire Protection
                                                                                                   Stn
                   The city of Calexico currently has two fire stations, located at 430 East
                   Street and at 900 Grant Street, see Figure PF- l. There are a total of 32
                   professional firefighters employed by the Calexico Fire Department:               1
                   chief, 30 firefighters, and an administrative staff.
                   The Department is also working toward adding reserve firefighters in the
                   near future. The Calexico Fire Department is a member of the Imperial
                   Valley Firefghters Strike Force which is responsible to respond to fire
                   emergencies throughout California. The Department is also a member of
                   the Imperial Valley Hazardous Materials Response Team and is available
                   to respond to hazardous materials emergencies throughout the Imperial
J
                   County. The Fire Department presently belongs to Imperial Valley
                   Emergency Communications Authority (" IVECA") and Radio Community
                   Server (" RCS")    which have integrated communications in the Imperial
                   Valley and San Diego County; and will soon include Yuma County, AZ.
  4. 2. 2. 6 Solid Waste
                   Solid waste collection and disposal is contracted through Allied Waste.
                   The collected waste is deposited in a private landfill that is located in the
                   City of Imperial. Estimates by the City' s Public Facilities Director,
                   regarding the capacity of the Imperial landfill, is that the landfill has
                   adequate capacity to accommodate the City' s growth for the next ten
                   years. However, Imperial County is actively seeking a new site on which
                   to build a landfill.

  4. 3 Establishing a Vision
                   The Vision for adequate public services and facilities in the City of
                   Calexico is essential for quality urban living. It is also necessary for the
                   future of the city as new growth will require additional facilities and
                   services. The Public Facilities and Services Element is responsive to the
                   City' s vision because it:
                   a.     identifies facilities and services that support the functions that are
                          essential to the future development of the City while retaining and
                          improving existing areas of the City,
                   b.     demonstrates a commitment to this important aspect of community
                          development by our public officials,
                   c.     strengthens the City' s overall sense of "community,"  and
                   d.     adds to the desirability of the community as a place to attract
                          business investment and home ownership.
  4.4 Goal, Objectives, and Policies
  4.4. 1 Goal
                   To provide a full range of the necessary public facilities and services that
                   are convenient to users, economical, and reinforce a quality City identity.
  4.4. 1. 1 Facilities and Services Development
  Objective 1
                   To coordinate planning and development of Calexico' s public facilities
                   and services with the private development sector, Calexico Unified School
                   District, San Diego State University, Imperiat County, and other public
                   agencies.
  Policy 1
                   a.     Establish funding mechanisms to fund the construction or expansion
                          of public services and facilities necessitated by new development.
                          The City should adopt appropriate ordinance( s) that implement
                          impact fees and/ or exactions on developers to fund the construction
                          of public facilities caused by the new development. The ordinance
                          should delineate methods for fee calculation to allow developers to
                          know in advance their expected fee.
                          The City should, where appropriate and feasible, create assessment
                          districts to fund certain public improvements.
                   c      The City should use general obligation and revenue bonds to finance
                          long-term capital improvements.

                     d.     Develop joint-use/joint-power agreements with Calexico Unified
                             School District, San Diego State University, and other special
                             districts  or agencies.    Examples of facility agreements include
                             libraries, theaters, learning facilities, and athletic fields.
                     e.     The City shall consider combining agencies that provide similar
                             services in order facilitate acquisition of these services and to
                            prevent similar agencies from performing the same tasks.
    4.4. 1. 2 Sewers
    Objective 2
                     To provide high quality sewage services to existing residents as well as to
                     accommodate future growth and development.
    Policy 2
                     a.     Approve new development only if sewer facilities will be expanded
                            to serve these areas at the expense of the developer or City.
                     b.     Continually monitor the existing sewer system to identify any
                            necessary improvements to maintain high quality service and to
                            ensure compliance with secondary treatment standards.
                            Sewer service shall exist prior to the approval of any new
                            development application which requires community sewer service.
                            Future sewer service expansions should be designed to maintain
                            adeyuate level of service.
                     e.     The extension of sewage transmission lines or pumping services to
                            accommodate new developments should be limited to within one
                            quarter mile of developed areas.
  l                  f.     All improvements to the existing sewer system necessitated by the
                            approval of a new development project shall be financed entirely by
                            the proponent either by fee or actual construction.
                     g.     All future tentative maps should be approved only with conditions
                            based on water and sewer service availability. There shall be no
1                           exceptions, either on occasion or by approval.
    4.4. 1. 3 Potable Water
1   Objective 3
                     To provide high quality potable water services to existing residents as well
                     as to accommodate future growth and development.
     Policy 3

1 5. 0 CONSERVATION/ OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
i 5. 1 Introduction
                    California law requires the preparation of a Conservation/ Open Space
                   Element in a City' s General Plan. California Government Code Section
                   65302 requires that the conservation element address the identification,
                   conservation, development, and use of natural resources. These include,
                   but are not limited to, development of farmland, flood control, water
                   pollution, erosion, and endangered species. The open space element is
                   simply the plan for " the comprehensive and long-range preservation and
                   conservation of open- space land" ( Government Code 65563). In addition,
                   the open space element must also include a plan of action which outlines
                   the means by which open space will be managed and acquired in the
                   future.
                   The City of Calexico is located in a predominantly flat agricultural area
                   with few natural features. The New River and the Imperial Irrigation
                   District (" IID")   canals are the only variations in the otherwise expansive
                   plain that surrounds the City. This element will focus on the important
                   resources that the City must conserve, including, soil, surface and ground
                   water, agricultural land, and open space.
  5.2 Conservation Resource Assessment
  5.2. 1 Agriculture
C                  The City of Calexico is located in Imperial County which is within the
                   7, 500 square mile Colorado Desert. Approximately half of the County' s
                   acreage is undeveloped and under ownership of the federal government.
I                  One fifth of the County' s acreage is used for agricultural purposes and is
                   located in the Imperial Valley. The Valley relies completely on the
                   importation of water from the Colorado River for both potable drinking
                   water and for crop irrigation. Due to a combination of a climate, fertile
                   soils, and readily available water, the Imperial Valley is one of the most
                   productive agricultural areas in the world. In 2003, the Imperial Valley
                   had an overall agricultural production output of over $ 1 billion, and for
                   every $ 1, 000 of total gross produced value, $ 392 of personal income is
                   generated for agriculture- related employment'.

   5.2. 3 Water Supply and Quality
                    In modern history, water has been plentiful in the Imperial Valley.
                    However,     as    populations    in   the   southwest      continue     to  grow,       the
                    competition     for   limited   water    supplies    will   escalate.     The  Imperial
                    Irrigation District, which supplies water to Calexico, has initiated an
                    agreement to divert some of its water allocation to other urbanized areas of
IJ                  southern    California.    Therefore,    water is a precious commodity and
                    conserving it in the Valley is an important step towards ensuring the long-
                    term viability of the region.
   5.2. 4 Soils
                    Long before the Colorado River was used as a source of water in the
                    Imperial Valley, the River shaped what the Valley would become. After
                    the great inland sea that once covered much of the Imperial Valley
                    receded, the Colorado River meandered across its delta, which was once in
                    the Imperial Valley, until it reached the Gulf of California. As it did, it left
                    silt deposits throughout the Valley ( as deep as 2, 000 feet), which accounts
                    for the rich soil that remains. The soil in the Imperial Valley is a precious
                    resource and must be conserved.
   5.2. 5 Open Space and the New River
                    Currently the only designated open space lands within the City of
                    Calexico, besides parkland, school properties, and agricultural land, are
                    the major water aqueducts or canals ( All American and Central Main)
                    which bisect the City, and the area immediately adjacent to the north side
                    of the Calexico International Airport. This area north of the airport is the
                    lowlands through which the New River flows. Because of the high level of
                    pollutants in the New River (referred to as the most polluted river in North
                                                CRWQCBZ),
                    America in a study by                        this area is also hazardous to public
                    health.   Flowing north from Mexico,            the New River is imbued with
                    industrial waste and raw sewage backflow from Mexicali. The New River
                    is simultaneously one of the areas with the greatest potential for
                    recreational    uses   associated    with   open    space    as  well     as the      worst
                    environmental hazard in the City.
                    Because the New River crosses international jurisdictions, the City has
                    less direct control over its clean- up. However, the U. S. Environmental
                    Protection Agency (" EPA") has recently announced the Border 2012
                    Program which is a bi- national environmental agreement between the U. S.
                    and Mexico. The Program, among other things, contributes $                   13 million
                      USD) to Mexicali II wastewater treatment project which could eliminate

                  Currently within the City, there is a local effort toward New River cleanup
                  by the Calexico New River Committee. The group has, among other
                 things, developed a local vision and has sought and received federat and
                  other funding sources aimed at implementing the New River Improvement
                  Project. The purpose of the New River Improvement Project is to provide
                  a regional vision and strategic plan to transform the New Rivers in, and
                  downstream from, the City of Calexico from its current highly polluted
                 condition into a resource with significantly improved water quality that
                 minimizes threats to public health and improves the condition of water
                 flowing into the Salton Sea. At the present time, the following describes
                 the vision for the New River Improvement Project. This project, as
                 described below, is not considered a part of the General Plan for purposes
                 of California Environmental Quality Act ( CEQA) compliance. The New
                 River Improvement Project will require separate review and compliance
                 with the California Environmental Quality Act and the National
                 Environmental Protection Act, as applicable.
                 The main New River Improvement Project components ( e. g. trash screen,
                 river encasement,     and  natural  treatment wetlands)   have evolved from
                 sanitation concepts most recently advanced by the City of Calexico, the
                 City of Calexico New River Committee and the Citizens Congressional
                 Task Force on the New River. The New River Improvement Project
                    Project") is envisioned to be developed and implemented in six phases,
                 as generally described below:
                 Phase 1â€”    Project Development and Planning: This phase provides a road
                 map to complete the Project in a reasonable and environmentally sound
                 manner. Its major components are preliminary site assessments ( e. g.,
                 hydro- geological investigations and surveying/mapping) and preparation
                 of supporting environmental studies required under NEPA and CEQA;
                 engineering plans and specifications; and Project permits.
                 Phase 2( Option 1) â€”       Project Headworks:     This phase consists of the
                 construction of and installation of headworks for the proposed river
                 encasements. These will be constructed near the Border where the New
                 River enters the United States, and will protect the integrity of the box
                 culvert, as well as track hydraulic and baseline water quality conditions of
                 the river as it crosses the border.
                 Phase 2( Option 2) â€” Project Headworks and Disinfection Facilities:              In
                 addition to including items and features identified in Option 1, Option 2
                 would assist in ensuring that discharges of wastes from Mexico do not
                 violate USEPA approved Pathogen Total Maximum Daily Load ( TMDL)
                 for the New River, and it includes two other major components:

                              from International Drain flows prior to discharge to the New River.
                     Phase 3â€” Project Box Culvert: This is the main construction phase of the
                     Project, in which a double culvert ( i. e., two enclosed parallel canals)
                     would be constructed to contain and reroute the New River from the
                     International Boundary, through the developed areas of Calexico and to a
                    point immediately downstream of Highway 98.
                     Phase 4â€”      Project Wastewater Polishing System: This phase includes
                    construction of a waste wastewater polishing system at the end of the box
                    culverts, just north of Highway 98, to provide treatment of residual
                    pollution from Mexico.
                    Phase 5â€” Project Wetlands:       This phase includes continued construction
                    of wetlands downstream from the improvements described in phase 4,
                    above, to address overall New River pollution.

                    Phase 6â€”      Project Community Greenbelts and Habitat Restoration: This
                    phase consists of the reclamation of open space for community facilities
                    such as walking and running trails and soccer/baseball field, and
                    preservation/ restoration of natural habitat in the area along the existing
                    river channel in the Calexico area and between Seeley and Brawley. Other
                    appropriate mitigation measures that are identified during Phase 1 of the
                    Project should be incorporated in this Phase.

                    CDFG in proximity to Calexico. However, there may be the existence of
1                   listed fish, amphibians, and reptiles in or around local freshwater habitats
                    created by irrigation and drainage canals. As well, as many as 10 protected
                    birds use the flyway corridors throughout the County.

                   One of the most striking and inextricable features that defnes the context
                   of the City of Calexico is the vast agricultural lands that surround it. Vistas
                   of  expansive,    flat, contiguous,    irrigated  cropland set against distant
                   mountains give the City an attractive and decidedly rural feel. These
                   aesthetic resources should be preserved in order for Calexico to retain a
                   significant portion of its character and sense of place.
  5.3 Establishing a Vision
u
                   The Vision for the conservation of natural resources and the preservation
                   and management of open space will allow for the balanced growth and
                   development of the City while protecting the fundamental resources that
                   represent the essence of the City and also enhance the quality of life for its
                   residents. The Conservation/ Open Space Element is responsive to the
                   City' s Vision because it:
                       a.     Protects   the  resources that future generations         will need to
                              prosper; both in terms of life quality and economic issues.
                       b.     Conserves of the area' s natural resources allows the City to
                              retain its character and heritage.
1                      c.     Enhances the overall quality of the City and therefore increases
                              the City' s desirability as a place to invest, possibly strengthening
                              the local economy.
                       a.     Ensures that development is conducted in an orderly manner that
                              recognizes the intrinsic value of natural resources and open
                              spaces.
                       e.     The preserved open spaces could become a source of community
                              pride.
                       f.     Contributes to the overall balance of land uses within our
                              community.
1                      g      Demonstrates the City' s commitment towards preserving its
                              resources.

5.4. 1 Conservation Goal
                 To balance development with the preservation and management of natural
                 and    human- built   open  space  resources,  thus ensuring the long-term
                 viability of the City.
5.4. 1. 1 Water Supply and Qvality
Objective 1
                 Water supply and water quality should be maintained by implementing
                 domestic conservation measures and protecting surface waters.
Policy 1
                     a.    All residential developments shall require low-volume toilets,
                           showers, and faucets.
                           New development projects should install water-conserving
                           appliances ( washing machines, dishwashers).
                     c.    The City shall continue to require the use of primarily drought-
                           tolerant and/ or native plants in new development through the
                           review and approval process by City staff. The use of turf grass
                           for lawns should be limited.
                     d.    Residential projects having common green areas and all
                           commercial, manufacturing, and public projects shall be required
                           to   install  automatic  irrigation  systems.         New commercial,
                           industrial, and housing projects that contain common green belts
                           should use reclaimed " grey" water for irrigation.
                     e.    Promote water conservation, reduce urban runoff, and prevent
                           groundwater      contamination     within     development      projects,
                           property maintenance, City operations, and all other related
                           activities requiring City discretionary approval.
                     f.    Adopt and enforce regulations and engage in educational efforts
                           to eliminate pollution from runoff.
                     g     Participate in any pertinent local, regional, state, and federal
                           programs to protect and enhance water quality.
                     h.    Support efforts to improve the water quality of the New River or
                           other proposals aimed at improving the area surrounding the
                           River,    such as the development and           implementation of an
                           integrated regional water quality management plan that meets
                           the goals and objectives of the Colorado River Basin Regional
                           Water Quality Control Board ( Region 7) for the New River.

                                 usage in residences shall be examined and initiated, if feasible.
                          k.    New residential construction shall be preplumbed for reclaimed
1                                water through a dual on- site distribution system. Anticipated
                                 non-potable uses include landscaping, lawn maintenance and
                                 crop   irrigation.  All  reclaimed      water       systems      will    be    in
1                                compliance with the State of California Regional Water Quality
                                board guidelines and basin objectives as well as CEQA and
                                NEPA guidelines.
                                Residential units connected to the community sewage collection
                                 system shall not use salt- based water softeners.
II   5.4. 1. 2 Soil Management
    Objective 2
                     The City shall continue using soil management techniques that minimize
                     soil related problems, including erosion, shrink- swell behavior, and septic
                     tank failure.
    Policy 2
                              In order to reduce or eliminate soil erosion and pollution, the City
1                             shall ensure that construction activity is in compliance with the
                              State' s General Permit for Construction Activities administered by
                             the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, located in
                              Palm Desert ( Region 7).        One condition of this permit is the
                              development and implementation of a site- specific Storm Water
                              Pollution     Prevention   Plan ("    SWPPP")         that    identifies      Best
  J                           Management Practices (" BMPs") to reduce/ eliminate erosion and
                              sedimentation associated with construction.
1                     b.     All development requiring City discretionary approval shall
                             provide a geotechnical investigation by a registered geotechnical
                              engineer     that  discusses,    at   least,    liquefaction,         subsidence,
                              shrink/ swell potential, soil strength, landslide potential, distance to
                             known     fault rupture zones. All geotechnical               studies      shall be
                              submitted to the City of Calexico Building and Safety Department
                              for review and approval.
                     c.       Soils with moderate or high permeability capacity should be left in
                             undeveloped ( perhaps used as open space where appropriate) to
1                            reduce runoff and facilitate groundwater recharge.
                     d.      Agricultural areas should not be disturbed to the extent that erosion
                             will    occur without the      initiation of proper          soil    management
                             measures.

                     c.      Projects of one acre or mare involving alteration or development of
t                            undisturbed land shall be required to submit a biological survey
                             conducted by a qualified biologist to the City of Calexico. A
                             focused biological study may be required if habitat that could
                             potentially support a listed or threatened species exists on the site.
   5.4. l. 4 Landform Features and Scenic Resources
u
   Objective 4
                     The rural character and scenic features provided by local agricultural
                    juxtaposed with the natural desert environment should be preserved in and
                     around the City.
   Policy 4
                      a.     In the development of the outlying land use in Calexico provisions
                             shall    be made  in the development plans             for large   lot rural
                             residential housing.
                     b.      Development on the outlying areas of the City shall occur in an
1                            orderly and contiguous manner in order to preserve the urban/ rural
                             edge.
                     c.      Encourage high-quality architectural and landscaping designs that
                             complement the City' s visual character.
   5.4.2 Open Space Goal
                     To identify, acquire, and preserve new open space opportunities while
                     adequately maintaining those that currently exist in and around the City.
1                    The preservation of open space will be in accordance with the need to
                     conserve signifcant resources of public interest and benefit.

  5.4. 2. 1 Land Use
  Objective 5
                   The City should act to preserve open space through land use policies that
                   value the importance of open space to the overall betterment of the City.
  Policy 5
                   a.       Noncontiguous or " leapfrog" development should be discouraged
                            to retain open space at the urban edge.
1                  b.       Every land use change should consider the City' s need to preserve
                            open space.
                   c.       Where    possible,      encourage infill development as a means to
                            preserve outlying open space and to conserve resources.
  5.4. 2. 2 Agricultural Land
1 Objective 6
                   The preservation of agricultural lands as community open space has many
                   inherent benefits such as those related to economics, aesthetic beauty, and
                   maintenance of the City' s rural character. The City recognizes that need
                   and shall therefore act to preserve agricultural land wherever possible and
                   minimize conflicts between agricultural and residential land uses.
  Policy 6
                   a.      The     City should preserve Prime Farmland by focusing
                           development on land with lesser- quality soils and maintaining a
                           compact urban form. ( See Figure C/ OS- 1.)             Land designations used
                           on the following map are as follows:
                           P= Prime Farmland: Land with the best combination ofphysical and chemical
                          features to sustain long-term agricultural production.
                           S=   Farmland of Statewide Importance: Similar to Prime except with minor
                           shortcomings such as slopes or less ability to store soil moisture.
                           L= Farmland o Local Importance: Land deemed to be of importance to the
                           local economy by the County Board ofSupervisors.
                          X= Other Land: Land that does not meet the criteria for any other category.
                           Typically includes low- density rural development, heavily forested land, mined
                           land, or government land with use restrictions.
                           D=   Urban or Built Up Land: Land occupied by structures by a density of at
                           least 1 unit per 1. S acres.
                   L.^     Encourage       the    use   of  Williamson       Act     contracts   on   active
                           agricultural lands within the City' s sphere of influence.
                   c.      Minimize the conflicts between agricultural and residential land
                           uses by requiring the use of buffer zones, roads, and other physical
                           boundaries between uses.

                                                                 t i   i:. =    r;' Â°. t   x  e: c;
                 d.      Support public relations and educational workshops between the
                         agricultural industry and non- agricultural businesses, developers,
                         and residents.
                 e.
                         The City should consider adopting a right-to- farm ordinance or the
                         use of other regulatory tools such as zoning or subdivision review
                        to reduce agriculture and non- agriculture land use conflicts.
                 f.     The City should work with the County of Imperial and other
                         surrounding cities, as well as state and local agricultural entities to

  6. 0 PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
  6. 1 Introduction
                   Parks and Recreational facilities are key elements of every urban
                   environment.    However, the state of California does not require the
                   inclusion of a Parks and Recreation Element in its list of required General
                   Plan components. The City of Calexico recognizes the importance of
                   parks and is committed to maintaining and improving its parks system and
                   therefore has chosen to include this Element in its General Plan.
                   Historically, parks have been passive areas of greenery that have provided
                   refuge from the concrete environment of urban living by offering
                   amenities such as large grassy areas, trees, and ponds. In more recent
                   history, many cities have taken a decided turn away from providing
                   passive parks to providing those that facilitate active recreation. Active
                   recreation   requires  additional  park  facilities  such   as  soccer  fields,
                   swimming pools, playground equipment, softball fields, and tennis courts.
                   Now, however, many cities have come to realize that an appropriate
                   balance should be sought between active and passive parks. The informal
                   nature of passive parks allows for impromptu activities such as Frisbee or
                   kite   flying.  Achieving    balance   between     park   types  requires    an
                   understanding of the needs of local residents.
                   As more and more land is developed and economic resources become
                   increasingly constricted, land acquisition for new parks and the
                   maintenance thereof has become a challenge for many communities. Yet,
                   parks represent an important resource in Calexicoâ€” they are sources of
                   aesthetic beauty and respite from urban living, they are community
                   activity, family recreation, and youth sports centers, and ultimately, a
                   source of civic pride.

                   The City of Calexico benefits from numerous regional recreational
                   facilities. To the east, northeast of the City is the Imperial Sand Dunes
                   Recreation Area, encompassing approximately 40 miles of dunes that
                   reach up to 300 feet high. There are various off-road vehicle recreation
                   opportunities associated with the dunes. To the west, northwest of the City
                   is Anza Borrego Desert State Park, the largest state park with over
                   600, 000 acres. Anza Borrego provides hiking, camping, backpacking, and
                   wildflower viewing. In addition, there are numerous other recreational
                   opportunities outside of the City limits but in proximity, including
                   Crucifixion Thorns Natural Area, Coyote Mountains Wilderness, Fish
                   Creek Mountain Wilderness, Ocotillo Well s State Vehicular Recreation
                   Area, the Colorado River, and many others.
J 6. 2. 2 Citywide Parks
                   As of 2004, the City has 22 parks totaling more than 60 acres. Figure P- 1
                   shows the locations of existing parks within the City and future areas
                   within the SOI where parks should be located. Table P- A list the existing
                   parks, their individual acreage, and selected facilities. Parks are typically
                   categorized by their size and service area which is discussed later in this
                   document. The City has numerous smaller parks that, according to the
                   City park classification ( found in Policy lf of this element), would not
                   qualify as either Neighborhood or Community Parks. The City has voiced
                   its need for a central community park to serve as a focal point of the City
                   and provide various recreational facilities such as a swimming pool,
                   soccer fields, and recreation center.

6. 3 Establishing a Vision
                  The Vision for community parks and recreation will ensure their adequate
                  development in a way that reflects the needs of the residents of the City.
                  The Parks and Recreation Element is responsive to the City' s Vision
                  because it:
                  a.     Seeks to create adequate park facilities and recreational services

     6. 4 Goal, Objectives, and Policies
     6. 4. 1 Goal
                       To provide continued investment in existing parks while creating high-
                       quality new facilities that satisfy the underserved and future needs of the
                      community. Park planning will be flexible in nature and therefore be
                      responsive to demographic or other social changes, thus ensuring a high-
                      quality, long-term viable park system.
     6. 4. 1. 1 Facility Types
     Objective 1
                      To provide a variety of parks facilities and recreational services that
1                     satisfies the diverse interests and needs of the community.
     Policy 1
                      a.     Develop a system of parks and recreational facilities that are
                             sensitive to the needs of seniors, children, families, active adults,
                             teenagers, and persons with disabilities.
                      b.     Give similar attention to passive or individual uses ( such as walking,
                             biking, and skating) as is given to formal recreation or sports groups.
                      c.     Offer equal levels of park service to all areas of the community.
                      d.     The City should annually review its parks and recreation facilities
                             and programs and update them accordingly as user needs and
                             preferences change.
                      e.     The City should annually review its parks and recreation facilities

                                                                             C F       rS Â°:       r;;-    Ft
                     f.   The City shall allow the use of private parks and recreational
                          facilities to satisfy development park requirements. Private parks
                          should be created and maintained through Community Facilities
                          Districts (" CFD")         or Homeowner' s Association (" HOA").              Uses
                          include, but are not limited to, golf courses, tennis facilities, and
 CJ                       sport courts.
                     g.   The City should add a Commercial Recreation designation to its
                          zoning code which would allow for the development of private
                          recreational      facilities  that are operated  for    profit     through     the
                          collection of user fees.
l                    h.   The City should develop a minimum 20 acre community park,
                          preferably in the center of the City, to meet the current needs. An
                          additional community park shall be developed to serve Calexico' s
                          growing population within the next 10 years.
                     h.   Establish the following park classifications within the City:
                                 Pocket Park. Pocket parks are less than 2 acres in size and are
                                 not necessarily intended to be used for active recreational
                                 activities beyond children' s play equipment. Pocket parks may
                                 be used for, but not limited to, land use buffers, picnic and
                                 sitting areas, and playgrounds.
                                 Neighborhood Park. Neighborhood parks shall be 5- 10 acres
                                 in size. Neighborhood parks serve residents within a% z to 1-
                                 mile radius and the characteristics thereof shall be examined to
                                 determine the proper facilities for each park. Wherever
  1                              possible, neighborhood parks should be tocated at the center of
                                 the residential area that they serve. Standard facility provisions
                                 are as follows in Table P- B:

                                 Community Park. Community parks shall be between 20 and
                                 50 acres in size and serve a population of about 20, 000. This
                                 park type serves several neighborhoods within a 2- mile radius.
                                 Community parks can be simultaneously passive and active

                                recreation areas because of their larger size. Community parks
                                 require adequate parking facilities and should be located at
                                 roughly the center of the target area served.
   6.4. 1. 2 Facility Design and Location
   Objective 2
                    Create high-quality, fully functional, demand- responsive parks that serve
                    the needs of the public in accordance with specific design standards.
                    Parklands and recreational facilities should be compatible with adjacent
                    iand uses.
II
   Policy 2
                    a.    The City shall develop a community park of at least 20 acres that
                          includes such facilities as, but not limited to: lighted playing fields, a
                          swimming      pool,  a  multi- purpose   or  specific- use    trail      system
                         throughout the park, and a passive recreation area.
                    b.    The community park shall be the site of community- wide athletic
                          events and community activities. As such, it should be located, if
                         possible, near the center of the City.
                    c     Wherever possible, community parks should be located near public
                         transportation.
                     l   Incorporate wherever possible or appropriate, public art or historical
                         themes into park design.
                    e.   Design new parks and improve existing ones, where possible, to
                         prevent certain activities such as outdoor facilities, parking areas,
                         nighttime lighting, and other elements from negatively impacting
                         adjacent land uses.
                    f.   Allow no more than 50% of the total parkland requirements of new
                         developments to be met by land used for retention basin purposes.
                    gâ€¢   Require all retention basins to be landscaped.
                    h.   Each park classification type shall adhere to the following design
                         standards:
                                All Parks. All parks should be landscaped with drought-
                                tolerant plant materials in an effort to conserve water. In
                                addition, automatic irrigation systems        should be used and
                                provisions made for adequate drainage. All sidewalks shall be
                                constructed   of concrete   or  rubberized    materials.        Biking or
t                               multi- purpose trails are encouraged and may be constructed
                                with materials such      as decomposed      granite or other soil-
                                stabilized material ( see City of Calexico Bicycle Master Plan,
                                2003). As much as possible, parks should be barrier- free to the
                                physicalIy disabled.

                              Pocket Park. Due to the wide variation              in size and the
                              propensity for pocket parks to be located in irregular and
                              difficult parcels, design standards for pocket parks are limited
                              to those listed above for " All Parks".
1                             Neighborhood Park. Neighborhood parks should be                  5- 10
                              acres in size; no less than 5 acres if adjacent to a school, and at
                              least 10 acres otherwise. They shall have restroom facilities
                              and have at least one designated grassy area measuring, at
                              minimum, two acres in size. Neighborhood parks should not be
                              divided by any natural or human- made barriers. They shall
                              include adequate on- and off-street parking and shall include at
                              some or all of the following recreational facilities, as
                              appropriate: tennis court, picnic areas, children' s play area,
                              trails, basketball courts, hand- ball courts or other active
                              recreation facilities. The Planning Commission shall review all
                              proposed improvements to determine if said improvements
                              meet the needs of the neighborhood upon recommendation by
                              the Parks and Recreation Commission.
                              Community Park. Community parks should have at least 20
                              useable acres, and serve 20, 000 people in approximately a two-
                              mile radius. Off-street parking must be provided at community
                              parks and close proximity to public transportation is strongly
                              sought. Locating community parks adjacent to school facilities
                              could help satisfy parking requirements as well as offer shared
                              use of certain facilities such as gym and swimming pools.
                              Community parks shall include developed playing fields,
                              picnic areas, and a system of hiking trails and bicycle paths,
                              and include other recreational facilities such as swimming
                              pools and those found in 1 leighborhood Parks. The number and
                              types of facilities located at each community park shall be
                              subject to review and approval by the City Council upon
                              recommendation by the Parks and Recreation Commission and
                              the Planning Commission.
                                                                                                   6-$

   6. 4. 1. 3 Financing
   Objective 3
                     The City should maintain and expand the current parks and recreation
                     system by implementing financing strategies.
   Policy 3
1                     a.  The City shall continue the implementation of the Quimby Act
                             Government Code 66477, City Ordinance 953) which allows the
                          City to reyuire the dedication of land ( 3 acres of park area for each
                           1, 000 subdivision residents) or cash in- lieu fees ( or a combination of
                          both) as a condition of residential development approval.
C                     b.  The City should acquire new parkland through the capital budget
                          process, the scheduling of the Quimby Act funds, and grants.
                    c.    Consider using eminent domain to acquire additional parkland in
                          instances of greatest need, such as creating a community park in the
                          center of the City.
                    d.    The City should explore increasing parks and recreational facilities
                          through the upgrade of existing open space or the conversion of
                          other public or quasi- public lands, such as utility right-of-ways and
                          the designated open space lands along the New River upon
1                         successful implementation and cleanup of the New River via the

     7. 0        NOISE ELEMENT
     7. 1    Introd uction
                          The environment is full of both natural and man- made noises. Noise must be
                         regulated for the health and safety of residents.                          Unacceptable noise       is
                         principally caused by the operation of vehicles (                          ground   and  air),   and
                         agricultural and industrial production. In Calexico, vehicular traffic movement
                         on the City' s road system is the predominant cause of high noise levels in the
                          City.
                         The Noise Element is closely related to other elements of the General Plan,
                         particularly the Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Parks and Recreation and
                          Open     Space       Elements.        A    major objective        of the Noise Element is         to
                         encourage noise- compatible                  land    uses.    Effective land use planning can
                         alleviate both perceived and real noise problems.
1
          7.2      Noise Rating System and Terminology
                         The unit of ineasurement used to describe a noise level is the decibel ( dB).
                         The human ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies within the sound
                          spectrum.       Therefore,       the " A-weighted"            noise  scale,  which   weights    the
l. J                     frequencies to which humans are sensitive, is used for measurements. Noise
                          levels using A-weighted measurements are written dB(A) or dB. Decibels are
                         measured on a logarithmic scale, which quantifies sound intensity in a manner
                          similar to the Richter scale used for earthquake magnitudes. Thus, a doubling
                         of the energy of a noise source, such as doubling a traffic volume, would
                          increase the noise level by 3 dB; a halving of the energy would result in a 3
                         dB    decrease.        A    10 dB increase represents a               10- fold increase in sound
                          intensity, a 20 dB change is a 100- fold difference, 30 dB is a 1000- fold
                          increase, etc.
                         Average noise levels over a period of minutes or hours are usually expressed
                         as dB Leq, or the equivalent noise level for that period of time. For example,
                         Leq 3 would represent a three hour average. When no period is specified, a
                         one- hour average is assumed. Noise standards for land use compatibility are
                          stated in terms of the Community Noise Equivalent Level ( CNEL) and the
                         Day-Night Average Noise Level ( Ldn). CNEL is a 24- hour weighted average
                         measure of community noise. The computation of CNEL adds 5 dB to the
                         average hourly noise levels between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. ( evening hours), and
                          10 dB to the average hourly noise levels between 10 p. m. and 7: 00 a.m.
                           nighttime hours). This weighting accounts for the increased human sensitivity
                         to noise in the evening and nighttime hours. Ldâ€ž is a very similar 24- hour
                         weighted average, which weights only the nighttime hours and not the evening

                     hours. CNEL is normally about 1 dB higher than Laâ€ž for typical traffic and
                     other community noise levels.
  7. 3     Harmful Effecfs of Noise
                    According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication
                     Disorders (" NIDCD"), approximately 28 million people in the United States
                    currently have some degree of hearing loss, a third of which is noise- induced.
                     In many of these cases, exposures to very loud, impulsive, or sustained noises
                    caused damage to the inner ear which was substantial even before a hearing
                    loss was actually noticed. To prevent the spread of hearing loss, a desirable
                    goal would be to minimize the number of noise sources which expose people
                    to sound levels above 70 decibels. However, hearing impairment is only one
                    of the harmful effects of noise on people.
                    Noise can also cause other temporary physical and / psychological responses in
                    humans. Temporary physical reactions to passing noises range from a startle
                    reflex to constriction in the peripheral blood vessels, the secretion of saliva
                    and gastric juices; and changes in heart rate, breathing patterns, the chemical
                    composition of the blood and urine, the dilation of the pupils of the eye, visual
                    acuity and equilibrium. The chronic recurrence of these physical reactions has
                    been shown to aggravate headaches, fatigue, digestive disorders, heart disease,
                    and circulatory and equilibrium disorders. Moreover, as a source of stress,
I
                    noise is a contributory factor in stress- related ailments such as ulcers, high
                    blood pressure, and anxiety.
                    Two other harmful effects of noise which are commonly of concern involve
                    speech interference and the prevention or interruption of sleep. Table N-A
                    identifies how excessive background noises can reduce the amount and quality
                    of   verbal    exchange    and thereby impact education, family lifestyles,
                    occupational efficiency and the quality of recreation and leisure time. As
                    shown on Table N- A, speech interference begins to occur at about 50 decibels
                    and becomes severe at about 60 decibels. Background noise levels affect
                    performance and learning processes through distraction,                       annoyance      and
                    irritability, and the inability to concentrate.
                    Several factors determine whether or not a particular noise event will interfere
                    with or prevent sleep. These factors include the noise level and characteristics,
                    the stage of sleep, the individual' s age, and the motivation to waken. I11 or
                    elderly people are particularly susceptible to noise- induced sleep interference,
                    which can occur when intruding noise levels exceed the typical 35- 45 decibel
                    background noise level in bedrooms. Sleep prevention can occur when
                    intruding noise levels exceed 50 dBA.

Cl 7. 4   Land Use Compafibility with Noise
                    Some land uses are more tolerant of noise than others. For example, schools,
                    hospitals, churches, and residences are more sensitive to noise intrusion than
                    commercial       or    manufacturing       activities.  For    this   reason,  land     use
                    compatibility with the noise environment is an important consideration in the
                    planning and design of new developments. As ambient noise levels affect the
                    perceived amenity or livability of a development, so too can the
                    mismanagement of noise impacts impair the economic health and growth of a
                    community by reducing the area's desirability as a place to live, shop, and
                    work.
                    The City of Calexico must make a determination regarding how much noise is
                    too    much.    Figure     N- 1  illustrates   guidelines   for    noise   and  land    use
                    compatibility as generated by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban
                    Development and the California State Office of Noise Control. Figure N-2
                    illustrates the federal exterior noise acceptability criteria for housing. These
                    guidelines are used by local governing agencies to set noise standards.

      The noise exposure may be of some concern but common building construction will make
      the indoor environment acceptable and the outdoor environment will be reasonably
      pleasant for recreation and play.
      NORMALLY ACCEPTABLE
      The noise exposure is significantly more severe; barriers may be necessary between the
      site and prominent noise sources to make the outdoor environment acceptable; special
      building constructions may be necessary to ensure that people indoors are sufficiently
      protected from outdoor noise.
IUNACCEPTABLE
      The noise exposure at the site is so severe that the construction cost to make the indoor
      noise environment acceptable may be prohibitive and the outdoor environment still be
      unacceptable.

                     The Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA)                                  has developed a series of
                     maximum design noise levels for various activity categories which are
                     expressed in terms of Leq and L o values ( L o refers to noise levels that are
                     exceeded ten percent of the time). The FHWA design noise levels represent
                     maximum values and incorporate trade- offs between desirable and feasible
                     noise levels. These design levels appear in Table N- B and are to be applied to:
                                Those undeveloped lands for which development is planned, designed,
                                and programmed on the date of public knowledge of the highway or
                                other federally funded construction project.

  7.5. 2 State Noise Standards
                    Section 1092 of Title 25 of the California Administrative Code includes sound
                   transmission control standards which detail specific requirements for new
                   multi- family structures (    motels,   apartments,   condominiums,     and    other
                   attached dwellings) located within the 60 CNEL contour adjacent to roads,
                   rapid transit lines, or manufacturing areas. An acoustical analysis is required
                   showing that the multi- family units have been designed to limit interior noise
                   levels ( with doors and windows closed) to 45 CNEL in any habitable room.
                   Title 21   of the California Administrative Code ( Subchapter 6, Article 2,
                   Section 5014) also specifies that multi- family, attached units incorporate noise
1                  reduction features sufficient to assure that interior noise levels in all habitable
                   rooms do not exceed 45 CNEL.
                   Section 6502( fl of the Government Code specifies that it is the responsibility
                   of the City of Calexico to specify the manner in which the Noise Element,
                   once adopted, also becomes the guideline for determining compliance with the
                   State noise insulation standards discussed above. The Office of Noise Control
                   established by the California Noise Control Act of 1973, has developed
                   criteria and guidelines for local agencies to use in setting standards for human
                   exposure to noise and preparing noise elements.
                   An interior CNEL of 45 dB is mandated by the State of California Noise
                   Insulation Standards ( CCR, Title 24, Part 6, Section T25- 28) for multiple-
                   family dwellings, dormitories, long-term care facilities, apartments, and hotel
                   and motel rooms. A 45 dB CNEL is also typically considered a desirable noise
                   exposure for single- family dwelling units. Since normal noise attenuation
                   within residential structures with closed windows is about 20- 25 dB, an
                   exterior noise exposure of 65 dB CNEL will result in an interior noise level of
                   40 to 45 dB CNEL and therefore, is generally the noise land use compatibility
                   guideline for noise sensitive receiver sites in California.
                   Since commercial and industrial activities are generally conducted indoors,
                   the exterior noise exposure standard for such less sensitive land uses is less
                   stringent.
  7. 6   Existing Noise Conditions
                   As a requisite to the formation of an effective noise control program, the City
                   must be cognizant of the location and extent of local noise problems, namely
                   major noise source locations, the number of persons exposed, and what levels
                   of exposure exist.
                   The two types of noise sources that should be considered are stationary and
                   mobile sources. Stationary sources of noise typically include manufacturing
                   and construction activities, air conditioning/ refrigeration units, whistles or
                   bells, high- level radio, stereo or television usage, power tools, lawnmowers,
                   home appliances,     and barking dogs. Mobile noise sources are typically

                      transportation- related and  include:  trains,  airpianes,  automobiles,  trucks,
                      buses,   motorcycles,   and   off-road   vehicles   for  both  recreational   and
                      agricultural use.
   7.6. 1     Mobrle Noise Sources
                      Motor vehicles on area roadways are the major source of continuous noise in
                      and around the City. As a result, they affect the noise environment of both the
                      existing and planned land uses adjacent to the said circulation system.
                      Traffic noise is generated by tire friction on the roadway surface, as well as
                      noise from the vehicle engines and exhaust. Generally, higher noise levels
                      result from higher traffic volumes and higher traffic speeds. The mix of
                      vehicles using the roadway also affects noise levels. For example, a truck
                      route would have higher noise levels compared to another street where truck
                      traffic was prohibited.
                      The Federal Highway Administration ("        FHWA")     has developed a noise
                      prediction model ( FHWA- RD- 77- 108) to estimate the noise levels generated
                      by roadways. This model was used to estimate the current noise impacts from
                      roadways in the City of Calexico and the results are contained in Tables N- C
                      and N- D. For example, in Table N- C, SR I 11 between Heber Road and Jasper
                      Road has a noise level of 71. 9 dBA at 50 feet from the roadway centerline.
                      From the centerline of said roadway to the point where the noise level is 65
                      dBA ( the maximum allowable outdoor noise level for all residential uses in
                      the City of Calexico according to Policy 1( a) below) , the distance is 246 feet.
                      Any distance greater than 246 feet from roadway centerline ( on this road
                      segment) has a noise level less than 65 dBA.

   7.6. 2  Other Noise Sources
                  Southern Pacific Railroad Company
                  The railroad is significant in its contribution to the nuisance noise level.
                  Increased rail traffic volumes which have led to additional truck traffic have
1                 made the railroad and its vicinity much noisier than in the past. Noise from the
                 trains using the railroad tracks depends on the number of locomotives per train,
                 the number of cars per train, and the speed of the train. For example, the hourly
                  Leq at a distance of 50 feet from the tracks resulting from 5 trains ( each train
                 with 3 locomotives and 100 rail cars traveling at 30 miles per hour) passing
                 through a certain area would be approximately 72. 7 dBA. If train activity
r                 continues at this pace throughout the day and night, the noise levels could be as
                 high as 79. 4 dBA CNEL. Therefore, this mode of transportation has an impact
                 on the noise levels in the City and must be taken into consideration in land use
                 planning. In terms of land use, the railroad is a significant part of the urban
                 fabric in Calexico. It is also an important part of the industrial, commercial and
                 agricultural economic base of the community.
                  Calexico International Aitport
                 The Calexico International Airport is located west of the City on Anza Road,
                 adjacent to the international border. The nearest residential area to the airport is
                 no closer than 2400 feet. The airport offers its services 365 days a year, and has
                 a monthly average of 1226 arrivals and departures. Five percent of these
                 operations are performed during the hours between 5 pm and 7 am. The type
                 and weight of aircraft that is able to use the airport facilities is limited by its
                 4679- foot runway which runs east- west, away from the residential areas,
                 towards the open agricultural areas to the west. Figure N- 3 shows the noise
                 contours for the Calexico International Airport. Note that the noise contours
                 presented herein are conservative and are based on future 60, 000 annual
                 operations; the Calexico International Airport Master Plan forecasts 27, 200
                                           20202.
                 annual operations by
                 International Border Traffic
                 The City of Calexico is known as the gateway to Mexico. The international
                 border is located in downtown Calexico, not more than half a block from most
                 of downtown' s commercial establishments. State Highway 111 runs north- south,
                 from the border to northern Imperial County. This highway is the principal route
                 for all vehicles traveling to or from Mexico via Mexicali. The traffic on SH 111
                 is continuous throughout the day and into the night. Therefore, limiting the
                 development along the route to land uses that are compatible with a higher noise
                 exposure is necessary.

  7. 7   Future Noise Conditions and Design Considerations
I
                   Growth in and near the City of Calexico will generate increased traffic
                   volumes. As traffic levels rise, existing residences wiil be exposed to higher
                   noise levels. Doubling the traffic volume will increase the need for controlling
                   the noise source whenever feasible and protecting the noise receptors when
                   noise source control measures are inadequate.
                   Table N- E and Table N- F provides an estimate of where the 65 and 70 dBA
                   noise level contour lines occur relative to the roadway centerline. The data
                   contained in these tables can be used as a quick reference to decide if future
                   projects will have the potential to expose sensitive receptors to unacceptable
                   outdoor noise levels without mitigation.
                   Acoustic architectural design involves the incorporation of noise reducing
                   strategies in the design and layout of individual structures. Building heights,
                   room arrangements, window size and placement, balcony and courtyard
                   design, and the provision of air conditioning all play an important role in
                   shielding noise sensitive activities from intrusive noise levels.

                        Acoustic construction is the treatment of various parts of a building to reduce
                        interior noise levels. Acoustic wall design, doors, ceilings and floors, as well
                        as dense building materials, the use of acoustic windows ( double glazed,
                        double paned, thick, unopenable,                 or   small    with    air-tight   seals)    and    the
                        inclusion of maximum air spaces in attics and walls are all available options.
                        Site planning can also address noise concerns through setbacks, front yards
                        facing streets, and courtyard housing arrangements.
                        Noise barriers are relatively easy to design and are inexpensive. Consequently,
                        they are often used indiscriminately in place of the techniyues discussed
                        above. For example, developments where each road is bordered by six-foot
                        block walts behind which residences are "                  protected"      from excessive noise
                        levels tends to become unsightly and reduces the open, more rural feel that
                        Calexico has had throughout its history. Ideally, noise barriers incorporate the
                        placement of berms, walls, or a combination of the two in conjunction with
                        appropriate landscaping to create an aesthetically pleasing environment.
                        Where space is available, a meandering earth berm is both effective and
                        pleasing. Where space is restricted, a wall is effective. In either case, however,
                        thick landscaping ( utilizing evergreen plants) should be specified to reduce the
                        visual impact of the barrier and retain the rural ambience.
   7.8      Goal, Objectives and Policies
   7.8. l     Goal
                        Maintain the quiet rurat residential nature of the community through the use
                        of sensitive land use practices and appropriate noise mitigation measures.
   7. 8. 1. 1    Acceptable Noise Levels
   Objective 1
                        The City should establish adverse noise levels for various noise- sensitive
                        uses.

                        a.       65 dBA CNEL is established as the acceptable outdoor noise exposure
                                 level for all private residential areas such as backyards.
                        b.       Indoor noise levels shall not exceed 45 dBA CNEL for single- and
                                 multiple- family dwellings,            dormitories,        hospitals,   nursing homes,
                                 apartments, and hotel and motel rooms.

                              nursing homes, parks, and recreation areas.
                              70 dBA CNEL is established as the acceptable outdoor noise exposure
                              level for office buildings, business, commercial, professional, and
                              mixed- use developments.
                      e.      75 dBA CNEL is established as the acceptable outdoor noise exposure
l _l                          level for golf courses, riding stables, water recreation, cemeteries,
                              industrial, manufacturing, utilities, and agriculture.
     7.8. 1. 2  Land Use Compatibility
     Objective 2
                      Land use distribution should account for the noise characteristics of basic uses.
     Policy 2
                      a.      The location and distribution of land uses throughout the City should
                              take into account the compatibility of the different uses and their
                              respective noise levels.
                      b.      The review of development applications shall consider the impact of
                              the use on the noise environment of existing or planned contiguous
                              uses.
                      c.      Where necessary because of incompatibilities, noise attenuation
                              measures shall be required by the City to achieve the acceptable noise
                              exposure levels.
     7. 8. 1. 3 Circulation Compatibility
     Objective 3
  J                   Noise levels generated by arterial and larger classification roadways
                      should be considered when planning improvements to the circulation
                      system.
     Policy 3
                      a.      The potential for increasing the general noise level shall be considered
                              when planning improvernents to the City's circulation system.
                      b.      In the event that it is determined that increased noise levels will result
                              from an improvement to the circulation system, mitigation measures
                              shall be required which reduce the noise levels to those determined
                              acceptable.
                      c.      Traffic speeds shall be regularly monitored to determine the feasibility
                              of lowering the speeds and thus lower the traffic noise generated.
     City of Calexico General Plan                                                            7- 17
                  d.       The City should examine areas where truck traffic should be restricted
                           in residential areas to reduce adverse noise and vibration levels. ( See
                           Circulation Element.)
  7. 8. 1. 4 Requirement for Project Speci c Noise Studies
1
  Objective 4
                  Noise studies shall be required for certain projects which have the
                  potential to increase ambient noise levels or the potential to expose
                  sensitive receptors to unacceptable noise levels.
  Policy 4
                  a.
                          A noise study shall be required for all projects which will be in
                          violation of Policy 1. Tables N- E and N-F will be used as screening
                          tables to determine the estimated outdoor noise levels and if the
                          project is in violation of Policy 1.
                  L:      A noise study shall be required for all projects within 700 feet of
                          railroad tracks ( 350 feet, if there are intervening buildings). In
                          addition, a vibrational analysis should also be required of residential
                          projects within 200 feet of railroad tracks and any projects within 120
                          feet of railroad tracks.
                  c.      A noise study shall be required for all projects proposing to locate
                          commercial or industrial land uses adjacent to residential land uses ( or
                          vice versa) in order to determine the noise impacts to residents.
  7.8. 1. 5  Noise Aftenuation Measures
  Objective 5
                  Noise attenuation measures shall be required to reduce noise levels to an
                  acceptable level.
  Policy 5
                  a.      Where feasible, setbacks should be used to mitigate adverse noise
                          conditions, to ensure an acceptable noise exposure level.
                  b.      Parcels affected by adverse noise levels should be properly site
                          planned to reduce noise through the following measures:
                               Uses that are compatible with higher noise levels should be located
                               adjacent to noise generators to block noise from noise sensitive
                               uses.
                               Clustering of commercial, office, or multi-family uses can reduce
                               interior open space ( e. g., courtyard) noise levels.
  City f Caiexico Ger erai Plar                                                             7- 18
                  c.     Noise    barriers  and  berms    shall  be  required   where   other   noise
                         attenuation measures      fail to   reduce  the  adverse   levels,  or   will
                         significantly increase the costs of continuation of land improvements.
                  d.     Architectural    design  in  adverse noise    areas  should  shield   noise-
                         sensitive uses through:
                             Proper entrance and window location;
                             Proper patio and balcony location; building projections and
                             heights; and
                             Internal arrangement of rooms; and location of air conditioning
                             equipment.
                 e.      Construction techniques should consider the following methods of
                         noise reduction:
                             Acoustical wall design;
                             Use of dense building materials;
                             Use of acoustical windows ( double glazed, double paned, thick and
                             nonoperable windows); and
                             Use of noise- tight doors, ceilings, and floors.
7.8. 1. 6  Noise Ordinances
Objective 6
                 The City' s community noise Ordinance shall be consistent with the Policies in
                 the Noise Element.
Policy 6
                 The City shall update the community noise ordinance to reflect and implement
                 the Policies in the Noise Element.

   8. 0 SAFETY ELEMENT
   8. 1 Introduction
                    The primary purpose of the Safety Element is to identify and assess
                    natural and human- made safety hazards and then minimize their danger to
                    life and property. These hazards have a direct impact on the quality of life
                    and the well- being of residents of Calexico and include both natural and
                    human- induced causes. This element will examine the following public
                    health and safety concerns:
                         Geologic Hazards -    including earthquakes and their secondary hazards
1                        Flooding
                         Fire - both wild land and urban
                         Hazardous materials

                         Peak Load Water Supply
                         Emergency Access
                    The State of California requires the inclusion of a safety element for all
                    General Plans. The following language from California Government Code
                    65302 outlines the necessary topics that must be addressed:
                      A safety element for the protection of the community from any
                      unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically- induced
                      surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and
                      dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides;
                      subsidence and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body;
                     flooding; and wild land and urban fires. The safety element shall
                      include mapping of known seismic and other geologic hazards. It shall
                      also address evacuation routes, peak load water supply requirements
                      and minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those
                      items relate to identifiedfire and geologic hazards.
   8. 2 Existing Conditions/ Hazard Assessment
   8. 2. 1 Geologic
                    The City of Calexico is particularly susceptible to geologic hazards such
                    as earthquakes and the secondary hazards associated therewith. The
                    primary hazard from earthyuakes is significant because of the proximity of
                    major faults and the soil composition of the Imperial Valley.            The
                    secondary impacts are related to the extensive irrigation and drainage as
                    well as other consequences caused by earthquakes such as fires, ground
                    displacement, soil liyuefaction, and environmental contamination.

                   Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy stored in the
                   earth' s core. Essentially, rigid plates form a" shell" around the fluidic
                   layer below it. As these plates shift and grind against one another, energy
                   is released which is known as plate tectonics. It is the areas near the
                   boundaries or separations ( faults) in the plates that the majority of energy
                   is released.
                   The State of California is located on the San Andreas Fault which
                   represents a portion of the boundary between the North American Plate
                   and the Pacific Plate. The Imperial Valley is located in what is known as
                   the Salton Trough, bordered on the east by the San Andreas and Imperial
                   Faults, and to the west by the San Jacinto- Coyote Creek and Elsinore-
                   Laguna Salada Faults. The Salton Trough is one of the most seismically
                   active areas in the United States. Figure S- 1 shows the City' s location in
                   relation to the locations of known fault lines.
                   In the last one hundred years, there have been eleven earthquakes that
                   have measured at least magnitude 6. 0 on the Richter scale. In 1940, there
                   was a magnitude 7. 1 earthquake that occurred along the Imperial Fault that
                   killed 7 people, destroyed numerous structures, and caused major crop
                   damage from flooding; the International Canal was moved more than 14
                   feet off its course during that earthquake.

    8. 2. 1. 1 Surface Ruptures
1                     Surface ruptures usually occur on fault lines in the event of seismic
                     activity. However, they may occur anywhere within a fault zone. The
                      likelihood of surface ruptures are directly proportional to the magnitude of
CJ                   the earthquake and are caused by the upward fault displacement thrust
                     from the epicenter. Surface ruptures can cause tremendous damage to
                     anything located along its path. The ability to prevent major damage from
                     surface rupture depends on our knowledge of the existence of active faults.
                     California Public Resources Code has created special zones for areas close
                     to active faults called Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning which
                     enforces special building requirements for structures in these areas. The
                     City of Calexico is not located within an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault
                     Zone.
    8.2. 1. 2 Ground Shaking
                     As energy is released along a fault during an earthquake, a shockwave is
                     created that moves through the soil and rock away from the epicenter. This
                     release of energy causes the ground to shake. The severity of the shaking
                     depends on the strength of the earthquake, the distance from where the
                     shaking is felt relative to the epicenter, and the soil composition between
                     the epicenter and the receptor site. Ground shaking can cause damage
                     across vast distances. Calexico is most susceptible to earthquake damage
                     from ground shaking.
    8. 2. 1. 3 Ground Failure
t
                     Ground failure occurs from the shock of an earthquake and is almost
                     exclusively manifest in the form of a landslide. Landslides are caused by
                     the combination of gravity, poor geologic conditions, along with the
                     seismic event. Due to its flat topography, Calexico is not susceptible to
                     landslides.
    8. 2. 1. 4 Liquefaction
                     The soil composition of the Valley adds to the potential seismic risk.
                     Because the Valley' s soil is a result of a deep layer of silt, and it is
                     irrigated for agricultural purposes, it is particularly susceptible to
                     liquefaction. Liquefaction is the loss of stability or strength in certain soil
                     types as a result of a seismic event. Typically liquefaction occurs in
                     granular,   unconsolidated,   saturated soils  like those   deposited   in   the
                     Imperial Valley by the Colorado River. The City of Calexico and the
                     surrounding area is particularly susceptible to liquefaction because of crop
                     irrigation and the geologically young and unconsolidated sediment soil.
t                    Damage caused by liquefaction is the result of the ground becoming
                     liquefied and thus flowing or lurching. The ground may also act like

                  quicksand and cause structures to sink or tilt. Although liquefaction
                 represents a risk to structures, it doesn' t necessarily preclude development.
                 Available mitigation measures such as excavation and replacement of
                 susceptible soils and the use of concrete piles are available.
8. 2. 1. 5 Subsidence
                 Land subsidence is the lowering of the land- surface elevation from
                 activities occurring underground. Typically it is caused by the pumping of
                 water, oil, or gas from subterranean reservoirs or from peat oxidation
                   shrinkage of buried organic matter) or hydrocompaction ( initial wetting
                 of soils that causes the soil to compact under their own weight),          and
                 earthquakes.   Subsidence coutd be a problem in the Imperial Valley
                 because of the irrigation and drainage systems. These systems utilize
                 gravity- fed systems, and even minor alterations in elevation could disrupt
                 these and cause localized flooding. Another source of potential subsidence
                 in Calexico and the surrounding areas are geothermal plants, whose rate
                 and volume of extraction/ injection are key variables that could lead to
                 subsidence.
8. 2. 1. 6 Structure Hazard
                 The Uniform Building Code (         UBC)     has incorporated seismic design
                 standards   since  1943.   Since that time, the     standards have improved
                 dramatically. Recent industry experience has shown that adherence to the
                 aforementioned codes greatly increases the chance that a structure will
                 endure an earthquake with little or no significant damage.
8. 2. 1. 7 Earthquake Risk Assessment
                 Thus far, the specificity with which earthquakes are predictable is that
                 they will occur at certain places sometime in the future. Though we know
                 not when, where, or to what intensity an earthquake will be, we know that
                 they will in fact occur. Modern building codes and construction techniques
                 have greatly improved our ability to withstand an earthquake.
                 Risk assessment is the process of comparing the cost to avoid a risk with
                 potential cost of the damage produced by the hazard. The purpose of
                 evaluating seismic risk is to reduce the risk to an acceptable level based on
                 structure use because it is not possible or practical to eliminate all risk to
                 life and property. While basing planning decisions on risk is difficult, risk-
                 reduction measures can be implemented. We cannot reduce the chance of
                 an earthquake occurring, but we can develop plans to help minimize its
                 impact.
City of Gaiexico Ge eral Plan                                                                  8- 5
                   Acceptable risk as defined by the Council of Intergovernmental Relations
                   guidelines for the General Plan Seismic Safety Element:
1                       The level of risk below which no specific action by government is
                       deemed to be necessary other than making the risk known.
                   When establishing acceptable risk levels, we should consider the
                   importance of the facility after the seismic event for the preservation of
                   public health, and safety, the number of people likely to be in the building,
                   whether its use is voluntary or involuntary, and the cost of eliminating the
                   risk. Certain facilities are very important and must remain usable after a
                   seismic event, such as fire and police stations, schools, public utility
                   facilities, and hospitaIs and other medical facilities. Table S- A shows the
                   allowable risk levels per land use and the estimated cost to achieve the
                   accepted level of risk.
t                  Occupancy levels must be a consideration in determining acceptable risk.
                   Structures with high occupancy levels such as theaters, schools, churches,
                   meeting halls, office buildings, apartment buildings, and shopping centers
                   should have a low level of acceptable risk. Conversely, higher levels of
                   risk may be acceptable in low-occupancy uses such as single- family
                   houses and warehouses.
                   Another factor to be considered when evaluating risk is whether the
                   inhabitants of the structure have a choice as to whether they would
                   otherwise subject themselves to a certain level of risk. Involuntary risk
                   occurs at facilities such as hospitals, schools, and convalescent homes.
                   Persons using these facilities may be restrained or incapable of leaving
                   these during a seismic event, thus only a low level of risk is acceptable.
                   Perhaps the most significant variable in risk reduction is the cost of doing
                   so. Risk reduction must be balanced against the cost thereof. Costs can be
                   either direct, such as the case with extra reinforcement of a building, or
                   indirect, as in zoning land with a high seismic risk as open space. Three
                   common      examples    of  seismic  risk mitigation    are  rehabilitation or
                   demolition of nonconforming structures, requiring extraordinary design
J
                   and construction techniques, and limiting or prohibiting development in
                   dangerous areas.

    8. 2. 2 Fire Hazards
I
                     The City of Calexico has a fire hazard rating of 5 from the ISO ( Insurance
                      Service Office) Commercial Risk Services, Inc. The rating is based on a l
                     to 10 scale with 10 being the greatest risk and considers many factors,
                        Failure of a single structure could affect large populations.
                     z Percentage assumption based on the structure otherwise being built in accordance with
                     standard California practice. The estimated additional cost assumes that the structure will
                     remain useful after an event.
                     3 Failure of a single structure would affect only the occupants.
                     4 Percentage assumption based on the structure otherwise being built in accordance with
                     standard California practice. The estimated additional cost assumes that the structure will
                     give reasonable assurance of preventing injury or loss of life but not necessarily
                     remaining useful after an event.

                     structural damage but with some non- structural damage; resists major earthquakes with
                     the intensity of the strongest experienced in California, without collapse but with some
                     structural and non- structural damage. In most structures, it is expected that structural
                     damage even from major earthquakes could be limited to repairable damage ( Structural
                     Engineers Association of California).

                                                                                            i   fc:#
                    including adequate water pressure and supply ( in addition to the city' s
                    maximum rate of consumption for purposes other than firefighting), fire
                    equipment     and  personnel,  response time, etc. Downtown Calexico is
                    susceptible to fires because many of the structures were built in the early
                     1900s and are constructed of wood. Additionally, some buildings lack
                    space between them, thus increasing the chances that a fire could spread to
                    numerous buildings. Also, many of the buildings in downtown Calexico
                    have not been retroftted for seismic activity and do not contain sprinkler
                    systems.
                    The City has a low risk of damage from wildfires. The undeveloped areas
                    around and outside of the City are either irrigated farm land or sparsely-
                    vegetated desert land. Therefore there is little risk from wildfires due to
                    lack of fuel.
1                   The City currently has two existing fire stations; one at 430 East 5`h Street,
                    and the other at 900 Grant Street. Of note is that the fire stations are
                    located on either side of the Union Pacific railroad tracks. There is
                    currently a proposal to build a new station in vicinity of Meadows Road
                    and Cole Road.
                    Currently, the Calexico Fire Department has one ( 1) chief, 30 firefighters,
                    one ( 1) fire inspector and an administrative staff. Based on a population of
                    32, 600, the current staffing ratio is 1. 0 personnel for each 1, 000 residents
                    based on professional full-time staff. The desired ratio is 1. 5 per 1, 000 so
                    current staffing levels are considered inadequate.
                    The City' s emergency services providers, such as fire and police, are
                    currently cooperating with IVECA and RCS for the coordinated efforts
                    Valley- wide to integrate communication within the Valley and between
                    Imperial Valley and San Diego County. The Calexico Fire Department is a
                    member of the Imperial Valley Firefighters Strike Force which is
                    responsible to respond to fire emergencies throughout California. The
                    Department is also a member of the Imperial Valley Hazardous Materials
                    Response Team and         is available to respond to      hazardous   materials
                    emergencies throughout Imperial County. The Department also has a Fire
                    Prevention Bureau headed by the inspector and administers inspections,
                    occupancy permits, and various safety programs throughout the city.

   8. 2. 3 Hazardous Materials
                    The California Health and Safety Code defines a hazardous material as
                      any material that because of its quantity, concentration, or physical or
                    chemical characteristics poses a significant present or potential hazard to
1                   human health and safety, or to the environment." These materials can be in
                    solid, liquid, or gaseous form and include such things as pesticides,
                    herbicides, toxic metals and chemicals, liquefied natural gas, explosives,
                    volatile    chemicals,   and    nuclear    fuels. According     to   the   U. S.

                                                                                        s< t:.
                    Environmental Protection Agency ("      EPA"),   hazardous material exhibit
                   one or more of the following properties:
                           Ignitability: Can create fires under certain conditions.
                           Corrosivity: Is acidic and capable of corroding metal.
                           Reactivity: Can create explosions or toxic fumes, gases and/ or
                           vapors when exposed to air or mixed with water.
                           Toxicity: Harmful or fatal when ingested, breathed, or absorbed by
                           the skin.
                   The risk posed by hazardous materials has been a concern for the City.
                   This is due to the fact that there has been heavy border truck and rail
                   traffic with many trucks and rail cars hauling potentially dangerous
                   materials. With the new commercial truck border crossing located east of
                   the City and the completion of SR- 7 connecting SR-98 to I- 8, the risks
                   associated with potentially hazardous materials hauled via truck are
                   reduced significantly. Rail service will continue to pose this risk as it
                   passes through the heart of the City as will trucks that serve industry
                   located within Calexico.
                   The other potential source of hazardous material release is from some of
                   the operations associated with agriculture, such as chemical handling and
                   storage facilities and crop dusting companies. The County Health Services
                   Department, pursuant to California Health and Safety Code Section
                   25500, must maintain a list of hazardous material handlers and/ or vendors
                   as well as an inventory of materials that is available to City fire
                   departments.
                   In January 2001, the EPA completed " Calexico: Hazardous Materials
                   Commodity Flow Study." The purpose of the study was " to provide a
                   commodity flow study of hazardous materials to aid local, state and
                   federal authorities to understand the volume and nature of hazardous
                   material movements into, out of, and through the region, particularly the
                   City of Calexico." The recommendations of this study have been
                   incorporated into the General Plan as described in Table S- B, below:

   8. 2. 4 The New River
  8. 2. 4. 1 Pollution
                    In many cities, the presence of a river can be a source of valuable open
                    space, recreational opportunities, or development potential. In Calexico
                    however, the presence of the New River represents one of the City' s
                    greatest environmental hazards and challenges. The New River flows
                    north from Mexicali through the City of Calexico and discharges into the
                    Salton Sea, approximately 60 miles north of the City. According to a 1996
                    study by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services ("         USDHS"),
                    about one third of the cumulative water flow of the New River is
                    generated in Mexico. Of that portion of water from Mexico, based on
                    information as current as May 2005, the State Water Resources Control
                    Board (" SWRCB") indicates that almost 70% of the pollution comes from
                    agricultural chemical runoff from the Imperial Valley agricultural
                    operations, and 29% is from the City of Mexicali, Mexico as human
                    waste.   A    remaining   small  percentage (    1%)     is  attributed to   the
                    manufacturing plants operating in Mexico. The amount of untreated or
                    partially-treated sewage often surges during times of sewer system failures
1                   at Mexican treatment facilities.
                    The previously mentioned study by USDHS identified the presence of
                    many dangerous substances found in the river. Among the many materials
                   found in the New River at unacceptable levels are: fecal coliforms, fecal
                    streptococci, and pathogenic microorganisms that are capable of causing
                   polio, typhoid, cholera, and tuberculosis. There was also the presence of
                   over twenty- five metals exceeding acceptable levels, including arsenic,
                   lead,   and   cadmium.    The New     River  also     contains  volatile organic
                   compounds ("     VOCs") and various pesticides. Therefore, the New River is
                   a major threat to public health for the City of Calexico.
                   Another hazard that affects land uses near the New River is the presence
                   of foam that frequently forms on the surface of the river. In 1980, the
                   California     Regional   Water Quality Control Board (" CRWQCB")
                   investigated the composition and source of the foam. The results of the
                   CRWQCB study found that the foam was primarily composed of
                   detergents discharged in Mexico, but was unable to determine whether
                   they were industrial or domestic in origin. The foam can be blown by the
                   wind and onto adjacent land uses and has been found to contain high
                   levels of fecal coliform.
                   The risks created by the pollution of the New River are human contact
1                  with or the ingestion of the water, unpleasant odors, blowing foam, the
                   consumption of fish and wildlife living in the river, and the possibility that
                   the mosquitoes ( Culex trsalis) that live in the New River are vectors for
                   encephalitis.    In addition, the blight associated       with the New River

                     represents a missed opportunity to gain needed recreational lands in the
                     City.
   8.2.4.2 Flooding
                    Flooding is a natural hazard that is unlikely to affect the City of Calexico
                     under normal    rain  and run- off conditions.   The Federal Emergency
                    Management Agency ( FEMA) hazard area map of the Catexico area
                    shows that the 500 year floodplain of the New River within the City is
                    contained within the area north of the Calexico International Airport that
                    is currently zoned as Open Space land.         See   Figure  S- 2. However,
                    conditions upstream in Mexico do affect the river. As the Mexicali area
                    becomes more urbanized with nothing heretofore having been done to
                    control urban runoff there, the potential for flooding could increase in
                    downstream areas such as Calexico.
                    As mentioned in Section 8. 2. I, flooding could result from seismic damage
                    to a major IID canal. The City of Calexico is traversed by two major
                    canals: the All American and the Central Main.
   8. 2. 5 Peak Load Water Supply
   Calexico receives all of its potable water supply from the Calexico Water Department
                      CWD). The CWD receives the water from Imperial Irrigation District
                      IID)  which is brought from the Colorado River. Currently, about 2
                    percent of IID water is divided among nine Imperial Valley communities.
                    The city of Calexico' s current daily maximum water output is 9 million
                    gallons of potable water. The peak demand of the City of Calexico is
                     10, 481 gallons per minute ( gpm) and can be handled by the existing
                    electric pumps which have a capacity of 12, 200 gpm. The CWD also has
                    an additional 5, 000 gpm fire flow suppression delivered by 2 natural gas
                    driven pumps. CWD has purchased property and is in the process of
                    designing a 6 million gallon ( mg) tank near Cole Road and Highway 98 to
                    stabilize and loop the existing water system and serve future development
                    to the east of the City' s existing boundaries. According to the " 2000
                    Urban Water Management Plan for Imperial Irrigation District ( IID) and
                    the Cities of Brawley, Calexico, and El Centro," the projected water
                    demand for Calexico will be 2,068 mg annually in 2020 and the project
                    water supply will be 2, 200 mg annually. The City has the necessary
C'                  capaciTy to supply enough water in the event of a disaster. However, a
                    severe earthquake or other natural disaster could destroy portions of the
                    water transmission system, thus causing a short-term water shortage. The
                    Imperial County Office of Emergency Services requires a ten- day storage
                    holding capacity for cities, so interruptions in transmission can be
                    managed.

     8. 2. 6 Evacvation/ Emergency Access
                      Evacuations and the need for emergency access can become necessary on
                      a localized or City-wide basis depending on the type of emergency
                      situation. Local evacuations and the need for emergency access occur, for
u                     example, when a building is on fire. A larger area may need to be
                      evacuated for more catastrophic events such as an earthquake that causes
                      major damage andlor flooding. Should an event occur that would
                      necessitate the mass evacuation or dispersal of people from the City, the
                      surrounding agricultural land is favorable because it is uninhabited and
                      open. The major evacuation routes are Highways 111, 98, and Interstate 8.
                      All primary local streets in the City connect to the county road system
                      outside of the City.
                      Localized emergency access relates to things such as adequate roadway
                      widths and turning radii, spaces around buildings, and distances to fire
                      hydrants. The City of Calexico Zoning Ordinance establishes setbacks
                      which provide for safe access around buildings associated with all types of
                      land uses. The General Plan Circulation Element, Section 3,           includes
                      policies addressing local street design and appropriate access on major
                      streets. The Circulation Element plan for streets is based on providing
                      adequate cross sections of streets to accommodate through traffic. All new
                      development is subject to these policies and standards. In older areas of
                      the City where such requirements are substandard, the City is working to
                      correct and improve less than ideal access.
     8. 3 Establishing a Vision
                      The Vision for safety in the City of Calexico will ensure one of the most
                      fundamental expectationsâ€” that lives and property will be protected from
                      human- made and natural hazards to the extent feasible. The Safety
                      Element is responsive to this Vision because it:
                      a)      Provides a sense of security and well- being to our residents.
I_ J
                      b)       Identifies facilities and services that support safety functions that
                              are essential to the future development of the City.
                      c)      Offers some measure of assurance to those who would invest in the
                              City that their investment will be protected to the extent possible
                              and feasible.
                      d)      Demonstrates a commitment to this important aspect of community
                              development by our public officials.
                      e)      Adds to the desirability of the community as a place to attract
                              business investment.

   8. 4 Related Plans and Programs
                     There are other agencies with plans and programs related to the purpose of
                    the Safety Element. These plans have been developed and adopted by
                     various levels of government and are administered by agencies with
                    powers to enforce state and local laws.
                    Multi- agency Cooperative Programs
                    The City' s emergency services providers, such as fire and police, are
                    currently cooperating with the coordinated efforts Valley-wide to integrate
                    communication within the Valley and between Imperial Valley and San
                     Diego County. The Calexico Fire Department is a member of the Imperial
                    Valley Firefighters Strike Force which is responsible to respond to fire
                    emergencies throughout California. The Department is also a member of
                    the Imperial Valley Hazardous Materials Response Team and is available
                    to   respond   to   hazardous      materials  emergencies    throughout      Imperial
                    County. The Department also has a Fire Prevention Bureau headed by the
                    inspector and administers inspections, occupancy permits, and various
                    safety programs throughout the City.

 J
                    Imperial County has an Emergency Plan that addresses Imperial County' s
                    planned response to extraordinary emergency situations associated with
                    natural disasters, technological incidents, and nuclear defense operations.
                    The County Emergency Plan focuses on potential large- scale disasters that
                    can    generate    unique      situations  requiring    unusual     responses.     The
                    Emergency Plan also identifies the sources of outside support which might
                    be provided by other jurisdictions, state and federal agencies, and the
                    private sector through mutual aid and specific statutory authorities.b
                    Calexico International Airport Master Plan
                    The Calexico International Airport is subject to the Calexico International
                    Airport Master Plan, 2001, prepared by the City of Calexico. The plan
                    identifies future improvements for the airport to meet future aviation
                    needs. The plan also addresses land uses surrounding the airport. The type
                    of development occurring in the airport environs impacts the safety of
                    aircraft operations. In the reverse, it also impacts the number of people
                    exposed to aircraft hazards such as airplane crashes. The General Plan
                    reflects the future airport expansion plan and the currentlfuture safety

                      Imperial County Airport Land Use Commission. The plan identifies areas
                      impacted by aircraft operations and includes policies to allow for the
                      continued operation of county airports, while protecting public safety. The
                      Hazards Element of the General Plan addresses these issues and policies.
                      The Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan is updated on a periodic basis to
                      reflect the California Department of Transportation' s Airport Land Use
                      Planning handbook. The City will review its General Plan to ensure
                      consistency when the airport plan is updated.

                      Dangerous Buildings, and the Uniform Fire Code, all of which contain
                      structural requirements for existing and new buildings. The codes are
   J                  designed to ensure structural integrity during seismic and other hazardous
                      events to prevent personal injury, loss of life, and substantial property
                      damage. To protect public safety, development in Calexico is subject to
                      these codes. Calexico has also adopted a Flood Damage Prevention code
                      and an Earthquake Hazard Reduction in Existing Buildings code to
                      address safety issues directly associated with flooding and earthyuakes.
1                     California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and Guidelines
                      The California Environmental Quality Act was adopted by the State
                      legislature  to  provide   public   disclosure   of the   substantial  adverse
L.
                      environmental effects of proposed development within the State. The
                      CEQA Statutes ( Public Resources Code           Section 21000, et seqâ€¢) and
                      Guidelines ( California Code of Regulations Title 14, Chapter 3, Section
                       15000, et seqâ€¢) include disclosure of and mitigation for safety hazards as
                      environmental impacts. Continued implementation of CEQA will ensure
                      that City officials and the general public have information describing and
                      mitigating    potentially  significant    safety  impacts    associated   with
                      discretionary private and public development projects.
                      Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
                      Pursuant to the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act, the State Geologist through
                      the California Geological Survey unit of the Department of Conservation
                      compiles maps identifying seismic hazard zones throughout the State.
                      Development in seismic hazard areas is subject to policies and criteria
                      established by the State Mining and Geology Board.               Approval   of
                      development located within a seismic hazard area requires the preparation
                      of a geotechnical report and local agency consideration of the policies and
                      criteria set forth by the State ( Public Resources Code Section 2690 et
                      se .). The City requires geotechnical reports for development throughout
                      the City due to the high risk for seismic activity in the area.
                                                                                                  8- 16

                   Alquist- Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act
                   The Alquist- Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act requires the State
                   Geologist to identify earthquake fault zones along traces of recently and
                   potentially active major faults. The General Plan includes Figure S- 1
                   which shows the location of these faults. The Alquist-Priolo Zones are
                   usually one- quarter mile or less in width. Proposed development plans
                   within these fault zones must be accompanied by a geotechnical report
                   prepared by a geologist describing the likelihood of surface rupture and
                   other seismically induced hazards.
                   Cobey-Alquist Floodplanin Management Act
                   The    Cobe- Alquist    Floodplain   Management     Act  encourages    local
                   governments     to  plan,  adopt,  and  enforce  land  use regulations    for
                   floodplain management in order to protect people and property from
                   flooding hazards. This act also identifies requirements which jurisdictions
                   must meet in order to receive State and financial assistance for flood
                   control.

                   The NFIP which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management
1                  Agency ( FEMA), provides federal flood insurance and federally financed
                   loans for property owners in flood prone areas. To qualify for federal
                   flood insurance and assistance, the City must identify flood hazard areas
J                   Figure S- 2) and implement a system of protective controls. The Safety
                   Element, Land Use Element, and Title 15, Chapter15. 54 of the Municipal
                   Code fulfill these requirements.
                   County of Imperial General Plan
                   The County General Plan identifies potential hazards that could impact
                   persons and property in the unincorporated portion of the City' s planning
                   area. The City cooperates with the County in emergency situations
                   affecting both jurisdictions and has mutual aid arrangements. Until
                   annexation into the City occurs, unincorporated areas are subject to the
                   County General Plan and other policies addressing safety.
                   City of Calexico Emergency Disaster Plan
1                  The City of Calexico has adopted a Standardized Emergency Management
                   System ( SEMS) Multi Hazard Functional Emergency Operations Plan
                    SEMS Operations Plan). It provides guidance for the City to respond to
                   extraordinary emergency situations associated with natural disasters, man-

9. 0 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
9. 1     Economic Development Element
                   Successful economic development for the City of Calexico can be
                   achieved through maintaining a fiscally healthy and balanced economy
                  that builds upon existing economic development efforts and establishes
                  policies for future economic growth. Economic growth and awareness of
                  regional economic development activities will assist in developing logical
                   strategies to address more intense economic development efforts. A
                  healthy economy not only provides local workers with adequate income to
                  afford a better quality of life, but it also provides local government with
                  adequate public revenues to maintain a better quality of public services.
                  The Economic Development goals and policies should be recognized as a
                  long term commitment that provides an organizational framework and
                  process that can guide ongoing development efforts. Recognizing that
                  economic development is an ongoing process, the goals and policies
                  should provide direction to guide development activities while at the same
                  time maintaining flexibility to respond to changing economic trends and
                  local market conditions.
                  Through economic diversification combined with its geographic locations
                  along the United States and Mexico International border, a broader tax
                  base will provide the City with long-term benefits and economic stability.
                  In the short- term, key improvements to the City' s economic development
                  should focus on four general areas: 1)       the concentration of mixed use
                  development in key locations of the City, 2) the development of
                  commercial and mixed use development along Interstate 111, State Route
                  98, Jasper Road and Cole Road 3) revitalization of the downtown area,
                  and 4) smart sustainable conversion and development of agricultural land
                  to non- agricultural land. In the long-term, the Silicon Border and Eastern
                  Industrial Corridor projects may provide engines for economic growth in
                  the region closest to Calexico. Through future expansion of its Sphere of
                  Influence, economic incentive programs, and cooperation with the County,
                  the City can realize the benefits of an Eastern Industrial Corridor.
9. 2     Economic Challenges
                  Calexico faces continuing economic challenges to the planning and
                  implementation of the future growth and development of the City. Two
                  key regional factors are vital to this planning effort: 1) Retention of the
                  large number of retail customers and consumers who commute from
                  Mexicali, Mexico to Calexico and other communities to purchase goods
                  and services at a high daily rate, and 2) Calexico' s contributing role in the
                  County' s mega- agricultural industry.

                  Significant contributors to the local economy are winter visitors (            or
                    snowbirds"),    Mexico/ LJ. S. border crossings, and the North American Free
                  Trade    Agreement (" NAFTA").            However,      due to  the prevalence of
                  unskilled agricultural and retail occupations, median income in Calexico
                  has remained low. The high proportion of employment in the retail
                  industry, which is aimed at the Mexicali consumer, has left the City
                  vulnerable to fluctuations in the relative strengths of the Mexican Peso
                  versus the U. S. Dollar. When Peso devaluation occurs, making American
                  goods more expensive, retail purchases decline and force many individuals
                  into unemployment. The combined decline in retail business employment
                  and the seasonal nature of the agricultural industry causes a high non-
                  seasonally adjusted unemployment rate. Table ED- A, identifies general
                  economic and demographics data for the City of Calexico and Imperial
                  County. This data provides an economic comparison between the City and
                  county. A significant economic factor according to the California
                  Employment Development Department (` BDD")                   is the unemployment
                  rate in this area, which in May of 2005 was I S percent for Calexico, and
                  13. 2 percent for Imperial County as a whole.

                       To meet these and other economic challenges, the City continues to take a
                       proactive approach by participating in various State Economic Incentive
  t                    Programs and Federal programs. Some of the programs in which the City
                       participates consist of: 1)     Enterprise Zone: a defned geographic area
                       within which businesses can obtain tax benefits and other incentives
                       designed to stimulate business investments. A Targeted Employment Area
                          TEA") provides for the establishment of employment areas comprised of
                       census tracts that have at least 51 % of its residents at low or moderate
                       income levels. The purpose of TEA designation is to encourage businesses
                       in the Calexico Enterprise Zone to hire eligible residents with the most
                       need and allows the Enterprise Zone companies to earn tax credits; 2)
                       Manufacturing Enhancement Area (" MEA"): intended to stimulate job
                       creation in areas experiencing triple the State' s unemployment rate. It
                       provides    for state  and   local   tax  incentives   to  encourage    business
                       investment    and   promote    job   creation; 3)   HUB     Zone (  Historically
                       Underutilized Business Zone):       a federal program aimed at stimulating
                       economic growth in urban and rural areas. The program gives federal
                       contract preferences to small businesses that are certified by maintaining
                       an office in one of the designated HUB Zones and employing staff who
                       live locally. The entire county of Imperial is a designated HUB Zone and
                       therefore any certified business in Calexico may participate; and 4)
                       Foreign Trade Zones (" FTZs"):        provide special customs procedures to
                       U. S. plants engaged in international trade- related activities. Duty- free
                       treatment is accorded to items that are processed in FTZs and then
                       reexported, and duty payment is deferred on items until they are brought
                       out of the FTZ for sale in the U. S. market.
    9. 3     Revitalization of the Downtown Area
                       While the City has grown at a steady rate over the past decade in terms of
                      jobs, retail sales, and average household income, certain areas of the City
                       need economic attention and revitalization. Due to the older nature of the
                       downtown, revitalization      is important to create      a sense of place    in
                       Calexico and to promote economic development and expansion.
                       The downtown area should be a focal point that promotes the City' s
l                      image. An important component to creating excitement for the downtown
                       area is to establish a lively and active environment that attracts people to
                       utilize the area. Mixed- use residential and commercial land uses can
                       contribute to this success. Creating a pedestrian- oriented environment,
                       community facilities, and mixed-use land use projects with cohesive
                      residential, retail, and office space are keys to a successful downtown.

     9.4      Preserving an Image to Remember
                       The City' s artistic values provide the basis for cultural identification
                       throughout the City' s planning efforts. Public awareness is important for
                       encouraging and supporting the arts and cultural development of the City.
                       Also, through direct support given to City- sponsored activities and
                       facilities, the City also plays an important role in helping to encourage and
                       enhance activities that support the arts. Through active involvement and
                       support, the City can offer a better understanding, appreciation,           and
                       enjoyment of the arts and history within Calexico.
                       Within the City, a downtown revitalization strategy should include the
                       development of an Arts Program, which focuses on providing a
                       welcoming and stimulating environment for practicing artists to present
                       their art to the community. A concerted effort can be undertaken to make
                       art a more integral part of citizens' lives by encouraging the expansion of
                       the arts in the school system, establishing new educational activities, and
                       inviting broader participation of students and designers in local public arts
                       opportunities in local parks as well as downtown.
     9.5 Establishing a Vision
                       Inclusion of an Economic Development section in the City' s General Plan,
                       enables the City to be better able to plan and regulate the type of future
                       development envisioned for the City. It also is better able to identify
                       potential economic impacts that may effect the City' s long-range policy
                       decisions relative to land use, public services, population and growth.
                       Economic development must sustain a plan that establishes a high priority
                       to the assets and values of the City and its citizens.
                       The Economic Development Element is responsive to the City' s Vision
                       because it:

                     opportunities to achieve its economic development objectives. Economic

  9. 0 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
  9. 1     Economic Development Element
                    Successful economic development for the City of Calexico can be
                    achieved through maintaining a fscally healthy and balanced economy
                    that builds upon existing economic development efforts and establishes
                    policies for future economic growth. Economic growth and awareness of
                    regional economic development activities will assist in developing logical
                    strategies to address more intense economic development efforts. A
                    healthy economy not only provides local workers with adequate income to
                    afford a better quality of life, but it also provides local government with
                    adequate public revenues to maintain a better quality of public services.
                    The Economic Development goals and policies should be recognized as a
                    long term commitment that provides an organizational framework and
t                   process that can guide ongoing development efforts. Recognizing that
                    economic development is an ongoing process, the goals and policies
                    should provide direction to guide development activities while at the same
                    time maintaining flexibility to respond to changing economic trends and
                    local market conditions.
                    Through economic diversification combined with its geographic locations
                    along the United States and Mexico International border, a broader tax
                    base will provide the City with long-term benefits and economic stability.
                    In the short- term, key improvements to the City' s economic development
                    should focus on four general areas: 1)       the concentration of mixed use
                    development in key locations of the City, 2) the development of
                    commercial and mixed use development along Interstate 111, State Route
                    98, Jasper Road and Cole Road 3) revitalization of the downtown area,
                    and 4) smart sustainable conversion and development of agricultural land
                    to non- agricultural land. In the long-term, the Silicon Border and Eastern
                    Industrial Corridor projects may provide engines for economic growth in
                    the region closest to Calexico. Through future expansion of its Sphere of
                    Influence, economic incentive programs, and cooperation with the County,
                    the City can realize the benefits of an Eastern Industrial Corridor.
  9. 2    Economic Challenges
                    Calexico faces continuing economic challenges to the planning and
                    implementation of the future growth and development of the City. Two
                    key regional factors are vital to this planning effort: 1) Retention of the
                    large number of retail customers and consumers who commute from

                      Significant contributors to the local economy are winter visitors (             or
                        snowbirds"),     Mexico/ LJ. S. border crossings, and the North American Free
                      Trade    Agreement (" NAFTA").            However,     due to  the  prevalence  of
                      unskilled agricultural and retail occupations, median income in Calexico
                      has remained low. The high proportion of employment in the retail
                      industry, which is aimed at the Mexicali consumer, has left the City
                      vulnerable to fluctuations in the relative strengths of the Mexican Peso
                      versus the U.S. Dollar. When Peso devaluation occurs, making American
                      goods more expensive, retail purchases decline and force many individuals
                      into unemployment. The combined decline in retail business employment
                      and the seasonal nature of the agricultural industry causes a high non-
                      seasonally adjusted unemployment rate. Table ED- A, identifies general
                      economic and demographics data for the City of Calexico and Imperial
                      County. This data provides an economic comparison between the City and
                      county. A significant economic factor according to the California
                      Employment Development Department (" EDD")                  is the unemployment
                      rate in this area, which in May of 2005 was I S percent for Catexico, and
                      13. 2 percent for Imperial County as a whole.

    City af Calexico Generai Plan                                                                    9- 2
                         To meet these and other economic challenges, the City continues to take a
                         proactive approach by participating in various State Economic Incentive
                         Programs and Federal programs. Some of the programs in which the City
                         participates consist of: 1)    Enterprise Zone: a defned geographic area
                         within which businesses can obtain tax benefits and other incentives
                         designed to stimulate business investments. A Targeted Employment Area
                            TEA") provides for the establishment of employment areas comprised of
                         census tracts that have at least 51%     of its residents at low or moderate
                         income levels. The purpose of TEA designation is to encourage businesses
                         in the Calexico Enterprise Zone to hire eligible residents with the most
                         need and allows the Enterprise Zone companies to earn tax credits; 2)
  IJ                     Manufacturing Enhancement Area (" MEA"): intended to stimulate job
                         creation in areas experiencing triple the State' s unemployment rate. It
                         provides for state and local        tax  incentives   to encourage  business
                         investment and promote job          creation;  3)  HUB    Zone ( Historically
                         Underutilized Business Zone):      a federal program aimed at stimulating
                         economic growth in urban and rural areas. The program gives federal
                         contract preferences to small businesses that are certified by maintaining
                         an office in one of the designated HUB Zones and employing staff who
                         live locally. The entire county of Imperial is a designated HUB Zone and
    J                    therefore any certified business in Calexico may participate; and 4)
                         Foreign Trade Zones (" FTZs"): provide special customs procedures to
                         U. S. plants engaged in international trade- related activities. Duty- free
                         treatment is accorded to items that are processed in FTZs and then
                         reexported, and duty payment is deferred on items until they are brought
                         out of the FTZ for sale in the U. S. market.

      9. 3     Revitalization of fhe Downtown Area
                         While the City has grown at a steady rate over the past decade in terms of
                        jobs, retail sales, and average household income, certain areas of the City
                         need economic attention and revitalization. Due to the older nature of the
                         downtown, revitalization     is important to create a sense of place in
                         Calexico and to promote economic development and expansion.
                         The downtown area should be a focal point that promotes the City' s
r                        image. An important component to creating excitement for the downtown
                        area is to establish a lively and active environment that attracts people to
                        utilize the area. Mixed- use residential and commercial land uses can
                        contribute to this success. Creating a pedestrian- oriented environment,
                        community facilities, and mixed- use land use projects with cohesive
                        residential, retail, and offce space are keys to a successful downtown.
      City of Calexico General Plan                                                                9- 3

  9. 4     Preserving an Image to Remember
                    The City' s artistic values provide the basis for cultural identification
                    throughout the City' s planning efforts. Public awareness is important for
                    encouraging and supporting the arts and cultural development of the City.
                    Also, through direct support given to City- sponsored activities and
                    facilities, the City also plays an important role in helping to encourage and
                    enhance activities that support the arts. Through active involvement and
                    support, the City can offer a better understanding, appreciation, and
                    enjoyment of the arts and history within Calexico.
                    Within the City, a downtown revitalization strategy should include the
                    development      of an Arts Program, which focuses on providing a
                    welcoming and stimulating environment for practicing arfists to present
                    their art to the community. A concerted effort can be undertaken to make
                    art a more integral part of citizens' lives by encouraging the expansion of
                    the arts in the school system, establishing new educational activities, and
                    inviting broader participation of students and designers in local public arts
                    opportunities in local parks as well as downtown.
  9.5 Establishing a Vision
                    Inclusion of an Economic Development section in the City' s General Plan,
                    enables the City to be better able to plan and regulate the type of future
                    development envisioned for the City. It also is better able to identify
                    potential economic impacts that may effect the City' s long-range policy
                    decisions relative to land use, public services, population and growth.
                    Economic development must sustain a plan that establishes a high priority
                    to the assets and values of the City and its citizens.
                    The Economic Development Element is responsive to the City' s Vision
                    because it:
J                   a)       stimulates economic revitalization in key areas of the City.
                    b)       creates the opportunity for economic options at strategic points to
                             the City.
                    c)       offers   economic    potential  that   seeks  to   achieve   regional
                             recognition, strengthen the economic base of the City, and provide
                             direct and indirect stimulation of other economic investments in
                             the City.
                    d)       provides job opportunities for local workers, and overall fiscal
                             benefits for maintaining the highest level of public services to local
                             residents.
                    e)       provides   economic    leverage to make resources available that
                             enhance stability in the operations and services provided by City
                             government.

                              contributes to the City' s economic development potential by
                              providing a choice of housing opportunities.
                              contributes to the overall balance of residential and non- residential

   9. 6     Goal, Objectives and Policies
                     The City of Calexico is located in a key location of the Imperial Valley,
                     along the U. S. and Mexico International border. The City' s location and
                     accessibility offers the opportunity to benefit as a regional location for
                     retail, commercial, industrial and tourism activity. Also, its location offers
                     opportunities for encouraging the development of industries in emerging
                     markets and new technologies.
   9. 6. 1    Goal
                     The City should promote a healthy and diversified economic base by
                     continuing to welcome Mexico' s resources, attracting quality businesses,
                     and encouraging existing businesses to expand their sales, facilities, and
                     employment.

L Objective 1
                    The City' s image can     have a profound impact on economic development
                    activities. The image     presented by the City can determine the location
                    decision of a new or       relocating business. Existing businesses are more
                    likely to expand and      reinvest in a City with a positive self-image and
                    strong sense of civic pride.
  Policy 1
                    a.       Emphasis shall be made to promote and preserve the qualities and
                             resources that contribute to Calexico' s attractiveness and make the
                             City unique.
                    b.       Emphasis shall be made to promote and preserve the City' s cultural
                             heritage.

                             economic health of the region.
                    e.       The City shall plan and develop a well- designed and effective
                             circulation system.
                    f.       The City shall recognize the importance of streets and " gateways" in
                             creating the initial impression or image of the City.
