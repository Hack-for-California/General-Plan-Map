INTRODUCTION
B.       GENERAL P LAN P URP OS E
The Artesia General Plan is a document designed to guide the growth and development
of Artesia through 2030. The document provides goals and polices which will assist the
City in achieving its economic and community development objectives. The General
Plan describes Artesia’s goals and strategies regarding Cultural and Historic Resources;
Economic Development; Intellectual Infrastructure; Land Use; Housing; Circulation and
Mobility; Bikeways and Trails; Community Facilities and Infrastructure; Air Quality and
Climate Change; Conservation and Natural Resources; Open Space; Parks and
Recreation; Community Safety; and Noise.
This General Plan supersedes the 1993 General Plan and all of its previous versions.
While this General Plan may contain similar goals, policies, or other components of the
previous plan, this version has been custom-tailored to meet the needs and issues of the
City at the present time and foreseeable future.
The Artesia General Plan is not a fixed expression of general goals and policies; rather,
it is a document which is practical in nature, progressive in strategy, and specifically
designed to guide development and address the aforementioned issues of the ever-
changing environment in which Artesia is located.
C.       HIS TORY OF ARTES IA
The City of Artesia traces its beginning as a community and retail trade center in
southeast Los Angeles County in the mid-1800s. In 1869, Daniel Gridley purchased
1,600 acres of the Spanish Land Grant known as Rancho Los Coyotes. He sold 550
acres to the Artesia Land Company, which also acquired 2,400 acres from other parties.
The community of Artesia was launched at a three-day auction in February 1875. By the
end of the year, nearly all the land was sold and approximately 50 farms were
established.
Principal crops of the early Artesia farmers were corn, wheat, fruits and vegetables.
There were small dairies and chicken ranches, though the only stocks raised for
exportation were hogs and beef cattle. Nearly every farm had an artesian well, giving
the area its name. By the turn of the century, the core of the City was established at the
junction of Pioneer Boulevard and the Pacific Electric Railroad. This core served as the
trading, transportation, and social center for the surrounding agricultural area.
In 1907, the Pacific Electric railway began a passenger and freight service from Los
Angeles to Santa Ana through Artesia. A town subdivision was opened and the present
Artesia business district was established with the organization of a national bank. By
1923, those who had settled in Artesia formed the Artesia Chamber of Commerce to
improve business and to build a better community.
       I-2                                                         Artesia General Plan

                                                                    INTRODUCTION
In the early 1920s, dairymen, mostly of Portuguese descent, were brought from the San
Joaquin Valley to fill the shortage of dairy hands. In the 1930s, prime dairy property
began to attract Dutch dairy farmers.
As late as 1940 about 2,500 people lived in the area, but following World War II many
people around the country began to relocate to Southern California. This migration
extended the urbanization of the County into Artesia’s previously agricultural areas. In
1951, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors designated the area as the Artesia
Zoned District. Artesia was incorporated in 1959 with an area of 1.62 square miles.
Today, City lands are devoted to a whole range of urban land uses. The dairy farms that
once surrounded the City core have been replaced by homes, businesses and industries,
and less than one percent of the City’s total area is vacant.
D.      S TATE REQUIREM ENTS
California law requires cities to adopt a General Plan that provides the policy framework
for the long-term physical development of the community. The General Plan expresses
the Community’s development goals, and provides specific public policy relative to the
public and private uses of land in the community. The General Plan links community
values, visions, and objectives to the utilization of public and private land and other
community resources. The General Plan is comprehensive and long-term; it provides
primary guidance for specific projects, policy actions, or programs that may occur in the
future.
Artesia’s General Plan includes fourteen individual Elements. State law requires seven
mandatory Elements: Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Conservation, Open Space,
Noise, and Safety. State law allows jurisdictions to incorporate those Elements in any
method that is appropriate and allows the inclusion of optional Elements. Artesia’s
2030 General Plan includes all state mandated Elements in addition to optional
Elements.
E.      A V IS ION FOR ARTES IA
The vision for the City of Artesia is founded on the three pillars of sustainability:
Environment, Economy and Equity. This vision is a broad long range view of the City’s
desired future and provides the setting and framework for all goals, policies and
programs in the General Plan. These principles are interconnected and are valued
equally to address the social, environmental and economic needs of the current
population and future generations.
Environment
Environmental sustainability maintains a stable resource base, avoiding over-
exploitation of renewable resource systems and depletion of non-renewable resources.
This includes maintenance of biodiversity, clean air, and other ecosystem functions.
Artesia General Plan                                                             I-3

INTRODUCTION
Economy
Economic sustainability produces goods and services on a continuing basis and keeps
the economic capital intact. This principle encourages new approaches to economic
development that involve coordination and integration of environmental and social
concerns.
Equity
The principle of social equity works to achieve distributional equity, adequate provision
of social services including health and education, political accountability and
participation. Social equity strives to continually enhance and renew the skills and
attributes of people and their social environments.
F.       C ONTENT AND ORGANIZATION
State law specifies the basic content of a General Plan and permits the use of any format
deemed appropriate or convenient. The City of Artesia has chosen a document which is
driven by the principle of sustainability, encompassing policies that allow for
maintenance of socio-economic, built, and natural environments, while providing for
future expansion of these areas when necessary and appropriate. The individual
General Plan Elements have been arranged according to Community Planning Themes,
each of which represents one facet of sustainability.
The General Plan integrates developmental policy and environmental mitigations into a
concise package.        To facilitate everyday use, the General Plan and Program
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) are provided under separate covers. The General
Plan is a policy document focused on sustainability that summarizes the essential goals,
strategies and actions, and acts as the “constitution of development” for Artesia’s future.
The Program EIR is more technical in nature and contains more detailed background
information as well as an Environmental Impact Analysis.
The General Plan Policy Document is organized as follows:
        Community Development and Design Element
         This Community Planning Theme identifies land use constraints and
         opportunities, and attempts to balance growth in the City. It sets forth a pattern
         of land use, and sets standards for the density of population and the intensity of
         development based on the availability of public services and infrastructure.
             o  Land Use Sub-Element- Offers guidance on how the land within the City
                can serve as a multi-functional economic base, and describes existing
                and newly formed land uses and their purpose.
             o  Housing Sub-Element- Assesses housing needs on a citywide and
                regional scale; and plans for the provision of housing for all income
                levels.
       I-4                                                         Artesia General Plan

                                                                     INTRODUCTION
           o   Circulation and Mobility Sub-Element- Identifies the strengths,
               opportunities and weaknesses of the existing circulation system; and
               establishes goals, strategies and actions on how to integrate multimodal
               transportation opportunities throughout the City for pedestrians,
               motorists, and cyclists while improving the street network.
           o   Community Facilities and Infrastructure Sub-Element- Identifies key issues
               of the City’s infrastructure and public service systems, and establishes a
               framework for determining appropriate improvements and expansion of
               public services within Artesia.
      Community Resources and Wellness Element
       This Community Planning Theme centers on topics related to the natural systems
       within the City. It focuses on maintaining and enhancing the City’s environmental
       resources for the benefit and enjoyment of all residents.
           o   Air Quality and Climate Change Sub-Element- Discusses air quality
               standards and what measures can be taken to improve them over time,
               as well as how reducing emissions locally will benefit the City of Artesia.
           o   Open Space and Conservation Sub-Element- Provides guidance in
               conserving precious local natural resources, as well as expanding
               resource opportunities. Identifies current open space areas, as well as
               future passive and active open space opportunities for current and future
               residents and visitors.
           o   Community Safety Sub-Element- Comprehensively identifies the potential

The State of California requires the General Plan to be internally consistent and
compatible. Accordingly, no conflicts should exist within and among the various
Elements and the implementation programs specified in each Element.
H.     GENERAL P LAN UPD ATE P ROC ESS
The update to the Artesia General Plan involved four phases, as described below.
      Phase 1: Existing Conditions- This phase involved understanding the existing
       conditions in the City of Artesia. It included site reconnaissance and review of
       existing conditions, trends and future projections. The research collected in this
       phase of the process helped frame the existing challenges and opportunities for
       the future.
      Phase 2: Developing and Selecting a Land Use Alternative- Following the existing
       conditions analysis, a number of land use alternatives were developed for key
       focus areas in the City. Each alternative was evaluated for impacts on the
       community and a preferred land use alternative was selected.
      Phase 3: Developing the Draft General Plan and Program EIR- The third phase
       in the General Plan process involved developing goals and policies to reflect the
       vision of the community and set new policy directions for the future. Following
       the development of the goals and policies, an environmental review was
       conducted to evaluate the impacts of the policy program and the preferred land
       use alternative. A Draft General Plan and Draft Program EIR were developed for
       public review.
      Phase 4: Adopting the General Plan and EIR- The final phase in the General
       Plan update process is adoption. The Planning Commission and City Council will
       conduct a public hearing on the Draft General Plan and Draft Program EIR. In
       consideration of public input, the Planning Commission will make a
       recommendation to the City Council. The City Council will consider the Planning
       Commission’s recommendation and conduct an additional public hearing. The
       City Council will make its final decision to adopt the General Plan and EIR. The
       adopted Artesia General Plan is then published and implemented.

I.       AD M INIS TERING THE GE NERAL P LAN
The Artesia General Plan is a policy document that provides guidance for the City’s
vision towards a sustainable urban area. The City Council adopts the Plan as the
primary development guidance tool. Zoning Ordinances, Specific Plans, design
guidelines, and other documents are designed to implement the General Plan. These
documents, therefore, must be consistent with the General Plan (including both the
required and optional Elements). In addition, all future programs and projects will seek
policy guidance from the General Plan.
The General Plan is intended to be a dynamic document. An annual review of the
General Plan is required by the State of California to ensure that it remains relevant.
The implementation program is derived from strategies and actions in the General Plan.
This program will be reviewed annually as a means of completing the mandated Annual
Report. The Implementation Program also includes a Mandated Mitigation Monitoring
Program for tracking impact mitigations identified in the Environmental Impact Report.
Moreover, the General Plan may be amended to respond to changing community needs
up to four times per year. Requests for amendments may be submitted by individuals or
initiated by the City itself. Any proposed amendment will be reviewed by the Planning
Commission and City Council to ensure that the change is in the public interest and
would not be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare. Environmental review
is also required for all General Plan Amendments.

                                                               character of the City. The

                                                               that will shape the way the
                                                               City of Artesia develops and
                                                               redevelops over the next 20
                                                               years. It will serve as a guide
for both public officials and private citizens in its description of the type, intensity, and
general distribution of land uses for housing, business, industry, open space and public
and quasi-public uses. Policies and implementing actions seek to maximize development
opportunities that respect established neighborhoods and community assets and
encourage social and economic activity.
The State of California Government Code Section 65302(a) requires that a General Plan
include “a Land Use Element which designates the proposed general distribution and
general location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open
space including agriculture, natural resources, recreation and enjoyment of scenic
beauty, education, public buildings, and grounds, solid and liquid waster disposal
facilities and other categories of public and private uses of land. The Land Use Element
shall include a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity
recommended for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan.”
The Land Use Element has the broadest scope of any of the State required components
of the General Plan. In addition to the State’s requirements set forth in the Government
Code, it has also been legally established that while the location of a particular land use
may be expressed in general terms, a property owner must be able to identify the
General Plan designation for his/her parcel from the land use diagram contained in the
Land Use Element.
Among the most important implementation mechanisms for the Land Use Element are
the Zoning Ordinance and Specific Plans. The Government Code requires that a city’s
Zoning Ordinance and Map be consistent with the General Plan Land Use Element and
Diagram. In addition, all provisions of Specific Plans adopted by a city must be
consistent with the General Plan they implement.

LAND USE SUB-ELEMENT
B.       BACKGROUND
The essential components of the Land Use Sub-Element are the General Plan Land Use
Map and the goals and policies that guide future development. The Land Use Map is
divided into land use designations that define areas of the City by the type of use, the
existing character of the neighborhood, and the intent of future growth. The map serves
as a graphic representation of the goals and policies of all General Plan Elements. Users
of this document are advised to refer to the goals and policies, as well as the map when
evaluating proposed development and capital improvement projects.
The majority of the land area within the City is developed with single-family homes built
between the 1960s and 1980s. Apartments, townhomes and condominiums can also be
found throughout the City. Commercial development is mainly located along Pioneer
Boulevard, Artesia Boulevard and South Street, along with smaller neighborhood-serving
retail centers scattered within residential areas. The City’s built-out nature presents
opportunity for infill development and redevelopment to accommodate changing needs,
market conditions, and demographics.
The existing land use pattern within the City is comparable to the City’s 1993 General
Plan land use for the community. Table LU-1 and Exhibit LU-1 summarizes the 1993
General Plan land use distribution. Table LU-2 quantifies the amount of actual existing
acreage devoted to each land use, as well as the existing number of dwelling units or
square feet within each category. Exhibit LU-2 illustrates the City’s existing land use
pattern.

Notes:
1
 Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is an expression of non-residential land use intensity. The FAR is calculated by
dividing the total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot by the total area of that lot.
2
 Residential density is described in terms of dwelling units per gross acre (du/ac). A dwelling unit is a
building or a portion of a building used for human habitation and may vary considerable in size. Residential
acreage is defined as the area developed for residential use, exclusive of local serving streets, alleys, or
arterials.

Notes:
1
 Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is an expression of non-residential land use intensity. The FAR is calculated by
dividing the total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot by the total area of that lot.
2
 Residential density is described in terms of dwelling units per gross acre (du/ac). A dwelling unit is a
building or a portion of a building used for human habitation and may vary considerable in size. Residential
acreage is defined as the area developed for residential use, exclusive of local serving streets, alleys, or
arterials.

2030 General Plan Land Use Designations
State General Plan law requires the Land Use Element to establish standards for
development density and intensity for land use designations described in the General
Plan Land Use Map. Land Use designations describe the purpose and the type and
intensity of development allowed in a given area. While terms like “residential,”
“commercial,” or “industrial” are generally understood, State General Plan law requires
a clear and concise description of the land use categories that are depicted in the Land
Use Plan.
This Land Use Sub-Element and General Plan Land Use Map contain the following land
use designations:
Low Density Residential
The Low-Density Residential designation is characterized by single family, detached
housing development. Low-Density Residential development provides for traditional
single-lot housing development and encourages the establishment and enhancement of
neighborhood quality and character.
High Density Residential
The High Density Residential designation provides opportunities for rental and for-sale
multiple housing. High density residential development provides opportunities for entry-
level housing, senior housing to serve a variety of income levels. High density
residential development provides opportunities for transportation accessibility, enhanced
access to local services in quality designed, functional environments that provide onsite
amenities to serve residents.
Commercial General
The Commercial General Designation provides for office and retail commercial activities
which serve both the local and regional markets. The Commercial General designation
encourages commercial and retail development adjacent to primary transportation
corridors to enhance local and regional accessibility to goods and services.
Light Manufacturing and Industrial
Light Manufacturing and Industrial designation provides opportunities for less intensive
assembly and manufacturing uses that low impact type noise and traffic, as well as non
hazardous operations and/or materials.
Institutional
This designation includes educational facilities, schools, public and civic facilities.
Open Space
The Open Space designation provides for areas for active and passive recreational

activities in a safe, attractive, and comfortable environment.     Open Space facilities
include parks and recreational trails.
Pioneer Boulevard Commercial
The Pioneer Boulevard Commercial designation encourages locally serving commercial
retail development that enhances functional integration and buffering of adjacent single
family neighborhoods. Integrated, mixed-use commercial and residential development
that provides residential development and complimentary, pedestrian-friendly retail
activities are encouraged.
Gateway Community Commercial
The Gateway Community Commercial designation provides for a complimentary mix of
job-creating industrial, manufacturing uses and local/regional-serving commercial retail
and office uses. The Gateway Community Commercial designation encourages
enhancement and expansion of manufacturing and industrial job-creating enterprise to
attract higher wage, high skilled employment opportunities.            Commercial retail
development is encouraged adjacent to the Artesia Boulevard and Pioneer Boulevard
corridors to enhance local and regionally-serving commercial activity. Well designed,
functionally integrated retail development is encouraged at primary intersections.
City Center Mixed Use
The City Center Mixed Use Designation encourages the development and
redevelopment of a complementary mix of commercial retail, office and residential uses
to expand economic vibrancy and livability in the City’s core commercial area. The City
Center Mixed use designation is intended to serve as the City’s core. The City Center
Mixed Use designations encourage physical and functional integration of adjacent
residential areas to ensure the protection and enhancement of adjacent residential
neighborhoods.
South Street Gateway Commercial
The South Street Gateway Commercial designation provides for the enhancement of
retail and service uses along the South Street corridor. The South Street Gateway
Commercial area is envisioned as a commercial node that enhances functional
connectivity with the City Center Mixed Use area.           Higher intensity, integrated
developments area encouraged.          Complimentary urban design and streetscape
improvements are envisioned to enhance the area’s function and a southern gateway to
the City.
Norwalk Boulevard Commercial
The Norwalk Boulevard Commercial designations encourages neighborhood serving
commercial and retail uses to provide greater accessibility to local services for residents
in the southwest portion of the City. Street-oriented commercial retail uses are
encouraged to provide a higher quality pedestrian environment for local patrons and
ensure adjacent residential neighborhoods are buffered from potential

D.        COMMUNITY PLANNING PRINCIPLES
Community Planning Principle LU 1
The Artesia General Plan 2030 will focus on enhancing areas that will allow the
development of mixed-use. This type of development involves a greater utilization of
uses that blends residential, commercial, industrial, or civic/institutional. By combining
complementary uses, mixed-use developments bring energy and vitality to areas during
both daytime and nighttime, and can benefit both residents and the businesses
operating within them. In addition, mixed-use allows the advantage of flexibility of
design to take full advantage of market shifts and land use trends.
Community Planning Principle LU 2
The City of Artesia contains established residential neighborhoods, which are well-
maintained and buffered from the impacts of freeway traffic or extensive industrial and
commercial development. Established neighborhoods in the City include areas with the
City’s older homes, newer residential developments, and some marginally desirable
areas where maintenance has been deferred. The City desires a diverse mix of housing
types, along with high standards for residential property maintenance to preserve real
estate values and high quality of life.
Community Planning Principle LU 3
Existing neighborhood commercial centers and corridors serve as important employment
centers in Artesia. These commercial areas have experienced some deferred
maintenance and signs of property decline have been visible. The Artesia General Plan
2030 will focus on preserving and revitalizing these commercial centers and corridors.
Community Planning Principle LU 4
The City of Artesia is a built out community, with most new development occurring at
infill sites. Redevelopment is occurring throughout the City and some uses are
transitioning to reflect the changing needs of residents and business owners. Maximizing
the uses in current commercial centers is seen as a valuable economic development tool
that will enhance shopping, dining and entertainment options that can improve quality
of life in Artesia.

INTRODUCTION
A.       PURPOSE AND CONTENT
The City of Artesia’s Housing Sub-Element is the component of the City’s General Plan
that addresses housing needs and opportunities for present and future Artesia residents
through 2014. The Housing Sub-Element provides the primary policy guidance for local
decision-making related to housing. The Housing Sub-Element of the General Plan is the
only General Plan Element that requires review and certification by the State of
California.
The Housing Sub-Element provides a detailed analysis of Artesia’s demographic,
economic, and housing characteristics as required by State Law. The Sub-Element also
provides a comprehensive evaluation of the City’s progress in implementing the past
policy and action programs related to housing production, preservation, conservation,
and rehabilitation. Based upon the community’s housing needs, available resources,
constraints, opportunities and past performance, the Housing Sub-Element identifies
goals, policies, actions and objectives that address the housing needs of present and
future Artesians.
B.       HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE PROCESS
The California State Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and
suitable living environment for every Californian as the State’s main housing goal.
Recognizing the important part that local planning programs play in pursuit of this goal,
the Legislature has mandated that all cities and counties prepare a Housing Element as
part of their comprehensive General Plan (California Government Code Section 65580
et al.).
The City of Artesia adopted the previous Housing Element for 1997-2005 in November
of 2003. The City is updating its Housing Element at this time to comply with the update
required of all jurisdictions in the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) region, as well as to respond to the issues that currently face the City. This
Housing Element update covers the planning period from January 2006 thru June 2014.
C.       STATE LAW AND LOCAL PLANNING
1.       Consistency with State Law
The Housing Element is one of the seven General Plan elements mandated by the State
of California, as articulated in Sections 65580 to 65589.8 of the California Government
Code. State Law requires that each jurisdiction’s Housing Element consist of “an
identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of
   Artesia General Plan                                                        H-1

                                                              Housing Sub-Element
goals, policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled program actions for the
preservation, improvement, and development of housing.” The Housing Element plans
for the provision of housing for all segments of the population.
Section 65583 of the Government Code sets forth specific requirements regarding the
scope and content of each Housing Element. Table H1-1 summarizes these
requirements and identifies the applicable sections in the Housing Element where these
requirements are addressed.

2.        General Plan Consistency
The Housing Sub-Element is one component of the City’s overall long-range planning
strategy. The California Government Code requires that the General Plan contain an
integrated, consistent set of goals and policies. The Housing Sub-Element is affected by
policies contained in other elements of the General Plan. For example, the Land Use
Sub-Element designates land for residential development and indicates the type,
location and density of the residential development permitted in the City. Working within
this framework, the Housing Sub-Element identifies goals, policies, actions and
objectives for the planning period that directly addresses the housing needs of Artesia’s
existing and future residents. The policies contained within other elements of the General
Plan affect many aspects of life that residents enjoy – the amount and variety of open
space, the preservation of natural, historic and cultural resources, the permitted noise
levels in residential areas and the safety of the residents in the event of a natural or
man-made disaster.
The Housing Sub-Element policies must be consistent with policies identified in other
Elements of the General Plan. The Housing Sub-Element has been reviewed for
consistency with the City’s other General Plan Elements. The policies and programs in
this Sub-Element reflect the policy direction contained in other parts of the General Plan.
As portions of the General Plan are amended in the future, this Housing Sub-Element
will be reviewed to ensure that internal consistency is maintained.

3.      Relationship to Other Plans and Programs
The Housing Sub-Element identifies goals, objectives, policies and action programs for
the 2006-2014 Planning Period that directly addresses the housing needs of Artesia.
There are a number of City plans and programs which work to implement the goals and
policies of the Housing Sub-Element. These include the City’s Municipal Code, Specific
Plans and Redevelopment Plan.
a. Artesia Municipal Code
The Artesia Municipal Code contains the regulatory and penal ordinances and certain
administrative ordinances of the City, codified pursuant to Sections 50022.1 through
50022.8 and 50022.10 of the Government Code. The Artesia Municipal Code includes
the City’s Subdivision and Zoning regulations.
The Subdivision Chapter of the Municipal Code regulates the design, development and
implementation of land division. It applies when a parcel is divided into two or more
parcels; a parcel is consolidated with one or more other parcels; or the boundaries of
two or more parcels are adjusted to change the size and/or configuration of the parcels.
The Zoning Chapter of the Municipal Code is the primary tool for implementing the
General Plan, and is designed to protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of
the people. The Zoning Chapter designates various districts and outlines the permitted,
conditionally permitted, and prohibited uses for each zone district. Finally, the Zoning
Chapter provides property development standards for each zone district and overall
administrative and legislative procedures.
b. Redevelopment Plans
The State Legislature allows cities to adopt Redevelopment Plans under the State of
California’s Community Redevelopment Law (CRL). The Redevelopment Plans are
intended to reverse deteriorating economic and physical conditions; redevelop blighted,
underutilized and vacant properties; improve public facilities and infrastructure; and
produce revenues through the development of job-creating properties. These plans are
one of the more powerful means cities have to implement the goals and policies set
forth in their General Plan. Artesia has one redevelopment project area with
approximately 245 acres of land.
c. Specific Plans
Specific Plans are customized regulatory documents that provide focused guidance and
regulations for a particular area to address the specific characteristics or needs for that
area. They generally include a land use plan, circulation plan, infrastructure plan,
zoning classifications, development standards, design guidelines, and implementation
plan. The City has three approved Specific Plans listed below.

      Pioneer Specific Plan
      South Specific Plan
      Artesia Boulevard Industrial Area Specific Plan
The City is also currently drafting the Downtown Specific Plan.
D.     HOUSING SUB-ELEMENT ORGANIZATION
California Government Code Section 65583 requires a jurisdiction’s Housing Element
include the following components:
      A review of the previous Element’s goals, policies, objectives and programs to
       ascertain the effectiveness of each of these components, as well as the overall
       effectiveness of the Housing Element;
      An assessment of housing need and an inventory of resources and constraints
       related to meeting these needs;
      A statement of goals, policies and quantified objectives related to the
       maintenance, preservation, improvement and development of housing; and,
      A policy program that provides a schedule of actions that the City is undertaking
       or intends to undertake implementing the policies set forth in the Housing
       Element.
The Artesia Housing Sub-Element is organized into five parts:
    1. Introduction – Explains the purpose, process and contents of the Housing Sub-
       Element.
    2. Community Profile – Describes the demographic, economic and housing
       characteristics of Artesia.
    3. Housing Needs – Analyzes the current and projected housing needs in Artesia.
    4. Resources and Constraints Analysis – Analyzes the actual and potential
       governmental and non-governmental constraints to the rehabilitation,
       preservation, conservation, and construction of housing.
    5. Housing Plan – Details specific policies and programs the City of Artesia will
       carry out over the planning period to address the City’s housing goals.
Artesia General Plan                                                           H-5

                                                       Housing Sub-Element
Given the detail and lengthy analysis in developing the Housing Sub-Element,
supporting background material is included in the following appendices:
        Appendix A: Community Outreach
        Appendix B: Residential Land Resources
        Appendix C: Review of 1998-2005 Housing Element Performance
        Appendix D: Glossary of Housing Terms
E.       CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
The California Government Code requires that local governments make diligent efforts
to solicit public participation from all segments of the community in the development of
the Housing Element. In compliance with this requirement, the City conducted public
outreach efforts including a Community Workshop on March 6, 2008. The Workshop
was held at the Albert O. Little Community Center and was publicly advertised on the
City website, in the City newsletter, The Artesian, in the local newspaper, and through
flyers posted in public areas. In addition to the Community Workshop, public testimony
will be taken during the Planning Commission and City Council hearings related to the
Housing Element update.

COMMUNITY PROFILE
An accurate assessment of existing and future housing needs in the City of Artesia is
needed to form the basis for establishing goals, policies, actions and objectives in the
Housing Element. This section presents demographic, economic and housing factors that
influence the demand for and availability of housing.
A.      POPULATION TRENDS AND CHARACTERISTICS
1. Historical, Existing, and Forecast Growth
The City of Artesia is one of 88 cities located in Los Angeles County. Los Angeles County
has experienced a steady growth rate over the last decade and a half. As indicated in
Table H2-1, the total County population increased by approximately 656,174 residents,
or 7.4 percent, from 1990 to 2000. County population trends within the current decade
have already begun to show a significant growth. Table H2-1 shows that from 2000 to
2008, the Los Angeles County population has already increased by 844,512 residents.
This 8.9 percent population increase in the last eight years has exceeded the previous
decade’s total growth.

As shown in Table H2-2, from 1980 to 1990, the County experienced a 19 percent
population growth, which slowed to 7.4 percent from 1990 to 2000. Population trends
in Artesia compared to the County of Los Angeles show that regional population
changes did not have as large of an affect on the City. Artesia’s growth during the
1980s and 1990s was slower than Los Angeles County. From 1980 to 1990, the City’s
population increased by 1,163 residents (8.1 percent), approximately 10.9 percent
lower than the total County-wide growth rate. From 1990 through 2000, Artesia’s total
growth was 5.9 percent, 1.5 percent below the County’s total growth.

The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), as part of its mandated
planning functions, is the lead agency for the development of regional population,
employment, and household forecasts. SCAG projections attempt to balance regional-
level growth factors with local land use policies and environments. Figure H2-1 shows
the population growth forecast for Artesia through 2030. SCAG forecasts a leveling in
growth within the City, with a forecasted population of 17,500 residents by 2030.

C.      HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Before current housing trends can be understood and future needs anticipated,
household characteristics need to be identified in the City. The following is an analysis of
household size, household growth, tenure, and vacancy trends. By definition, a
“household” consists of all the people occupying a dwelling unit, whether or not they are
related. A single person living in an apartment is a household, just as a couple with two
children and an unrelated tenant living in the same dwelling unit is considered a
household.
1.     Household Formation and Composition
As shown in Table H2-8, the 2000 Census identified 4,470 households in Artesia, an
increase of 102 households from the 1990 Census total of 4,368 households. This
represents a 2.3 percent increase over the decade. As of 2008, the State Department of
Finance estimates there are 4,713 households in the City. Over the eight-year period
from 2000 to 2008, the number of households has increased by approximately 5.4
percent.

As shown in Table H2-9, the 1990 US Census reported the average household size for
Artesia was 3.41 persons per household. Persons per household increased to 3.54
persons in 2000 and to 3.71 persons per household by 2008. This trend was similar for
the entire County, which averaged 2.91 persons per household in 1990 and increased
to 3.12 by 2007. The larger household size in the City indicates both a need for larger
housing units and a potential for overcrowding when larger units are not available at
monthly costs affordable to the residents.

2.        Household Income
The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) develops an
annual median household income for the purpose of determining program eligibility.
According to HUD, the 2008 median family income (MFI) for Los Angels County,
including the City of Artesia, was $59,800. The State of California uses five income
categories to determine housing affordability. These categories are as follow:
         Extremely-low income – 30% or less of the median income;
         Very-low income – 31% to 50% of the median income;
         Low income – 51% to 80% of the median income;
         Moderate income – 81% to 120% of the median income;
         Above-moderate income – greater than 120% of the median income.
Table H2-11 shows the income categories and their ranges.

                                                           Housing Sub-Element
The US Census makes a distinction between a “household” and a “family”. A “family”
consists of two or more related persons living as a unit, which may include single
parents, children, and extended family members (i.e. grandparents). A “household” may
be comprised of unrelated persons (i.e., roommates, unmarried couples, and single
persons), as well as households falling under the “family“definition.
Household income data from 1999 is shown in Table H2-12. According to the 2000
Census, approximately 40 percent of Artesia’s residents earned less than $25,000,
falling into the very-low income category. Fifty-three percent earned less than $35,000,
falling into the very-low and low income categories.

D.       HOUSING INVENTORY AND MARKET CONDITIONS
This section summarizes the current housing inventory and prevailing market conditions
in the City of Artesia. Analysis of past housing trends and existing housing stock
conditions provides a method for projecting the future housing needs of Artesia.
1.       Housing Stock Profile
Data from the US Census indicates there were 4,598 dwelling units in Artesia in 2000.
Total dwelling units in the City increased by approximately 64 units between 1990 and
2000 (approximately 1.4 percent). During this period, dwelling units in Los Angeles
County increased by approximately 3.4 percent. Despite the growth rate difference,
approximately 0.14 percent of the units in the overall County continue to be located in
Artesia.

       Sources: US Census 1990 STF3 H001, US Census 2000 H1
Because there has not been a substantial increase in dwelling units between 1990 and
2000, housing inventory type has remained relatively constant. According to Table H2-
15, the majority of housing units (approximately 71.7 percent) in the City of Artesia were
single-family, detached in 1990. This number decreased to 69.2 percent in 2000.
While the total number of single-family detached units fell from 3,252 in 1990 to 3,184
     H-18                                                               Artesia General Plan
                                                          Housing Sub-Element
in 2000, single-family attached units and multiple-family units increased by 33 units and
129 units respectively. Mobile-home units increase by three units from 1990 to 2000.

4.       Unit Type
As of 2000, Artesia’s occupied housing units have consisted primarily of single-family
detached housing, accounting for 69.3 percent of total housing units. Multiple-family
(5+) units make up approximately 14.8 percent of the total units, followed by single-
family attached at 7.1 percent, and multiple-family (2-4 units) at 6.8 percent. When total
occupied units are separated into owner-occupied and renter-occupied units,
characteristics vary. Single-family, detached units make up a larger number of the total
owner-occupied units (85.5 percent) than of the renter occupied units (48.3 percent),
while multiple-family units comprise a greater percentage (29.9 percent) of renter-
occupied units than owner-occupied units (3.1 percent).

5.      Vacancy Rates
Vacancy rates are a measure of the general availability of housing. They also indicate
how well the types of available units meet the housing market demand. A low vacancy
rate suggests that households may have difficulty finding housing within their price
range, whereas a high vacancy rate indicates that either the units available are not
suited to the population’s needs or there is an oversupply of housing units. The
availability of vacant housing units provides households with choices of type and price to
accommodate their specific needs. Low vacancy rates can result in higher prices, limited
choices, and settling with inadequate housing. It may also contribute to overcrowding.
A vacancy rate between four and six is considered “healthy.” As shown in Table H2-19,
2.8 percent of Artesia’s housing units were vacant in 2008. This vacancy rate is lower
than Los Angeles County’s vacancy rate of 4.2 percent in 2008.

6.      Age of Housing Stock
Table H2-20 summarizes the City’s housing stock by the year built. Age can be an
indicator of general housing stock conditions and a factor in determining the need for
rehabilitation. Without proper maintenance, housing units deteriorate over time. The
older the units, the more likely they will need major repairs. Additionally, older housing
units may not be built to current building codes including fire safety standards.
In general, housing that is 30 years or older may need minor repairs. Housing over 50
years old is considered aged, and is more likely to need major repairs. In Artesia,
approximately 87.4 percent of housing units were built prior to 1980, and 67.1 percent
were built prior to 1960.

Table H2-21 breaks down the housing units by both year of construction and tenure.
Approximately 90 percent of owner-occupied units were built prior to 1980 and 44.4
percent were built prior to 1960. Of the renter-occupied units, 84.4 percent were
constructed prior to 1980 and 32.3 percent were constructed prior to 1960.

7.      Housing Conditions
Housing units where living conditions, as defined in Section 17920.3 of the California
Health and Safety Code, endanger the health and safety of the occupants are
considered substandard. Households living in substandard conditions are considered to
be in need of housing assistance, even if they are not seeking an alternative housing
arrangement, due to threat to health and safety.
In 2008, the City of Artesia completed a comprehensive housing conditions survey. The
survey documented the roof, wall, foundation, door, and window, landscape and
fencing conditions of all housing units within identified focus areas. Based on the survey,
approximately 76 housing units in Artesia are in poor condition and 343 are in need of
improvement. Housing units in these categories have the potential to benefit from
rehabilitation. Housing units in poor condition may require replacement, depending on
specific items in need of repair. Table H2-22 summarizes the units needing
improvement and in poor condition.

In addition to structural deficiencies and standards, the lack of infrastructure and utilities
serves as an indicator for substandard conditions. According to the 2000 Census, 38
housing units lacked complete plumbing facilities, 33 of which were renter-occupied. 82
of the housing units lacked complete kitchen facilities, 77 of which were renter-occupied.
8.      Housing Costs and Rents
a.      Existing and New Home Price Trends
In 2000, the median value for all owner-occupied units in Artesia was $187,300. Table
H2-23 shows the number of housing units by price range. In 2000, 11.6 percent of the
housing units were valued below $100,000. Approximately 46.8 percent were valued
between $100,000 and $199,999. Approximately 30.9 percent were valued between
$200,000 and $299,999. Approximately 10.8 percent were valued at $300,000 or

c.       Affordability Gap Analysis
By comparing the costs of homeownership and renting to the household’s ability to pay,
an affordability gap can be determined. Housing affordability is defined as paying no
more than 30 percent of the household income on housing expenses. Table H2-26
summarizes the affordable rents and purchase prices based on the 2008 HUD median
income of $59,800 for Los Angeles County. The affordable purchase price assumes a
6.0 percent interest rate with a 30-year mortgage.

d.     Rental Affordability
The average rent for the smallest of units (a studio apartment) is higher than the rental
payment affordable for the extremely-low and very-low income categories. The
affordable rents for the low income category coincide with the average rent for a studio
apartment. The affordable rents for the moderate income category coincide with the
average rent for the 1 and 2 bedroom units. The high cost of rent in Artesia compared
to the affordable rents indicates extremely-low, very-low, and low income households
may have difficulty finding suitable rental housing.
e.     Ownership Affordability
The median sales price in Artesia exceeds the affordability range for all income
categories except above-moderate income households. Those households in the
extremely-low through moderate income categories will likely find it difficult to afford
purchasing a home.

HOUSING NEEDS
The following analysis describes housing needs relative to various segments of the
population.
Several factors influence the need for housing. The four major housing need categories
discussed in this section are:
         Housing need resulting from population growth and demolition of existing
          housing stock;
         Housing need resulting from overcrowding;
         Housing need resulting from overpayment; and,
         Housing needs of “special needs groups” such as elderly persons, large
          households, female-headed households, persons with disabilities, persons who
          are homeless, and farm workers.
A.        REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
California Housing Law requires regional planning agencies to identify existing and
future housing needs every five years. SCAG is the regional planning agency responsible
for developing the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) and identifying the
existing and growth needs numbers for the cities in the areas encompassed by the
Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange, and Imperial Counties. The
“fair share” allocation concept seeks to ensure that each jurisdiction accepts
responsibility for the housing needs of not only its resident population, but also for those
households who might reasonably be expected to reside within the jurisdiction,
particularly low income households. This assumes the availability of a variety and choice
of housing accommodations appropriate to their needs.
1.        Existing Needs
The RHNA addresses existing housing needs in two subcategories: overpayment and
overcrowding.
a.        Households Overpaying for Housing
Overpayment refers to households that pay more than 30 percent of their gross income
for housing. High housing costs can cause a household to spend a disproportionate
percentage of their income for housing. This may cause a series of related problems,
including a deterioration of housing stock because costs associated with maintenance
must be sacrificed for more immediate expenses (i.e., food, clothing, medical care, and
utilities). It may also result in the selection of units that do not suit the space or amenity
needs of the household.
                                                                                     H-27
    Artesia General Plan

                                                             HOUSING SUB-ELEMENT
Based on SCAG’s data, 22 percent of the total households in Artesia are overpaying for
housing. Of the owner-occupied households, approximately 23 percent are overpaying.
Of the renter-occupied households, approximately 28 percent are overpaying. Over 37
percent of the owner-occupied households that are overpaying earn over 95 percent of
the median income. Some owner-occupied households choose to allocate a higher
portion of their disposable monthly income to housing costs in light of investment
qualities of ownership. Renter-occupied households earning between 30 and 50 percent
of the median income comprise approximately 30 percent of the renter-occupied
households experiencing overpayment. Renter-occupied households earning between 50
and 80 percent of the median income comprise approximately 44 percent of the renter-
occupied households experiencing overpayment. This data indicates a need for
increased rental housing affordable to the low and very-low income categories.

b.       Overcrowding
Overcrowding is defined as households having an average of more than one person per
room, not including bathrooms, kitchens, and hallways. Effects of overcrowding include
strain on public facilities and services, reduced quality of the physical environment, and
deterioration of the housing stock.
According to SCAG, 25 percent of Artesia’s total households experience overcrowding.
Thirty percent of renter-occupied, and 21 percent of owner-occupied households,
experience overcrowding. This data is consistent with the high number of persons per
household in the City. Of the overcrowded owner-occupied households, 53 percent earn
over 95 percent of the median income. Twenty-eight percent of the overcrowded renter-
occupied units earn over 95 percent of the median income and 31 percent earn
between 50 and 80 percent of the median income.

2.       2006-2014 Growth Needs
A local jurisdiction’s “fair share” of regional housing need is the number of additional
housing units that will need to be constructed in the jurisdiction to accommodate the
anticipated population growth, to replace expected demolitions and conversion of
housing to non-housing uses, and to achieve a healthy vacancy rate. The allocation is
divided into the four household categories used in the Federal and State programs: very
low, low, moderate, and above moderate. In addition to these four categories, the City
must address the needs of extremely-low income households. The extremely-low income
need is assumed to be 50 percent of the very-low income allocation.
Table H3-3 illustrates the City of Artesia’s allocation for the 2006-2014 planning
period.

B.       SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
There are certain segments of the population that may experience more difficulty in
finding decent, affordable housing due to their special circumstances. These groups
include the elderly, large families (5 or more persons), female-headed households,
persons with disabilities, homeless persons, and farm workers.
In addition to the data from the 2000 U.S. Census and the 2006 ACS, this section also
uses data from the 2000 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS)
published by HUD. The CHAS provides information related to households with housing
problems, including overpayment, overcrowding and/or without complete kitchen
facilities and plumbing systems. The CHAS data is based on the Census 2000 data files
and are mostly comprised of a variety of housing need variables split by HUD-defined
income limits and HUD-specified housing types.
1.       Elderly Persons
The special housing needs of the elderly are an important concern since many retired
persons are likely to be on fixed incomes. In addition, the elderly may have special
needs related to housing construction and location. The elderly often require ramps,
handrails, lower cabinets and counters to allow greater access and mobility. They also
may need special security devices for their homes to allow greater self-protection. Due to
limited mobility, the elderly also typically desire access to services and amenities (i.e.,
medical and shopping) and public transit facilities. Generally, the elderly population
within the community has four primary concerns:
        Income – The elderly population typically lives on a fixed income;
        Household Composition – The elderly (particularly women) often live alone;
        Transportation – The elderly population is more likely to rely on public
         transportation; and
        Health Care – The elderly have a significantly greater need for health care.
In 2000, the US Census reported that 12.4 percent of Artesia’s residents were elderly
(age 65 and over). Table H3-4 shows the number of householders by age in Artesia. In
2000, 24 percent of the owner-occupied households and 14.9 percent of the renter-
occupied households had an elderly householder.

Table H3-5 shows the number and percent of elderly persons (ages 65 and over) within
three disability categories that may limit independent living. According to Table H3-5,
the largest disability category within the elderly population is self-care, and at least one
other disability. Males in this category make up approximately 11 percent of the total
elderly males; while females in this category make up 14.9 percent of all elderly
females. Approximately 32.8 percent of elderly persons have a disability that limits their
ability to live independently.

       increasing number of elderly persons in the population is creating a demand for more
       affordable housing. The City will address the needs of the elderly population through the
       development of policies and programs that will address affordability and special design
       guidelines for the elderly. Table H3-6 provides a summary of housing problems
       experienced by elderly households in Artesia.

2.      Large Families
The 2000 US Census reported 1,191 households in the City of Artesia with five or more
persons. Large households are included as a Special Needs group because they typically
require larger dwellings with more bedrooms. These households report higher cost
burden and a higher percentage of housing problems. This is especially true for renter
households because multi-family units are typically smaller than single-family units.
Table H3-6 shows that there were 506 large households occupying rental units, which
represents 11.3 percent of all renter households. The number of large households in
owner-occupied units was higher than those in renter-occupied units at 685 units (15.3
percent of total households). As of 2000, large households constituted 26.6 percent of
total households in the City.

According to the 2000 CHAS data, 32.1 percent of large renter-occupied households
and 31.9 percent of large owner-occupied households experience overpayment.
Currently, less than five percent of the City’s rental housing stock has four or more
bedrooms (refer to Table H2-18) resulting in a high percentage of large family
households that are forced to live in overcrowded situations. To address this need, the
City shall develop policies that will establish incentives and programs to encourage the
development of housing for large families. Table H3-8 provides a summary of housing
problems experienced by large households in the City of Artesia.

3.       Female-Headed Households
Female-headed households are included as a Special Needs group because of their
historic low rate of homeownership, lower incomes, and high poverty rates. Table H3-9,
Tenure in Female-Headed Households, represents the total female-headed households
in the City in 2000. Of the total 593 female-headed households in 2000, approximately
312 (52.6 percent) were in owner-occupied units, compared to 281 in renter-occupied
units (47.4 percent). Of the total 261 female householder with no husband present, with
children under 18, there was an 18.8 percent ownership rate of the unit, compared to
female headed households without children which has an owner occupied rate of 79.2
percent.

4.       Persons with Disabilities
Access and affordability are two major housing needs of persons with disabilities. Access
is particularly important for those with physical disabilities and they may require specially
designed housing.
Lack of affordable accommodations and inadequate accessibility can be caused by a
variety of factors, including: a) subtle, or not so subtle, discrimination; b) lack of
financial resources and incentives available to those who want to make their buildings
accessible; and, d) lack of knowledge as to how accessibility can be improved.
California Administrative Code Title 24 sets forth access and adaptability requirements
for persons with disabilities. These regulations apply to public buildings (i.e., offices,
stores, and motels), employee housing, factory-built housing, and privately funded,
newly constructed apartment houses containing five or more dwelling units. The
regulations also require that features such as rampways, doorways, and restrooms be
designed to enable free access to the handicapped. These standards are not required in
new single-family residential construction.
The 2000 Census reports that there were 812 residents with some type of reported
disability in Artesia (refer to Table H3-11). This constituted approximately 5 percent of
the total 2000 population in the City. The housing needs of persons with disabilities vary
with the type and severity of the particular disability. Not all persons with disabilities
require specialized housing. While the needs of certain individuals may be met without
special housing accommodations, persons with disabilities affecting mobility often need
specially designed, barrier-free housing. Some, but not all, persons with disabilities also
need housing assistance of a financial nature. Age categories identified in Table H3-11
Artesia General Plan                                                             H-37

indicate that the largest cohort of individuals with disabilities are 65 or older, and a
larger proportion of this age group has more than one disability.

Table H3-12 provides a summary of housing problems experienced by households with
mobility and self-care limitations in the City of Artesia. According to the 2000 CHAS
data, 52.6 percent of the total number of households with mobility and self-care
limitations experience some sort of housing problem. As previously stated, these
problems include overpayment, overcrowding, and/or lack of complete kitchen facilities
and plumbing systems.

5.      Homeless Population
The most recent enumeration of homeless persons in the Greater Los Angeles area,
including the City of Artesia, took place in January of 2007. Artesia is part of the East
Los Angeles Service Planning Area (SPA 7). The point-in-time results showed there were
5,580 homeless persons in SPA 7. The annual projection is estimated at 14,365
instances of homelessness per year. Within the estimated homeless population, sub-
populations have been identified as listed in Table H3-13.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, Lakewood Station, Artesia Team,
estimates there are 3 to 4 homeless persons within Artesia at a given point in time. The
City boundaries encompass approximately 1.6 square miles of land. Limited areas for
homeless persons to stay in, combined with limited social services within the City leads
to a low homeless population.
The City of Artesia does not have a homeless shelter, and any homeless cases are
referred to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD) or to a social service
program in the area. Social service programs currently available for the City are in the
Cities of Long Beach and Los Angeles. The capacity to meet the homeless needs is
discussed in Section 4: Resources and Constraints.
6.      Farm Workers
Farm workers are defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
seasonal agricultural work. In 2000, only 18 of Artesia’s residents reported being
employed in agriculture (or related industries). With such a small percentage of residents
working in active agricultural production and harvest, there is no apparent or
recognized need for farm worker housing.

     C.       EXTREMELY-LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
     Extremely Low-Income households are defined as households with income less than 30
     percent of the MFI. The provisions of Government Code Section 65583 (a)(1) require
     quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of Extremely Low-
     Income households. In 2000, 27.8 percent of Artesia households were within the
     Extremely Low-Income category (refer to Table H2-12; household income less than
     $15,000).
     Table H2-14 provides a summary of housing problems experienced by extremely low-
     income households in the City of Artesia. Extremely Low-Income renter-occupied
     households experience both overpayment and overcrowding. According to data from the
     2000 CHAS provided by HUD, 64.8 percent of Extremely Low-Income households
     experience at least one type of housing problem.

RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
Actual or potential constraints can affect the development of new housing or the
maintenance of existing units for all income levels. Governmental and non-
governmental constraints in Artesia are similar to those in other jurisdictions in the
region and are discussed below. One of the most significant constraints to housing in
Artesia is the limited amount of available land and, as elsewhere in the Los Angeles
County region, the high cost of land.
A.       GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Governmental constraints can limit the supply of housing in the region, making it
difficult to meet the demand for housing. Governmental constraints can include policies,
standards, requirements, or actions imposed by the various levels of government upon
land use and development. These constraints may include land use controls, growth
management measures, building codes, fees and processing, and permit procedures.
1.       Land Use Controls
Land use controls take a number of forms that affect the development of residential
units. These controls include General Plan policies, zoning designations (and the
resulting use restrictions, development standards, and permit processing requirements),
development fees and local growth management programs.
a.       General Plan
Each city and county is required by State Law to have a General Plan, which establishes
policy guidelines for development. The General Plan is the foundation of all land use
controls in a jurisdiction. The Land Use Element of the General Plan identifies the
location, distribution, and density of the land uses within the City. General Plan
residential densities are expressed as dwelling units per acre. The Artesia General Plan
identifies three residential land use designations, as shown in Table H4-1.

be possible at complete build-out. The Department of Finance (DOF) reports an
estimated 4,713 units existed within the City as of January 2008.
To make a housing project economically feasible based on land costs, certain densities
are necessary. HCD has established generally accepted standards for density based on
desired affordability.
        Very-low- and low income: Minimum of 20 units per acre (based on AB 2348)
        Moderate income: Minimum of 11-30 units per acre
        Above-moderate income: Up to 11 units per acre
b.       Zoning Code
The Zoning Code is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan. It is designed to
protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare.
Table H4-2 summarizes the permitted residential uses in each zone within Artesia. The
A-1 (Agriculture-Single Family Residential), R-1 (Single-Family Residential), M-R (Multiple
Family Residential), and MD-R (Medium Density Residential) zones are the primary
residential zones. Single-family uses are permitted in all of the residential zones, while
multi-family developments are permitted in M-R zones. Attached duplexes are permitted
in the MD-R and M-R zones.

Single family detached units with 5 or more bedrooms and congregate living health
facilities require a conditional use permit. Conditional use permits are granted by the
Planning Commission through a public hearing process. The City has standard
conditions, found in the Municipal Code, for each of these uses. The requirement for a
conditional use permit is to ensure design compatibility with the surrounding
neighborhood and ensure the project provides the adequate interior and exterior
amenities for the residents.
Single family detached units with 5 or more bedrooms must satisfy the following
conditions:
        The lot or parcel is adequate in size to accommodate a dwelling with five (5) or
         more bedrooms and still provide open space, landscaping, and other outdoor
         amenities as required by this chapter.
        The mass and scale of the dwelling unit is harmonious with the character of the
         neighborhood and with the existing development pattern on abutting lots or
         parcels.
        The proposed physical orientation of the dwelling unit on the lot or parcel is
         appropriate for the shape of the lot, the location of outdoor living areas, and the
         placement and orientation of surrounding homes and structures.

       The dwelling is designed for only single-family use.
Congregate living health facilities must satisfy the following conditions:
       The lot or parcel has adequate outdoor area for all required parking, including
        parking required for employees and visitors while maintaining a residential
        appearance. In addition, an outdoor area in the rear yard shall be provided for
        residents and employees of the facility;
       The structure and lot to be utilized comply with any and all development
        standards applicable to single family dwellings except as otherwise provided in
        this subsection;
       The structure and lot or parcel to be utilized are physically and aesthetically
        compatible with surrounding structures and lots and the character of the
        neighborhood;
       The proposed facility will provide loading and unloading facilities as may be
        necessary to protect and ensure the safety of persons unloading or loading, and
        to avoid interference with traffic;
       In addition to the parking otherwise required for single-family residences
        pursuant to this Code, one paved parking space shall be provided for each
        nonresident employee or aide;
       No signage advertising the facility shall be allowed on or off the premises;
       Facilities necessary to accommodate medical waste shall be provided in a State
        authorized container that is secured and out of public access and public view;
       The applicant applies for and obtains Development Review Board approval of
        the proposed structure, site plan, landscaping, general design and development,
        setbacks, height, and vehicle and pedestrian ingress and egress;
       The applicant/operator obtains and maintains a current business license from
        the City. At the time of obtaining and/or renewing the required business license,
        the applicant/operator shall submit evidence of having obtained the necessary
        and current State license together with proof of the most recent inspection by the
        State of the facility; and
       The facility shall be operated in a manner that complies with the City of Artesia
        Noise Ordinance.
       The operator, as part of the application process, shall state whether or not the

        had any State license or City or County approval to operate such facility
        suspended or revoked, including the dates and locations of all such suspensions
        or revocations.
Artesia’s residential zoning designations, as shown in Table H4-2, control both the use
and development standards of each specific parcel.

The A-1, R-1, and MDR residential zones require development to be built no higher than
2 stories or 30 feet while the MR zone permits development to be built no higher than 2
stories or 35 feet. Buildings in the MR zone may exceed the maximum height with a
conditional use permit granted by the Planning Commission.

c.       Parking Requirements
Table H4-4 summarizes the parking requirements that exist in the City. Parking
requirements do not strain the development of housing directly; however, since required
parking spaces in the City of Artesia must be located on the same lot or property, these
requirements may reduce the amount of available lot area for residential development.

Based on the units constructed or entitled during the current Planning Period, The City
has not found the parking requirements to unduly impact the cost and supply of
housing, nor the ability for projects to achieve maximum densities. However, to ensure
the City’s parking requirements are not a potential constraint to residential development,
especially new housing units affordable to lower and moderate income households, the
City will include a program in this Housing Element update to evaluate and make
appropriate revisions to the residential parking requirements.
d.       Affordable Housing Incentives and Density Bonus
The City of Artesia adopted Ordinance No. 640 in 2002, which created a density bonus
and developer incentives for affordable housing. The City has not updated its Municipal
Code to reflect the requirements set forth in Senate Bill 1818.
Currently, a density bonus of 25 percent is allowed for projects that provide for one of
the following:
       H-46                                                               Artesia General Plan

                                                        Housing Sub-Element
    1. At least 10 percent of the units are affordable to households earning no more
        than 50 percent of the median income;
    2. At least 20 percent of the units are affordable to households earning no more
        than 60 percent of the median income; or
    3. At least 50 percent of the units are designated for qualifying senior citizens.
A density bonus of 50 percent is allowed for projects that provide for one of the
following:
    1. At least 20 percent of the units are affordable to households earning no more
        than 50 percent of the median income; or
    2. At least 40 percent of the units are affordable to households earning no more
        than 60 percent of the median income.
The developer must also provide on-site amenities based on the number of units
constructed and the project must remain affordable for at least 30 years.
In addition to the density bonus, the developer is granted one incentive from the
following list:
    1. A reduction in the required amount of parking for the project, not to exceed ten
        percent;
    2. A reduction in the required amount of open space for the project, not to exceed
        ten percent;
    3. A reduction in the required setback dimensions for the project, not to exceed fifty
        percent of required setback dimensions, provided that a setback shall not be less
        than five feet; or
    4. An increase in the maximum height permitted, not to exceed one additional
        story, provided that there is a minimum setback between the additional floor and
        the lower floors of the building of at least ten feet.
e.      Second Dwelling Units
Second dwelling units provide additional opportunities to provide affordable housing.
These are primarily intended for the elderly or family of the primary owner, or as a
rental unit for additional income. Second dwelling units are permitted by-right in the A-1
and R-1 zones provided certain size, setback, and design conditions are met. In the A-1
zone, the lot size must be at least 12,000 square feet. In the R-1 zone, the lot size must
be at least 10,000 square feet. Requirements for second units in both zones include the
following:
Artesia General Plan                                                             H-47
                                                         Housing Sub-Element
    1. The second dwelling unit must be located to the rear of the primary residence;
    2. The unit shall be a minimum of 150 square feet or the minimum size of an
        efficiency unit as defined by the State, whichever is greater;
    3. The unit shall not exceed 640 square feet;
    4. The primary residence and second dwelling unit shall not exceed a structural lot
        coverage of 50 percent;
    5. The height of the second dwelling unit shall not exceed the height of the primary
        residence;
    6. The same setbacks for the primary residence apply and there shall be at least 20
        feet of separation between the primary residence and a detached secondary
        dwelling unit;
    7. A maximum of one secondary dwelling unit is allowed on a lot;
    8. One common front entrance is permitted for attached secondary dwelling unit
        within or a part of the primary residence. The entrance for a detached secondary
        unit shall be located so that it is not visible from the street or the entrance to the
        primary residence; and,
    9. At least one enclosed parking space per bedroom shall be provided for the
        secondary dwelling unit.
In addition to the above requirements, the secondary dwelling unit shall be
architecturally compatible with the primary residence. The property owner must reside in
one of the residential structures and the secondary dwelling unit cannot be sold as a
separate property.
f.      Senior Housing
Rest homes and homes for the aged are permitted in the M-R zone. Since elderly
persons require different dwelling characteristics, developments for seniors require a
conditional use permit. Project proposals are evaluated for their design and
compatibility with the surroundings. For rest homes and homes for the aged, one
parking space for every four residents in accordance with the residential capacity of the
home as listed on the required license or permit, and one parking space for each
employee is required.
There are currently four senior housing facilities located within the City – The Christian
Home for the Aged, Windsor Palms (formerly Twin Palms Care Center), Founder’s

     H-48                                                             Artesia General Plan

                                                         Housing Sub-Element
Recent changes to State Law (SB 2) require that cities identify sites that are adequately
zoned for emergency shelters and transitional housing. In addition, cities must not
unduly discourage or deter these uses. There are no emergency shelters or transitional
housing facilities within the City. The City’s Municipal Code does not address or make
reference to development of emergency shelters or transitional housing in the City.
Based on the provisions of SB 2, cities with an unmet need for emergency shelters are
required to identify a zone(s) where emergency shelters will be allowed as a permitted
use without a conditional use permit or other discretionary permit. The identified zone(s)
must have sufficient capacity to accommodate the shelter need and, at a minimum,
provide capacity for at least one year-round shelter.
To comply with SB 2, the City will consider amending the Light Manufacturing and
Industrial Zone (M-1), or other suitable zone(s) with sufficient capacity, to permit
emergency shelters without discretionary approvals. The City has analyzed the existing
land uses and development standards of the M-1 Zone and has found the Zone has the
capacity and is suitable to accommodate at least one year-round shelter meeting the
local homeless needs described in Section 3: Housing Needs.
The M-1 Zone currently accommodates small to moderate sized industry as well as
limited commercial and service uses. Parcels in the M-1 Zone are located in close
proximity to Pioneer Boulevard, the primary north-south arterial in the City. Norwalk
Transit and LA Metro operate bus lines along Pioneer Boulevard, making the M-1 Zone
accessible by public transit. The M-1 Zone is also located adjacent to commercial areas,
providing access to services and employment centers. The M-1 Zone encompasses
approximately 28 acres.
Table H4-5 summarizes the development standards for the M-1 Zone.

h.       Housing for Persons with Disabilities
The City permits in the R-1 and M-R zones, subject to a conditional use permit,
congregate living health facilities serving more than 6 persons or having more than 6
beds for persons who are terminally ill or who are catastrophically and severely
disabled. The City does not address or make reference to development of housing for
persons with disabilities when there are 6 or less residents. If there are 6 or less
residents, the City does not differentiate the facility from any other residential use in the
same zone.
The City’s Municipal Code defines “family” as a person or persons, related by blood,
marriage, or adoption, living together as a single housekeeping unit, in a bachelor
apartment, or dwelling unit. Family shall also include a group of not more than five
persons, including roomers but excluding servants, unrelated by blood, marriage, or
adoption, living together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit.
The City currently does not have formal procedures adopted for processing reasonable
accommodation requests for persons with disabilities. The City handles such requests on
a case-by-case basis through an administrative review process when possible. The City’s
Housing Plan shall include an action to develop formal reasonable accommodation
procedures.
i.       Building Codes and Enforcement
Building and safety codes are adopted to preserve public health and safety, and to
ensure the construction of safe and decent housing. They also have the potential to
increase the cost of housing construction or maintenance.
The City has adopted Title 26 (Building Code) of the Los Angeles County Code which
adopts by reference the 2007 California Building Code. The California Building Code
has established construction standards for all residential buildings. These codes provide
minimum standards necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of Artesia’s
residents.
The City also requires that all new residential construction comply with the Federal
Americans with Disability Act (ADA), which includes accessibility requirements for certain
types of buildings. Specific accessibility requirements for residential buildings are also
contained in the California Building Code.
      H-50                                                             Artesia General Plan

The City’s Code Enforcement Officers are responsible for investigating complaints of
violations of building codes, zoning ordinances, sign regulations, abatement, and public
nuisance ordinances.
j.         Development Fees
Various development and permit fees are charged by the City and other agencies to
cover administrative processing costs associated with development. These fees ensure
quality development and the provision of adequate public services, and are based on
the type, size, and potential impacts on various services and infrastructures. However,
because these fees are often passed down to renters and homeowners in the
rent/purchase price of the unit, they affect the affordability of housing. One method of
determining whether fees are excessive and represent barriers to affordable housing is
by comparing fees to jurisdictions in the region.
Artesia’s building permit, permit plan check, and inspection services are provided by the
County of Los Angeles’ Building and Safety Department, which also provides the same
services for other cities in the area, including Lakewood and Cerritos.
The City of Artesia is unique to other cities in the region in that it does not charge
developers’ or impact fees.

k.        Local Processing and Permit Procedures
Considerable holding costs are associated with delays in processing development
applications and plans. Two levels of decision-making bodies govern the review process
in Artesia: the Planning Commission and City Council. The City previously had a
separate Development Review Board. The duties and powers of the Development Review
Board have been transferred to the Planning Commission.
Depending on the type of entitlement required, a development may be subject to various
levels of review. All residential projects are subject to design review by the Planning
Commission, except for those in the A-1 and R-1 zones. Single-family residential units in
the A-1 and R-1, as well as residential projects with design review approval, proceed to
plan check for building permit issuance. Projects requiring a conditional use permit or
variance are also reviewed by the Planning Commission.
Table H4-7 outlines the estimated time for development review.

   As shown in Table H4-7, processing times vary depending on the complexity of the
   project. Single-family homes and tenant improvements can be processed in 1 to 4
   weeks. Multi-family projects can be processed in 3 to 8 weeks. More complex projects
   requiring a variance, zone change, or conditional use permit require a higher level of
   review and thus have a longer processing timeline.
   2.        Artesia Redevelopment Agency Housing Set-Aside Fund Resources
   The City of Artesia Redevelopment Agency provides the funding source for many
   housing-related activities in the City. Table H4-8 summarizes the tax-increment
   projections from fiscal year 2006-2007 through fiscal year 2010-2011. The City’s
   Redevelopment Agency anticipates using Housing Set-Aside Funds for two programs
   through the Planning Period. The First Time Homebuyer Tax Credit Program provides a
   loan of up to $8,000. Because the program provides loans, the funds are available for
   reuse as loans are repaid. The Redevelopment Agency also anticipates using
   approximately $3 million for land acquisition to assemble land for low to moderate
   income housing.

a.       Redevelopment Agency Inclusionary Requirement
In accordance with California Community Redevelopment Law, the City of Artesia
Redevelopment Agency requires production of affordable housing units in conjunction
with Agency-developed housing or housing projects within the redevelopment project
areas.
At least 30 percent of new or substantially rehabilitated housing units developed by the
Agency must be restricted for very-low and low income households. Fifty percent of the
total restricted units must be reserved for very-low income households.
At least 15 percent of the units developed by entities other than the Agency in a
redevelopment project area must be reserved for very-low and low income households.
Of those restricted units, at least 40 percent must be for very-low income households.

4.       Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
The City of Artesia has limited natural resources and pristine habitat due to its location
and built out nature; however, as with most southern California cities, development may
be limited due to exposure to a variety of environmental hazards.
a.       Environmental Constraints
The City of Artesia has identified areas where land development should be carefully
controlled. The following hazards may impact future development of residential units in
Artesia.
Seismic Hazards: The City of Artesia, like other cities in Southern California, is located
in a region of frequent seismic activity. While the City is located in the vicinity of active
faults, no known earthquake faults or Alquist-Priolo Special Study Zones are located
within the City. Major active fault zones located in the vicinity of the City include the
Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone and the Whittier-Elsinore Fault Zone. The Newport-
Inglewood Fault Zone is located approximately five miles southwest of the City. The fault
is designated as active with a maximum credible magnitude of 7.0 to 7.5 on the Richter
scale. The Whittier-Elsinore Fault Zone is located approximately eight miles northeast of
Artesia. This fault zone has an expected maximum credible magnitude of 6.6 on the
Richter scale.
The City of Artesia may be subject to ground shaking in the event of a nearby
earthquake. The amount of ground shaking would depend on the proximity of the area
to the fault, the depth, the location of the epicenter, the magnitude of the earthquake,
and soil type in the area. Alluvial soils, such as those found in Artesia, are especially
prone to intense ground shaking.
The City of Artesia is located within an identified liquefaction zone. Liquefaction is
caused by a shock or strain from an earthquake and involves the sudden loss of soil
strength and cohesion, and the temporary transformation of soil into a fluid mass.
Artesia General Plan                                                             H-55

                                                           Housing Sub-Element
Flooding: The City of Artesia is located in the San Gabriel River alluvial plain. Drainage
within the City flows southwest into the San Gabriel River. The entire city is located within
the designated Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Zone C (minimal
flooding).
The City of Artesia has adopted Floodplain Management requirements as part of Title 8
of the City’s Municipal Code. These standards apply to construction in flood-prone
areas, and are intended to protect the residents and property in Artesia.
Fire Hazards: The City of Artesia is located in a built-out, urbanized area and,
therefore, the most serious fire threat within the City is by residents. Fire hazards within
the City may be associated with heavy industrial uses, hazardous materials, and arson.
The Los Angeles County Fire Department provides fire protection and paramedic
services for the City. There are no fire stations located within the City; however, there are
two fire stations (Fire Stations No. 30 and 115) located in surrounding cities that provide
immediate fire protection services. Four other fire stations provide secondary service to
the City.
Noise: Residential land uses are the most sensitive to noise in Artesia. Principal noise
sources in the City are transportation noise sources, including primary and secondary
highways, arterials, the Union Pacific Railroad/Los Angeles County MTA corridor and the
91 freeway. Other potential noise sources include stationary industrial, construction, and
population noise. Title 5, Chapter 2 of the City’s Municipal Code addresses permissible
noise levels.
b.      Infrastructure Constraints
The City of Artesia is generally a built out city. Anticipated residential development is
either infill of smaller lots or intensification of use, such as larger single family lots being
converted to a higher density use, such as multifamily. Main infrastructure is available at
most locations in the city and developers may need to upgrade as required in order to
ensure adequate fire flow or sewer capacity.
Water: Three companies provide water services in the City of Artesia: Southern
California Water Company, County Water Company and Park Water Company.
Approximately 87 percent of the City is served by the Southern California Water
Company. The SCWC water system in Artesia receives water from the Metropolitan
Water District and three active wells, two of which are located in Artesia. County Water
Company provides water to approximately 10 percent of the City located in the northern
and southeastern portions of the City. The source of water is a water connection with the
City of Norwalk and a water connection to the SCWC system. Park Water Company
provides water services to approximately 3 percent of the City. The source of water is
from groundwater wells with the Company’s Norwalk Water System.
     H-56                                                               Artesia General Plan

                                                      Housing Sub-Element
The City has identified some limitations on new infill development based on inadequate
fire flow from small pipes in residential neighborhoods. This constraint may cause an
inability of property owners to obtain approval to build large homes.
Sewer: The City of Artesia maintains the sewer systems within the City. The City’s local
collector sewer lines connect to main sewer trunks owned and operated by the County
Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County (Sanitation Districts). The Sanitation Districts
service 78 cities and unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. The Sanitation
Districts operate 11 wastewater treatment plants and treat approximately 500 million
gallons per day.
Storm Drains: Storm drains within the City are predominantly owned by the Los Angeles
County Flood Control District. The City typically requires no increase in run-off from any
new development. In addition, Low Impact Development Practices are beginning to be
implemented. Individual improvements within each developing lot would be required as
necessary. Meeting future storm water regulations may require the City to acquire land
in order to create storm water quality basins such as sand filter basins. This may impact
the ability of the City to accommodate additional dwelling units. Said storm water
requirements are currently in flux and it is difficult to assess how they may impact
residential development at this time.
B.       NON-GOVERNM ENTAL C ONS TRAINTS
A number of market and non-governmental factors contribute to the cost of housing.
These constraints include the availability of land and costs of land and construction. The
following is a discussion of these factors and their impact on affordable housing
development.
1.       Vacant and Underutilized Land
Vacant land in Artesia is minimally due to the built-out condition of the City. The greatest
opportunities for development exist on underutilized parcels or areas available for
redevelopment. The limited availability of raw vacant land has a direct effect on land
prices, and although redevelopment and intensified land are viable options,
development costs overall are increased by this factor. A thorough analysis of vacant
and underutilized land is conducted in Appendix B of this Housing Element.
2.       Land Prices
The cost of land directly influences the cost of housing. Land prices are determined by a
number of factors, most important of which are land availability and permitted
development density. As land becomes scarcer, the price of land increases. In terms of
development, land prices have a positive correlation with the number of units permitted
on each lot. In recent years, land prices have increased in Southern California.

3.       Construction Costs
Construction costs can be strongly influenced by a variety of factors and have a direct
correlation with the cost of housing. Construction costs are primarily determined by the
cost of materials and labor. The cost of construction depends on the type of unit being
built.
Table H4-9 provides a summary of estimated construction costs for Los Angeles County.

                Single-Family Residential                           $100-125
              Townhomes/Condominiums                                $150-180
         Multi-family- garden-style apartments                        $200
   Multi-family- stacked flats with structured parking                $250

4.       Financing
Mortgage interest rates have a large influence over the affordability of housing. Higher
interest rates increase a homebuyer’s monthly payment and decrease the range of
housing that a household can afford. Lower interest rates result in a lower cost and
lower payments for the homebuyer.
Typically, when interest rates rise, the market compensates by decreasing housing
prices. Similarly, when interest rates decrease, housing prices begin to rise. Often times,
there is a lag in the market. So when interest rates rise, housing prices continue to stay
high until the market can catch up. It is this period when it is the most difficult for lower
income households to purchase a home.
As shown in Table H4-10, the percentage of persons denied for a home loan in the Los
Angeles region increases as income decreases. Approximately 30 percent of very-low
income households were denied a loan, while 22.8 percent of above-moderate income
households were denied.

Figure H4-1 shows the average interest rates between October 2006 and September
2007. Interest rates reached a high point in July 2007 and have decreased since.
Interest rates are determined by national policies and economic conditions and there is
little that a local government can do to affect these rates. However, in order to extend
home buying opportunities to lower income households, jurisdictions can offer interest
rate write-downs. Additionally, government insured loan programs may be available to
reduce mortgage down payment requirements
There have been recent changes in the qualifications and lending standards for home
loans. Nationwide, there has been a large increase in the number of delinquencies and
foreclosures in the housing market. As a result, lenders have more stringent
qualifications for home loans and lower income households may find it more difficult to
qualify.

Energy Conservation
The City of Artesia requires compliance with the 2008 County of Los Angeles Building
Code, based on the 2007 California Building Code, for all new construction.
Compliance with the 2008 County Building Code on the use of energy efficient
appliances and insulation has reduced energy demand stemming from new residential
development.
Southern California Edison, which provides electricity service in Artesia, also offers public
information and technical assistance to developers and homeowners regarding energy
conservation. Southern California Edison also provides incentives for energy efficient
new construction and home improvements. Through the California Energy Star New
Homes program, builders can receive up to $700 per single family unit or $275 per
multi-family unit for constructing homes that are 15-20 percent more energy efficient
than the County and State requirements. Builders also have the option of installing
efficient appliances, insulation and/or tight ducts to receive similar monetary incentives.
Owners of existing homes can receive monetary incentives for purchasing Energy-star

qualified appliances or making other energy-saving improvements such as installing a
whole-house fan in the attic.
One of the more recent strategies in building energy-efficient homes is following the
U.S. Green Building Council’s guidelines for LEED Certification. LEED-certified buildings
demonstrate energy and water savings, reduced maintenance costs, and improved
occupant satisfaction. The LEED for New Construction program has been applied to
numerous multi-family residential projects nationwide. The LEED for Homes pilot
program was launched in 2005 and includes standards for new single-family and multi-
family home construction.

HOUSING PLAN
A.        INTRODUCTION
This section of the Housing Element describes the City’s housing goals, policies, and
action programs for the 2006-2014 Planning Period. The Housing Plan was developed
based on the City’s present and future housing needs, and addresses specific
requirements of State law. In addition, the Housing Plan considers the input of residents
and stakeholders. The goals, policies, and actions focus not only on increasing the
housing stock, but also the maintenance, preservation, and improvement of housing for
all Artesians.
The City’s housing goals are organized to address five key areas:
      1. Provision of Affordable Housing
      2. Conservation and Improvement of Existing Housing Stock
      3. Provision of Adequate Housing Sites
      4. Provision of Equal Housing Opportunities
      5. Removal of Governmental Constraints

      In addition, development standards for mixed use

      maximum allowable floor area of the commercial
      component may be increased by up to 10%; b) the
      parking requirement for both the commercial and the

      Amend the South Specific Plan to designate the site as an

      affordable housing is provided. To facilitate affordable
      housing, and specifically very low- and low-income
      housing, the AHO designation will require that no less
      than 30 percent of the housing units be available to
      families of very low-income and 20 percent to families of
      low-income. The remaining 50% of the units shall be at
      market rate. In addition, the minimum housing density
      shall be 21 units per acre and the maximum 24 units per
      acre. However, the developer would retain the option of
      building at the lower density permitted by the Specific

      In compliance with SB 2, the City will analyze and revise

          sufficient capacity, to permit emergency shelters by-
          right and without a condition use or other
          discretionary permit.
         Ensure the provisions of the Housing Accountability Act
          are enforced and prohibit the denial of emergency
          shelter/transitional/supportive housing facility via
          discretionary approvals if it is consistent with adopted
          regulatory standards.

          provisions to ensure that standards encourage rather
          than discourage development.

                             According to case law Santa Barbara v. Adamson (1980),
                             the Supreme Court found that a definition of “family” that
                             made a distinction between related and unrelated persons
                             in setting occupancy limits for single-family homes was
                             unconstitutional. Therefore, the City will revise the current
                             definition of “family” in the Municipal Code to comply with
                             the definition found in the State’s Health and Safety Code
                             and in the Welfare and Institutions Code.
                             Objective:                      Revise the definition of

      development, especially new housing units affordable to
      lower and moderate income households, the City shall
      review the existing parking requirements and revise the
      requirements, as appropriate. Further study of these
      revisions shall be conducted as part of anticipated Zoning
      Code revisions as provided in this Housing Element.

                                                   The Circulation and Mobility Sub-Element
                                                   addresses the physical transportation
                                                   system, such as streets, highways, bicycle
                                                   routes and sidewalks; as well as various
                                                   modes of transportation, including cars,
                                                   buses, trucks, rail, bicycles, rideshare and
                                                   walking.
                                                   The circulation and transportation system
                                                   plays an important role in shaping the
                                                   overall structure and form of the City–both
                                                   dividing and connecting land uses. This
Sub-Element will serve as a guide for circulation and mobility improvements as they
relate to the long-range growth of the City of Artesia.
The Circulation and Mobility Sub-Element has a critical relationship to the Land Use
Sub-Element because the circulation system must adequately handle future traffic as the
City and surrounding areas continue to grow. Circulation and land use must be closely
tied to ensure that community members are able to move in and around the City to
locations where they live, work, shop and spend leisure hours.
The State of California Government Code Section 65302 (b) requires that a General
Plan include:
    “A circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of existing
    and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other
    local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the
    plan.”
The Circulation and Mobility Sub-Element describes existing circulation conditions in the
City, establishes standards for implementation of future improvements in conjunction
with planned growth, and provides a method for measuring system performance for
future updates.
The Circulation and Mobility Sub-Element establishes official City policy regarding:
  The transportation facilities that will be required to serve both present and future
    vehicular and non-vehicular travel demand in the City;
  Classifications and design standards for circulation facilities; and
  Strategies to implement the City’s planned circulation system.
   Artesia General Plan 2030                                                          CIR-1

CIRCULATION AND MOBILITY SUB-ELEMENT
The Circulation and Mobility Sub-Element considers not only the physical parameters of
the transportation system (roadway facility type, number of lanes, etc.), but also
operation issues such as the provision of transit services, and programs and policies that
encourage the use of alternative transit modes.

Relationship to Other Plans
Primary to effective land use is an orderly movement of people in a metropolitan region.
The following regional plans have been developed and/or adopted which have
relevance for circulation in the City of Artesia.
a.      Regional Transportation Plan
On May 8, 2008, the Regional Council of the Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG) adopted the 2008 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP): Making the
Connections. The RTP presents the transportation vision for this region through the year
2035 and provides a long-term investment framework for addressing the region’s
transportation and related challenges.
The goals of the RTP are to:
  Maximize mobility and accessibility for all people and goods in the region
  Ensure travel safety and reliability for all people and goods in the region
  Preserve and ensure a sustainable regional transportation system
  Maximize the productivity of our transportation system
  Protect the environment, improve air quality and promote energy efficiency
  Encourage land use and growth patterns that complement our transportation
    investments and improve the cost-effectiveness of expenditures
  Maximize the security of our transportation system through improved system
    monitoring, rapid recovery planning, and coordination with other security agencies
b.      Regional Transportation Improvement Program
The Regional Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP) is a capital listing of all
transportation projects proposed over a six-year period for the SCAG region. The
projects include highway improvements, transit, rail and bus facilities, high occupancy
vehicle lanes, signal synchronization, intersection improvements, freeway ramps, etc.
The RTIP is SCAG’s compilation of State, Federal and locally funded transportation
projects. In addition to projects identified in the State Transportation Improvement
Program (STIP), the RTIP includes projects eligible for Federal Congestion Mitigation Air
Quality (CMAQ) and Surface Transportation Program (STP) funds, other Federal funds
and projects entirely funded out of local and private sources.

                                CIRCULATION AND MOBILITY SUB-ELEMENT
c.        Congestion Management Program:
Urban traffic congestion is addressed by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (Metro) through a Congestion Management Program (CMP) in
accordance with State law. This program requires local jurisdictions to examine the
impact of land use decisions on the CMP regional transportation system and to be
responsible for mitigating these impacts. CMP conformance allows local jurisdictions to
continue receiving certain State gas tax (Section 2105) funds and to preserve their
eligibility for other State and Federal transportation dollars. There are five components
required for CMP conformance:
  Reporting traffic counts and LOS at selected intersections (biennial requirement);
  Implementation of the locally-adopted CMP TDM Ordinance;
  Following CMP transportation impact analysis guidelines for projects requiring an
    Environmental Impact Report (EIR) as incorporated in the locally-adopted CMP Land
    Use Analysis Program;
  Adoption of a Local Development Report (LDR), reporting new development activity,
    development adjustments, and exempted development activity; and
  After holding a noticed public hearing, adoption of a resolution self-certifying CMP
    conformance which incorporates the LDR mentioned above.
d.        Los Angeles County Bicycle Transportation Strategic Plan
The Los Angeles County Bicycle Transportation Strategic Plan is “designed to be used by
the cities, the County, and transit agencies in planning regionally significant bicycle
facilities, setting priorities for improving mobility through the use of bicycles with transit,
and filling gaps in the interjurisdictional bikeway network. The goal is to integrate bicycle
use in all transportation planning: existing and future transit and transportation oriented
development. This Plan provides a new look at bicycle use to relieve congestion, improve
air quality, reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and increase transit viability.” One gap
identified in the inter-jurisdictional bicycle network falls within Artesia along the West
Santa Ana Branch Metro Right-of-Way with the suggested improvement of a bike path
between Bellflower and Coyote Creek/Orange County border.
Existing Circulation System
The existing regional and local roadway network in Artesia is a hierarchical system of
highways and local streets developed to provide regional traffic movement and local
access. The following section provides a description of the functional classification of the
facilities within the City.
Street System
An existing series of major and secondary streets and highways in the City and
surrounding urban metropolitan area connect local neighborhood areas with adjacent
communities and the region. The General Plan identifies a hierarchy of streets providing

routes and road types consistent with those found throughout Los Angeles County. There
are no scenic highways designated within the Artesia city boundaries. Exhibit CIR-1
illustrates the existing circulation system within the City, as categorized in the 1993
General Plan.
The roadway system in Artesia is fully developed. Future streets will be constructed
through private sector assessments in conjunction with new development.

Street System Classifications
The Artesia street system consists of six basic functional classes of roads incorporated in
the City's street/road standards, mapped in Exhibit CIR-2. The six basic types are as
follows, with cross-sections and level of service thresholds detailed in Table CIR-1:
1. Freeways: A four or six lane divided arterial highway with full control of access and
with grade separations at intersections.
As the highest type of road facility, freeways provide maximum service and safety for
through traffic. Freeways serve as the principal arterials of the inter- and intrastate
system of highways, carrying traffic between cities, traffic generators, and points of
interest.
Strategically located within the northern portion of the corporate boundary of the City,
the 91 Freeway provides convenient access east-west to beach cities and Riverside,
respectively. Within one-half mile to the west of the City in Cerritos, the 605 Freeway
offers access to the region in a north-south direction.
2. Primary Highway / Primary Arterial Highway: A divided six- or four-lane road with
intersections at grade and partial control of access.
Primary Highways and Primary Arterial Highways serve as the highest types of facilities
carrying local traffic within communities, with emphasis on through traffic carrying
capability. These roads serve as principal access routes to shopping areas, places of
employment, community centers, recreational areas, and other places of assembly.
Primary Highways include Artesia Boulevard. Primary Arterial Highways in the City
include Pioneer Boulevard and South Street.
3. Secondary Highway / Secondary Arterial Highway: An undivided four-lane road with
intersections at grade and partial control of access.
Secondary Highways and Secondary Arterial Highways serve as secondary types of
arterial facilities carrying local through traffic within communities. These highways
frequently serve as access to shopping areas, employment centers, recreational areas,
residential areas, and places of assembly. Secondary Highways include Gridley Road.
Secondary Arterial Highways include Norwalk Boulevard, 166th Street, and 183rd
Street.
4. Collector Road: A two lane undivided road with intersections at grade and designed
to take a minimum interference of traffic from driveways. Collector Roads provide
principal access to residential areas or connect streets of higher classifications to permit
adequate traffic circulation. Collector Roads include 186th Street, 187th Street, and
Elaine Avenue.

In addition to these six basic functional classes of roads, Artesia recognizes County
standards for lesser streets that serve particular types of land uses, and for alleys. Table

Existing Volumes and Levels of Service
The travel patterns in the City of Artesia are to a large extent influenced by the location
of employment and population centers outside the city limits. These factors tend to
create a significant travel demand on the City's highways and arterials. In addition,
intra-city vehicle movement is significantly affected by the peak periods from commercial
activities in the Los Cerritos Shopping Center.
Fifteen roadway segments were selected for the evaluation of current traffic conditions in
      CIR-8                                                       Artesia General Plan 2030

Public Transit
Public bus service is provided to Artesia by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(MTA), the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA), the Long Beach Transit
District, and the Norwalk Transit District as illustrated in Exhibit CIR-4. Expanded service
and improved intercity routes make such alternative transportation accessible and
inexpensive.
The City of Artesia offers free-of-charge transportation service, the "Artesia Express," to
senior citizens (60 years of age or older), and individuals with disabilities who are
Artesia residents.
The Los Angeles County 2008 Long Range Transportation Plan, developed by Metro,
identifies an opportunity to construct “environmentally-friendly high-speed transit” along
the “Santa Ana West Branch” ROW from Union Station to Orange County that passes
through Artesia. Currently the ROW is not being utilized for rail service. Construction of
a commuter rail line would provide additional options for Artesia residents, providing a
convenient connection to Downtown Los Angeles and Orange County.

Bikeways
Currently, there are no designated bikeways within the City. However, there are Class II
bike lanes adjacent to the City in the following locations:
  Pioneer Boulevard, south of 195th Street
  195th Street, east of Bloomfield
  South Street, east of Bloomfield
There are Class I bike paths to the west of the City along the San Gabriel River and to
the east of the City along Coyote Creek. The County Bicycle Transportation Strategic
Plan identifies the opportunity to connect these bikeways through the creation of a new
bikeway in Artesia.
The Los Angeles County 2008 Long Range Transportation Plan identifies an opportunity
to construct a Class I bikeway along the “Santa Ana West Branch” ROW that passes
through Artesia, in addition to the potential for developing transit along that ROW. This
would create an off-street bikeway connection between the San Gabriel River and
Coyote Creek bikeways. The Cerritos Bikeway System Route Map identifies this as a
future Class I bike path.
The Cerritos Bikeway System Route Map also shows future bikeways (Class II and III)
along Artesia Boulevard between the San Gabriel River and Coyote Creek, with a gap
through the City of Artesia. Other bikeways on this map that border on Artesia include:
   Future Class III bike route on Gridley from 166th Street to Del Amo Boulevard;
   Existing Class II bike lane on Pioneer Boulevard south of the railway ROW;
   Future Class III bike route on Norwalk Boulevard south of the ROW; and
   Existing Class III bike route on 195 th Street between Pioneer Boulevard and
    Bloomfield Avenue that connects to the Coyote Creek bikeway via Class II bike lane.
Near the Artesia City limits, an existing Class II bike lane on South Street starts at
Bloomfield Avenue and leads eastward to another access point on the Coyote Creek
bikeway.
Truck Routes
The City has designed three roadways as truck routes to provide for the regulated
movement of trucks through the City. The designation of these roadways--Artesia
Boulevard, Pioneer Boulevard and South Street--is intended to route truck traffic to those
streets where they would cause the least amount of neighborhood intrusion and where
noise and other impacts would not be considered nuisances. The designation of truck
routes does not prevent trucks from using other roads or streets to load or unload when
such deviations are reasonable and necessary. Exhibit CIR-5 illustrates truck routes
within the City.

Artesia is a built-out community where future growth will occur as infill and
redevelopment of existing uses. As growth and development continues, there will be
increasing demands on the circulation system that will need to be accommodated in a
manner which allows the system to provide an acceptable level of service.
C om m uni t y Pla nni ng P ri nciple C IR 2
The right-of-ways play a significant role in the aesthetics and imagery of the public
realm in Artesia. The visual quality along the circulation network can be improved
through a number of streetscape improvement opportunities.
C om m uni t y Pla nni ng P ri nciple C IR 3
Reducing vehicle miles traveled is an important goal of SCAG and the region as a
whole. Reducing vehicle miles traveled will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas
emissions, reducing traffic congestion and improving the quality of life in Artesia.
C om m uni t y Pla nni ng P ri nciple C IR 4
Alternative modes of transportation including bicycling, walking and use of public transit
play important roles in reducing the strain on the existing circulation system and
increase the options community members have to move in and around the City.
C om m uni t y Pla nni ng P ri nciple 5
Circulation and mobility do not stop at the city boundaries. Artesia is surrounded on all
sides by urbanized community and traffic does not recognize city boundaries. Regional
and inter-jurisdictional partnerships are necessary to address circulation and mobility
issues.

Water System
Three companies provide water services in the City of Artesia: Southern California Water
Company (SCWC), County Water Company and Park Water Company. Approximately
87 percent of the City is served by the Southern California Water Company. The SCWC
water system in Artesia receives water from the Metropolitan Water District and three
active wells, two of which are located in Artesia. County Water Company provides water
to approximately 10 percent of the City located in the northern and southeastern
portions of the City. The source of water is a water connection with the City of Norwalk
and a water connection to the SCWC system. Park Water Company provides water
services to approximately 3 percent of the City. The source of water is from groundwater
wells with the Company’s Norwalk Water System.
Water infrastructure within Artesia is vital to the well-being of the community, and must
be maintained and improved to meet the needs of residents and businesses alike. The
reliability of the system is dependent on a variety of factors ranging from local
precipitation and groundwater recharge, water conditions in northern California,
changing population dynamics, adjudicated groundwater rights with the Central Basin,
anticipated benefits from conjunctive use programs, and the continued availability of
recycled water from local sources. The additional development accommodated under
the General Plan update would increase water demand within the City, thus, requiring
the construction of new water facilities and/or expansion of existing water facilities.
Future development would be required to make all improvements necessary to extend
water service to the development site, including any service upgrades. In addition to
   Artesia General Plan 2030                                                       CFI-1

water demands placed on the system for domestic and commercial use, the system must
be capable of providing adequate pressures for fire-fighting purposes. Since fires can
occur at any time, the water system must be ready to provide the required flow.
Wastewater System
The City of Artesia maintains the sewer systems within the City. The City’s local collector
sewer lines connect to main sewer trunks owned and operated by the County Sanitation
Districts of Los Angeles County (Sanitation Districts). The Sanitation Districts service 78
cities and unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. The Sanitation Districts operate
11 wastewater treatment plants and treat approximately 500 million gallons per day.
As the population continues to grow, infrastructure facilities, including wastewater will
receive additional pressure to serve the community. Expansions of existing facilities may
be required on an as needed basis due to incremental increases in wastewater
generation as a result of new development. Site-specific sewer evaluation may also be
implemented to ensure that new development within the City does not exceed the
wastewater conveyance capacity of facilities.
Storm Drain System
Storm drains within the City are predominantly owned by the Los Angeles County Flood
Control District. The system is designed to control the movement of rainwater to a safe
location where it can re-charge the natural and man-made water supplies. Meeting
future storm water regulations may require the City to acquire land in order to create
storm water quality basins. Two important planning considerations in regards to storm
drain planning include: 1) ensuring adequate capacity to collect and carry storm water is
available; and 2) working to reduce pollutants in storm water.
During rainstorms, pollutants such as trash, litter, silt, automotive chemicals, animal
waste and other contaminants are washed into the storm drains. The Federal Pollution
Control Act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant into navigable waters from a point
source unless the discharge is authorized by a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit. The City of Artesia participates in the NPDES permit program in
conjunction with the County of Los Angeles and the County Flood Control District.
Storm Water and Urban Water Runoff
In accordance with the Clean Water Act, a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit is required for certain municipal separate storm sewer
discharges into surface waters. The City of Artesia is within the region originally covered
by Order No. 01-182 issued December 13, 2000. The City is a permittee under the
2001 Permit and therefore is required by federal and state law to implement all
requirements of the 2001 Permit. The goal of the 2001 Permit is to have discharges
from land uses in Los Angeles County drainage basins meet water quality standards
suitable for the protection of the beneficial uses of the receiving waters (lakes, rivers,
ground water and the ocean).

The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) increased its
requirements for the Municipal NPDES Permit. The new requirements of the Municipal
NPDES permit require the development of a Standard Urban Stormwater Mitigation Plan
(SUSMP). Guidelines for the requirements associated with the SUSMP are described in
detail in the Development Planning for Stormwater Management - A Manual for the
Standard Urban Stormwater Mitigation Plan (SUSMP) (2002) prepared by the Los
Angeles County Department of Public Works.

South Coast Air Basin
The City of Artesia is located in the South Coast Air Basin, a 10,743-square mile area
bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the San Gabriel, San Bernardino and San
Jacinto Mountains to the north and east. The Basin includes all of Orange County and
the non-desert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, in
addition to the San Gorgonio Pass area of Riverside County. The Basin’s terrain and
geographical location (i.e. a coastal plain with connecting broad valleys and low hills)
determine its distinctive climate.
The general region lies in the semi-permanent high-pressure zone of the eastern Pacific.
The climate is mild and tempered by cool sea breezes. The usually mild climatological
pattern is interrupted infrequently by periods of extremely hot weather, winter storms or
Santa Ana winds. The extent and severity of the air pollution problem in the Basin is a
function of the area’s natural physical characteristics (weather and topography), as well
as man-made influences (development patterns and lifestyle). Factors such as wind,
sunlight, temperature, humidity, rainfall and topography all affect the accumulation
and/or dispersion of pollutants throughout the Basin.
   Artesia General Plan 2030                                                   AQ-1

AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE SUB-ELEMENT
Regulatory Framework
Regulatory oversight for air quality in the Basin rests with the South Coast Air Quality
Management District (SCAQMD) at the regional level, the California Air Resources
Board (CARB) at the State level and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
Region IX office at the Federal level.
Local Ambient Air Quality
Air Quality Monitoring Stations
The SCAQMD monitors air quality at 37 monitoring stations throughout the Basin. Each
monitoring station is located within a Source Receptor Area (SRA). The communities
within an SRA are expected to have similar climatology and ambient air pollutant
concentrations. The City of Artesia is located in SRA 4 (South Coastal Los Angeles
County). The monitoring stations usually measure pollutant concentrations ten feet
above ground level; therefore, air quality is often referred to in terms of ground-level
concentrations.
Pollutants Measured
The following air quality information briefly describes the various types of pollutants
monitored:
Carbon Monoxide. Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas that is
emitted by mobile and stationary sources as a result of incomplete combustion of
hydrocarbons or other carbon-based fuels. In cities, automobile exhaust can cause as
much as 95 percent of all CO emissions.
CO replaces oxygen in the body’s red blood cells. Individuals with a deficient blood
supply to the heart, patients with diseases involving heart and blood vessels, fetuses
(unborn babies) and patients with chronic hypoxemia (oxygen deficiency), as seen in
high altitudes are most susceptible to the adverse effects of CO exposure. People with
heart disease are also more susceptible to developing chest pains when exposed to low
levels of CO. Exposure to high levels of CO can slow reflexes and cause drowsiness,
and result in death in confined spaces at very high concentrations. The State and
Federal standard for CO is 9.0 ppm.
Nitrogen Dioxide. Nitrogen oxides (NOX) are a family of highly reactive gases that are a
primary precursor to the formation of ground-level O3, and react in the atmosphere to
form acid rain. NO2 (often used interchangeably with NOX) is a reddish-brown gas that
can cause breathing difficulties at high levels. Peak readings of NO2 occur in areas that
have a high concentration of combustion sources (e.g., motor vehicle engines, power
plants, refineries and other industrial operations). NO2 can irritate and damage the
lungs and lower resistance to respiratory infections such as influenza. The health effects
of short-term exposure are still unclear. However, continued or frequent exposure to
NO2 concentrations that are typically much higher than those normally found in the
ambient air may increase acute respiratory illnesses in children and increase the
incidence of chronic bronchitis and lung irritation. Chronic exposure to NO2 may
aggravate eyes and mucus membranes and cause pulmonary dysfunction.
      AQ-2                                                   Artesia General Plan 2030

                 AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE SUB-ELEMENT
For NO2, the Basin is designated as being in attainment under both State and Federal
standards. The NO2 ambient air quality standard was amended on February 22, 2007
to lower the State 1-hour standard to 0.18 ppm and establish a new Federal annual
standard of 0.053 ppm.
Ozone. Ozone (O3) occurs in two layers of the atmosphere. The layer closest to the
earth’s surface is the troposphere. The troposphere extends approximately 10 miles
above ground level, where it meets the second layer, the stratosphere. The stratosphere
(the “good” O3 layer) extends upward from about 10 to 30 miles and protects life on
earth from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays.
“Bad” O3 is a photochemical pollutant, and needs reactive organic compounds (ROGs),
NOX, and sunlight to form. Therefore, ROGs and NOX are O3 precursors. To reduce O3
concentrations, it is necessary to control the emissions of these O3 precursors.
Significant O3 formation generally requires an adequate amount of precursors in the
atmosphere and a period of several hours in a stable atmosphere with strong sunlight.
High O3 concentrations can form over large regions when emissions from motor
vehicles and stationary sources are carried hundreds of miles from their origins.
While O3 in the stratosphere protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation, high
concentrations of ground-level O3 can adversely affect the human respiratory system
and other tissues. O3 is a strong irritant that can constrict the airways, forcing the
respiratory system to work hard to deliver oxygen. Individuals exercising outdoors,
children and people with pre-existing lung disease such as asthma and chronic
pulmonary lung disease are considered to be the most susceptible to the negative health
effects of O3. Short-term exposure (lasting for a few hours) to O3 at levels typically
observed in Southern California can result in aggravated respiratory diseases such as
emphysema, bronchitis and asthma, shortness of breath, increased susceptibility to
infections, inflammation of the lung tissue, increased fatigue, chest pain, dry throat,
headache and nausea.
The State 8-hour standard for O3 is 0.07, and was approved by CARB on April 28,
2005. The exceedances for the State standards have not yet been provided by CARB.
The Federal standard for O3 has been revoked as of June 2005.
Coarse Particulate Matter (PM10). PM10 refers to suspended particulate matter which is
smaller than 10 microns or ten one-millionths of a meter. PM10 arises from sources such
as road dust, diesel soot, combustion products, construction operations and dust storms.
PM10 scatters light and significantly reduces visibility. In addition, these particulates
penetrate into the lungs and can potentially damage the respiratory tract. On June 19,
2003, CARB adopted amendments to the statewide 24-hour particulate matter
standards based upon requirements set forth in the Children’s Environmental Health
Protection Act (Senate Bill 25).

Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5). Due to recent increased concerns over health impacts
related to fine particulate matter (particulate matter 2.5 microns in diameter or less),
both State and Federal PM2.5 standards have been created. Particulate matter primarily
affects infants, children, the elderly and those with pre-existing cardiopulmonary
disease. In 1997, the EPA announced new PM2.5 standards. Industry groups challenged
the new standard in court and the implementation of the standard was blocked.
However, upon appeal by the EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed this decision and
upheld the EPA’s new standards.
On January 5, 2005, the EPA published a Final Rule in the Federal Register that
designates the Basin as a nonattainment area for Federal PM2.5 standards. On June 20,
2002, CARB adopted amendments for statewide annual ambient particulate matter air
quality standards. These standards were established due to increasing concerns that
previous standards were inadequate, as almost everyone in California is exposed to
levels at or above the current State standards during some parts of the year and the
statewide potential for significant health impacts associated with particulate matter
exposure was determined to be large and wide-ranging.
For PM2.5, the Federal standard is 35 µg/m3 over 24 hours. There is no separate State
standard for PM2.5.
Sulfur Dioxide. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a colorless, irritating gas with a rotten egg smell.
It is formed primarily by the combustion of sulfur-containing fossil fuels. Sulfur dioxide is
often used interchangeably with sulfur oxides (SOX) and lead (Pb). Exposure of a few
minutes to low levels of SO2 can result in airway constriction in some asthmatics.
Increased in resistance to air flow and reduced breathing capacity leading to severe
breathing difficulties are observed in people with asthma after acute exposure to SO2.
The Basin is designated as an attainment area for both State and Federal SO2
standards. SO2 did not exceed Federal or State standards between 2004 and 2008.
Reactive Organic Gases and Volatile Organic Compounds. Hydrocarbons are organic
gases that are formed solely of hydrogen and carbon. There are several subsets of
organic gases including reactive organic gases (ROGs) and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs). ROGs comprise all hydrocarbons except those exempted by the CARB.
Therefore, ROGs are a set of organic gases based on State rules and regulations.
VOCs are similar to ROGs in that they comprise all organic gases, except those
exempted by Federal law. VOCs are therefore a set of organic gases based on Federal
rules and regulations. Both ROGs and VOCs are emitted from the incomplete
combustion of hydrocarbons or other carbon-based fuels. The major sources of
hydrocarbons are combustion engine exhaust, oil refineries and oil-fueled power plants;
other common sources are petroleum fuels, solvents, dry cleaning solutions and paint
(via evaporation).
The health effects of hydrocarbons result from the formation of ozone and its related
health effects. High levels of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere can interfere with oxygen
intake by reducing the amount of available oxygen through displacement. Carcinogenic
forms of hydrocarbons are considered toxic air contaminants (“air toxics”). There are no

separate health standards for VOCs, although some VOCs are also toxic. An example is
benzene, which is both a VOC and a carcinogen.
Global Climate Change Gases. The natural process through which heat is retained in
the troposphere is called the “greenhouse effect.”1 The greenhouse effect traps heat in
the troposphere through a three fold process summarized as follows: short wave
radiation emitted by the Sun is absorbed by the Earth; the Earth emits a portion of this
energy in the form of long wave (thermal) radiation; and greenhouse gases in the upper
atmosphere absorb this long wave radiation and emit this long wave radiation into
space and toward the Earth. This ”trapping” of the long wave radiation emitted back
toward the Earth is the underlying process of the greenhouse effect.
The most abundant greenhouse gases are water vapor and carbon dioxide. Many other
trace gases have greater ability to absorb and re-radiate long wave radiation. However,
these gases are not as plentiful. For this reason, and to gauge the potency of
greenhouse gases, scientists have established a Global Warming Potential for each
greenhouse gas based on its ability to absorb and re-radiate long wave radiation. The
Global Warming Potential of a gas is determined using carbon dioxide as the reference
gas with a Global Warming Potential of one (1).
Greenhouse gases include, but are not limited to, the following:2
        Water Vapor (H2O). Although water vapor has not received the scrutiny of other
         greenhouse gases, it is the primary contributor to the greenhouse effect. Natural
         processes, such as evaporation from oceans and rivers, and transpiration from
         plants, contribute 90 percent and 10 percent of the water vapor in our
         atmosphere, respectively.
         The primary human related source of water vapor comes from fuel combustion
         in motor vehicles; however, this is not believed to contribute a significant amount
         (less than one percent) to atmospheric concentrations of water vapor. The
         Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has not determined a Global
         Warming Potential for water vapor.
        Carbon Dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide is primarily generated by fossil fuel
         combustion in stationary and mobile sources. Due to the emergence of
         industrial facilities and mobile sources in the past 250 years, the concentration of
         carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased 35 percent.3 Carbon dioxide is
         the most widely emitted greenhouse gas and is the reference gas (Global
         1
            The troposphere is the bottom layer of the atmosphere, which varies in height from the Earth’s
surface to 10 to 12 kilometers.
         2
            All Global Warming Potentials are given as 100 year Global Warming Potential. Unless noted
otherwise, all Global Warming Potentials were obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change. Climate Change (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change, The Science of

         Warming Potential of 1) for determining Global Warming Potentials for other
         greenhouse gases.
        Methane (CH4).          Methane is emitted from biogenic sources, incomplete
         combustion in forest fires, landfills, manure management, and leaks in natural
         gas pipelines. In the United States, the top three sources of methane are
         landfills, natural gas systems, and enteric fermentation. Methane is the primary
         component of natural gas, which is used for space and water heating, steam
         production, and power generation. The Global Warming Potential of methane is
         21.
        Nitrous Oxide (N2O). Nitrous oxide is produced by both natural and human
         related sources. Primary human related sources include agricultural soil
         management, animal manure management, sewage treatment, mobile and
         stationary combustion of fossil fuel, adipic acid production, and nitric acid
         production. The Global Warming Potential of nitrous oxide is 310.
        Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). HFCs are typically used as refrigerants for both
         stationary refrigeration and mobile air conditioning. The use of HFCs for cooling
         and foam blowing is growing, as the continued phase out of
         chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) gains
         momentum. The Global Warming Potential of HFCs range from 140 for HFC-
         152a to 6,300 for HFC-236fa.
        Perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Perfluorocarbons are compounds consisting of carbon
         and fluorine. They are primarily created as a byproduct of aluminum production
         and semi conductor manufacturing. Perfluorocarbons are potent greenhouse
         gases with a Global Warming Potential several thousand times that of carbon
         dioxide, depending on the specific PFC. Another area of concern regarding
         PFCs is their long atmospheric lifetime (up to 50,000 years).4 The Global
         Warming Potential of PFCs range from 5,700 to 11,900.
        Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Sulfur hexafluoride is a colorless, odorless, nontoxic,
         nonflammable gas. It is most commonly used as an electrical insulator in high
         voltage equipment that transmits and distributes electricity. Sulfur hexafluoride is
         the most potent greenhouse gas that has been evaluated by the
         Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change with a Global Warming Potential of
         23,900. However, its global warming contribution is not as high as the Global
         Warming Potential would indicate due to its low mixing ratio compared to
         carbon dioxide (4 parts per trillion [ppt] in 1990 versus 365 parts per million
         [ppm]).5

In addition to the six major greenhouse gases discussed above (excluding water vapor),
many other compounds have the potential to contribute to the greenhouse effect. Some
of these substances were previously identified as stratospheric O3 depletors; therefore,
their gradual phase out is currently in effect. The following is a listing of these
compounds:
        Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). HCFCs are solvents, similar in use and
         chemical composition to CFCs. The main uses of HCFCs are for refrigerant
         products and air conditioning systems. As part of the Montreal Protocol, all
         developed countries that adhere to the Montreal Protocol are subject to a
         consumption cap and gradual phase out of HCFCs. The United States is
         scheduled to achieve a 100 percent reduction to the cap by 2030. The Global
         Warming Potentials of HCFCs range from 93 for HCFC-123 to 2,000 for HCFC-
         142b.6
        1,1,1 trichloroethane. 1,1,1 trichloroethane or methyl chloroform is a solvent
         and degreasing agent commonly used by manufacturers. The Global Warming
         Potential of methyl chloroform is 110 times that of carbon dioxide.7
        Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). CFCs are used as refrigerants, cleaning solvents,
         and aerosol spray propellants. CFCs were also part of the EPA’s Final Rule (57
         FR 3374) for the phase out of O3 depleting substances. Currently, CFCs have
         been replaced by HFCs in cooling systems and a variety of alternatives for
         cleaning solvents. Nevertheless, CFCs remain suspended in the atmosphere
         contributing to the greenhouse effect. CFCs are potent greenhouse gases with
         Global Warming Potentials ranging from 4,600 for CFC 11 to 14,000 for CFC
         13.8
Attainment Status
The EPA and CARB have designated portions of the Basin as non-attainment for a
variety of pollutants, and some of those designations have an associated classification.
The Basin has been designated in attainment for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen
dioxide (NOX), and sulfur dioxides (SOX) for both State and Federal standards and is
non-attainment for ozone (O3), PM10 and PM2.5. Despite implementing many strict
controls, the Basin still fails to meet the Federal and State air quality standards for O3.
For the Federal standards, O3 is designated non-attainment (Serious 17); refer to Table

Primary Sources Of Emissions
Air pollutants within the City of Artesia are generated by Stationary and Mobile Sources.
These emission sources are described below.
Stationary Sources
Stationary source emissions refer to those that originate from a single place or object
that does not move around. Typical stationary sources include power plants, mines,
smokestacks, vents, incinerators, buildings, and other facilities using industrial
combustion processes. Stationary point sources have one or more emission sources at a
facility with an identified location and are usually associated with manufacturing and
industrial projects. Examples include refinery boilers or combustion equipment that
produces electricity or process heat.
Point Sources
The City of Artesia contains several point sources of air pollutants. A variety of
pollutants, including reactive hydrocarbons from activities such as spray painting, are
generated by smaller commercial and industrial uses. Industrial uses are generally
located in the northwestern portion of the City.
Mobile Sources
Mobile sources of emissions refer to those moving objects that release pollution and
include cars, trucks, buses, planes, trains, motorcycles, and gasoline-powered lawn
mowers. Increased traffic volumes within the City of Artesia could contribute to regional
incremental emissions of NOX, VOC, CO, SOX, and PM10. The following is a listing of
emissions that typically emanate from vehicular sources:
         Vehicle    running exhaust (VOC, CO, NOX, SOX, and PM10);
         Vehicle    tire wear particulates (PM10);
         Vehicle    brake wear particulates (PM10);
         Vehicle    variable starts (VOC, CO, NOX);
         Vehicle    hot soaks (VOC);
         Vehicle    diurnal (VOC);
         Vehicle    resting losses (VOC); and
      AQ-8                                                                 Artesia General Plan 2030

                  AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE SUB-ELEMENT
        Vehicle evaporative running losses (VOC).
Mobile source emissions may be classified as on- or off-road sources.
On-Road Sources. These sources are considered to be a combination of emissions from
automobiles, trucks, and indirect sources. Major sources of mobile emissions in the City
include the local and regional roadway network. State Route 91 (SR-91) passes through
the City. Additionally, the primary roadways that service the City include South Street,
Pioneer Boulevard, Norwalk Boulevard and Artesia Boulevard. Indirect sources are
those that by themselves may not emit air contaminants, but indirectly cause the
generation of air pollutants by attracting vehicle trips or by consuming energy.
Examples of these indirect sources include an office complex or commercial center that
generates trips and consumes energy resources.
Off-Road Sources. Off-road sources include aircraft, trains, construction equipment,
and landscape equipment. Emissions from off-road sources include NOX and diesel
particulate matter, which contribute to serious public health problems. The EPA has set
emission standards for the engines used in most construction, agricultural, and industrial
equipment. The EPA has adopted off-road diesel fuel requirements to decrease the
allowable levels of sulfur, which can damage advanced emission control technologies.
Additionally, in 2007, CARB adopted a regulation to reduce diesel particulate matter
and NOX emissions from in-use off-road heavy-duty diesel vehicles in California.
Sensitive Receptors
Sensitive populations are more susceptible to the effects of air pollution than are the
general population. Sensitive populations (sensitive receptors) that are in proximity to
localized sources of toxics and CO are of particular concern. Land uses considered
sensitive receptors include residences, schools, playgrounds, childcare centers, athletic
facilities, churches, long-term health care facilities, rehabilitation centers, convalescent
centers and retirement homes.

Element. Further discussion regarding conservation of resources is contained in the
Sustainability Element.
This Sub-Element also outlines strategies and actions to preserve and enhance open
space areas in the City and meet the recreational needs of its residents. Open space
and recreational resources in the City of Artesia include parks, as well as community
centers, school facilities and the former Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way.
The State of California Government Code Section 65302(d) requires “that a General
Plan include a conservation element for the conservation, development, and utilization
of natural resources including water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils, rivers and
other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals and other natural resources.”
The California State Government Code Section 65560(b)(3) requires that the General
Plan address “…Open space for outdoor recreation, including but not limited to, areas
of outstanding scenic, historical and cultural value; areas particularly suited for park and
recreation purposes, including access to lakes, shores, beaches, and rivers and streams;
and areas which serve as links between major recreation and open space reservations,
including utility easements, banks of rivers and streams, trails, and scenic highway
corridors…”
Recreation Elements are an optional element of the General Plan, pursuant to Section
65303 of the Government Code. Other relevant sections of the Government Code that
are applicable to the Open Space and Recreation Sub-Element include Sections 65560,
65562, 65563, 65564, 65566 and 65567, as well as Public Resources Code Section
5076, which allows cities to consider the demands for trail-oriented recreational use. In
addition, Government Code Section 66477, more commonly referred to as the Quimby
Act, allows cities to adopt ordinances addressing park land and/or fees for residential
subdivisions.

OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION SUB-ELEMENT
B.      B AC KGROUND
The City of Artesia is located in a highly urbanized area and is generally built out. There
are essentially no areas within the City that have been undisturbed. The open space
areas within the City are either developed as recreational areas or are previously
developed areas where the use has expired.
Open Space
The total amount of open space, including parks and recreational facilities, is currently 65.8
acres, or 6.3 percent of the total City. Exhibit OS-1 and Exhibit OS-2 show the location
of the City’s open space and a summary of open space resources is provided in Table
OS-1. Open space and parks fall generally into two categories: City-owned facilities
and school district properties.
City Owned Parks and Recreational Facilities: These facilities consist of presently
developed park sites and open space areas suitable for park expansion or park
development.
The City of Artesia currently owns and maintains three parks: Artesia Park, A.J.
Padelford Park, and Baber Park. These parks encompass 17.25 acres. An additional
6.88 acres of railroad right-of-way land area, owned by the Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, provides opportunities for development of
additional recreational facilities.
School District Properties (Joint-Use): These properties are currently developed as school
sites, but maintain considerable open space suited to community enjoyment when not in
use by the school system.
This open space falls under the ownership of the ABC Unified School District. Four
school sites lie within the City of Artesia: John H. Niemes Elementary, Luther Burbank
Elementary, William F. Elliott Elementary, and Faye Ross Junior High. The net open
space provided by these schools totals 31.41 acres. At present, the City’s recreation
department maintains active use of the fields at Faye Ross Junior High.

Recreational Programs
In addition to open space facilities, Artesia maintains an extensive schedule of
recreational programs and activities for all ages and segments of the community.
Sports: Sports programs for youth and/or adults include baseball, softball, ice skating,
and tennis.
Youth Programs: Examples of youth programs include day camps and excursions, YMCA
child care, recreation classes, and a preschool program.
Adult Programs: Fitness, dance, martial arts, and special interest classes are offered for
adults.
Family Activities: Movie nights and crafts workshops cater to families.
Special Events & Holiday Programs: In addition to multi-cultural events sponsored by
community organizations, the City offers a variety of holiday celebrations and special
events.
Senior Citizen Programs: Programs for the elderly include a senior nutrition program,
home delivery meals, Portuguese social hour, seniors club, Artesia Express Dial-A-Ride
Service, and trips to local and regional points of interest. Educational classes in
partnership with Cerritos College are also available. Other activities include health and
fitness programs, bingo, and social gatherings
Regional Facilities
Regional recreation facilities are an important resource for the City of Artesia residents,
though they lie outside the City boundaries. These facilities provide supplemental
recreational opportunities that may not be offered by the City due to its size and limited
resources. Regional recreational facilities are located within a convenient traveling
distance of the City. The City of Cerritos, in conjunction with the County of Los Angeles,
maintains the 56-acre Cerritos Regional County Park located less than one mile from
Artesia's southern boundary. Ralph B. Clark Regional Park, a 105-acre County facility, is
located in the City of Buena Park, approximately seven miles from Artesia’s eastern
boundary. These facilities provide additional amenities not offered in Artesia such as
hiking trails, fishing, and volleyball courts.

Notes:

 School acreage includes only the field/recreation acreage. School buildings and lots are not included in the
open space or recreation acreage total.
  Parkland Standards
  Having incorporated with the majority of its land already developed, the City of Artesia
  does not possess the physical resources to provide recreational facilities of regional
  significance. Rather, the City has historically focused on providing community and
  neighborhood facilities that can be used by residents in the immediate area.
  The State of California Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code Sections 65000
  through 66037) and the Quimby Act1 (Government Code Section 66477) indicate that
  the legislative body of a municipality or county may, by ordinance, require the
  dedication of land, the payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both for
  park recreational purposes as a condition to the approval for a final tract map or parcel
  map. In cases where such dedication or in lieu fees have not been obtained for
  particular lots through a map, they may be imposed at a time that building permits are
  issued.
  Among other requirements, the following conditions must be met:
     The ordinance must include definite standards for determining the proportion of a
       subdivision to be dedicated and the amount of any fee to be paid in lieu thereof;
  1
    The Quimby Act was established by the California legislature in 1965 to provide parks for the grown
  communities in the State. The Act allows cities and counties to establish ordinances requiring new residential
  subdivisions to provide park/recreation land and/or in-lieu fees as well as specifying acceptable uses and
  expenditures of such funds.
  Artesia General Plan 2030                                                                        OS-7

     and
   The legislative body has an adopted General Plan containing a Recreation Element,
     and any proposed park and recreational facilities are in accordance with definite
     principles and standards contained therein.
The City of Artesia Parks and Recreation Department does not have an established
standard for City-provided parkland. By utilizing both the City-owned parks and the
school sites as recreational facilities, Artesia currently provides 49.2 acres of recreational
open space, or 2.8 acres per 1,000 of population.2
Limited opportunities exist to expand open space resources in the City of Artesia.
Conversion of vacant lots into small pocket parks or creation of urban plazas or gardens
as public open spaces would contribute to an increase in park and open space areas.
Based on the Quimby Act target acreage of 3 acres per 1,000 of population, the City’s
target park acreage is 52.65 acres.
The railroad right-of-way could provide additional open space in Artesia that connects to
regional bikeways. The Los Angeles County 2008 Long Range Transportation Plan has
identified an opportunity to develop high-speed transit along the right-of-way as well as
a Class I off-street bikeway, suggesting that a linear park may be feasible alongside rail.
Biological Resources
Biological resources include natural and altered biotic habitats (vegetative communities
and corresponding wildlife habitat), as well as associated flora and fauna.
The City of Artesia is highly urbanized and landscaped with mostly non-native species.
No rare or endangered plant or animal species have been identified within the City.
There are no significant natural habitats in the City. Wildlife species present in the City
are typical of any disturbed, highly urbanized setting and are not considered rare,
endangered, or threatened.
The City is also devoid of wetland and riparian habitat. The City’s most significant plant
resources are imported trees and ornamental plants. While these offer only limited
biological value, they do contribute to the aesthetic and historical character of the City.

                                                           The intent of this Sub-Element is
                                                           to identify and understand risks
associated with each specific type of hazard so that the City government and the public
can make informed decisions about land use and development throughout the City.
The State of California Government Code Section 65302(g) requires that a General Plan
include:
        “…a safety element for the protection of the community from any
        unreasonable risk associated with the effects of seismically induced surface
        ruptures, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure;
        slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence,
        liquefaction and other seismic hazards identified pursuant to chapter 7.8
        (commencing with §2690) of the Public Resources Code, and other
        geologic hazards known to the legislative body; flooding and wild land and
        urban fires.”
B.      B AC KGROUND
The Community Safety Sub-Element addresses both natural and man-made hazards.
Natural hazards include flooding and seismic activity. Man-made hazards include fire,
crime and hazardous materials.
Geology and Soils
The City of Artesia is located within the Los Angeles basin, which is a depression several
thousand feet deep in the earth’s crust. This part of Southern California is characterized
by elongated northwest-southeast trending ridges, valleys and structural features. The
City is within the alluvial plain of the San Gabriel River, which is composed primarily of
rocks, sand and soil from the mountains to the north. Artesia is characterized by level
topography with slopes of less than five percent. Ground elevations are approximately
   Artesia General Plan 2030                                                      SAF-1

COMMUNITY SAFETY SUB-ELEMENT
65 feet above sea level to the north and slope south to 45 feet above sea level.
Seismic Hazards
An earthquake is caused when potential strain energy is suddenly released within the
earth’s crust. The result is the movement of two adjacent areas of earth material and
generation of vibration spreading from the point of origin (epicenter). As expected, an
earthquake is most problematic when it occurs in a developed and populated area,
resulting in impacts on buildings and people.
The magnitude scale, originally proposed by Charles F. Richter, is commonly used for
describing the size of earthquakes. The scale is related to the total amount of energy
released by an earthquake, recording magnitudes ranging from less than 1, up to 9 (the
largest assumed earthquake).
The Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale measures the intensity of an earthquake’s effects
on a given locality. The Mercalli Scale can often be more meaningful to the general
public than the magnitude scale or Richter Scale because it is based on observations of
an earthquake’s effects at a specific place. The Mercalli Scale provides a means of
comparing the effects of intensity for different events. On the Modified Mercalli Intensity
Scale, in which values range from I to XII, an earthquake will have only one magnitude,
but many intensities, which decrease with distance from the epicenter.
Earthquake Faults
Artesia is not located within an Alquist-Priolo earthquake fault zone and there are no
known faults within the City limits. However, active faults, structural zones and
historically destructive earthquakes are characteristic of Southern California. The San
Andreas Fault is approximately 50 miles to the northeast of Artesia.
Major active fault zones located in the vicinity of the City of Artesia include:
Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone. Located approximately five miles southwest of the City,
this complex zone of northwest-trending faults extends from the Cheviot Hills in western
Los Angeles County south to the City of Laguna Beach in Orange County. Major
movement on this fault, such as the Long Beach Earthquake of 1933, can cause severe
vibration in Artesia. The California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and
Geology designates the Newport-Inglewood fault as active, with a maximum credible
magnitude of 7.0-7.5 on the Richter Scale.
Whittier-Elsinore Fault Zone. Located approximately eight miles northeast of Artesia, this
fault zone extends from the southern portion of the San Gabriel Valley in Los Angeles
County south to Lake Elsinore in Riverside County. The epicenter of the 1987 Whittier
Narrows earthquake (magnitude 5.9) was located near the northern portion of the
Whittier-Elsinore fault zone. This fault zone has an expected maximum credible
magnitude of 6.6 on the Richter Scale.
Ground Shaking
Ground shaking is considered to be the earthquake action with the greatest potential to
     SAF-2                                                      Artesia General Plan 2030

                                               COMMUNITY SAFETY SUB-ELEMENT
result in building damage and life loss. According to the Probabilistic Seismic Hazards
Mapping Ground Motion on the California Geological Survey, the City of Artesia has a
peak horizontal acceleration of 40 percent gravity. Forty percent gravity is not identified
by the Geological Survey as a high risk area.1
Artesia’s topography is generally flat and devoid of hills, lakes and faults. Therefore,
building codes, rather than land use policies, are the most significant tools for reducing
this seismic hazard. The City of Artesia has adopted Title 26, Building Code, of the Los
Angeles County Code, which is based on the California Building Code and addresses
seismic hazards. The City contracts with the Los Angeles County Department of Public
Works for building and safety services.
Liquefaction
Liquefaction is caused by a shock or strain from an earthquake, and involves the sudden
loss of soil strength and cohesion. The result is a temporary transformation of soil into a
fluid mass. The entire City lies within an identified liquefaction hazard zone according to
the Seismic Hazard Evaluations of the Los Alamitos 7.5 Minute Quadrangle (March
1999).
Measurements provided by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works,
Hydraulic Water Conservation Division in July 1992 indicate a depth to water range in
Artesia of 38 to 85 plus feet over the past year. As levels within 50 feet occur
intermittently due to well pumping, the potential for liquefaction is considered moderate.
To minimize the potential risk, the precise nature of the earth material and water table
beneath proposed developments should be analyzed to accurately determine
liquefaction potential.
Landslide Hazards
According to the Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology’s report
Seismic Hazard Evaluations of the Los Alamitos 7.5 Minute Quadrangle (March 1999),
the City of Artesia does not have the potential for landslides.
Hydrology and Drainage
The City of Artesia is located in the San Gabriel River alluvial plain. Drainage within the
City flows southwest into the San Gabriel River.
Flooding
The City of Artesia is located in flood zone “C.” Areas in this zone have been determined
by the Federal Emergency Flood Agency (FEMA) to have minimal flood hazard and are
higher than the elevation of the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood. 2

Dam Inundation
Dam inundation is flooding that occurs due to the structural failure of a dam. Failure of
a dam may be caused by seismic activity, severe flooding that causes water to exceed
the capacity of the dam or landslides that flow into a reservoir displacing the water.
The City of Artesia faces a potential hazard from dam inundation resulting from the
failure of either of two dams: Brea Dam and Whittier Narrows Dam.
The Brea Dam is located approximately 10 miles east of Artesia. The Brea Dam is an
earth dam built in 1942 for flood control and storm water management. Dam failure
poses a high potential hazard to downstream areas.
The Whittier Narrows Dam is located approximately 15 miles northeast of the City. The
Dam is owned and operated by the Los Angeles District, Corps of Engineers. All of
Artesia is within the dam’s floodplain/inundation path.
The City of Artesia has adopted Floodplain Management requirements as part of Title 8
of the City’s Municipal Code. These standards apply to construction in flood-prone
areas, and are intended to protect the residents and property in Artesia.
Fire Protection
Fire protection services in Artesia are provided through the Los Angeles County Fire
Department (LACFD). Fire Station No. 30, headquarters of Battalion 9, is located south
of Artesia in the City of Cerritos at 19030 Pioneer Boulevard. The station staff consists of
27 fire fighters, 2 chief officers, 2 secretaries, 1 community service representative (CSR),
and 6 fire prevention personnel. Staff are divided between three shifts consisting of 9 fire
fighters and 1 chief officer each. The CSR acts as a liaison between the fire department
and the cities within the service area. Fire equipment at Station No. 30 includes 1 fire
engine, 1 paramedic squat, 1 quint (ladder truck), and 1 battalion chief command
vehicle.3
Fire Station No. 115 at 11317 Alondra Boulevard in the City of Norwalk provides
service to the northern portion of the City.4 Station No. 115 is equipped with 1 engine
and 1 mobile air unit. Shifts consist of four staff at this station.
The City has entered into an automatic response agreement with the Cities of Norwalk
and Cerritos to provide dispatch regardless of the city boundaries. Additionally, Station
No. 30 is part of a Mutual Aid Agreement with the County of Orange to provide
overlapping coverage in case of additional service need.
The LACFD response time goal is four minutes, but response time may vary depending
on the type of call.5

In addition to fire suppression and prevention activities, the Department provides
paramedic and emergency ambulance services through a contract with Care
Ambulance.
Fire Flow
Required fire flow is closely related to land use. Fire flow requirements depend on a
number of factors including building use, type of construction, size and presence of an
automatic fire sprinkler system. Fire flow requirements established by LACFD are shown
in Table SAF-1. The water system must be able to provide the required fire flow at a
minimum residual pressure of 20 psi. The City’s Water System Master Plan prepared in
1995 found that the existing water supply system was inadequate to provide the
maximum day demand plus a fire event.

Police Protection
Police service is provided under contract with the County of Los Angeles Sheriff’s
Department. The City is served by the Sheriff’s Lakewood Station at 5130 Clark Avenue
in Lakewood. The station and its two substations provide service to a 55-square mile
area, including six contract cities.6 Thirteen deputies are currently assigned to work in the
City of Artesia. There are no civilian employees assigned exclusively to the City.7
In 2007, the average response time for units responding to routine calls for service was
11 minutes and responses to emergency calls averaged 3 minutes. Response times are
computed beginning when the desk officer taking a call sends a computer message to
the dispatcher and ending when the first unit arrives on the scene. Emergency calls are
also voiced over the radio.8
The County does not utilize a specific formula or standard to deploy or assign law
enforcement personnel to a city based on population. Each city’s needs are evaluated
on an individual basis. Factors considered include area size, population, past crime

Evacuation Routes
Major arterial streets that connect to the 91 and 605 freeways, such as Pioneer
Boulevard, Norwalk Boulevard, and South Street, would serve as potential evacuation
routes during a disaster9, as shown in Exhibit SAF-1. These streets maintain right-of-way
widths of 80 to 100 feet and form a grid pattern across the City at approximately one-
half mile intervals. This grid pattern provides a variety of evacuation routes to local and
regional hospitals and shelters in the event of a fire or other emergency situation.

The City of Artesia is located in a built-out, urbanized area. Therefore, the most serious
fire threat within the City is man-made. Fire hazards within the City may be associated
with industrial uses, hazardous materials and arson. High-quality fire protection services
contribute to the overall protection of health, safety and welfare in the City. Adequate
personnel and equipment, minimization of hazards, and community education allow
Artesia to protect its residents from the threat of urban fires.

Noise Definitions
Noise is often defined as unwanted sound. Health studies have shown that excessive
noise can cause adverse physiological and psychological effects on human beings.
While sound levels can be easily measured, impacts on an individual person vary based
on subjective and physical responses.
Sound is created when an object vibrates and radiates part of its energy as acoustic
pressure waves through a medium such as air, water, or a solid. The ear, which is the
hearing mechanism of humans and most animals, receives these pressure waves and
converts them to neurological impulses, which are then transferred to the brain for
interpretation. The interpretation of sound depends both on the characteristics of the
sound and the characteristics of the individual person hearing it.
Artesia General Plan 2030                                                          N-1

NOISE SUB-ELEMENT
Standard Units of Measurement
Sound is technically described in terms of its loudness (amplitude) and frequency (pitch).
The standard unit of measurement of loudness of sound is the decibel (dB). Everyday
noises typically range from 30 dB (very quiet) to 100 dB (very loud). Decibels are based
on a logarithmic scale. The scale compresses the wide range in noise levels to a more
usable range of numbers, relating the sound pressure level of a noise source to the
reference pressure level.
Frequency is the rate of repetition of sound pressure oscillations (waves) as they reach
our ears and is expressed in hertz (Hz). When analyzing the total noise of any source,
the frequency components are sometimes analyzed to determine the relative amounts of
low-frequency, middle-frequency and high-frequency noise. Our ear is better equipped
to hear mid- and high-frequencies than lower frequencies. Thus, we find mid- and high-
frequency noise to be more annoying. High-frequency noise is also more capable of
causing hearing loss. Engineering solutions to noise issues are different for different
frequency ranges. Low-frequency noise is generally harder to control. The normal
frequency range of hearing for most people extends from about 20 Hz to about 10,000
to 15,000 Hz. People respond to sound most readily when the predominant frequency is
in the range of normal conversation, typically around 1,000 to 2,000 Hz.
Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to sound at all frequencies, several filters or
scales have been developed that match the sensitivity of the human ear and thus help us
evaluate the relative loudness of various sounds made up of different frequencies. The
“A” filter is the most commonly used for environmental noise sources. The A-weighted
decibel scale (dBA) performs this compensation by filtering or weighting frequencies to
approximate the response of the human ear to sound. The A-weighted filter significantly
deemphasizes those parts of the total noise that occur at frequencies that we do not hear
as well (frequencies below about 500 Hz and above 10,000 Hz). The filter has very little
effect, or is nearly “flat,” in the middle range of frequencies, where our ears are most
sensitive. Because this filter generally matches our ears’ sensitivity, sounds having a
higher A-weighted sound level or dBA are usually judged to be louder than those with a
lower A-weighted sound level.
Equivalent Sound Level (Leq)
The equivalent sound level (Leq) is a measure of the exposure resulting from the
accumulation of A-weighted sound levels over a particular time period (e.g., 1 hour, 8
hours, a school day, nighttime, or a full 24-hour day). Since the length of the period can
be different based on the timeframe of interest, the applicable period is identified along
with the metric (e.g. Leq(24)).
Leq may be thought of as a constant sound level over the period of interest, containing as
much total sound energy as the actual sound level that varies over time with peaks and
valleys. The two signals (the constant one and time-varying one) would sound very
different from each other if compared in real life. Variation in the “average” sound level
suggested by Leq is not an arithmetic value, but a logarithmic (“energy-averaged”) sound
level. Therefore, loud events dominate any noise environment described by the metric.

Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL)
Cumulative noise metrics were developed to assess community response to noise. These
metrics take into account the loudness and duration of the noise, the total number of
noise events and the time of day these events occur in one single-number rating scale.
They are also designed to account for the known health effects of noise on people.
These metrics are useful when evaluating noise within developed areas and developing
policies for noise.
The community noise equivalent level (CNEL) is a 24-hour, time-weighted energy-
average noise level based on dBA that measures the overall noise during the entire day.
Noise that occurs during certain sensitive time periods is penalized and weighted higher
by adding decibels to its Leq measurement. On the CNEL scale, noise occurring between
7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. is penalized by approximately five dB to account for the
greater potential for noise to interfere during these hours, as well as the typically lower
ambient (background) noise levels during these hours. Noise occurring during the night
(from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) is penalized by 10 dB to account for our higher
sensitivity to noise during the nighttime and the expected further decrease in ambient
noise levels that typically occur at night.
Day-Night Average (Ldn)
The day-night average noise level (Ldn) is a measure of the 24-hour average noise level
at a given location. It was adopted by the EPA for developing criteria to evaluate
community noise exposure. Ldn is based on a measure of the average noise level over a
given time period. The Ldn is calculated by averaging the Leq for each hour of the day at
a given location after weighting or penalizing the nighttime hours (10:00 p.m. to 7:00
a.m.) by 10 dBA to take into account the increased sensitivity of people to noises that
occur at night.
Other Noise Factors
As previously discussed, changes in the loudness of sound or the sound pressure are
described in a logarithmic manner. In general, a 1dBA change in the sound pressure
level of a given sound is detectable only under laboratory conditions. A 3 dBA change in
sound pressure level is a detectable difference in most situations. A 5 dBA change is
readily noticeable and a 10 dBA change is considered a doubling (or halving) of the
subjective loudness.
When looking at noise generated by traffic, a 3 dBA increase or decrease in the average
traffic noise level occurs through a doubling or halving of the traffic volume; or by about
a 7 mile per hour increase or decrease in speed. Noise barriers can provide
approximately a 5 dBA CNEL noise reduction, depending on the material, length,
location, and height. A row of buildings provides up to a 5 dBA CNEL noise reduction
with a 1.5 dBA CNEL reduction for each additional row up to a maximum reduction of
approximately 10 dBA. The exact level of noise attenuation depends on the nature and
orientation of the structure and intervening barriers.

Existing Conditions
Ambient Noise
Ambient noise is described as the all-encompassing background noise associated with a
given environment and is usually a composite of sounds from a variety of close and
distant sources.
Artesia’s noise environment is primarily dominated by vehicular traffic along the 91
freeway and the major arterials. The major arterials that traverse the City are Artesia
Boulevard, South Street and Pioneer Boulevard.
A Technical Memorandum identifying the existing noise conditions within the City was
prepared by RBF Consulting in 2007. Locations for noise measurements were selected
utilizing aerial photographs and a land use map. RBF utilized the aerial photograph to
divide the City into a concentric grid pattern. The grid was then further grouped into
similar land uses to determine specific areas to be measured. RBF determined seven
areas that would provide sufficient data to establish an acoustical baseline for the City.
RBF conducted one short-term noise measurement (10 minutes in length) in each
designated area. Additionally, RBF conducted one long-term noise measurement (24
hours in length). The noise measurement sites were representative of typical existing
noise exposure adjacent to major roadways as well as within residential and commercial
uses.
Short-Term Measurements
Noise monitoring equipment used for the ambient short-term noise survey consisted of a
Brüel & Kjær Hand-held Analyzer Type 2250 equipped with a 4189 microphone. The
monitoring equipment complies with applicable requirements of the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) for Type I (precision) sound level meters. The results of the
field measurements are indicated in Table N-1. Existing measured short-term noise
levels ranged from 50.8 dBA to 66.5 dBA.
Long-Term Measurement
Noise monitoring equipment used for the ambient long-term noise survey consisted of a
Larson Davis Laboratories Model LDL 820 sound level analyzer equipped with a Larson
Davis Random Incidence Model 2561 microphone. The instrumentation was calibrated
prior to use with a Larson Davis Model CAL250 acoustical calibrator to ensure the
accuracy of the measurements, and complies with applicable requirements of the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for Type I (precision) sound level meters.
The result of the field measurement is indicated in Table N-1. The long-term noise level
is approximately 63.1 dBA.

Noise Sensitive Receptors
Human response to noise varies widely depending on the type of noise, time of day and
the sensitivity of the receptor. The effects of noise on humans can range from temporary
or permanent hearing loss to stress and annoyance due to such things as sleep
deprivation and speech interference. Prolonged stress, regardless of the cause, is known
to contribute to a variety of health disorders.
Sensitive populations are more susceptible to the effects of noise and air pollution than
are the general population. Land uses considered sensitive by the State of California
include schools, playgrounds, athletic facilities, hospitals, rest homes, rehabilitation
centers and long-term care and mental care facilities. Some jurisdictions also consider
day care centers, single-family dwellings, mobile home parks, churches, and libraries to
be sensitive to noise. Generally, a sensitive receptor is identified as a location where
human populations (especially children, senior citizens, and sick persons) are present,
and where there is a reasonable expectation of continuous human exposure to noise.
Moderately sensitive land uses typically include: multi-family dwellings, hotels, motels,
dormitories and outpatient clinics. Land uses less sensitive to noise are business,
commercial and professional developments. Noise receptors categorized as being least

sensitive to noise include industrial, manufacturing, utilities, agriculture, natural open
space, undeveloped land, parking lots, motorcycle parks, rifle ranges, warehousing,
liquid and solid waste facilities, salvage yards and transit terminals. Some of these land
uses generate high noise levels.
Current land uses located within the City of Artesia that are sensitive to intrusive noise
include residential uses, schools, churches, and parks.
Noise and Land Use Compatibility Matrix
The State of California Office of Planning and Research (OPR) Noise Element Guidelines
include recommended interior and exterior level standards for local jurisdictions to
identify and prevent the creation of incompatible land uses due to noise. The OPR
Guidelines describe the compatibility of various land uses with a range of environmental
noise levels in terms of dBA CNEL.
A noise environment of 50 dBA CNEL to 60 dBA CNEL is considered to be “normally
acceptable” for residential uses. The State indicates that locating residential units, parks,
and institutions (such as churches, schools, libraries, and hospitals) in areas where
exterior ambient noise levels exceed 65 dBA CNEL is undesirable.                  The OPR
recommendations also note that, under certain conditions, more restrictive standards
than the maximum levels cited may be appropriate. As an example, the standards for
quiet suburban and rural communities may be reduced by 5 to 10 dB to reflect their
lower existing outdoor noise levels in comparison with urban environments.
In addition, Title 25, Section 1092 of the California Code of Regulations sets forth
requirements for the insulation of multiple-family residential dwelling units from
excessive and potentially harmful noise. Whenever multiple-family residential dwelling
units are proposed in areas with excessive noise exposure, the developer must
incorporate construction features into the building’s design that reduce interior noise
levels to 45 dBA CNEL or lower.
Table N-2, Noise and Land Use Compatibility Matrix, illustrates the guidelines
established by the State Department of Health Services for acceptable noise levels.
These guidelines are incorporated into the land use planning process to reduce future
noise and land use incompatibilities. This table is the primary tool that allows the City to
ensure integrated planning for compatibility between land uses and outdoor noise.

Normally Acceptable – Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are
of normal conventional construction, without any special noise insulation requirements.
Conditionally Acceptable – New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of
the noise reduction requirements is made and needed noise insulation features included in the design. Conventional
construction, but with closed windows and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning, will normally suffice.
Normally Unacceptable – New construction or development should be discouraged. If new construction or
development does proceed, a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise
insulation features included in the design.
Clearly Unacceptable – New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.
     City of Artesia Noise Standards
     The City of Artesia has established citywide interior and exterior noise level standards in
     a comprehensive Noise Ordinance within the Municipal Code. The purpose of the
     Ordinance is to control loud, unnecessary and unusual noises, sounds, or vibrations
     emanating from areas of the City. The Noise Ordinance (Municipal Code Title 5,
     Chapter 2: Noise) establishes daytime and nighttime permissible sound limits or levels
     for all residentially zoned properties in the City as well as prohibited noises.
     Artesia General Plan 2030                                                                        N-7

Permissible Exterior Sound Limits or Levels
The City’s Noise Ordinance establishes permissible exterior sound limits provided below.
The source cannot cause the noise level to exceed the greater of either the actual
measured ambient noise level, or the following ambient noise level for a cumulative
period of more than thirty minutes in any hour as measured at any property line:
                Time Period                              Permissible Noise Level

If the alleged offensive noise consists entirely of impact noise, simple tone noise, speech,
music, or any combination thereof, the permissible noise level set forth above is reduced
by 5 dBA.
The Ordinance allows for short term increases in noise levels as follows:

Permissible Interior Sound Limits or Levels
The City’s Noise Ordinance establishes permissible interior sound limits provided below.
The source cannot cause the noise level to exceed the greater of either the actual
measured ambient noise level, or the following ambient noise level for a cumulative
period of more than five minutes in any hour:
                Time Period                              Permissible Noise Level
             7:00 a.m.- 10:00 p.m.                                  55 dBA

Prohibited Noises
The Noise Ordinance states that it is unlawful for any person to willfully make or
continue, or cause to be made or continued, any loud, unnecessary, or unusual noise,
sound or vibration which unreasonably disturbs the peace and quiet of any
neighborhood or which causes discomfort or annoyance to any reasonable person of
normal sensitiveness residing in the area.
The Ordinance also regulates specific noise sources such as radios, mechanical devices
near residential areas, construction, emergency signaling devices, commercial
establishments adjacent to residential property, and leaf blowers.

C om m uni t y Pla nni ng P ri nciple N 1
Potential noise impacts are closely related to land use planning decisions. Because
future development in the City will be in the form of infill and redevelopment, the
likelihood of noise impacts based on differing uses will increase. Land use planning
decisions should consider both noise sources and receptors.
C om m uni t y Pla nni ng P ri nciple N 2
Transportation sources are the primary sources of noise in Artesia. Noise impacts
resulting from transportation sources are difficult to mitigate at the source. Therefore
sound attenuation measures are important to minimize exposure to noise.
C om m uni t y Pla nni ng P ri nciple N 3
Commercial and industrial uses, construction activity and other non-transportation
related sources of noise can negatively impact the noise environment. Identifying and
mitigating these potential noise sources will reduce negative impacts.
C om m uni t y Pla nni ng P ri nciple N 4
Residential uses and sensitive receptors such as schools, churches, and parks are most
likely to be affected by intrusive noise. Special consideration should be given when
planning for or implementing changes with the potential to increase noise around these
uses.

Legal Basis for the Cultural and Historic Resources Sub-Element
The Cultural and Historic Resources Sub-Element is not required per California
Government Code Section 65302; however, as cultural and historic preservation is of
importance to the community, it is prepared as an optional element per California
Government Code Section 65303.
Federal Law
The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) enacted in 1966 established the National
Register of Historic Places, authorized funding for state programs with participation by
local governments, created the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and
established a review process for protecting cultural resources. The NHPA provides the
legal framework for most state and local preservation laws. The National Register of
Historic Places is the nation's official list of cultural resources worthy of preservation. It is
part of a national program to coordinate and support public and private efforts to
identify, evaluate, and protect historic and archeological resources. The NHPA was
amended in 1980 to create the Certified Local Government (CLG) program,
administered through the State Office of Historic Preservation (OHP). This program
allows for direct local government participation and integration in a comprehensive
statewide historic preservation planning process. Cities and counties with CLG status
may compete for preservation funds allocated by the Congress and awarded to each
state.
State Law
The California Register of Historical Resources was established in 1992, through
amendments to the Public Resources Code. It serves as an authoritative guide to be used
by State and local agencies, private groups, and citizens to identify the State's historical
resources and to indicate what properties are to be protected from substantial adverse
change. The California Register includes resources that are formally determined eligible
for, or listed in, the National Register; State Historical Landmarks numbered 770 or

in accordance with criteria and procedures adopted by the SHRC; and resources and
districts designated as city or county landmarks when the designation criteria are
consistent with California Register criteria.
With establishment of the California Register and the SHRC, the State legislature
amended the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in 1992 to define historical
resources as a resource listed in (or determined eligible for listing in) the California
Register; a resource included in a local register of historical resources or identified as
significant in a historical resource survey that meets certain requirements; and any
object, building, structure, site, area, place, record, or manuscript which a lead agency
determines to be significant. Generally, a resource is considered to be historically
significant if it meets the criteria for listing in the California Register. However, a lead
agency under CEQA is not precluded from determining a resource is significant that is
not listed in (or determined eligible for listing in) the California Register, not included in
a local register, or identified in a historical resources survey as a historical resource, as
defined in the Public Resources Code.
CEQA was further amended to clarify that a project that may cause a substantial
adverse change in the significance of a historical resource is a project that may have a
significant effect on the environment. While demolition and destruction are obvious
significant impacts, it is more difficult to assess when change, alteration, or relocation
crosses the threshold of substantial adverse change. The state CEQA guidelines provide
that a project that demolishes or alters those physical characteristics of a historical
resource that convey its historical significance, (i.e., its character-defining features), can
be considered to materially impair the resource's significance. However, a project that
conforms to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic
Properties can generally be considered to be a project that will not cause a significant
impact.

History of Artesia
The village of Artesia formally became a community when the Artesia School District was
established on May 3, 1875. The first school was located on 183rd Street and Alburtis
Avenue. Artesia was named from the many naturally flowing artesian wells in the area.
The rural countryside with its rich soil and abundant water supply was ideal for farming,
and many early residents grew grapes, sugar beets, and other vegetables and fruits.
In the 1920s and 1930s, Dutch and Portuguese farmers developed Artesia into one of
the most important dairy districts in Southern California. After World War II, as with
many other cities in the region, Artesia was pressured by developers to build residential
tracts. The city of Dairy Valley was incorporated in 1956, and later became the city of
Cerritos. As the demand for housing continued, dairymen moved their operations further
east into Chino and north into the Central Valley. Artesia finally incorporated on May
29, 1959.

                                            Artesia Water Tower
                                            The Artesia Water Tower, the inactive water
                                            storage tank located on Clarkdale Avenue just
                                            south of 183rd Street, has been a familiar sight
                                            for citizens of Artesia for many years. However,
                                            little is known of its active past or when it was
                                            actually constructed. In an attempt to declare
                                            the Tower a Historical Landmark the City is
                                            asking citizens who may have information to
                                            share about its past, or have dated pictures of
                                            the tower, to come forward.
                                            The Tower, which can store up to 50,000
                                            gallons of water, was once owned by the
                                            Southern California Water Company, and was
                                            sold to the City of Artesia as an inactive water
                                            storage facility in 1988. The Tower was
                                            purchased by the City to be used only as a
point of historical interest, and to provide a special identity to the community. At that
time, the then-green Tower was quickly painted to its current color and the name Artesia
was painted on two sides.
Although the site was the actual site of an artesian well in 1911, no records can be
found that show when the existing Tower was actually built. It also may have been the
site of a smaller wood structure water tower. To qualify for historic designation through
the State of California, factual documentation must be presented.
Frampton-Dantema Home
In 2002, in partnership with the City of Artesia, the Artesia Historical Society saved the
historic 1929 Spanish Style Frampton-Dantema home which was moved to a former
park site. This home was restored and has become the Artesia Historical Museum which
is now open to the public. The museum is located at 18644 Alburtis Avenue and is open
the second Saturday of every month, from 1 to 3 p.m.
Portuguese in Artesia
Artesia DES (Divino Espírito Santo) was founded in 1927 with the idea to promote the
traditions of the Portuguese in Artesia. It came about after the founding of the Holy
Family Catholic Church in 1925 by the Portuguese community and by Father Manuel
Vicente, its first Pastor. In 1974, the Artesia DES went through a massive re-organization
due to the ideas of a growing number of immigrants, primarily from the Azores, who
wanted to become more active in the community. This re-organization helped make
Artesia DES one of the most successful Portuguese societies in California. The DES hall
at 11903 East Ashworth Street serves as a community center for celebrations and
sporting events, including “bloodless” bullfights.

The City of Artesia is a confluence of residential and commercial uses, characterized by
key retail corridors that serve both the local population and adjacent municipalities. In
December 2007, a market analysis was conducted for the City of Artesia. The report
identified current market conditions and overall development potential of the City.
Generally, the analysis found that Artesia is home to:
        508 retail establishments with $190 million in total retail sales in 2006;
        A largely middle class, diverse population, with an average household income of
         $52,323 per year;
        5,000 jobs within City limits primarily in the health care, retail trade, restaurant,
         and professional service sectors; and
        Four hotels, with an average occupancy of 75.8 percent.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SUB-ELEMENT
Retail Sector
Artesia’s current retail performance and future retail potential are influenced by the
larger context of Los Angeles County’s retail market. Los Angeles County retail sales
have grown only slightly over the past few years, and that increase has been
predominantly due to population growth rather than increased spending per capita.
Taxable retail sales totaled $190 million in Artesia in 2006, an increase in absolute
sales from 2001, but a decrease after adjusting for inflation. The 2007 market study
found a decline in auto sales over the 2001-2006 period, but expansion, in the same
period, of some retail categories including: service stations, food sales, and home
furnishings.
The overall negative sales trend is a reflection of increasing retail leakage from Artesia,
which experiences retail leakage in auto sales, general merchandise and apparel.
However, retailers capture more sales than expected in restaurants, home furnishings,
food stores, and building materials.
The City’s economy has been bolstered by its thriving commercial/retail centers, mainly
City Plaza at South Street and Pioneer Boulevard and the International Cultural District
(unofficially referred to as “Little India”). These areas serve as major retail destinations
and tourist attractions that should serve as a focal point in the overall strategy aimed at
business attraction and retention.
Overall Competitiveness
The surrounding cities of Cerritos and Long Beach are direct retail competitors to
Artesia. In 2005, Cerritos had total sales of $2.4 billion and Long Beach had total sales
of $4.3 billion. The City of Artesia has outperformed most surrounding cities on a retail
sales per resident basis. After adjusting for inflation, retail sales were down across all
cities in the surrounding area between 2000 and 2005.
Hotel Market
While Artesia’s share of the regional travel and tourism sector is small, it has seen
significant growth in recent years, with increases in daily room rates, occupancy rates,
and total revenues. Its hotels serve both the business and leisure visitor, and the
average daily room rate is consistent with a market dominated by middle tier hotels.
Artesia’s hotel market lacks a quality higher-end hotel which could capture travel
demand that is currently served by other area hotels.
Business Environment
In the face of harsh economic times and the disbandment of the Artesia Chamber of
Commerce, both the public and private sector in Artesia have realized the importance of
maintaining constant dialogue and positive relationships. In 2009, private sector
representatives voted in the Board of Directors to represent the newly formed Artesia
Business Association. As the City looks ahead with this General Plan, it is essential to
work in partnership with the business community to retain and attract companies.

Labor Force
As of 2007, 10% of the population of Artesia is between the ages of 18-24, 28% is
between the ages of 25-44, 13% is between the ages of 45-54, and 10% is between the
ages of 55-64. Artesia is very ethnically diverse, with White (over 40 percent), Asian
(34.5 percent), and Other Race (15 percent) as the largest racial categories. Latinos of
all racial categories make up 36 percent of the population. Over 80 percent of the
population has graduated from high school and 25 percent has a bachelor’s degree or
higher.
The California Employment Development Department projected job growth in Artesia in
retail; information; real estate, rental and leasing; education services; and health care
and social assistance. Programs to increase the job preparedness of residents can
develop a qualified workforce for these opportunities.

The resulting consequences of our changing climate are well documented. Sea level
rise, more extreme weather and heat waves, prolonged drought and depleted resources
are just a few of the major concerns that unite the residents and business owners of
Artesia with the region, the State, and beyond. Increased poverty, hunger, job loss and
economic disparity are both symptoms of and contributors to the current global crisis.
Based on this understanding, the City of Artesia recognizes the need for a new
consciousness and commitment with respect to local planning decisions to strive for a
healthy environment, a stable economy and increased quality of life.
Definition of Sustainability
The most widely acknowledged definition of sustainability comes from the Brundtland
Commission Report in 1987, which described sustainability as “development that meets
the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs.” Sustainability requires that the social and economic decisions made
by the City, its residents and business owners allow our economy and community to
thrive without destroying the natural resources that support our way of life.
This Sustainability Element charts the City’s course for progress towards this objective,
through goals, policies and actions that are based on the three pillars of sustainability:
Environment, Economy and Equity.
Environmental Quality
Environmental sustainability maintains a stable, quality resource base, avoiding over-
exploitation of renewable resource systems and depletion of non-renewable resources.
This includes maintenance of biodiversity, clean air, and other ecosystem functions.
Economic Vitality
Economic sustainability produces goods and services on a continuing basis and keeps
the local economic capital intact, with employment opportunities for workers of all skill
levels. This principle encourages new approaches to economic development that involve

coordination and integration of environmental and social concerns.
Equal Opportunity
The principle of social equity works to achieve distributional equity, adequate provision
of social services including health and education, and political accountability and
participation--regardless of factors like race, income level, sexual orientation, or age.
Social equity strives to continually enhance and renew the skills and attributes of people
and their social environments.
Relation to Other City Policies
Sustainability is, by its nature, a holistic, broad-ranging concept that pulls from,
contributes to, and creates synergies with multiple planning goals and focus areas within
the City. As a result, there is abundant overlap between this Element and other Elements
of the General Plan. This Sustainability Element provides the big-picture goals and
policies which may be addressed or expanded upon in other Elements. The Sustainability
Element provides a comprehensive policy framework to guide the City’s green efforts
and provide a foundation upon which to build future programs and practices.
The Sustainability Element is consistent with the rest of the General Plan and will enable
the City to collaborate with other jurisdictions and create public/private partnerships to
achieve sustainability, as many of the goals and policies are similar to other programs
within the State.
The Sustainability Element was developed as part of the General Plan as a direct result
of the established vision for the future of Artesia. The Element pulls goals, policies and
targets into one place to emphasize the City’s focus on environmental, economic and
social sustainability. This focus on sustainability will require the City to develop new
and/or change existing programs, establish new priorities, and commit resources to
these priorities. While some of the actions identified will require additional resources, the
Sustainability Element, as part of the General Plan, has the potential to increase local
and regional job production as well as reduce long-term energy costs for local residents
and businesses.
Artesia’s focus on sustainability is new, but many of the City’s existing policies and
programs already contribute to sustainability. Land use policies and goals encourage a
stable economic base and provide for social needs while mitigating environmental
impacts and providing for open space. The Circulation Element includes language that
prioritizes traffic demand management and anticipates a potential commuter light-rail
transit station along the existing railroad right-of-way. The Infrastructure Element
includes policies regarding water conservation and source reduction and recycling. The
newly adopted Water Conservation Ordinance and Water Efficient Landscape
Ordinance are intended to reduce water use and demand for water. The Open
Space/Conservation Element prioritizes the establishment of open space and recreation
opportunities, and promotes water conservation through drought tolerant landscaping.
There are numerous examples of efforts to improve the City’s performance with respect
to sustainability. It is the intention of this Element to focus and expand these efforts to
allow for greater prosperity, environmental health, and quality of life.

Existing Policy and Gap Assessment
While the previous General Plan provided reasonable attention to environmental, social
and economic sustainability, there were areas that needed improvement within the
existing policies and programs. Following is the previous policy framework for
sustainability, including deficiencies that this Element is designed to address.
Land Use
The previous General Plan encouraged development plans that are less automobile-
oriented and that promote integration of land uses to shift transportation from
automobile to transit, bicycles and pedestrian modes. While the Pioneer Specific Plan
included this as a goal, there is a need for increased focus on mixed-use, higher density
development that would support non-vehicular mobility.
Transportation/Circulation
The previous General Plan included a discrepancy regarding support for a commuter
fixed-rail line, and lacked a strategy to alleviate and protect against future increases in
traffic congestion. The previous General Plan also encouraged development plans that
are less automobile-oriented, and that promote integration of land uses to encourage a
transportation shift from the automobile to transit, bicycles, and pedestrians.
Resource Conservation
The previous General Plan encouraged private developers to consider energy and water
conservation, and required all new construction, including major renovations, to retrofit
all existing or proposed plumbing with water conservation devices. The previous
General Plan also promoted water conservation through appropriate landscaping, and
encouraged water conservation awareness and practices throughout the City. In June
2009, the City adopted a Water Ordinance that prohibits watering of landscapes or
lawns more than once a day, and provides regulations on timing and frequency of
irrigation, among other provisions. In January 2010, the City adopted a Water Efficient
Landscaping Ordinance in accordance with the State’s Water Conservation in
Landscaping Act.
Air Quality
The previous General Plan promoted compliance with regional air quality measures.
Regional air quality goals and targets, including those for climate change and
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, have undergone major developments, and therefore
there is a need for additional focus on meeting air quality and climate change goals
through specific policies and programs.
Waste Reduction
The previous General Plan supported compliance with Assembly Bill 939, the California
Integrated Waste Management Act. However, the Plan lacked an implementing program
to meet and exceed the requirements of AB 939.
Artesia General Plan 2030                                                        SUS-3

SUSTAINABILITY ELEMENT
Open Space / Recreation
The previous General Plan supported establishment of open space uses, including
development and expansion of recreational land, conservation of natural resources, and
maintenance of man-made amenities. It encourages the use of vegetation to protect
and/or enhance visual resources and air quality, and aid in recharging groundwater. It
also includes a policy that focuses efforts for park development in underserved areas,
and a tree planting program for all residential areas. Additionally, the Pioneer
Boulevard Enhancement Downtown Design Guidelines includes tree selection based on
water use performance, provision of shade and stormwater infiltration capabilities,
among other guidelines.
Social Equity
The Environmental Impact Report for the previous General Plan includes mitigation that
requires a percentage of new housing developments to be dedicated to low-income
and/or senior residents.
The Urban Environmental Accords
The Urban Environmental Accords (UEA) is an internationally recognized agreement that
includes a set of 21 Actions that the United Nations has asked city governments to adopt
and implement over a seven year period, culminating on World Environment Day in
2012. There are currently over 100 cities that have signed on to the UEA.
The City recognizes the UEA as a valuable guide in the effort to make Artesia a more
sustainable city. As such, the Sustainability Element is modeled after the UEA, and is
tailored to meet the specific needs, the local and regional environmental and legislative
climate, and the resources of the City of Artesia. At this time, the City does not assume
full participation in the Green Cities Declaration, or the target date of 2012 for
completed actions under the UEA. But by using the UEA as a foundation, the City takes
advantage of a well-recognized framework that still allows the flexibility for the City to
address the actions that make sense at any given time during the General Plan timeline.

vision for a sustainable Artesia. These goals are grouped into 9 focus areas: energy,
waste reduction, urban design, urban nature, transportation, environmental & public
health, climate protection & air quality, water, and economic vitality. This Element also
includes an Implementation Matrix to aid the City in developing priorities and charting
progress towards the goals and policies of the Sustainability Element.
 Ene rg y
The United States is increasingly dependent on foreign oil. The world’s supply of fossil
fuels cannot sustain our current rate of consumption infinitely; therefore, there is an
urgent need to increase efficient use of available resources, and develop alternative
sources for energy, including renewable sources such as solar, wind and geothermal. It
will take many years to transition from a fossil fuel economy to a renewable energy
economy. The City will support more sustainable land use patterns, green building
design, energy efficiency, and alternative transportation options in both public and
private developments. It will also support local and regional job creation through the
increased use of renewable energy sources and potential development of renewable
energy production facilities.

Was te Re ductio n
Landfills have historically been the lowest cost alternative for eliminating waste, but this
traditional method has become less attractive due to several factors. Our use of
materials flows in a linear fashion from raw materials, to products, to the landfill--in
contrast with nature, where materials flow in a cycle. Resources are diminishing as we
bury them in overburdened landfills. Landfills consume valuable land, diminish
surrounding land values, and contaminate local groundwater. Decomposing waste in
landfills emits greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Encouraging and
implementing programs to reduce, reuse and recycle our resources is paramount in
order to alleviate the burden on the environment and on local landfills.

Urb an D es ig n
Through past development, we have shaped the places in which we live, that in turn
shape the patterns of our own behavior. Our sprawling cities require long commutes.
Our streets discourage pedestrians and bicycles. Our building materials and methods
waste resources and contribute to climate change. We must adopt a different approach
to designing the built environment that will instead encourage walking, bicycling, and
public transportation as the primary modes of transportation. To do this, the urban
design focus must shift from segregated land uses, such as office parks and strip malls,
to mixed-use neighborhoods that integrate land uses such as office, commercial,
institutional and residential. By integrating land uses in a compact design that also
supports safe streets accessible by all modes of transportation, the City can encourage
people to leave their cars behind.

The urban environment can become a harsh “concrete jungle” without urban nature.
Urban nature has the ability to cool the microclimate and clean the air. Trees and
plants turn carbon dioxide into oxygen and improve water quality while absorbing and
storing carbon from the atmosphere. Urban nature also contributes economic benefits
by increasing property values and lowering building energy use by providing shade.

Recent research has connected public health and smart growth. A report for the US
Green Building Council concludes that such smart development factors such as density,

C l ima te P rote ct ion & Ai r Qua li t y
Air quality is a major environmental health issue for the Southern California region.
Vehicles and other mobile sources powered by combustion cause most of our air
pollution. Ozone, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, sulfur dioxide, and oxides of
nitrogen are problematic air pollutants that can be reduced through local and regional
efforts.
Global climate change has occurred naturally without human influence over the course
of thousands or millions of years. However, some scientists believe that the climate shift
presently taking place is occurring at a quicker rate and magnitude. Scientific evidence
suggests that global climate change is the result of increased concentrations of
greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth’s atmosphere, including carbon dioxide,
methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. Some scientists believe that this
increased rate of climate change is the result of greenhouse gases generated by human
activity and industrialization over the past 200 years.
California is a substantial contributor of global GHGs, emitting over 400 million tons of
carbon dioxide per year.1 California has three major regulatory acts that address
climate change: Executive Order S-3-05, which established GHG emissions reduction
targets; followed by Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), the Global Warming Solutions Act of
2006, which established a statewide program to limit GHG emissions from all major
industries; and Senate Bill 375, which aims to reduce GHG emissions from automobiles
and light trucks by requiring metropolitan planning organizations to include
“Sustainable Communities Strategies” in their regional transportation plans.
In conjunction with these and other climate change policies, changes in lifestyle and
behavior patterns, as well as management practices, can contribute to climate change
mitigation and have a positive role in reducing GHG emissions, according to the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Fourth Assessment Report. The City has
the greatest control over its own operations, yet even greater emission reduction results
can be attained through the City’s jurisdiction over the built environment. The City also
has the power to influence other jurisdictions to achieve their own climate protection
goals.

Southern California has a history of drying lakes and rivers, and is currently suffering
from decreased water supply resulting from drought, reduced availability of imported
water due to restrictions in the Sacramento River Delta, and continued drawdown of
stored groundwater. As development and population growth continue, it is imperative
that the City, its residents, and property owners be conscious of our water use habits.
There are many opportunities to reduce water consumption through education,
landscaping, changing consumption habits, and retrofits.

A.      INTRODUCTION
During 2008, the City sought input on the concerns and ideas of community members
and housing stakeholder groups through community outreach activities. The City held a
community workshop on March 6, 2008 at the Albert O. Little Community Center. The
workshop was advertised and open to the public. In addition, the City invited
stakeholder organizations such as housing advocacy groups, developers and community
service organizations to participate.
Workshop participants were provided with a brief overview of the Housing Element
content, update process and background. They were then asked to identify challenges
and opportunities related to the construction, maintenance and improvement of housing
in Artesia.
B.      WORKSHOP NOTES
The following are notes taken from the community discussion at the community
workshop on housing challenges and opportunities.
Challenges
       High rents
       Money (from rent) leaves the City
       Owners receive rent – live out of Area
            o Don’t spend money in Artesia
       Mobile home tenants are “stuck” due to high land costs
            o Particularly seniors
       Lack of suitable housing
       High cost of housing = people can’t afford to stay
       Costs limit housing variety…develop large units on property
            o Not a lot of single units, studios, etc.
            o Minimum middle sized housing
       Maintenance = increase in Rent

A.      AV AILAB ILITY OF S ITES F OR HOUS ING
State Housing Element Law mandates that each city show it has adequate sites available
through appropriate zoning and development standards and with the required public
services and facilities for a variety of housing types and incomes. This evaluation of
adequate sties represents a planning goals and not a requirement for actual production
of housing within the planning period. The City must demonstrate that it has capacity or
adequate sites to accommodate the projected need for housing.
The DOF is responsible for developing the total statewide housing demand projection.
With HCD, this demand is apportioned to each of the state’s regions. The demand
represents the number of additional units needed to accommodate the anticipated
growth in the number of households, to replace expected demolitions and conversions
of housing units to non-residential uses and to allow for a future vacancy rate conducive
to healthy functioning of the housing market.
SCAG, the Council of Governments (COG) representing the region, in cooperation with
local jurisdictions is responsible for allocating the region’s projected new housing
demand in each jurisdiction. This process is known as the Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) and the goals are referred to as the RHNA goals or the “regional
share” goals for new housing construction. The allocation takes into account factors
such as market demand for housing, employment opportunities, the availability of
suitable sites and public facilities, commuting patterns, type and tenure of housing need
and others. In determining a jurisdiction’s share of new housing needs by income
category, the allocation is adjusted to avoid an over-concentration of lower income
households in any one jurisdiction. Cities must also plan for the growth needs in the
extremely low income category (30 percent or less than the median income). The
extremely low income need is assumed to be 50 percent of the very low income
allocation. The allocation is divided into four income categories:
       Very Low Income- 31 to 50 percent of the median income;
       Low Income- 51 to 80 percent of the median income;
       Moderate Income- 81 to 120 percent of the median income; and,
       Above Moderate Income- more than 120 percent of the median income.
The RHNA prepared by SCAG for the planning period of January 1, 2006 through June
30, 2014 identifies the City of Artesia’s share of the region’s housing needs as 132 new
housing units. The City’s share of the region’s housing needs for 2006-2014, as
determined by SCAG, is the projected housing need used in this evaluation.

                        APPENDIX B: RESIDENTIAL LAND RESOURCES
are counted as “credits” towards the RHNA need. From January 1, 2006 through May
2008, there were 31 dwelling units constructed in Artesia. All 31 units are assumed to
be affordable to Above Moderate-Income households. Information for these units is
provided in Table B-1 and the locations of these units are shown in Exhibit B-1. Based
on this adjustment, the regional housing needs for 2006-2014 is 100 units, with the
allocations based on income category shown in Table B-2.

3.     Vacant Land
Artesia is generally built-out and there are few pieces of vacant land remaining
throughout the City. Table B-4 summarizes the capacity for new units on these vacant
parcels. Exhibit B-3 shows the location of the vacant parcels. Based on the provisions of
AB 2348, jurisdictions in Los Angeles County with a population less than 25,000 are
considered suburban jurisdictions. Therefore, the default density of at least 20 du/ac
would allow Artesia to accommodate housing for lower-income households. Parcels
located in the MR zone (shown in bold text) have the potential to develop at a net density
of 21 du/ac based on the permitted density and lot development standards including
setbacks and lot coverage requirements, however none of the sites have the capacity to
accommodate 16 dwelling units on a single site. Therefore, the capacity of the vacant
land of 40 dwelling units is assumed to be used towards the City’s above-moderate
income need.

4.       Underutilized Land
The City has identified four underutilized parcels located in the MR zone that are
currently used for parking. These parcels have the potential capacity of 19 dwelling units
at a net density of 21 du/ac. Given the built-out nature of the City and the high demand
for developable land, it is reasonable to assume these parcels will be redeveloped with
residential uses with a parking component. Table B-5 summarizes these parcels. Exhibit
B-4 shows the locations of these parcels.

5.      Rezoning Program
Pursuant to AB 2348, jurisdictions with a shortfall of vacant and underutilized residential
land to meet its RHNA needs must commit to a rezoning program to provide adequate
sites to meet its housing growth needs. The program must adhere to the following
parameters:
      Sites must be rezoned to accommodate 100 percent of the RHNA shortfall for
        lower-income units
      Rezoned sites must accommodate owner-occupied and multi-family residential
        uses by-right
      At least 50 percent of the very-low and low income housing need shall be
        accommodated on sites designated for residential use and for which
        nonresidential use or mixed uses are not permitted.
a. Downtown Specific Plan
The City is currently drafting the Downtown Specific Plan. The Downtown Specific Plan
area is currently developed with mainly strip commercial centers and parking lots. The
buildings are mostly between 20 and 40 years old. The City has received interest from
developers to redevelop the area with mixed use and higher intensity development.
Within the Specific Plan, there will be a mixed use overlay or district which will allow the
development of residential units at a minimum net density of 20 du/ac in conjunction
with commercial uses. Table B-6 summarizes the projected capacity of the parcels within
the proposed mixed use area. The proposed Specific Plan area is shown in Exhibit B-5.
Of the parcels within the mixed use overlay, 5 have the capacity to accommodate at
least 16 dwelling units on a single site. The 178 dwelling units projected for these 5
parcels can be utilized by the City to accommodate its lower-income housing needs.

b. Rezoning for Exclusively Residential Use to Meet Lower-Income Growth Needs
The City will need to rezone areas in addition to the Downtown Specific Plan area in
order to accommodate the remainder of its lower-income housing growth needs. The
City has identified 2 vacant parcels within the City which it will rezone from Medium
Density Residential (MDR) to new zone allowing exclusive by-right residential
development at a minimum net density of 20 du/ac. Table B-6 summarizes the target
parcels for rezoning. Based on the provisions of AB 2348, the capacity for 41 dwelling
units on these sites can be counted towards meeting the City’s lower-income RHNA
needs. Exhibit B-6 shows the location of these sites.

B.      PRESERVATION OF ASSISTED UNITS AT RISK OF CONVERSION
State Housing Element Law requires the analysis of government-assisted housing that is
eligible to change from low-income to market-rate housing during the 2006-2014
planning period and the 5 years subsequent (2015-2019). Housing assistance could be
a rental subsidy, mortgage subsidy or mortgage insurance to an assisted housing
development. Government assisted housing might convert to market rate housing for a
number of reasons including expiring subsidies, mortgage repayments or expiration of
affordability restrictions. The City of Artesia does not have any units at risk of conversion
through 2019.

permitted uses shall include multiple-family dwelling units sited together with
typical permitted commercial uses of the C-G zone, with the exception of uses that
are incompatible with residential uses, such as light manufacturing, automotive
servicing or other uses that may pose potential health and safety risks or nuisances
to residents of the mixed-use development. In additional, development standards
for mixed use residential and commercial uses shall be subject to the same
development standards of the C-G zone as commercial use unless otherwise
stated. However, certain development standards (maximum floor area, parking
requirements and development fees, and maximum floor area) for mixed use
development projects providing affordable housing shall be flexible. If affordable
housing is provided in a mixed-use development project, the following shall apply:
a) the maximum allowable floor area of the commercial component may be
increased by up to 10%; b) the parking requirement for both the commercial and
the residential components shall be reduced; and c) development fees shall be
waived.

the units shall be at market rate. In addition, the minimum housing density shall be
21 units per acre and the maximum 24 units per acre. However, the developer
would retain the option of building at the lower density permitted by the Specific
Plan’s development standards. In addition, amend the Specific Plan to allow
residential units to be developed above the first floor of commercial buildings. The

       purpose of potentially amending the Redevelopment Plan to add residential areas
       to the existing project area (Policy 2.1 action) and to determine potential sites for
       future housing developments. The Agency could then attempt to purchase
       underutilized sites offered for sale in the project area for future affordable housing
