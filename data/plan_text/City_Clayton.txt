                                  CIRCULATION SETTING
The City of Clayton is situated in a regional circulation system indicated in Exhibit III-1.
 In the regional context the arterials in the Clayton area are Ygnacio Valley B Kirker Pass
Road and Clayton Road. These roads carry most of the commute traffic from east
Concord and the Clayton area to Interstate Route 680 and State Route 24 for destinations
in downtown Concord, Walnut Creek, Martinez, Pittsburg, Antioch, Alameda County and
San Francisco. Concord Boulevard also serves to carry commute traffic, but does so for
lower volumes. At present, Concord Boulevard south of Kirker Pass Road changes its
name to Oakhurst Drive at Clayton’s City limits. This road connects with Clayton Road.
Clayton Road carries traffic to downtown Clayton from State Route 24 in Concord.
Marsh Creek Road carries traffic to Clayton from residential developments and ranches
to the east between Clayton and Brentwood. Marsh Creek Road is primarily a rural
facility. Clayton and Marsh Creek Roads meet both in the Town Center (where Marsh
Creek Road ends) and adjacent to the Diablo view Middle School (where Clayton Road
ends and Marsh Creek Road turns to the Town Center).
Other important roads in Clayton are Pine Hollow and Mitchell Canyon. Pine Hollow
Road is a two-lane residential street that has been widened to four lanes to serve new
subdivisions. It often serves as a bypass to the Ygnacio Valley B Clayton Road
intersection, a use the City of Clayton would prefer to discourage because the road is not
designed for such use and because heavy bypass traffic would adversely affect a large
number of residents whose properties front directly onto the road. Mitchell Canyon Road
carries heavy truck traffic to and from the local quarries at times. The number of tandem
gravel trucks traveling on Mitchell Canyon Road and Clayton and Pine Hollow Roads
depends upon the amount and location of construction activities in the surrounding areas
and time of year. Truck travel is greatest during the dry season.

                                      Capacity Terms
Discussion of traffic capacity is an indication of how well the circulation system serves
area land use. The four common measures of traffic efficiency are as follows:
a.      Average Daily Trips B This measures either the vehicle trips generated per
        residence (10-15 depending on the size of unit) or the number of cars passing over
        a stretch of roadway during a certain period of time.
b.      Peak-Hour Trips - This measures the number of cars passing per hour and
        normally representing the worst case on a roadway. Afternoon peak hour (4:00 B
        6:00) appears to be the heaviest usage of the area’s circulation system. Morning
        peak hours (6:30 B 8:30) is approaching the same level of volume. The peak
        hour normally carries 10% of daily volume. If the Clayton peak hours proportion
        is extended to the entire commute hours of 6:30 to 9:00 AM and 4:00 to 6:30 PM,
        over 30% of the daily usage will be accounted for leaving 70% of the traffic
        dispersed over 19 hours. The capacity of system is judged by peak response. In
        transportation planning the expansion of the peak period or dispersal of peak
        traffic is sought to improve system function at capacity. Reduction of peak
        commute hours through work staggering and flex-time will allow more efficient
        use of the road systems. Otherwise, costly methods of road expansion and
        improvement of flow become necessary.
        The non-system alternatives are to tolerate increased commute periods and delays
        or prevent additional development.
c.      Intersection level of service measure is identified in the table below:
        Level of Service        Average Delay Seconds per Vehicle
                  A                          0.0 B 16.0
                  B                        16.1 B 22.0
                  C                        22.1 B 28.0
                  D                        28.1 B 35.0
                  E                        35.1 B 40.0
                  F                        40.1 or greater
        Level of service is based on amount of delay experienced by vehicles that pass
        through an intersection. The number is determined by calculating the average
        delay experienced by all the vehicles in a 24 hour period.
        As the average delay increases, it is easy to envision delay of several minutes at
        each intersection during peak commute hours.
                                                                              (Revised 6/28/95)

d.        Street Capacity measure can be described in two ways. The first is the physical
          capacity of a street, which means the ability of a street to carry a certain number
          of vehicles per hour. A standard two B lane road for instance is considered to
          have the capacity of 1,000 vehicles per hour. Such a capacity is limited by
          driveways, left turns, stop signs and cross traffic. Capacities are identified for the
          following roads:
          Street                    Size          Vehicles Maximum Cars per Hour
          Concord Boulevard         2 lanes               1000 B 1200
          Concord Boulevard         4 lanes               2500 B 3000
          Clayton Road              2 lanes               1100 B 1300
          Pine Hollow Road          2 lanes               1000 B 1200
          In contrast to the physical capacity of the street, a capacity index is used as a
          relative index tied to the level of service. The level of highest acceptable delay is
          considered to be 100% of capacity. This is not the physical capacity but
          acceptable capacity. Levels of service higher than 100% indicate street usage at
          levels in excess of acceptable capacity. In larger metropolitan areas gradual
          acceptance of longer delays by commuters has been a documented phenomena.
                    EXISTING AND PROJECTED TRAFFIC LEVELS
Traffic data used in this plan is based on data generated for the Keller EIR’s and other
sources as noted. Keller data was prepared by D. K. Goodrich and included information
supplied by the cities of Walnut Creek and Concord. The data reflects existing traffic
conditions (9/19/83) and projections for new development. Primary anticipated
development will be on Keller Ranch, however, smaller projects such as Regency
Meadows and infill sites are also included in the tabulation. The data in Exhibit III-2A
assumes that Keller will develop 1,825 units with a total of 190,000 square feet of
commercial development, 60,000 square feet of office space and 500 infill units. A
previous set of projections indicated in Exhibit III-2B assumed 2,016 units to be
developed on Keller Ranch with 728,000 square feet of commercial space, 120,000
square feet of office space and 712 infill units.
Exhibit III-2Aindicates the most recent peak traffic levels based on projected growth
while Exhibit III-2B identifies peak traffic levels based on high growth assumptions. The
General Plan numbers adopted 7/85 for Keller Ranch and Clayton fall below those
identified in Figure III-2A as the table below indicates:
          Keller Ranch Residential                744 to 1486 units
          Commercial Retail Development.          190,000 Square Feet
          Office Development                      60,000 Square Feet
          Residential Infill                      100 to 645 Units
Since circulation is a primary concern related to development in Clayton, additional
traffic studies will be required to update previous information and facilitate determination
of mitigation.

                                      AREA GROWTH
Clayton’s development is minor when taken in the context of subregional development.
Since January 1983, a total of 153 new homes have been built in Clayton (1/83 B 12/84),
about 6 homes per month. This represents an 11% increase in the number of homes in
Clayton and consequently an 11% increase in the number of current vehicle trips in
Clayton. Clayton has cut back on projected growth several times since incorporation,
due to circulation and other issues. Presently Clayton’s employment-generating
development and commercial development is very low. The residential development
identified represents 20-year total build-out. It should be noted that the ABAG needs
assessment indicates 710 units are needed by 1990, and it is not possible to meet this goal
within the present City limits without severe environmental shortcomings.
In contrast the initial findings of the Interstate 680 and Interstate 580 Corridor Study
Circulation Element                           Page III-10                            March 2000

(10/84) include the following points:
1.        By the year 2000 45,000 new households are anticipated in East County.
2.        Employment in the Central Contra Costa County is expected to increase by
          63,000 new jobs.
3.        The largest projected increase in commute trips will be out of the east Contra
          Costa County area traveling southbound through Central Contra Costa County.
          Commuters from Pittsburg B Antioch area are likely to use arterials such as
          Kirker Pass Road.
4.        A monitoring system should be developed to track study area development
          proposals and their status.
5.        Cities and counties should require major developments to provide for short-term
          transportation mitigation measures to decrease the immediate need for additional
          improvements.
6.        The separation of job location in Central County and residential development in
          East County will promote long distance commuting, increase highway travel and
          increase facility improvement needs.
Based on these points it appears Clayton is caught between major employment
development in Central County and major residential development in East County. The
residents of Clayton are extremely concerned over the changes that have occurred in area
traffic. Exhibit III B 3 indicates the projected addition of Clayton traffic upon existing
area roadways. It does not include additional traffic due to actions in other jurisdictions.
Clayton is willing to participate in regional solutions that include analysis of factors such
as employment generation, land cost, transportation system improvement, encouragement
of alternatives to the single-vehicle-occupant commuter, land use, and the respective
roles of area communities in the problem.

            ROAD IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY UPON DEVELOPMENT
The greatest impact of new development is the effect of traffic upon service levels would
be during the PM peak B hour traffic flow between 4:00 and 6:00 PM daily. Congestion
would increase between 6:00 and 8:30 AM but to a lesser peak.
Exhibit III-4 indicates the level of service and capacity index for area intersections under
existing conditions and upon buildout. This does not include new developments within
other jurisdictions. Without adequate mitigation it appears that unacceptable intersection
deterioration can be anticipated at area intersections. In 1981 the City of Clayton
adopted a resolution which established a city policy for the collection of off-site
arterials/street improvement fees from new residential development.
Circulation Element                          Page III-12                            March 2000
Design Improvements
Intersection details and EIR mitigation measures are not normally considered in the text
of the General Plan. However, the importance of circulation and design in consideration
of city buildout prompts inclusion. Resolution of design details will occur at the project
level.
The following improvement measures are included in the Keller Ranch EIR (1983) in
order to improve area traffic flow. The measures are intended to maintain a level of
service of D or better at all signalized intersection and mid-block roadway segments.
a.        Improve Clayton Road between Kirker Pass Road and Oak Street. This will
          require realigning and straightening, widening in some locations, providing turn
          lanes at all intersections, and providing signals where necessary. Sufficient right-
          of-way for lanes with turn pockets, should it ultimately be necessary, should also
          be acquired.
b.        Widen Concord Boulevard to four lanes between Kirker Pass Road and Bailey
          Roads. Figure 20 shows how lane requirements would change on local roadways,
          including Clayton Road and Concord Boulevard, in response to traffic produced
          following Keller Ranch development. This would require use of some existing
          frontage of homes lining Concord Boulevard. An alternative would be to provide
Circulation Element                            Page III-13                           March 2000
          an optional two-way left turn lane plus the two existing through lanes. This
          would separate the many turning vehicles from the through traffic flow.
c.        Widen intersection approaches on Marsh Creed Road south of the Keller
          development and on Pine Hollow Road to provide room for turning lanes. This
          may require removal of minor amounts of landscaping on these approaches
d.        Widen and restripe intersection approaches (Exhibit III B 5) to the intersection of
          Kirker Pass Road with Clayton Road and with Concord Boulevard, and of
          Clayton Road with Mitchell Canyon Road.
          The City of Concord has found that in addition to these improvements the
          intersection of Kirker Pass Road/Clayton Road will require a second, or dual, left
          turn lane to accommodate Clayton buildout traffic (Franzen).
Circulation Element                          Page III-14                             March 2000
e.        Extend Concord Boulevard through the Keller Ranch site as a four-lane arterial
          with turning lanes at all points to its intersection with the Marsh Creek Road
          extension. Separate the intersections along Concord Boulevard by at least 800
          feet, and use four-leg intersections rather than “Tee” intersections wherever
          possible. The site plan reflects this type of planning and would help divert traffic
          from Concord Boulevard and downtown Clayton.
f.        South of the Marsh Creek Road extension, Concord Boulevard should be a two-
          lane road. Reserve sufficient right-of-way for a four-lane road in case additional
          lanes are required in the future.
g.        Make the Marsh Creek Road extension south of Main Street four lanes and
          provide turning lanes at each intersection in order to provide adequate traffic
          flow.
h.        Place traffic signal hardware at the Marsh Creek Road-Concord Boulevard
          intersection. A signal will probably be necessary when Keller Ranch is fully
          developed.
i.        Increase the curvature of residential roads to produce a more serpentine alignment
          with curve design speeds not over 25 miles per hour. This would promote lower
          speeds and preserve the residential character of the streets.
j.        Design all roads to have grades of 15% or less. Exceptions to this standard in
          hillside areas should be evaluated on an individual basis and should be for the
          shortest length possible.
k.        Black Diamond Way should be included on the Preliminary Development Plan as
          a hiking, riding and bicycling trail. This roadway would need to be removed from
          the Contra Costa County Major Roads Plan in order to be in conformance with
          the adopted County General Plan amendment for the Keller Ranch area.
l.        Implementation of all mitigation measures listed in this section would be
          necessary at buildout of Keller Ranch. However, many would be needed during
          the course of development, depending on project phasing. The City should
          require the developer to submit a proposed phasing schedule for improvements
          that is consistent with the phasing schedule for project development.
m.        The northern Contra Costa County area, including the cities of Concord, Walnut
          Creek, Martinez, Pittsburg, Antioch and Clayton is in need of an area-wide traffic,
          transportation and land use study. All of these cities are growing, and the traffic
          impacts from one city are usually felt by the others. Improvements that may be in
          the best interest of one city may not facilitate the best overall area traffic system.
          Many of the transportation related issues that will affect some or all of the cities
          are beyond the capacity of a single B project EIR to answer. It is therefore
          recommended that an area-wide study be conducted to coordinate future traffic
          plans among all responsible government bodies. The following issues should be
          looked at in the study:
Circulation Element                             Page III-15                              March 2000

                  Alternative transportation corridors to Ygnacio Valley Road. It will be
                   impossible to keep mitigating traffic problems along this one roadway.
                  Development of new employment centers east of Concord to shift present
                   area-wide travel patterns. This may be the only method to reduce or
                   maintain existing peak hour, peak direction traffic flows on the local
                   roads.
                  Funding currently does not exist, nor will it probably exist in the future, to
                   provide enough transit service to reduce auto volumes to any measurable
                   extent.
                  Improved signalization coordination and intersection improvements based
                   on a cooperative area-wide traffic flow strategy rather than on a separate
                   city-by-city basis.
Change to the previous comments were recommended by the City of Concord:
1.        West of Kirker Pass Road, Clayton Road has been expanded to 6 lanes while
          Concord Boulevard is only 2 lanes. Traffic should be directed away from
          Concord Boulevard and onto Clayton Road.
2.        Crossings of Mt. Diablo Creek at El Camino, Lydia Land and Mitchell Canyon
          Road should be considered or at least emergency crossing of emergency vehicles,
          pedestrians and bicycle paths.
3.        Additional left-turn lanes are necessary at the intersection of Clayton Road and
          Ygnacio B Kirker Pass Roads.
          An updated traffic analysis will be necessary to supplement peak traffic analysis
          in order to include one-way volumes for both AM and PM peak hours.
4.        Revised recommendation is made for improvements between Kirker Pass Road
          and Ayers Road.
5.        Recommend use of Concord fee structure for use in Clayton to mitigate
          downstream traffic.
6.        Consideration by Keller Ranch development of effect on Concord Boulevard and
          Denkinger Road intersection.
Prior to decision on circulation improvement and mitigation of costs due to any new
project, the cities of Concord and Clayton will need to meet and resolve the issues raised.
This process should begin prior to approval of any significant traffic-generating
development.

                                     Clayton Street System
Clayton street and pathway system is indicated in Exhibit III B 6. The system consists of
arterial collector streets, local streets, private streets, cul-de-sacs and greenbelts. There is
20.6 miles of roadway. They are described as follows:
Arterial streets such as Clayton Road, Kirker Pass Road, Marsh Creek Road, and
Oakhurst Drive are designed to carry traffic through a city or from one major area to
another within a city. Specific provisions, such as striping or grade separated lanes are
required for non-motorized vehicles.
Collector streets such as Washington Boulevard, Mitchell Canyon Road and El Molino
Drive provide a direct connection between arterials and local streets and also provide
access to activity centers such as schools, parks, and shopping centers. Specific
provisions may be required for non-motorized vehicles.
Local streets such as Tiffin Drive, Lydia Lane and Weatherly Drive are typically two-
lane streets which provide direct access to individual residential lots. These types of
streets are not shown on the circulation plan. Local streets may be through or may dead
end. Streets that will eventually go through should be posted with signs to prevent
confusion.
Private streets such as Clark Creek Circle, have been developed as part of a private
residential development. The streets are not built to City standard and must be
maintained by the homeowners.
Cul-de-sacs such as Marquette court, Nottingham Place and Malibu Court are not
intended to go through; however, they must provide adequate turn-around.
Greenbelts found along Mt. Diablo, Peacock, Donner and Mitchell Creeks provide
circulation through the community for pedestrians, horseback riders and bicycle riders.

Standards of Construction
Exhibit III B 7 indicates standards under which Clayton streets should be developed.
These streets were developed at various times and some lack curb, gutter and sidewalk
improvements. The City intends to upgrade all city streets for full city standards
depending on available funding. However, within areas that provide a transition from
suburban to agricultural uses, street standards may vary to reflect the rural conditions.
Specific Plans, conditions of approval and similar documents will define street standards
within these transitional areas.
Financing Improvements
The most likely sources of financing for circulation system improvements, proportionate
to effect, consist of project contributions from the development of Keller Ranch, Kirker
Corridor and smaller projects proposed within the Sphere of Influence. In addition,
establishment of a redevelopment agency can help fund needed circulation improvements
not covered by fees.

                    ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION MEANS
Transit
The City of Clayton is serviced by the Central Contra Costa Transit Authority (CCCTA).
 The current bus route is indicated in Exhibit III B 8. Bus stop and shelter locations are
also indicated.
A recommendation for the service improvement in the future would be a Bart shuttle
from various points of Clayton at peak hour as demand warranted.
Park and Ride Lots
There are no park and ride lots in Clayton at present. However, it will be worthwhile to
contact churches and other institutions and facilities with large minimally used parking
lots for park and ride locations.

Van Pools and Car Pools
There are van pools and car pools currently operating in Clayton. It will be beneficial to
assist in providing coordination of carpool formation and matching for local residents.

   HOUSING ELEMENT
1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Overview of State Requirements
State law recognizes the vital role local governments play in facilitating the supply and affordability
of housing. Each local government in California is required to adopt a comprehensive, long-term
General Plan for the physical development of the city or county. The Housing Element is one of the
seven mandated elements of the local General Plan. State law requires that local governments
identify and plan for the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the
community in their Housing Elements. The law acknowledges that, in order for the private market
to adequately address housing needs and demand, local governments must adopt land use plans and
regulatory systems that provide opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing
development. Housing policy in the state rests largely upon the effective implementation of local
general plans and, in particular, local Housing Elements.
1.2 Housing Element Organization
This Housing Element addresses the planning period from January 31, 2015 to January 31, 2023.
This Housing Element consists of the following sections:
   Section 2.0 provides a description and analysis of Clayton’s population and household
    characteristics, employment and economic trends, housing stock, and existing and future
    housing needs.
   Section 3.0 examines opportunities and resources for residential energy conservation.
   Section 4.0 describes potential governmental and non-governmental constraints to the
    production of affordable housing.
   Section 5.0 provides an overview of existing financial and programmatic resources available to
    assist in housing production and improve affordability, as well as an inventory of existing
    affordable housing developments and properties.
   Section 6.0 analyzes land available for residential development and demonstrates the City’s
    capacity to meet its Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA).
   Section 7.0 reviews the implementation status, effectiveness, and continued appropriateness of
    implementation measures from the City’s 2009–2014 Housing Element.
   Section 8.0 establishes goals, policies, implementation measures, and quantified objectives for
    the 2015–2023 Housing Element planning period. Housing goals and policies are organized in
    six categories: the provision of housing for households at all income levels; regulatory relief and
    incentives; rental and homeownership assistance; equal access to housing; energy conservation;
    and regional planning. Following the housing goals, policies, and implementation measures
    section is a table that outlines quantified objectives for the 2015–2023 planning period.

1.3 Public Participation
State law requires that local governments “make a diligent effort to achieve public participation of all
economic segments of the community in the development of the housing element” (Government
Code Section 65583). To satisfy this requirement, the City conducted a series of community
meetings and public hearings to receive community input regarding housing needs and policy
direction in the City of Clayton. City staff posted notices at public buildings, published notices in the
regional newspaper Contra Costa Times, mailed letters, and sent e-mails to housing advocacy groups,
property owners, and community contacts to publicize meeting dates and input opportunities. The
joint Planning Commission/City Council workshop on November 5, 2013, was televised on the
local cable channel. In addition, the draft Housing Element was made available to the public on the
City’s website in April 2014.
The outreach list included groups serving lower-income and special needs populations including
EAH Housing, a nonprofit affordable housing developer; Contra Costa for Every Generation, a
special needs housing group serving seniors and low-income families; the Clayton Community
Church; and local realty interests, including Focus Realty and Lynn French Realty.
In addition, City staff met twice and communicated via phone and email with representatives of
Saint John’s Parish in the summer and fall of 2013 to discuss development opportunities for their
underutilized site at 5555 Clayton Road. Opportunities include new housing on the two single-family
lots on the Southbrook Drive frontage to complement existing homes on that street and the
potential for senior housing and/or a senior center on the portion of the property fronting on
Clayton Road.
Workshops and Hearings
Public Workshop (November 5, 2013)—City staff and the Housing Element consultant made a
presentation to the City Council, Planning Commission, and members of the public regarding the
Housing Element update. The presentation included an overview of the update process and
schedule, a description of the required components, and initial findings from the needs assessment.
The comments received at the meeting included general questions and comments regarding the
Housing Element process, which were addressed at the meeting. There were no comments from the
public.
Planning Commission Hearing (May 13, 2014)— City staff and the Housing Element consultant
presented the draft Housing Element to the Planning Commission and members of the public for
review and comment. There were no public comments.
City Council Hearing (June 3, 2014)—City staff and the Housing Element consultant presented the
draft Housing Element to the City Council and members of the public for review and comment, and
approval to submit the draft to the California Housing and Community Development (HCD). There
were no public comments.
Following receipt of a letter of conditional compliance from HCD, the City held public hearings to
present the final draft, as well as recommended revisions to the Planning Commission and City

Council for review and adoption. The final draft document was made available to the public on
September 12, 2014, at City Hall and the City’s website.
Planning Commission Hearing (October 14, 2014)—City staff presented the final draft Housing
Element to the Planning Commission and public. After hearing and considering the information, the
Planning Commission recommended City Council adoption of the final draft Housing Element with
minor technical revisions as presented.
City Council Hearing (November 18, 2014)—City staff and Housing Element consultant presented
the final draft Housing Element to the City Council for adoption. City Council adopted Resolution
42–2014 adopting the 2015–2023 Housing Element.
1.4 Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
State law requires that the Housing Element be consistent with the community’s General Plan. The
Clayton General Plan comprises eight elements: Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Community
Design, Open Space/Conservation, Safety, Noise, Community Facilities and Growth Management.
All of the goals, policies, and programs contained in these elements are consistent with this Housing
Element. The City will continue to review the General Plan for internal consistency as amendments
are proposed and adopted.
The City is aware of the requirements of Assembly Bill (AB) 162 (2007). AB 162 requires every city
and county to amend the safety and conservation elements of its general plan to include analysis and
policies regarding flood hazards and management.

2.0 HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
According to state law, the Housing Element must analyze demographic trends, housing
characteristics and market trends, economic and income data, and the special housing needs of
certain segments of the population. The analysis in this section primarily utilizes data compiled by
the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) in the Data Profiles for Housing Elements,
released in January 2014. The profiles include population, housing stock, and economics data from
the 2000 and 2010 US Census, the California Department of Finance (DOF), 2013 ABAG
projections, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Comprehensive
Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) database, and the US Census American Community Survey
(ACS). ACS figures are estimates based on samples; for a small city like Clayton, reported figures
may be subject to large margins of error. Data that was not included in the ABAG Data Profiles for
Housing Elements packet was obtained from direct contact with public agencies, city staff, or other
publically available data sources.
2.1 Population Characteristics
Historic Population Growth
According to the DOF, the population in Clayton was estimated at 11,093 as of 2013, up from
10,897 in 2010 (US Census). As shown in Table 1, Clayton experienced significant growth from
1970 to 2000, when the population increased over 675 percent. Since 2000, the population has
grown at a slower pace, increasing only 1 percent from 2000 to 2010.

Clayton is the smallest city in Contra Costa County. Table 2 shows that although Clayton’s steady
population levels between 2000 and 2010 are consistent with growth that has occurred in the nearby
communities of Concord and Walnut Creek, other Contra Costa cities such as Brentwood and San
Ramon have continued to grow at a significant rate. Clayton’s voter-approved Urban Limit Line
virtually parallels the City’s municipal limits and the City is essentially built-out.

Projected Population Growth
According to ABAG projections, the Clayton population will increase approximately 6 percent from
2010 to 2040, to a population of 11,600. For the same period, the countywide Contra Costa
population is expected to increase by over 27 percent to 1,338,400 persons (see Table 3).

Household Size and Composition
The average size of Clayton households was 2.72 persons as of 2010. This is comparable to the
average household size of Contra Costa County as a whole, which had an average of 2.77
households as of 2010. According to ABAG projections, the average household size for the City of
Clayton and Contra Costa County as a whole will increase in size to 2.85 persons by 2040.
According to the 2007–2011 ACS, over 80 percent of Clayton households were family and just
under 40 percent were families with children. Approximately 16 percent of households were single
persons and 2 percent were multiple-person, non-family households.
Population Age
Current and future housing needs are determined in part by the age characteristics of a community’s
residents. Age can contribute to lifestyle choice, housing preferences, earning capability, and need
for services and amenities.
The median age in Clayton increased from 40.2 in 2000 to 45.0 years in 2010 (US Census). This
slight shift is reflected in Table 4, which shows a decrease in the percentage of residents that are
under age 5, aged 20 to 34, and aged 33 to 44, and an increase in the percentage of residents that are
age 45 or older.

2.2 Housing Stock Characteristics
This section provides an overview of the number and type of housing units in Clayton, as well as
analysis of tenure and occupancy, the age and condition of existing housing, and overcrowding.
Note that the number of housing units and households in Clayton varies in tables in this Housing
Element as data was pulled from different data sources including Summary Files 1 and 3 from the
US Census and ACS counts.
Housing Stock Growth and Composition
In 1970, Clayton was a small town with only 354 housing units, all of which were single-family
homes. During the 1970s, the town underwent dramatic change. In the mid-1970s, Seeno
Construction Company initiated a surge of new development in Clayton with the Regency Woods
project, Clayton’s first large subdivision development. As a result of this and other development in
the mid- and late-1970s, Clayton’s housing stock nearly quadrupled to 1,377 units by 1980. In 1987,
the City annexed a large area to the north and the Presley Company began developing the Oakhurst
Country Club area. Also in 1987, Clayton annexed several existing unincorporated neighborhoods
(Clayton Woods, Regency Meadows, Dana Hills, and Dana Ridge), which together added
approximately 700 housing units to the city. In 1995, Clayton adopted a specific plan for a 475-acre
area to the east along Marsh Creek Road. The Marsh Creek Road Specific Plan envisioned a part of
this area to be annexed to the city. Annexation and development of this area would add
approximately 310 new units and 20 existing units to the city’s housing stock. The 1990s saw the
approval/development of over 1,700 residential units. This included the completion of the Oakhurst

development which added 1,474 units to the city over a seven-year period (1992 to 1999), Diablo
Village which added 33 units, Stranahan which added 54 units, and Diamond Terrace which added
86 units.
According to the US Census, Clayton’s housing stock consisted of 4,086 units in 2010, an increase
of 110 units from 2000. Approximately 82 percent of Clayton housing units are detached single-
family homes. Table 6 compares the number and type of homes in Clayton in 2000 and 2010.

* Note that the total number of housing units in Clayton varies in tables in this Housing Element as data was pulled from different data
sources. For the 2000 US Census, the count of housing units was 3,976 in Summary File 3 (sample data) and 3,924 in Summary File 1
(complete data). Unfortunately, detailed estimates by unit type are not available in Summary File 1.
Housing Tenure and Occupancy
Housing tenure refers to the occupancy of a housing unit—whether the unit is owner-occupied or
renter-occupied. Housing tenure is influenced by demographic factors (e.g., household composition,
income, and age of the householder) as well as the cost of housing. Most homes in Clayton are
owner-occupied. There are few multi-family units in the city and this contributes to a very low
proportion of renter-occupied households. As shown in Table 7, the share of owner-occupied units
as a percentage of all occupied units decreased from 94 percent in 2000 to 90 percent in 2010. The
proportion of owner- versus renter-occupied households in the city differs from that of Contra
Costa County as a whole, which has a much higher proportion of renter-occupied units (67 percent
owner and 33 percent renter).

Vacancy rates are an indicator of housing supply and demand. Low vacancy rates influence greater
upward price pressures and higher vacancy rates indicate downward price pressure. Optimal vacancy
rates differ between rental housing and ownership housing. In its 2008 Bay Area Housing Needs
Plan, ABAG cites optimal vacancy rates of 5 percent for rental housing and 2 percent for ownership
housing. These rates are set at levels that will allow for mobility but not drive up prices.
The US Census reports that Clayton’s housing stock contained 4,086 housing units in 2010 and that
of these, 80 were classified as vacant (an overall vacancy rate of 2 percent). In 2010, the homeowner
and rental vacancy rates for Clayton were both less than 1 percent. Both of these rates fall below
ABAG’s threshold.
High demand and short supply may result in continued use of units which are overcrowded, unsafe,
unsanitary, or otherwise unsuitable for residential use. It also generally results in high prices and
rents which most severely affect lower-income households, people on fixed incomes, families with
children, and other special needs groups. Overcrowding and discrimination are also more likely to
occur when the rental vacancy rate is low. Table 8 shows 2000 and 2010 housing occupancy and
vacancy in Clayton.

Age and Condition of Housing
According to the ACS, 88 percent of housing units in Clayton are less than 40 years old (Table 9).
As a result, most of Clayton’s housing stock is in good condition. There are, however, numerous
older structures, some of which may need rehabilitation.

Housing Conditions Survey
In May 2009, the City conducted a windshield survey of housing conditions throughout the city. The
survey consisted of 300 randomly selected residential parcels in specific neighborhoods. A map
displaying the areas surveyed is included as Appendix A. As housing conditions did not change
substantially since 2009, this housing survey is considered current for the purpose of this Housing
Element.
As shown in Table 10, approximately 87 percent of the homes surveyed were in sound condition
and 12 percent were in need of minor repairs. A house in sound condition is well maintained and
structurally intact. This includes no obvious foundation issues, straight roof lines, good exterior
paint condition and siding, and windows and doors that are in good repair. Homes in sound
condition may have minor maintenance needs or require some paint or siding repair. Homes
deemed to be in need of minor repairs require general maintenance or one major repair such as a
new roof.
The remaining 1 percent of homes surveyed were found to be in need of moderate repair. There
were not any homes found in the survey that were in dilapidated condition.

 Source: PMC Housing Conditions Survey, May 2009
The survey of the city’s housing stock found that the overall condition of homes in the city is sound.
Less than one-sixth of the homes surveyed were found to be in need of minor or moderate repairs,
which is likely the result of the high rate of homeownership in the city as well as the large proportion
of new housing units added to the housing stock in the past two decades.
Overcrowding
The US Census defines overcrowding as more than 1.01 persons per room. Severe overcrowding
occurs when there are more than 1.5 persons per room. The 2005–2010 ACS-based CHAS data
provided in the ABAG Data Profiles for Housing Elements indicate that there are zero over-
crowded or severely overcrowded housing units in Clayton. The current ACS estimates are
consistent with 2000 US Census data, which identified 25 (0.6 percent) overcrowded households.
2.3 Employment and Income Trends
Employment
Clayton is a residential community with primarily two smaller convenience-shopping business
sectors and therefore relatively few jobs. ABAG reported that in 2010, there were 1,540 jobs in
Clayton. As shown in Table 11, ABAG projects that the number of jobs in the city will increase
approximately 27 percent from 2010 to 2040 to 1,950 jobs.

    HOUSING ELEMENT
According to the ACS, Clayton has approximately 5,248 employed residents. As shown in Table 12,
nearly half of the city’s residents are employed in relatively high-earning industries. Approximately
20 percent of employed residents work in educational, health, and social services; 16 percent work in
finance, insurance, real estate, and rental and leasing; and 13 percent work in professional, scientific,
management, administrative, and waste management services. Table 12 also reports an overall
decline in employment between 2000 and 2010, which likely is the result of the economic downturn
in 2008. The decrease in employment figures may also be partially accounted for by the fact that
2010 numbers are sampled estimates from the ACS, which has a large margin of error for small
cities.

Table 13 lists the region’s ten fastest-growing occupations. This information is available only for the
Oakland-Fremont-Hayward Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Alameda and Contra
Costa Counties but is applicable because Clayton residents work both inside and outside of the city.
Of the ten fastest-growing occupations, only three occupations would allow a family of four with a
single breadwinner to surpass HCD’s median county income level of $93,500.

Jobs/Housing Balance
The analysis of jobs/housing balance is used to measure the degree to which communities and
subregions are inducing commuter travel as growth occurs. A community with a balance of jobs and
housing has as many jobs as residents that are able to work. For example, a city with 5,000 employed
residents requires 5,000 jobs to be in balance. A community is out of balance if it either has more
jobs than employed residents or has more employable residents than jobs.
In 2010, Clayton had a jobs-to-employed residents ratio of 0.31 (1,540 jobs/4,960 employed
residents), up from 0.26 in 2005 (1,440 jobs/5,620 employed residents). As shown in Table 14,
ABAG projects that this ratio will steadily increase through 2040 up to 0.35.
Clayton is considered a “bedroom” community, meaning that it is part of a larger community in
which employed residents of Clayton support neighboring communities by providing a supply of
workers in the workforce. Clayton is surrounded by much larger communities with available
employment and is situated along transportation corridors connected to those communities, making

  * ABAG projection
When a community has more employed residents than jobs, it is a sign that a number of residents
are commuting out of the community for work, which can have a number of negative impacts
including traffic congestion and loss of revenue for local businesses. As shown in Table 15, more
than half of Clayton’s employed residents commute 30 minutes or more to work.

Extremely Low Income Households
In 2006, Government Code Section 65583(a) was amended and requires jurisdictions to quantify the
existing number of extremely low-income households. An extremely low-income household is
defined as a household earning less than 30 percent of median household income. In 2014, this was
$28,050 for Clayton households. Table 18 shows household income by ACS category quintiles. The
ACS does not provide a quantification of households for those earning less than $28,050, but it does
show households earning less than $24,999. This range has been used to estimate the number of
existing extremely low-income households. According to the ACS data, there were approximately
289 extremely low-income households in the city in 2011.
Extremely low-income households generally have a higher incidence of housing problems and tend
to overpay for housing (paying greater than 30 percent of their income toward housing costs). To
facilitate opportunities for housing that may assist extremely low-income households, the City
amended its Zoning Ordinance in 2012 to add single-room occupancy units as a residential use type
and allow these units with a use permit in the Limited Commercial zoning district.
The City will continue to encourage the development of housing for extremely low-income
households by offering priority application processing, fee reductions or deferrals, and flexibility in
the application of development standards (Implementation Measure II.2.1) for projects that provide
units affordable to extremely low-income households.

2.4 Housing Costs and Affordability
Home Sales Prices
According to DataQuick, the median home sale price in Clayton was $595,000 in 2013, an increase
of approximately 22 percent from the 2012 median of $489,500. Median prices in Clayton tend to be
in the middle to high range when compared to other Contra Costa County cities, and are
consistently higher than Contra Costa County as a whole.

Figure 1 shows median home sales prices in Clayton and nearby jurisdictions from 2010 to 2013.
The median price was relatively stable from 2010 to 2013 and increased sharply in 2013. This trend
is similar to that of the Bay Area and metropolitan areas throughout California and can be attributed
to low interest rates, job growth, and greater economic stability following the recession.

Rental Prices
Table 19 displays the results of a survey of rental property listings in and around Clayton in
February 2014. With high owner occupancy and a low vacancy rate, there are currently very few
rental opportunities available in the city.
The rental survey included listings posted on online services such as Craigslist, as well as average rate
ranges provided in phone conversations by representatives from local real estate and property
management companies. As of February 2014, only seven units were available for rent, all of which
were in single-family attached or detached units.

Housing Affordability
A home is considered affordable if households do not spend more than 30 percent of income on
rent (including a monthly allowance for water, gas, and electricity) or monthly mortgage, according
to a standard set by HUD.
Table 20 displays the monthly income limits by household size for each income group (based on
HCD’s annual income limits). The monthly income limits are used to calculate maximum affordable
monthly rents as well as the maximum affordable purchase prices for homes. For example, a two-
person household earning a combined monthly income of no more than $1,871 per month is
considered an extremely low-income household that can afford a maximum monthly rent of $561 or
purchase a home for $66,805. The rental and sales price figures represent an affordable housing
amount (30 percent of monthly income).

   HOUSING ELEMENT
As noted in the Homes Sales Prices analysis, the median price in Clayton was $595,000 in 2013.
Only households earning above moderate incomes could afford a home priced at or around the
median. A moderate-income household of four could afford a home priced at a maximum of
$373,606. While homes may be available at this price point, they may require additional investments
for maintenance or improvement. Homeownership is out of reach in Clayton for most lower-
income households.
Households considered extremely low or very low income would find it difficult to secure housing
that is affordable and would likely have little option but to overpay for housing. For example, a
three-person very low-income household earning a monthly income of $3,508 would be able to
afford $1,053 per month for rent. According to the results of the rent survey, the least expensive
two-bedroom (minimum size to avoid overcrowding) home rents for $1,800. Without rental
assistance, the three-person household would pay in excess of what is affordable for them.
The City will encourage assistance for lower-income renters and prospective home buyers by
promoting programs such as the Contra Costa County Mortgage Credit Certificate Program and
Lower-Income Rental Assistance Program (Implementation Measure III.1.1) and will pursue
funding from CalHome or other available sources to establish a down payment assistance program
(Implementation Measure III.1.2).
Overpayment
Definitions of housing affordability can vary; however, as previously noted, a household should
spend no more than 30 percent of its monthly income on housing costs (according to HUD
standards). Households that pay more than this are considered to be overpaying for housing and
households that pay more than 50 percent are considered severely overpaying. HUD’s CHAS
database reports information on overpayment by tenure, as illustrated in Table 21. As of 2010,
approximately 34 percent of households (1,320 households) paid 30 percent or more of their income
toward housing. Overpayment is a significant issue in Contra Costa County and in jurisdictions
throughout the Bay Area.
Among owner-occupied households, the “above moderate” income category reports 595 burdened
households, which is the highest of all income categories. This unexpected finding is likely the
outcomes of a high barrier to entry for homeownership in the city. For renters, the “very low
income” category has the largest number of overpaying households (95). This is particularly
concerning since people with very low income are less able to pay for other necessities such as food,
fuel, and clothing when burdened with excessive housing costs.

2.5 Special Housing Needs
Certain segments of the population encounter more difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing
due to special circumstance. Special needs may be related to one’s employment type and income,
family or household characteristics, or medial condition or disability. The following subsections
discuss the special housing needs of groups identified in state housing element law (Government
Code, Section 65583(a)(6)). Specifically, these include senior households, persons with disabilities,
persons with developmental disabilities, large households, female-headed households, homeless
persons, and farmworkers.
Seniors
As of 2010, seniors, those aged 65 and over, made up approximately 15 percent of the Clayton
population. This is an increase from 2000 when approximately 9 percent of the population was
seniors. As shown in Table 22, the senior population grew by 628 persons, an increase of
approximately 64 percent.

Senior households are defined as households in which one or more persons is over 65 years of age.
As shown in Table 23, nearly 25 percent of all households in Clayton included one or more senior.
The vast majority (nearly 90 percent) of senior households own their homes. While homeownership
is beneficial in that costs are generally stable, which is important because many seniors live on fixed
incomes, it can become difficult for seniors to maintain their homes and yards due to financial and
physical constraints.

In general, seniors have lower earning capacity than middle-aged persons. However, the 2007–2011
ACS reports that the majority of elderly residents earned at least $50,000 per year as shown in Table
24. Senior income estimates may be misleading, as many elderly persons have access to capital
outside the earned income measured by the Census. This is underscored by ABAG’s estimate that
the senior poverty rate (just under 4 percent of the senior population) is relatively low in Clayton.

Diamond Terrace is the only senior housing development in Clayton. Diamond Terrace has a total
of 86 units, one of which is reserved for an on-site manager. Diamond Terrace offers affordable
housing with an array of support services (including meals). There are 65 units reserved for very
low-income residents, 10 units reserved for low-income residents, 10 units reserved for moderate-
income residents. The City, through its now defunct Redevelopment Agency, financially assisted in
the development of this senior living facility.
The Concord Housing and Community Services Department responds to elderly needs in Clayton
by publishing a list of housing facilities for the elderly, providing low-interest loans for household
repairs, and paying an emergency rebate for home repairs. The department also provides referrals to
nonprofit organizations such as Meals-on-Wheels.
In 2013, the City of Clayton adopted a universal design ordinance (Chapter 15.92 of the Municipal
Code). Universal design standards are intended to ensure that development is accessible for persons
at all stages of life and implementation of these standards will facilitate new homes that are
appropriate for seniors and those with disabilities. The City will continue to implement this
ordinance and distribute a brochure describing universal design standards (Implementation Measure
IV.3.2).
In addition, the City will work with housing providers to identify and pursue housing opportunities
for senior households (Implementation Measure II.1.1).
Persons with Disabilities
A disability is defined broadly by the US Census as a physical, mental, or emotional condition that
lasts over a long period of time and makes it difficult to live independently. Special needs for access
and affordability can make it difficult for persons with disabilities to find appropriate housing. As

shown in Table 25, approximately 13 percent of the Clayton population age 16 or older had a
mobility or self-help limitation as of 2000. As the population ages, the incidence of disability
increases. Among the population aged 65 and older, 31 percent experienced either a self-care or
mobility limitation or both.
Disability status was not counted in the 2010 US Census and the ACS does not provide estimates
for very small cities such as Clayton. As such, the 2000 data is the best available data and is retained
in this analysis as a proxy for current disability figures.

The City adopted a universal design ordinance in 2013 to better facilitate housing appropriate for
those with disabilities, and enacted a reasonable accommodation ordinance in 2012 to allow for
variations in the application of zoning standards and development policies to ensure that housing
can be developed in a way that is suitable for persons with disabilities. The City will continue to
implement the reasonable accommodations ordinance (Implementation Measure IV.3.1) and
distribute a brochure describing universal design standards (Implementation Measure IV.3.2).
Developmental Disabilities
Senate Bill (SB) 812 requires that the City include an analysis of the special housing needs of
individuals with a developmental disability within the community. According to Section 4512 of the
Welfare and Institutions Code, a “developmental disability” means a disability that originates before
an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and
constitutes a substantial disability for that individual, which includes mental retardation, cerebral
palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes disabling conditions found to be closely related
to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental
retardation, but does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently in a conventional housing
environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where
supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental
disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally
disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.

The California Department of Developmental Services currently provides community-based services
to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a
statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based
facilities. The Regional Center of the East Bay is one of 21 regional centers in California that
provides point of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. The center is a private,
nonprofit community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to
individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.
According to the Regional Center of the East Bay, the Center serves approximately 46
developmentally disabled persons who reside in and around Clayton (those residing within the
94517 zip code). As shown in Table 26, approximately 63 percent of these residents are age 21 or
younger and thus are likely to live at home with family and receive services through public schools.

A number of housing types are appropriate for people living with a development disability: rent-
subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, Section 8 vouchers, special
programs for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. The design of housing-accessibility
modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group living opportunities
represent some of the types of considerations that are important in serving this need group.
Incorporating “barrier-free” design in all new multi-family housing (as required by California and
federal fair housing laws) is especially important to provide the widest range of choices for disabled
residents. Special consideration should also be given to the affordability of housing, as people with
disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
The City adopted a universal design ordinance in 2013 to better facilitate housing appropriate for
those with developmental disabilities and enacted a reasonable accommodation ordinance in 2012 to
allow for variations in the application of zoning standards and development policies to ensure that
housing can be developed in a way that is suitable for persons with disabilities, including those with
developmental disabilities. The City will continue to implement these ordinances and publicize their
availability (Implementation Measures IV.3.1 and IV.3.2).
Large Households
HUD defines a large household or family as one with five or more members. Large households need
larger homes with more bedrooms to avoid overcrowded conditions. In general, homes for these
households should provide safe outdoor play areas for children and should be located to provide
convenient access to schools and childcare facilities. These types of needs can pose problems,
particularly for large families that cannot afford to buy or rent single-family houses, as apartment
and condominium units are often developed with smaller households in mind.

Female-Headed Households
Female-headed single-parent households may experience a variety housing problems, including
affordability, overcrowding, insufficient housing choices, and discrimination. Often with only one
source of income, female-headed households have more difficulties finding adequate, affordable
housing than families with two income-earning adults. Also, female-headed family households with
small children may need to pay for child care, which further reduces disposable income. This special
needs group would benefit generally from expanded affordable housing opportunities. More
specifically, the need for dependent care also makes it important that housing for female-headed
families be located near child care facilities, schools, youth services, medical facilities, or senior
services.
As of 2010, approximately 20 percent of Clayton households were headed by a female. As shown in
Table 28, approximately 80 percent of female-headed households owned their homes. About 37

percent of female-headed households were families, over half of which had children under the age
of 18. Table 29 illustrates the number of family households that are headed by a female with no
husband present. In 2010, female-headed households with no husband present accounted for 9
percent of all families in the city. Female-headed households with children make up approximately 5
percent of all households in the city and 55 percent of all female-headed households. According to
the ABAG Housing Element Data Profiles, approximately 406 female residents live alone in
Clayton.

The City of Clayton recognizes these problems and has included policies and programs in this
document to address affordability and discrimination for all segments of the population
(Implementation Measure II.1.1 and Policy IV.1).
Homeless
The housing needs of the homeless are more difficult to measure and assess than those of any other
population subgroup. The very nature of homelessness makes it difficult to quantify the number and
typical residency of homeless persons. The best available data is from a biennial point-in-time
homeless count completed by the Contra Costa County Homeless Program. The most recent count,
completed in January 2013, identified 3,798 homeless persons. No homeless persons were identified
as residents of Clayton.

According to City staff, one or two homeless persons occasionally appear in Clayton, but they soon
move to areas where there are needed services. The point-in-time homeless count informs the
County regarding its progress in accomplishing goals related to ending homelessness. The most
notable findings of the homeless count for the county as a whole are:
    An 11 percent decrease in homeless persons, from 4,274 in 2011 to 3,798 in 2013. The decrease
     could be due to the differences in the number of sheltered homeless persons reported by
     supportive services-only programs, a decrease in the number of sheltered homeless children
     reported by the school districts, the decrease in unsheltered persons living in encampments, and
     the variability inherent in point-in-time surveys. 
    Fifty-five (55) percent of unsheltered homeless persons were encountered in encampments,
     compared to 69 percent in 2011.
The County’s data is supplemented with HUD data, which identified a total homeless population of
2,386 persons (see Table 30). The difference in total homelessness figures between the two data sets
underscores the challenges of collecting homelessness data and the variability in estimates that occur
from a “point-in-time” survey.

Homelessness is often the end result of multiple factors that converge in a person’s life. The
combination of loss of employment, inability to find a job because of the need for retraining, and
the high housing costs in Contra Costa County lead to some individuals and families losing their
housing. For others, the loss of housing is due to chronic health problems, physical disabilities,
mental health disabilities, or drug and alcohol addictions along with an inability to access the services
and long-term support needed to address these conditions. According to the Contra Costa
Homeless Continuum of Care Plan 2001–2006, the three primary causes of homelessness are the
lack of affordable housing, lack of access to support services, and low incomes.
Although there are no emergency shelters or homeless services in the City of Clayton, a number of
resources exist in adjacent Concord and throughout Contra Costa County. Table 31 shows services
available near Clayton.

In 2013, Clayton amended its Zoning Ordinance to allow emergency shelters as a permitted use in
the Public Facilities zoning district, subject to some development criteria and management
standards. In addition, the City updated the Zoning Ordinance to define transitional housing and
allow it as a permitted use in a residential zoning district. The City will continue to work with
housing and service providers to identify opportunities to assist homeless persons and families

Farmworkers
The 2007–2011 ACS five-year estimates indicate that 37 residents are employed in the “agriculture,
forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining” sector. This number is up by 25 from the 2000 Census
count of 12. This increase is likely due to the large margins of error associated with this type of data
in the ACS. It is unlikely that Clayton residents are employed in farming, forestry, or fishing
industries. While there are many active farms in Contra Costa County, agricultural areas are relatively
distant from Clayton and it is unlikely there are any farmworkers living in Clayton.
Most farmworkers seek and find housing situations that are not specifically designated for
farmworkers. Permanent rental housing is the most likely housing option for farmworkers. Should
farmworkers seek housing in Clayton, existing multi-family housing and sites identified for multi-
family residential would provide opportunities for this group.
In addition, Implementation Measure II.1.2 commits the City to amending its Zoning Ordinance to
allow agricultural employee housing for six or fewer residents as a permitted use in residential zoning
districts, in compliance with Health and Safety Code Section 17021.6. The City will also work with
housing providers to address the housing needs of farmworkers (Implementation Measure II.1.1).
Disadvantaged Unincorporated Communities
SB 244 (2012) requires that jurisdictions identify and analyze the housing and infrastructure needs of
disadvantaged unincorporated communities (DUC), which are inhabited areas of 10 or more
dwellings located adjacent to or in close proximity to one another in which the median household
income is 80 percent or less than the statewide median income ($49,306 according to the 2010 ACS).
DUCs may be classified as “island,” “fringe,” or “legacy,” defined as follows (per the State of
California Office of Planning and Research and Government Code Section 65302.10):
   “Island community” means any inhabited and unincorporated territory that is surrounded by or
    substantially surrounded by one or more cities.
   “Fringe community” means any inhabited and unincorporated territory that is within a city’s
    sphere of influence.
   “Legacy community” means a geographically isolated community that is inhabited and has
    existed for at least 50 years.
Without the benefit of political representation in a local jurisdiction, DUCs often suffer from poor
access to services and resources, limited or no infrastructure improvements, environmental hazards,
and generally unsafe and unsanitary living conditions.
In 2012, the Contra Costa County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) identified one
unincorporated “island” community within the Clayton sphere of influence. However, income levels
within this area are higher than 80 percent of the statewide median. Thus, there are no DUCs within
or adjacent to the Clayton sphere of influence.

3.0 ENERGY CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES
Parts 6 and 11 of Title 24 in the California Uniform Building Code require the implementation of
construction standards and other energy-efficiency techniques that will result in reduced energy use
in newly built residences. Clayton residents are eligible to participate in a number of energy
efficiency and conservation programs, including:
   The Contra Costa County Weatherization Program provides no-cost weatherization upgrades to
    income-qualifying residents (http://ca-contracostacounty.civicplus.com/index.aspx?nid=282).
   Energy Upgrade California offers rebates for whole house retrofits in Contra Costa County.
    Income-qualifying residents are eligible for additional rebates. The Energy Upgrade California
    website (https://tools.energyupgradeca.org/county/contra_costa/incentives) also provides links
    to rebates for numerous energy conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy projects.
   Multi-family buildings of five or more units in Contra Costa may be eligible for property-
    assessed financing for energy efficiency though California FIRST.
   Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) offers rebates for solar water heaters, pool pumps, and
    appliances including water heaters and washing machines.
   Income-qualifying households are eligible for Single-family Affordable Solar Homes (SASH),
    which provides upfront rebates to help low-income homeowners access the benefits of solar
    power.
A complete list of residential energy efficiency rebates is available at: http://ca-
contracostacounty2.civicplus.com/4344/Home-Energy-Efficiency. Residents may also employ
simple measures in an effort to reduce energy consumption and, hence, overall demand. The
measures include:
   Change incandescent lighting to fluorescent or compact fluorescent lighting.
   Installation of whole house cooling fans to rapidly cool warm houses in the summer.
   Installation of rooftop solar power-generating panels to supply hot water and electricity for daily
    needs (see Solar and Energy Efficiency District discussion below).
   Replacement of household appliances that do not meet state seasonal energy efficiency ratio
    (SEER) guidelines with more efficient ones.
   Implementation of more traditional methods of conservation and increasing energy efficiency

The City will encourage and maintain energy efficiency in new and existing housing through the
performance of Implementation Measures V.1.1 and V.1.2 to provide energy conservation
brochures at City Hall and the Community Library and to develop standards to allow energy self-
sufficiency and generation projects.
In addition, the City will investigate opting in to a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program
to provide a low-cost financing option for energy efficiency, water efficiency, and renewable energy
home improvements for Clayton home owners. Such programs include Home Energy Renovation
Opportunity (HERO) program and Figtree PACE. Implementation Measure V.1.3 commits the City
to exploring these programs and participating, if appropriate.

4.0 POTENTIAL CONSTRAINTS
4.1 Governmental Constraints
While local governments have little influence on market factors such as interest rates, their policies
and regulations can affect the type, amount, and affordability of residential development. Since
governmental actions can constrain development and affordability of housing, state law requires that
the Housing Element “address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental
constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing” (Government Code
Section 65583(c)(3)).
City regulations that affect residential development and housing affordability include policies,
standards, and procedures set forth in the Land Use Element of the General Plan, Specific Plans,
and the Zoning Ordinance.
Land Use Controls
General Plan
The General Plan is the City’s principal land use policy document. The City adopted its first General
Plan in July 1971. The General Plan was updated in 1985 with periodic amendments, most recently
in April 2012. Table 32 shows the General Plan land use categories that allow for residential uses,
along with density ranges and the types of residential uses allowed. The General Plan provides for
single- and multi-family housing in a range of densities from 1.0 to 20 units per gross acre.

Town Center Specific Plan
The City adopted the Town Center Specific Plan in 1990 and amended it in 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007,
2008, and 2012. The Town Center has served as the City’s historic commercial center since
Clayton’s inception. The Town Center Specific Plan aims to preserve the unique characteristics of
this small center, while facilitating new development and reuse of underutilized private properties.
The Specific Plan calls for a combination of commercial and residential land uses in the Clayton
Town Center. Residential designations include: Multi-Family Low Density (7.6 to 10 dwelling units
per acre [du/acre]), Multi-Family Medium Density (10.1 to 15 du/acre), Multi-Family High Density
(15.1 to 20 du/acre), and Institutional Residential (7.6 to 20 du/acre).
In addition to the sites designated for residential uses, the Specific Plan permits residential uses to be
constructed on all floors, except ground level, in mixed-use developments. In areas designated Town
Center (TC) Commercial, residential uses are allowed on upper stories, subject to the development
review standards set forth in the Town Center Specific Plan.
Development standards for the TC Commercial area do not specifically regulate residential densities
of commercial sites; rather applicants submit development proposals that must satisfy various
requirements, including those pertaining to open space, stormwater compliance, and parking. The
remaining available space is available for development.
The City will continue promote mixed-use and affordable housing development in the Town Center
Specific Plan area through Policy I.4 and Implementation Measure I.4.1.
Zoning
The provisions of the Clayton Zoning Ordinance implement the policies and standards set forth in
the General Plan. The Zoning Ordinance permits residential development in the following districts:
   Single-family residential district – The following designations are included in the single-family
    zones: R-10, R-12, R-15, R-20, R-40, and R-40-H.
   Multi-family residential district – The following designations are included in the multi-family
    zones: M-R, M-R-M, and M-R-H. Although there are no parcels currently designated M-R-H,
    the City maintains the designation for future use.
   Planned development district – The following designation is used to denote planned
    development districts: PD.
The Zoning Ordinance establishes the types of allowed residential uses as well as residential
development standards for each zoning district. Development standards are intended to protect the
safety and welfare of the City’s residents and preserve community character.

Development Standards
Table 33 summarizes the development standards for residential zoning districts. The maximum
residential density allowed is one unit per 2,000 square feet of lot area in the M-R-H district, which is
equivalent to approximately 20 dwelling units per gross acre. The Zoning Ordinance provides for
small lot and zero lot line development in the PD district.

These parking requirements may be reduced for projects zoned PD (e.g., Oakhurst provides only 1.5
parking spaces for its zero lot line units) with a supporting parking analysis and may be reduced for
Affordable Housing Opportunity sites with a supporting parking analysis. As stated in
Implementation Measure II.2.1, the City will provide flexibility in the application of parking
standards for development projects that include affordable units.

Second Dwelling Units
A second dwelling unit is an additional self-contained living unit, either attached to or detached from
the primary residential unit on a single lot. It has cooking, eating, sleeping, and full sanitation
facilities. To encourage establishment of second dwelling units on existing developed lots, state law
requires cities and counties to either adopt an ordinance based on standards set out in the state law
or allow second units ministerially per state requirements.
In April 2004, the City adopted a second dwelling unit ordinance that follows the requirements of
state law (Government Code Section 65852.1) in allowing second dwelling units on any single-family
residential lot subject to ministerial review (and on multi-family lots subject to Planning Commission
approval). Second units are subject to specific development requirements, as described in Table 36.

Zoning Districts                Per Zoning Code Chapter 17.47 second dwelling units are allowed in all
                                residential districts that allow single-family dwellings.

Second dwelling unit applicants must pay a processing fee of $269 for staff level administrative
review applications. For second dwelling unit applications that require Planning Commission review,
a minimum processing fee deposit of $1,000 is required. Second unit development is not constrained
by the City’s land use controls. However, the Contra Costa Water District (a special district public
agency) charges a fee of approximately $24,125 for second unit 5/8” water hookup (fees vary based
on unit size). This connection fee may be a constraint to the development of second units, as there
have been few second unit permits processed since the 2004 amendment of the Municipal Code.
The City will continue to support efforts to construct second dwelling units on new and existing
single family-zoned lots (Policy I.3). Implementation Measure I.3.1 commits the City to publicizing
information about second unit development in the City’s general application packet as well as on the
City’s website.
Residential Care Facilities
Residential care facilities or group homes for persons with disabilities are allowed in the city.
Facilities for six or fewer persons are allowed by right in all residential districts pursuant to the state
Health and Safety Code Section 1566.3. Facilities for seven or more persons are allowed with a use
permit in accordance with Chapter 17.46 of the Zoning Ordinance and must meet the following
standards:
    The applicant must maintain an operating license from the applicable state and county agencies.
    The residential care home shall be located within a detached single-family dwelling.
    Sufficient off-street parking spaces shall be provided in addition to the required off-street
     parking to serve the dwelling.
    Signs are not allowed.

    Each residential care facility shall be located at least 1,000 feet from another such facility.
    The dwelling must comply with the Uniform Building Code and State standards for accessibility
     by disabled persons.
Manufactured Homes
In 2009, the City amended the Zoning Ordinance to allow manufactured housing on any residential
lot subject to the standards applicable to site-built housing in accordance with state law. The Zoning
Ordinance now treats manufactured housing as a single-family use type, includes a definition for
manufactured housing, and allows manufactured housing on a permanent foundation in all
residential zones that allow for single-family homes, subject to site plan and design review
Emergency Shelters
In compliance with SB 2 (2007), the City amended its Zoning Ordinance in 2013 to define
emergency shelters and allow them by right (without discretionary approval) in at least one zoning
district. Emergency shelters are now an allowed use in the Public Facilities district, subject to specific
development and management standards, including but not limited to:
    Emergency shelters must be located a minimum of 300 feet from residential buildings and
     schools, and at least 300 feet from other shelters.
    The maximum number of beds in a single shelter is 10.
    Individuals may stay no longer than 180 consecutive days in a consecutive 12-month period.
    Off-street parking must be provided in the ratio of one space for every three beds plus one
     parking space per staff member per shift.
    The shelter must provide an operational plan to the Community Development Director.
Refer to Section 17.36.082 for a comprehensive list of emergency shelter requirements. There are six
sites zoned Public Facilities. The site identified as most viable for an emergency shelter is the north
portion of the City’s 4.73 acre property located at 6125 Clayton Road which houses its community
library and several idle historical buildings. The site is directly served by public transit (a regional bus
that connects to Bay Area Rapid Transit) as well as services and public amenities. Approximately 1.5
acres of the site are available for development of an emergency shelter.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
SB 2 also requires that all jurisdictions define and allow transitional and supportive housing.
Transitional facilities offer short-term housing (at least six months’ stay); supportive housing types
are those that offer permanent housing situations that are occupied by a target population (persons
with AIDS, persons with mental or development disabilities, persons with chemical dependency,
etc.) and may have on- or off-site services linked to the housing.

                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT
The City amended its Zoning Ordinance in 2012 to define supportive housing and transitional
housing and allow both as permitted uses in all residential zoning districts, subject only to the permit
processing requirements as other similar use types in the same zone (site plan review, design review,
etc.).
To achieve full compliance with the provisions of SB 2, which requires that transitional and
supportive housing be allowed as a residential use in all districts that allow residential, the City is
committed to amending the Zoning Ordinance to allow transitional and supportive housing in the
Limited Commercial zoning district, subject only to the same regulations that apply to other
residential uses of the same type in that zone (Implementation Measure II.1.3).
Single-Room Occupancy Units (SRO)
Assembly Bill (AB) 2634 (2006) requires the quantification and analysis of existing and projected
housing needs of extremely low-income households. Housing Elements must also identify zoning to
encourage and facilitate housing for extremely low-income persons, of which two common types are
supportive housing and single-room occupancy units (SRO).
Extremely low-income households typically include persons with special housing needs, including
but not limited to persons experiencing homelessness or near-homelessness, persons with substance
abuse problems, and persons with mental illness or developmental disabilities.
In 2012, the City amended its Municipal Code to explicitly define SRO housing as a type of
residential hotel offering one-room units for long-term occupancy by one or two people. SROs may
have kitchen or bath facilities (but not both) in the room. The City allows development of SROs in
the Limited Commercial (LC) zoning district with a use permit.
Accommodation of Persons with Disabilities
The City has taken significant steps to improve housing accessibility for persons with disabilities. In
2013, the City adopted a universal design ordinance to ensure that new housing is adaptable and
accessible for persons with disabilities. In 2012, the City adopted a reasonable accommodations
ordinance (Chapter 15.90 of the Municipal Code) to allow for variations in the application of zoning
codes and policies to accommodate persons with disabilities; amended the Zoning Ordinance to
define and allow supportive housing facilities as described above; and amended the definition of
“family” to remove restrictions on the number of unrelated persons that may be considered a family.
In 2008, the City Council approved its Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Transition Plan. The
plan included an evaluation of barriers for persons with disabilities and included steps to remove
such barriers. The plan mandates that the City Community Development and Engineering
departments periodically evaluate their procedures for land use permit processing and public
participation to ensure that reasonable accommodations are made for individuals with disabilities
and all are in compliance with fair housing laws. As a result of plan implementation, all City facilities,
offices, and meeting rooms have been upgraded to be accessible and compliant with ADA
requirements, and the City has a program for installation of wheelchair-accessible ramps at street
intersections.

   HOUSING ELEMENT
The City has two special needs facilities that cater to persons with disabilities. In 1992, the City
approved the Kirker Court development, which provides 20 units for persons with mental
disabilities. In 1999, the City approved the Diamond Terrace project, which created 86 units for
seniors, many of whom have disabilities and require special accommodations in their housing units
and other project facilities. The City, through its now defunct Redevelopment Agency, financially
participated to support the establishment of both facilities.
The City also offers reduced parking requirements for residential developments that serve seniors
and persons with disabilities. The residential parking requirement for seniors or persons with
disabilities is one parking space per dwelling unit, while standard single-family residential units
require four parking spaces per unit.
As stated in Policy II.1 and Implementation Measure II.1.1, the City will work to provide housing
opportunities for persons and households with disabilities through coordination with housing
providers and assistance with funding application. The City will also continue to offer reasonable
accommodations to ensure that City standards and policies do not impede housing opportunities for
disabled households (Policy IV.3 and Implementation Measure IV.3.1) and continue to implement
the universal design ordinance (Policy IV.3.2).
Density Bonus
The City amended its Zoning Ordinance in 2009 to add specific density provisions in keeping with
state law. As detailed in Chapter 17.90 of the Municipal Code, the City offers a density bonus of up
to 35 percent and a variety of incentives/concessions to promote affordable housing.
Implementation Measure II.2.1 confirms the City’s ongoing commitment to the density bonus
program.
Affordable Housing Plan
As described in Implementation Measure I.2.1, developments of 10 or more units are subject to an
Affordable Housing Plan requirement. The City has established the specific guidelines for the review
and preparation of Affordable Housing Plans. These criteria do not present a constraint to the
development of housing but help to ensure that housing affordable to households at a wide range of
income levels is built in the city. As described below, the City offers a variety of incentives to
developers and will consider incentives not specifically listed.
The Affordable Housing Plan must be submitted and approved in conjunction with the earliest stage
of project entitlement, typically with the City Council approval of the primary land use entitlement
and/or a development agreement.
The Affordable Housing Plan must include the following:
   The number of dwelling units that will be developed as affordable to very low-, low-, moderate-,
    and above moderate-income households (the City desires that at least 5 percent of all project
    units be affordable to very low-income households and at least 5 percent of all project units be
    affordable to low-income households).

   The number of affordable ownership and rental units to be produced. Such split shall be
    approved by the City Council based on housing needs, market conditions, and other relevant
    factors.
   Program options within Affordable Housing Plans may include, but are not limited to:
    o Actual production (on-site or off-site) of affordable units (including ownership and rental
        opportunities in the form of corner units, halfplexes, duplexes, cottages, creative alternative
        housing products, etc.)
    o Land dedication (on-site and off-site).
    o Payment of in-lieu fees.
   The timing for completion of affordable housing obligations.
   At the City Council’s discretion, land or other contributions provided by developers as specified
    within Affordable Housing Plans may be utilized to augment City efforts and the efforts of its
    nonprofit partners to provide affordable housing opportunities to all income levels throughout
    the community. The City will pursue supplemental funding to allow affordability to households
    earning less than 50 percent of area median income.
   In order to ensure the production and preservation of housing affordable to the City’s
    workforce, no productive, reasonable program or incentive option will be excluded from
    consideration within project-specific Affordable Housing Plans. Incentives may include, but are
    not limited to:
    o Density bonuses
    o Fee waivers or deferrals (as reasonably available)
    o Expedited processing/priority processing
    o Reduced parking standards
    o Technical assistance with accessing funding
    o Modifications to development standards (on a case-by-case basis)
The size of property, the surrounding land uses, the purchase price of the real property, and the
current market conditions (i.e., competition) are all factors that may be considered in the preparation
of proposed Affordable Housing Plans. Each development project is unique, as are the incentives
and specific affordable housing requirements applied. The flexibility of this menu approach allows
the City and developer to agree to terms that meet the intent of providing affordable housing while
ensuring that the proposed development remains feasible.

Growth Management Program (Measure C)
In 1988, Contra Costa County voters approved a half-cent sales tax to fund a transportation
improvement and growth management program (Measure C). This program addresses congestion
problems by funding transportation improvement projects and establishing a process involving all of
the cities in Contra Costa County, including Clayton, to cooperatively manage the impacts of
growth.
The overall goals of the program are to relieve congestion created by past development through
road and transit improvements funded by the sales tax increase and to prevent future development
decisions from resulting in the deterioration of services. To be eligible for sales tax funds, the
Growth Management Program requires that each participating city and town and the County take
several actions including:
   Adopting a Growth Management Element of the General Plan to address the impacts of
    growth.
   Committing to managing congestion by adopting and applying traffic service standards to ensure
    that new development will not significantly worsen traffic on streets, roads, and regional routes.
   Reducing dependency on the single-occupancy automobile through use of transportation
    systems management for each jurisdiction’s large employers or an alternative mitigation program
    for areas that are primarily residential in character.
   Ensuring that new development pays its own way through mitigation and fee programs.
   Reducing the number and length of automobile commute trips by addressing housing options
    and job opportunities at the local, regional, and countywide level.
   Adopting a Housing Element certified by the California Department of Housing and
    Community Development.
The Contra Costa Transportation Authority is responsible for ensuring that these objectives and
requirements are met. Periodically, it evaluates whether each city, town, and the County is
participating fully, based on a compliance checklist. Each year that a locality is found in compliance
with the Growth Management Program, it receives a share of the local sales tax increase that will be
used for local street improvements and related activities.
In 1992, the City adopted the Growth Management Element of the General Plan pursuant to the
requirements of Measure C. This element establishes goals, policies, and standards for traffic service
and other public facilities and services. Specifically, the element requires the preparation of traffic
studies for large developments and prohibits the City from approving projects that will cause levels
of service at any designated intersection to fall below the standards set in the element (i.e., level of
service D). The element also sets standards for police emergency response time, parks, fire
emergency response time, sanitary sewers, water services, and flood control. In effect, the standards

contained in the Growth Management Element formalize mitigation measures that are typically
required under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) on a project-by-project basis.
None of these standards are expected to constrain housing development in Clayton beyond the level
currently imposed by state environmental regulation.
In November 2004, Contra Costa County voters approved Measure J by over a two-thirds majority.
Measure J extended the half-cent sales tax for transportation improvements until 2034. Measure J
requires jurisdictions to demonstrate progress on providing housing opportunities by comparing the
number of units approved within the previous five years with the number of units needed to meet
the objectives established in the jurisdiction’s Housing Element. It further requires each city to
periodically certify it has not violated its Urban Limit Line (ULL) boundary and accompanying
regulations for orderly growth in order to be eligible for Measure J funds.
The adopted Growth Management Element does not restrict the number of new homes that are
permitted to be built. The element intends to use the increased tax revenue for transportation
improvements to ensure that development and growth are orderly and not restricted. Measure J
requires that the City monitor progress toward meeting Clayton’s housing objectives. The City has
determined that its Growth Management Element does not constrain the maintenance,
improvement, or development of housing for all income levels.
Development Processing Procedures, Standards, and Fees
Permit Processing Procedures
Housing development projects proposed in Clayton are subject to one or more of the following
review processes or permits: environmental review, zoning, subdivision review, planned unit
development, site plan review, use permits, and building permits.
The City does not have an in-house building department and instead contracts with the Contra
Costa County Building Inspection Division to administer its building permit process. To proceed
with a residential development, the developer first obtains the required project specific development
entitlement approvals from the City. The developer then submits construction plans for zoning
compliance review. The developer then applies for sewer and water service. The City of Concord
provides sewer service in Clayton under contract with Clayton. The Contra Costa Water District, an
independent special district public entity, provides water service. Once the developer has obtained
these approvals, the developer submits plans to the County Building Inspection Division for plan
check and a building permit. The County also provides building inspection services and grants
certificates of occupancy for the project.
The City created and offers a development handbook that provides applicants with an overview of
its development approval process. The guide is intended to minimize uncertainty in the process and
reduce the time applicants spend seeking development approval. The Clayton Community
Development Department also encourages no-cost pre-application meetings so that the City can
provide assistance and direction to applicants prior to application review. The City has found that
the pre-application meetings reduce the time spent approving development applications and create
opportunities for public/private development ventures.

Permit Processing Time Frames
Table 37 shows typical permit processing times in Clayton. Typical processing times include both
discretionary and non-discretionary permit processing times and take into account the time required
to obtain permits from both Contra Costa County and the City. For example, a “typical”
development project that requires a use permit and site plan review from the City and a building
permit from Contra Costa County would take approximately eight weeks to process (i.e., six weeks
for the use permit and site plan which would be processed concurrently, and two weeks for a
building permit).
The City’s permit processing procedures include an assessment of the potential environmental
impacts of the proposed project. If a project requires environmental review, additional processing
and time is required. State law under CEQA mandates these review procedures. Many of the
environmental regulations have protected the public from significant environmental degradation and
from development of certain projects on inappropriate sites, and have given the public an
opportunity to comment on project impacts. This process does, however, increase the time needed
for approval of a project.
A single-family residential subdivision requires approval of a Tentative Subdivision Map and a multi-
family project requires the approval of a Development Plan Permit. Both proposals require actions
by the Planning Commission and the City Council. If the level of environmental review is a negative
declaration (ND) or a mitigated negative declaration (MND) for these proposals, then the typical
processing time for these planning entitlements is four to six months from the time an application is
deemed complete. If the level of environmental review is an environmental impact report (EIR),
then the typical processing time, from the time the application is deemed complete, is approximately
12 months.

Planned Development Districts
A Planned Development (PD) district requires a subsequent development plan permit. The permit
request must meet the requirements set forth in Section 17.28 of the Clayton Municipal Code and be
approved by the City Council. An approved PD district provides applicants with flexibility in land
use controls, including residential land use controls.
To facilitate multi-family development on PD sites, in 2014 the City amended the PD zoning district
standards to allow multi-family developments with a General Plan land use designation of Multi-
Family High Density (MHD) to be processed with only site plan review (rather than development
plan review as was previously required) if applicants choose to adhere to M-R-H zoning district
development standards. This change was intended to create a predictable path for development on
sites designated MHD.
Development Plan Review
The PD district provides developers and the City with the flexibility to accommodate projects on
sites which are constrained by various physical factors such as flooding, slopes, restricted access, or
cultural resources. The development plan process allows creativity in the application of various
standard development requirements including setbacks, height limitations, lot coverage, vehicular
access, parking, and architectural design. Since development plans may involve the relaxation of
various standards, Planning Commission and City Council review is required. The standards of
review are listed in the Zoning Ordinance and focus upon ensuring that a better development will
result than would occur with a non-flexible zone and ensuring protection of usable and natural open
areas.
Site Plan Review
Site plan review is required for new single-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings, and certain types
of residential additions. Typically, the process is initiated by staff meeting with the applicant to
review the project. The applicant submits an application and the processing fee/deposit.
Neighboring property owners are notified and a staff report is prepared. The Planning Commission
reviews the project at a public hearing to examine compatibility with surrounding residences, solar
rights, privacy, safety, and views. The site plan review process takes approximately six to ten weeks.
Following site plan approval, the applicant submits construction drawings for an initial conformance
review by the City’s Community Development Department staff and then to the County Building
Inspection Division.
Since specific criteria listed in the Zoning Ordinance are used in the evaluation and approval of
projects, the site plan review process is generally predictable and does not add great time or expense
to residential development.

Design Review
Residential development projects in Clayton are subject to a basic design review process that is a
component of the site plan review process. This process ensures that new residential development is
compatible with surrounding residences and protects the solar rights, privacy, safety, and views of
existing development. The requirements for design review are described in the Town Center Specific
Plan, the Marsh Creek Road Specific Plan, the Zoning Ordinance, and the General Plan. These
documents are described as follows:
   Marsh Creek Road Specific Plan: The Marsh Creek Road Specific Plan contains design and
    development standards that require designers and builders to retain and enhance the character of
    the planning area as it develops. The guidelines address site planning, creek corridors, ridgeline
    and hillside protection, streetscape and landscape architecture, residential architecture, energy
    and resource conservation, and commercial development.
   Town Center Specific Plan: The Town Center Specific Plan contains design guidelines that
    provide guiding principles rather than strict requirements to ensure flexibility in meeting the
    intent of the guidelines. The guidelines address several topics such as site design, architectural
    character, landscape character, preservation of historic buildings, relationship of new to existing
    development, parking, and signage.
   General Plan: The General Plan contains a Community Design Element with objectives,
    policies, and implementation measures that address overall community design, scenic highways,
    and design standards for the Town Center.
   Zoning Ordinance: The Zoning Ordinance protects solar rights, privacy, safety, and views of
    existing development through height and setback restrictions.
The design review process ensures that new residential development preserves basic aesthetic
principles and does not affect entitlements by allowing additional conditions to be placed on the
project. The design review process adds proportionately insignificant costs to residential
development and therefore is not a constraint to affordable housing.
On- and Off-Site Improvement Requirements
The City requires the installation of certain on- and off-site improvements to ensure the safety and
livability of its residential neighborhoods. On-site improvements typically include streets, curbs,
gutters, sidewalks, and utilities, and amenities such as landscaping, fencing, street lighting, open
space, and park facilities. Off-site improvements typically include:
   Road improvements, including construction of sections of roadway, medians, sidewalks, bicycle
    lanes, and street lighting.
   Drainage improvements, including improvement to sections of channel, culverts, swales, and
    pond areas (Contra Costa County Flood Control District requirements).

                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT
    Sewage collection and treatment (Contra Costa Sanitary District requirements).
    Water system improvements, including lines, storage tanks, and treatment plant (Contra Costa
     Water District requirements).
    Public facilities for fire, school, and recreation.
    Geological hazard repair and maintenance where appropriate.
The type of improvements required depend upon the improvements that exist prior to development.
If, for example, a vacant lot is improved with curb, gutters, and sidewalks, then the developer is not
required to reinstall these. All typical improvements discussed above are required for residential
development if they are absent prior to development.
Typically, on- and off-site improvement costs are passed on to the homebuyer as part of the final
cost of the home. Clayton does not require on- and off-site improvements beyond what is typically
required in other jurisdictions and therefore does not consider these improvements to be a
constraint to the development of housing for all income levels.
Construction and Housing Codes
Building Code and Code Enforcement
The City has a small Code Enforcement team. Code Enforcement receives and follows up on
complaints from citizens about matters ranging from poorly maintained properties, including
foreclosed properties, to boats, recreational vehicles, and trailers illegally parked on private
properties. Enforcement tactics include verbal contacts, written courtesy notices, and formal notices
of violation. These efforts are essential in maintaining the quality and appearance of the built
environment in Clayton. Code Enforcement coordinates as needed with other local agencies,
including representatives from the Contra Costa County Building Department, the Clayton Police
Department, the Housing Authority of Contra Costa County, the Contra Costa County Mosquito
and Vector Control District, and the Environmental Health Department of Contra Costa County.
Additionally, the City contracts with the Contra Costa County Building Inspection Division to
provide building plan check, inspection, and occasional code enforcement services related directly to
construction projects. Table 38 shows the construction and housing codes adopted and
administered by Contra Costa County for Clayton.

The City and applicable districts collect development impact fees for the provision of services such
as water, sewers, storm drains, schools, and parks and recreation facilities. These fees are generally
assessed based on the number of units in a residential development with the exception of the school
district fee collected by the Mount Diablo Unified School District (MDUSD), which determines
permit fees based on square footage. Fees charged for building permits are based on the
construction values as prescribed by the Uniform Building Code. Table 40 shows development fees

Development fees in Clayton are typical for fees associated with residential development in the Bay
Area. A large portion ($24,262) of the total fees associated with residential development in the city is
for water connections, which are provided by the Contra Costa Water District (special district) for
jurisdictions located in Contra Costa County. The City also relies on the County’s Department
Conservation and Development – Building Inspection Division for building permit, plan review and
inspection services. The City’s pre-application meetings and application referral process assist with
expediting the permit review period at the County level.
4.2 Non-Governmental Constraints
The availability and cost of housing is strongly influenced by market factors in the desirable Bay
Area over which local government has little or no control. State law requires that the Housing
Element provide a general assessment of these constraints. This assessment can serve as the basis
for actions which local governments might take to offset the effects of such constraints. The
primary market constraints to the development of new housing are the costs of constructing and
purchasing new housing. These costs can be broken down into three categories: land, construction,
and financing. For the most part, housing cost components in Clayton are comparable to those in
other parts of the Bay Area.
Land Costs
Costs associated with the acquisition of land include the market price of raw land and the cost of
holding land throughout the development process. These costs can account for as much as half of
the final sales prices of new homes in very small developments or in areas where land is scarce.
Among the variables affecting the cost of land are its location, its amenities, the availability of public
services, and the financing arrangement made between the buyer and seller.
Land costs vary significantly in accordance with a variety of factors, including proximity of urban
services. Due to low inventories of vacant lands and land for sale in Clayton, it is difficult to estimate
the cost per acre of land in the city. The inventory of vacant land parcels in the neighboring City of
Concord includes properties that are near the Clayton boundary line. Undeveloped land zoned for
residential development on these properties is listed from $600,000 per acre to as high as $4 million
per acre. It is recognized that the high cost of land constrains developers’ ability to develop
affordable housing. Unfortunately, there is little the City can do to lower the cost of land in the
private market.
Construction Costs
Factors that affect the cost of building a house include the type of construction, materials, site
conditions, finishing details, amenities, and structural configuration. An Internet source of
construction cost data (www.building-cost.net), provided by the Craftsman Book Company, estimated
the cost of a single-story home in Clayton to be approximately $136 per square foot in January 2014.
This cost estimate is based on a 2,000-square-foot house of good standard-quality construction
including a two-car garage and central heating and air conditioning. The total construction costs

    HOUSING ELEMENT
excluding land costs are estimated at approximately $273,560. In April 2014, a local developer
suggested that costs are currently closer to $100 per square foot for large single family homes.
According to local developers, the cost to develop multi-family housing (excluding land cost) in the
city is typically about $72 per square foot. The cost to develop a 1,200 square foot multi-family
apartment unit would be approximately $86,400, making multi-family housing the more affordable
housing development option on a construction cost per square foot basis.
If labor or material costs increased substantially, the cost of construction in Clayton could rise to a
level that impacts the price of new construction and rehabilitation. Therefore, increased construction
costs have the potential to constrain new housing construction and rehabilitation of existing
housing.
Availability of Financing
Financing new residential development can be a significant cost; however, residential financing for
both single family and multiple family housing is generally available. Developers of single-family
projects often secure loans for land acquisition, installation of improvements, and construction.
Land acquisition and development loan rates are typically the prime rate plus .5 to 2 percent, which
was 3.6 to 4.5 percent in late 2013. Apartment loan rates are generally a bit lower.
Developers of affordable housing face significant challenges in securing financing. Due to the
limited possible return from rents or sales prices of affordable units, many private lenders are unable
to finance affordable projects due to the rate of return. Thus affordable developers must rely on
community lending divisions, nonprofit institutions, grants and special loans, and local assistance.

5.0 HOUSING RESOURCES
The City utilizes local, state, and federal funds to implement its housing strategy. Because of the high
cost of new construction, more than one source of public funds is required to construct an
affordable housing development. The City does not act as a developer in the production of
affordable units, but relies upon the private sector to develop new units with the assistance of these
various funding sources.
Clayton residents may also benefit from programs that are administered by the Contra Costa County
Community Development Department. For example, the Mortgage Credit Certificate Program
(authorized via Section 25 of the IRS code) is targeted to households whose incomes do not exceed
115 percent of area median income. This program permits public jurisdictions to issue tax credit
certificates for a portion of the mortgage interest paid by first-time homebuyers. In this program, the
buyer and the lender cover most of the direct expenses.
As stated in Implementation Measures II.1.1, III.1.1, and III.1.3), the City will continue to promote
the availability of existing assistance programs, assist housing providers in pursuing available funding
sources, and pursue sources locally whenever available.
5.1 Housing Programs and Funding Sources
Section 8 Voucher Program
Rental assistance is available from the Housing Authority of the County of Contra Costa, which
administers the Section 8 voucher program. As of 2013, only one Clayton household was receiving
rental assistance from this program, which is funded by HUD. The limited number of rental housing
units and the high cost of rental housing in the city make it unlikely that Section 8 participants will
find units to rent in Clayton.
Funding Programs
Local, state, and federal funding programs can be used to assist first-time homebuyers, build
affordable housing, and help special needs groups, such as seniors, persons with disabilities, and the
homeless. Funds provided may be low-interest loans that need to be repaid, or in some instances,
grants are provided that do not require repayment.
These funding programs are summarized in Table 41. In most cases, for-profit and nonprofit
developers apply for these funds or program benefits directly. For example, nonprofit organizations
apply directly to HUD for Section 202 and Section 811 loans, and developers apply to the California
Tax Credit Allocation Committee for low-income tax credits. The City does not act as a developer in
the production of affordable units, but relies upon the private sector to develop new units with the
assistance of various funding sources. The City can help sponsor grant and loan applications,
provide matching funds, or furnish land at below-market cost. However, there are also programs,
such as CDBG and HOME, for which the City can apply directly to the County Community
Development Department for funding. Finally, there are a few programs, such as the Mortgage
Credit Certificate Program or the Lease Purchase Program, to which individual households apply
directly once local or county programs have been established.

Community Development Block Grant Funds (CDBG)
The County Community Development Department also administers the CDBG and HOME
programs. The County receives approximately $3.5 million in CDBG funds annually for the 14 cities
and unincorporated areas that make up the urban county. Forty-seven (47) percent of the funds are
reserved for projects and programs within the urban county that address the following priorities:
   Increase the supply of multi-family rental housing affordable to and occupied by very low- and
    low-income households.
   Maintain the existing affordable housing stock through the rehabilitation of owner-occupied and
    rental housing.
   Increase the supply of appropriate and supportive housing for special needs populations.
   Assist the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless by providing emergency and
    transitional housing.
   Alleviate problems of housing discrimination.
CDBG funds are used for site acquisition, rehabilitation, first-time homebuyer assistance,
development of emergency and transitional shelters, and fair housing/housing counseling activities.
Additional activities in support of the new construction of affordable housing include site
acquisition, site clearance, and the financing of related infrastructure and public facility
improvements.
HOME Investment Partnership Act Program Funds
The urban county and the cities of Antioch, Concord, Pittsburg, Richmond, and Walnut Creek
formed the Contra Costa Consortium for the purpose of applying to HUD for HOME funds.
Approximately $2.9 million in HOME funds are allocated to the consortium annually. All projects
funded with HOME funds must be targeted to very low- and low-income households and must
have permanent matching funds from non-federal resources equal to 25 percent of the requested
funds. In addition, the County Board of Supervisors has established a priority for the allocation of
HOME and CDBG funds to projects that include a portion of the units affordable to extremely
low-income households (incomes at or below 30 percent of the area median income).
Consortium HOME program priorities include the following:
   Acquisition, rehabilitation, and new construction of affordable multi-family rental housing.
   Owner-occupied housing rehabilitation programs for low-income households.
   First-time homebuyers assistance for low-income households.

5.2 Existing Affordable Housing
As shown in Table 42, there are 126 affordable units at a variety of affordability levels in Clayton.
There are 20 affordable housing units at Kirker Court, a project for persons with disabilities
managed by Eden Housing. Diamond Terrace, an assisted living project for seniors, was completed
in 2003. This project provides 65 units for very low-income seniors and 10 units for low-income
seniors as well as 10 units for moderate-income seniors.
The Stranahan residential subdivision was built in 1995 and consisted of 54 single-family detached
homes. Eighteen of the homes were sold at a level affordable to moderate-income households. Since
the initial sale, two of the 18 homes were repurchased by the redevelopment agency (RDA) and
resold to low-income households, and an additional six of these houses were repurchased by the
RDA and resold to moderate-income households. One of the homes converted to market rate in
2013. Due to the dissolution of the RDA, the City did not have the resources to purchase and resell
the home at an affordable rate.
In addition, four lower-income units were provided by the Bridlewood Court and Diablo Estates at
Clayton projects to satisfy Affordable Housing Plan requirements. Table 42 presents detailed

Affordable Housing at Risk of Conversion to Market Rate
State law requires that Housing Elements include an inventory and analysis of restricted affordable
housing units that are eligible to convert to market rate within 10 years of the beginning of the
Housing Element planning period (through December 31, 2024). As shown in Table 41, none of
the City’s 126 affordable units are eligible for conversion to market rate in the next 10 years. Should
any units in the city become at risk, the City will implement Implementation Measure III.2.1 to
preserve units at risk of conversion to market rate.
Table 43 identifies nonprofit housing organizations that serve Contra Costa County listed by HCD
as entities that could acquire multi-family developments or affordable units if any units were to
become at risk in the future.

6.0 RESIDENTIAL LAND ANALYSIS
6.1 Regional Housing Needs Allocation
State law (Government Code Section 65580 et seq.) requires that HCD project statewide housing
needs and allocate the anticipated need to regions throughout the state. For the Bay Area, HCD
provides the regional need to the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), which then
distributes the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) to the cities and counties within the
ABAG region. ABAG allocates housing production goals for cities and counties based on their
projected share of the region’s household growth, the state of the local housing market and
vacancies, and the jurisdiction’s housing replacement needs.
Projected housing needs in the RHNA are described by income categories as established by HCD:
very low, low, moderate, and above moderate. Additionally, recent state legislation requires
jurisdictions to project housing needs for extremely low-income households, which is assumed to be
half of the very low-income allocation.
Clayton’s share of the 2014 to 2022 RHNA is 141 units. As shown in Table 44, the RHNA includes
25 extremely low-income units, 26 very low-income units, 25 low-income units, 31 moderate-income
units, and 34 above moderate-income units.
Clayton’s RHNA represents less than 1 percent of the total Contra Costa County RHNA of 20,630
units.

Capacity to Accommodate the RHNA
As detailed in Section 6.2 Adequate Sites Inventory and summarized in Table 45, Clayton has
capacity in planned or approved projects and adequate land zoned at densities appropriate to meet
the 2014–2022 RHNA for all income categories. Projects already approved or planned can
accommodate 13 units, vacant residential sites can accommodate 136 units, and underutilized sites
can accommodate 129 units. Identified sites have realistic capacity for a total of 278 units, 145 of
which may be appropriate for lower-income households.

As stated in Implementation Measure I.1.1, the City will continue to track and monitor the inventory
of available sites throughout the planning period to ensure that adequate sites remain available to
accommodate the City’s RHNA.

    Units estimated in the lower-income categories will be deed-restricted for affordability in the Creekside Terrace and Oak Creek Canyon
  Projects. 2 Units estimated in the lower-income categories are located in General Plan land use designations that allow up to at least 20
  units per acre (Multi-family High Density and Town Center Commercial), in keeping with the “default density” for the City of Clayton as
  determined by HCD.
6.2 Adequate Sites Inventory
State law requires that the Housing Element include an “inventory of land suitable for residential
development, including vacant sites and sites having the potential for redevelopment” (Government
Code Section 65583[a][3]). State law further requires that the Housing Element analyze zoning and
infrastructure on these sites to ensure that housing development during the planning period is
actually feasible. Through this process, the City must demonstrate that it has sufficient land to
accommodate its fair share of the RHNA as described above.
The City must also show that the land supply is capable of supporting housing demand for all
economic segments of the community, including lower-income households. The state has generally
held that the best way to demonstrate capacity for “affordable” housing is to provide sufficient and
suitable land zoned for higher-density multi-family housing.
All sites identified in the inventory are shown on the map in Appendix B.
Approved Projects
As of March 2014, 13 housing units were approved for development in the City of Clayton. As
shown in Table 46, these units are located in the Creekside Terrace and Oak Creek Canyon
projects.

Creekside Terrace
Creekside Terrace is an approved mixed-use project in the Town Center area that is planned for
seven second floor residential uses and ground floor commercial. The site is owned by the City and
its now defunct RDA took the many steps necessary to ready the site for development, including
completing entitlements and environmental review. The City is currently working with interested
developers to move the project forward, and anticipates project completion within the first half of
the planning period. Because the project was enabled by the RDA, one unit must be deed-restricted
for affordability to lower-income households. An interested developer is exploring the prospect of
adding an additional 7 residential units to the project.
Oak Creek Canyon
Oak Creek Canyon is an approved five-unit single-family subdivision planned for a site of
approximately 9 acres that has been annexed into the city. The project has been approved since
2005; however, development stalled due to the recession. It is anticipated that this project will move
forward and provide units appropriate for above moderate-income households early in the planning
period. As the original Site Plan Review Permit expired the City is seeking for the developer to
provide 1 low-income housing unit off-site as part of the Affordable Housing Plan for the project.
Vacant Residential Land
As shown in Table 47, Clayton has vacant, unentitled land zoned for residential and mixed-use
development at densities of up to 20 units per acre with a realistic capacity for 136 units. While
vacant residential sites could accommodate up to 180 units in accordance with zoning standards, it is
assumed that not all sites will develop at the maximum allowed density due to various site features
and constraints.
Sites V-1 and V-2 are designated Town Center Commercial, which allows residential development
(with no maximum density) on upper floor units (ground floor uses must be commercial). Policy I.6
of the Town Center Specific Plan encourages “the provision of small residential units on upper
floors of commercially designated parcels.” Implementation Measure I.4.1 further encourages the
development of residential units on Town Center sites.

Sites V-3 and V-4 are designated as Affordable Housing Opportunity sites, allowing for increased
density and potential regulatory incentives for the development of affordable housing. Site V-3,
known as the Old Firehouse Site, is a 1-acre parcel located at the corner of Clayton Road and
Mitchell Canyon Road. In the past, there has been some developer interest in the site for projects
ranging from 16 to 22 units, thus the realistic capacity is estimated at 18. Site V-4 is a 1.1-acre lot
that is likely to accommodate 18 to 20 homes.
Site V-5, Silver Oak Estates, is a 59-unit project planned for the 13.96-acre Hurd Ranch property.
The project includes 7 single-family homes and 52 town homes, as well as a neighborhood
swimming pool and cabana and nearly 8 acres of open space. It is anticipated that Silver Oak Estates
units will be affordable to moderate- and above moderate-income households; however, the
developers of Silver Oak Estates conceptually propose to provide six on-site affordable units as part
of the Affordable Housing Plan for the project.
Sites V-6, V-7, and V-8 are designated for low and medium density single-family development in the
City’s General Plan. It is assumed that units on these sites will be affordable to moderate- and above
moderate-income households.

 1 Refer to the Realistic Capacity subsection for a discussion of realistic capacity assumptions.
 2 There is no maximum density for residential development in the Town Center Commercial designation. For analysis purposes, the
 “maximum units” calculation is based on a density of 20 units per acre, the density allowed in the Multi-family High Density land use
 designation.

Underdeveloped Residential Land
Underdeveloped residential land could realistically provide capacity for an additional 129 units.
Table 48 provides a detailed list of viable underdeveloped sites, including a description of existing
uses. Sites U-1, U-2, and U-3 were redesignated Multi-Family High Density in 2011. During this
process property owners were contacted and made aware of the increased development potential for
their sites.
Site U-4 is an underutilized church site. The site is currently zoned Agricultural but is within the
Institutional General Plan land use designation, which allows residential development at up to 20
units per acre. The designation is intended for the development of senior housing. The site would
need to be rezoned for consistency with the General Plan in order for the residential development
potential to be realized.
The property owner of site U-11 is in the process of subdividing the parcel to create two additional
lots for the development of two new single-family homes. No affordable units would be provided.

Environmental Constraints
The inventory of available sites identifies a variety of potential environmental constraints, such as
slope, oak tree preservation, and floodplains. The City recognizes that these environmental
characteristics are part of the City’s character and promotes flexible design standards that allow
developers to mitigate environmental constraints while preserving the City’s environmental features.
The realistic capacity assumptions of sites identified in Table 46 and 47 take into account existing
environmental constraints. The City recognizes the potential effect that environmental constraints
are likely to have on housing development, including reducing the number of units likely to be
constructed. The City will continue to work with developers to creatively coordinate development
and preserve the community’s natural characteristics.
Zoning to Accommodate Lower-Income Households
Housing Element law requires that jurisdictions identify zones which accommodate the housing
needs of lower-income households. The law allows jurisdictions to rely upon default densities (20
du/ac for Clayton) to demonstrate zoning that encourages lower-income housing development.
Pursuant to state law (Government Code Section 65583.2[c][3][B]), parcels zoned for a residential
density of up to 20 units are assumed to be appropriate to meet the City’s lower-income RHNA. It
is important to note that sites within other residential zones, may also be appropriate for affordable
housing development; however, they have been assumed for moderate- and above-moderate
development in keeping with state default density analysis standards.
Realistic Capacity
Realistic capacity is generally estimated at 80 percent of the maximum allowed, based on densities
achieved in past housing developments. In some instances, the realistic capacity has been adjusted
down to account for site-specific constraints. Recent example affordable housing projects include:
   Diamond Terrace (2002): affordable senior housing including 65 very low-, 10 low-, and 10
    moderate-income units. The site was zoned PD and had a General Plan designation of
    Institutional, which allowed a density of up to 20 units per acre. The total site is 6.45 acres,
    achieving a density of 13.3 units per acre (67 percent of the maximum allowed).
   Stranahan Circle (1995): mixed-income housing including 2 low-income, 16 moderate-income,
    and 36 market-rate units. The site was zoned PD and the General Plan designation was SF-HD,
    which allowed a maximum of 7.5 units per acre. Stranahan Circle was developed on 7.5 acres,
    achieving a density of 7.2 units per acre (96 percent of the maximum allowed).
   Kirker Court (1993): developed with 20 units and was made affordable to extremely low-income
    households. The site was zoned PD and the General Plan designation was MF-LD, which allows
    a maximum of 10 units per acre. The project exceeded the maximum density, providing at 12.4
    units per acre on the 1.61-acre site (124 percent of the maximum allowed).

    HOUSING ELEMENT
Recent market-rate developments in the city—Rachel Ranch, Pine Hollow Estates, and Mitchell
Creek Place—developed at 73 percent, 96 percent, and 73 percent of their respective maximum
allowable densities.
For sites designated Town Center Commercial, there is no specific maximum density for residential
development. Residential units are allowed only on upper floors. For these sites, the maximum
density is estimated at 20 units per acre, the same density allowed in the Multi-Family High Density
designation, and realistic capacity is assumed at half of that maximum, to account for the mix of uses
on these sites.
Affordable Housing Opportunity Sites
The Old Firehouse Site (A-3) and former Stanley Property (Site A-6) in the inventory of vacant land
are designated as Affordable Housing Opportunity sites. These sites have been determined to be
particularly appropriate for affordable housing development due to their size and proximity to
services and amenities. As such the City placed a 20 unit to the acre MHD (Multi-Family High
Density) General Plan Land Use Designation on the properties to encourage and facilitate
development at high densities and to make affordable housing more feasible. The City also amended
its PD (Planned Development) district standards to allow properties with an MHD designation to
use the default zoning designation of M-R-H (Multiple Family High Density). While it is not
required that these sites develop only as affordable housing, affordable housing is strongly preferred
and development of affordable units will be incentivized through increased density, design flexibility,
priority processing, and funding application assistance.
Priority Development Areas (PDAs)
Priority Development Areas (PDAs) are locally identified, infill development opportunity areas
within existing communities. They are generally areas of at least 100 acres where there is local
commitment to developing more housing along with amenities and services to meet the day-to-day
needs of residents in a pedestrian-friendly environment served by transit. To be eligible to become a
PDA, an area had to be within an existing community, near existing or planned fixed transit or
served by comparable bus service, and planned for more housing. The City of Clayton does not have
any identified PDAs since there are no infill opportunities of 100 acres or more within the City.
6.3 Availability of Services
Water
The Contra Costa Water District (CCWD or District) is a special district public agency that provides
public water supply, treatment, storage, and distribution in the City of Clayton. CCWD obtains its
water from Rock Slough, near Oakley, in the Delta, under the terms of a contract with the federal
government. CCWD’s 2011 Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) indicates that CCWD has a
near-term total planned supply of 214,900 acre-feet of water in a normal precipitation year and
166,900 acre-feet of water in a single-year drought condition year. The demand for water by CCWD
customers in 2010 was 121,170 acre-feet of water, which yields an excess supply of 93,730 acre-feet.

supply, resulting in an excess supply of 51,480 acre feet per year.
Water distributed by CCWD in the Clayton area is treated at the CCWD’s Bollman plant on
Highway 4. The plant’s permitted capacity in 2011 was 75 million gallons per day (mgd), which is
sufficient for current levels of demand within its service area. CCWD officials report that the
Bollman treatment plant, in its present configuration, can be expanded to a maximum capacity of 95
mgd, which is sufficient to handle increased water demand in Clayton. If development occurs east of
the city, it is likely to require additional water supply and distribution facilities, including reservoirs,
pumping stations, and distribution lines.
CCWD completed the Future Water Supply Study (FWSS) in 1996 to identify alternatives to offer
customers a high quality, reliable supply for the next 50 years. The FWSS was updated in 2002. The
FWSS examined water demand, conservation, and existing and potential supplies for a range of
service area alternatives. The CCWD’s Board of Directors adopted the FWSS, including the
Preferred Alternative and Implementation Plan. The Preferred Alternative provides drought
reliability and operational flexibility in the short term while maintaining long-term supply targets to
meet projected demands. The Preferred Alternative includes the following actions to meet future
demand:
    Re-negotiation of the District’s existing CVP Amendatory contract prior to the year 2005
     (completed May 2005).
    Implementation of an expanded District-wide conservation program (known as CPA 1) to
     encompass wholesale and retail customers, which would achieve a target of at least 5 percent
     District-wide savings by the year 2040. These savings are in addition to conservation savings
     expected from non-District activities.
    The completion of two or more water transfers to: (1) strengthen the reliability of supplies and
     drought protection for existing customers, and (2) bridge the gap between water supplies and
     projected demands. Transfers would be pursued in incremental blocks tied specifically to
     approved growth within the District. 
Future treatment plant expansions and system-wide facility improvements are partially funded
through the District’s connection fee. The fee is based on the size of the new connection’s water
meter. The connection fee for a typical single-family home (or detached second dwelling unit) is
$24,262. State and local fire district regulations require all new single-family homes in Clayton to
have a 1-inch meter to supply a mandatory fire sprinkler system, but CCWD charges a fee similar to
the 5/8-inch rate for a one-inch meter under these circumstances. CCWD designs all water system
expansions, prepares the construction plans, supplies the materials, and supervises construction, at
the developer’s expense. Installation is generally the responsibility of a developer. Upon completion,
the new pipelines and appurtenances become CCWD property.

Wastewater Treatment and Collection
The Central Contra Costa Sanitary District (CCCSD) provides public sanitary sewer treatment for
the central Contra Costa County area, including Clayton. Sewage is conveyed through gravity sewer
lines and pumping stations to CCCSD’s treatment plant located at the intersection of Highway 4 and
Interstate 680. Treated effluent is discharged into the Carquinez Strait.
As of 2013, the CCCSD treatment plant operated at 45 mgd. Based on the current rate of growth in
the CCCSD service area, CCCSD staff project the plant will reach its full capacity of 53.8 mgd in 15
to 20 years.
Under agreement, the City of Concord Public Works Department operates and maintains Clayton’s
sanitary sewer collection system, although the collection lines are actually owned by Clayton.
Concord transports Clayton’s sewage downstream through its system of trunk sewers and pumping
stations to the CCCSD treatment plant. CCCSD charges the City of Concord a per-gallon fee for
sewage treatment and for new service connections. Concord passes these costs along to all of its
sewer customers, including those in Clayton, along with additional charges for the operation and
maintenance of the collection system.
According to Concord’s Sewer System Management Plan, adopted in 2012, the capacity of the
district’s waste system will support ABAG’s projected population through 2030. Recent investments
made in upgrades to the system (2004 to 2006) increased the system capacity to meet the future
demands of increased population growth.
In the fall of 2004, the City advanced funds and initiated preparation of a sewer master plan for the
Marsh Creek Road Specific Plan area. The Specific Plan identifies upgrades needed to rectify any
existing downstream constraints in the sewers serving the Specific Plan area. The plan also identifies
the routing of sewers to serve the Specific Plan area. In addition, the Specific Plan established a
funding program, to be borne by developers, for the necessary improvements and extensions of the
sewers. The cost of improving Clayton’s main collection system will add to the cost of developing
housing in the Marsh Creek Road area and could have a constraining effect on the development of
low and moderate-income housing in that area. As a result infrastructure of investments in the early
2000s, sewer service is available to virtually all of Clayton, although not all residences have
connected to the lines.
Pursuant to SB 1087, which requires the City to ensure a copy of the adopted Housing Element
reaches its water and wastewater providers, the City will forward its adopted Housing Element to
the City of Concord Public Works Department, CCCSD, and Contra Costa Water District.
Government Code 65889.7 requires water and wastewater providers to establish a schedule that
prioritizes services toward developments with affordable housing. The City will forward the adopted
Housing Element to local water and wastewater agencies to assist those agencies with prioritizing
water and wastewater allocations.

   7.0 REVIEW OF PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
   Clayton has made significant progress toward achieving one-time and ongoing goals set in the existing Housing Element, which was adopted and
   certified in 2010. This section summarizes Housing Element results from 2010 through 2013. The following table provides a brief description of
   Clayton’s effectiveness in implementing programs to achieve objectives set in the previous Housing Element.

The Affordable Housing Plan shall specify and include the following:                               projects of 10 or more units.
    The number of dwelling units that will be developed as affordable to very low-, low-,
     moderate-, and above moderate-income households (the City’s desire would be that at
     least 5 percent of all project units be built as very low-income housing units and at least 5
     percent of all project units be built as low-income housing units).
    The number of affordable ownership and rental units to be produced. Such split shall be
     approved by the City Council based on housing needs, market conditions, and other
     relevant factors. The split of ownership and rental units shall be addressed within the
     Plan for each individual project.
    Program options within project-specific Affordable Housing Plans may include, but are not
     limited to, the following:
      –   Actual production (on-site or off-site) of affordable units (including ownership and
          rental opportunities in the form of corner units, halfplexes, duplexes, cottages,
          creative alternative housing products, etc.).
      –   Land dedication (on-site and off-site).
      –   Payment of in-lieu fees.
    The timing for completion of affordable housing obligations. For projects proposing to
     construct affordable housing units, the City generally supports construction of affordable
     dwellings concurrent with the construction of market-rate housing when feasible. For

     contributions shall be identified in the Plan, with the expectation that the City will pursue
     construction of affordable units generally concurrent with construction of project market-
     rate housing.
    At the City Council’s discretion, land or other contributions provided by developers as
     specified within project Affordable Housing Plans may be utilized to augment City efforts
     and the efforts of its nonprofit partners to provide affordable housing opportunities to all
     income levels throughout the community. The City will pursue supplemental funding to
     allow affordability to households earning less than 50 percent of area median income.
    In order to ensure the production and preservation of housing affordable to the City’s
     workforce, no productive, reasonable program or incentive option will be excluded from
     consideration within project-specific Affordable Housing Plans. Possible incentives may
     include, but are not limited to:
      –   Density bonuses
      –   Fee waivers or deferrals (as reasonably available)
      –   Expedited processing/priority processing
      –   Reduced parking standards
      –   Technical assistance with accessing funding
      – Modifications to development standards (on a case-by-case basis)

Time Frame: This program will be implemented as projects of two or more units are processed
through the Planning Department. The City will monitor the implementation of this program to
ensure that it does not cause a constraint to the development of housing in the City of Clayton
and will make necessary revisions to the program if necessary to avoid such a constraint.

Annually coordinate with HUD to monitor projects approved to convert to ensure that any
required assistance (or assistance that the owner has agreed to provide) to displaced tenants is
carried out in a timely manner. Ensure projects are monitored to see if they are subject to
other state or local requirements regarding the provision of assistance to displaced tenants.
Annually monitor local investment in projects that have been acquired by nonprofit or for-
profit entities to ensure that properties are well managed and maintained and are being
operated in accordance with the City’s property rehabilitation standards.
Work with owners, tenants, and nonprofit organizations to assist in the nonprofit acquisition of
at-risk projects to ensure long-term affordability of the development. Annually contact property
owners, gauge interest, and identify nonprofit partners and pursue funding and preservation
strategy on a project-by-project basis.
Annually meet with stakeholders and housing interests to participate and support, through
letters and meetings and technical assistance, with local legislators in federal, state, or local
initiatives that address affordable housing preservation (e.g., support state or national
legislation that addresses at-risk projects, support full funding of programs that provide
resources for preservation activities). Use available financial resources to restructure federally
assisted preservation projects, where feasible, in order to preserve and/or extend affordability.
Annually identify funding sources for at-risk preservation and acquisition rehabilitation and
pursue these funding sources at the federal, state, or local level to preserve at-risk units on a
project-by-project basis.

8.0 GOALS AND POLICIES
Adequate Sites and New Construction
GOAL I Provide for adequate sites and promote the development of new housing to
          accommodate Clayton’s fair share housing allocation.
POLICY I.1 The City shall designate and zone sufficient land to accommodate Clayton’s
             projected fair share housing allocation as determined by the Association of Bay Area
             Governments.
Implementation Measure I.1.1. To ensure that adequate sites are available through the planning
             period to meet the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), the City will
             continue to maintain an inventory of sites available and appropriate for residential
             development for households at all income levels. In keeping with state “no net loss”
             provisions (Government Code Section 65863), if development projects are approved
             at densities lower than anticipated in the sites inventory, the City will evaluate the
             availability of sites appropriate for lower-income housing and, if necessary, shall
             rezone sufficient sites to accommodate the RHNA.
             Responsibility:          Community Development Department
             Time Frame:              Ongoing, as development projects are proposed.
             Funding:                 General Fund
Implementation Measure I.1.2. The City will amend the Multi-Family High Density (MHD)
             General Plan land use designation or otherwise amend the General Plan and/or
             Zoning Ordinance as needed to meet state requirements specific to sites rezoned to

             specifically to allow multi-family housing by-right on these sites at a minimum
             density of 20 units per acre.
             The City’s 2007–2014 Housing Element identified a shortfall of land that provided
             for residential development at a density deemed appropriate for affordable housing
             to accommodate 84 units to meet the extremely low-, very low-, and low-income
             RHNA. State law (Government Code Section 65583.2(h) and (i)) requires that land
             rezoned or redesignated to meet a shortfall meet the following criteria:
                     Require a minimum density of at least 20 units per acre.
                     Accommodate at least 16 units per site.
                     Allow multi-family housing by-right (without a use permit).

                         only.
                In 2012, the City in good faith established the Multi-Family High Density General
                Plan Land Use and Zoning District designations and made specified General Plan
                Map and Zoning Map changes in an attempt to accommodate the City’s lower-
                income RHNA shortfall from the 2007–2014 planning period. The City was advised
                by HCD that these efforts fell short of state law; therefore, the City’s land use
                regulations will be appropriately revised to comply with the above stated criteria..

POLICY I.2 The City shall actively support and participate in the development of extremely low-,
                very low-, low-, and moderate-income housing to meet Clayton’s fair share housing
                allocation. To this end, the City shall help facilitate the provision of affordable
                housing through the granting of regulatory concessions and available financial
                assistance.
Implementation Measure I.2.1. For residential projects of 10 or more units, developers will be
                required to develop an Affordable Housing Plan that requires a minimum of 10 % of
                the units to be built or created as affordable housing units. The City has established
                the following guidelines to provide direction for the review of Affordable Housing
                Plans associated with individual development projects and to provide direction for
                the preparation of an Affordable Housing Plan.
                The plan shall be approved in conjunction with the earliest stage of project
                entitlement, typically with the City Council approval of the development agreement
                or other primary land use entitlement.
                The Affordable Housing Plan shall specify and include the following:
                   The number of dwelling units that will be developed as affordable to very low-,
                    low-, moderate-, and above moderate-income households shall be a minimum of
                    10% of the total project. The number of affordable units shall be rounded up to
                    a whole number. It is the City’s desire that at least 5 percent of all project units
                    be built as very low-income housing units and at least 5 percent of all project
                    units be built as low-income housing units.
                   The number of affordable ownership and rental units to be produced. Such split
                    shall be approved by the City Council based on housing needs, market

                 conditions, and other relevant factors. The split of ownership and rental units
                 shall be addressed within the plan for each individual project.
                Program options within project-specific Affordable Housing Plans may include,
                 but are not limited to, the following:
                     –       Actual production (on-site or off-site) of affordable units (including
                             ownership and rental opportunities in the form of corner units,
                             halfplexes, duplexes, cottages, creative alternative housing products,
                             etc.).
                     –       Land dedication (on-site and off-site).
                     –       Payment of in-lieu fees.
                The timing for completion of affordable housing obligations. For projects
                 proposing to construct affordable housing units, the City generally supports
                 construction of affordable dwellings concurrent with the construction of market-
                 rate housing when feasible. For projects providing alternative contributions (land
                 dedication, funds, etc.), timing of such contributions shall be identified in the
                 plan, with the expectation that the City will pursue construction of affordable
                 units generally concurrent with construction of project market-rate housing.
                At the City Council’s discretion, land or other contributions provided by
                 developers as specified within project Affordable Housing Plans may be utilized
                 to augment City efforts and the efforts of its nonprofit partners to provide
                 affordable housing opportunities to all income levels throughout the community.
                 The City will pursue supplemental funding to allow affordability to households
                 earning less than 50 percent of area median income.
                In order to ensure the production and preservation of housing affordable to the
                 City’s workforce, no productive, reasonable program or incentive option will be
                 excluded from consideration within project-specific Affordable Housing Plans.
                 Possible incentives may include, but are not limited to:
                     –       Density bonuses
                     –       Fee waivers or deferrals (as reasonably available)
                     –       Expedited processing/priority processing
                     –       Reduced parking standards

                detailed policy direction, standards, and guidelines that encourage mixed-use and
                second-story residential development. The City will continue to promote
                development opportunities in the Town Center, circulate a development handbook
                that describes the permitting process for mixed-use projects, and offer incentives
                such as density bonuses to incentivize mixed-use projects. The City will aim to

                               CLAYTON FACILITY NEEDS
The City of Clayton is expected to have the population of 12,100 by the year 2000. This
includes incorporation of all the land developed within the planning area. The City will
need to provide and maintain facilities for the population stated.
Sewer Facilities
Presently the City of Clayton has limited sanitary sewer service lines supplied by the City
of Concord. The main line, known as the Mountaire line, extends from Olive Drive to
Kirker Pass Road in a southeasterly direction generally following Mount Diablo Creek to
where it intersects with Main Street in Clayton. From there, the line runs through
downtown Clayton, serving a few businesses and residences, and out Marsh Creek Road
to a point in the vicinity of the Seminary where it ends. The size of the line varies from
18 inches to 6 inches within the City limits of Clayton.
Another sewer line, called the Clayton Road line, extends down Clayton Road, across
Kirker Pass and then southerly through the Highlands subdivision until it intersects Pine
Hollow Road. It then follows Pine Hollow Road to the Mitchell Canyon Estates. This
line serves both the Highlands and a portion of Mitchell Canyon Estates.
Portions of Clayton are in transition from septic to sewer, and eventually most homes will
be linked to sewer lines. The Mountaire line currently extends from Concord through
Clayton. The line’s capacity is adequate but will ultimately need to be upgraded by a
parallel line to meet the area’s ultimate demand. All future lines into the City will
connect up with the Mountaire line necessitating a 27-inch total capacity in the Kirker
Pass to Mitchell Canyon Road link.
Exhibit IX-1 will provide a map of all as-built lines and anticipated line extensions. The
City of Concord will not expand existing lines or develop new ones unless there is
additional new development that will pay for it. Main trunk sewer bottlenecks will be
addressed at the time of new development.
Sewage treatment is provided by Central Costa County Sanitation District on a regional
basis. No new plant or plant expansion is anticipated.
Water Facilities
Water facilities include storage, supply, treatment and distribution for residential,
commercial, industrial, public and other urban uses. An adequate water supply is and
will be available to the planning area at least until the year 2000. Water planning for the
area is done by the Contra Costa Water District. The major sources of water are:
1.         The Sacramento River
Community Facilities Element                    Page IX-3                       Revised March 2001

2.         Sacramento River via the Contra Costa Water District Canal.
There is adequate water at the source at present and no problem in supply foreseen in the
future. However, inferior water quality, due mainly to the periodic intrusion of brackish
water into the river system, will be a continuing problem and; there needs to be system
improvements to make water available to all parts of the Town Center. There are two
zones, 4 and 5. Zone 4 tanks include the Murchio tank and the Pine Hollow reservoir.
Zone 5 is fed by the Seminary reservoir and the Kirker Pass reservoir at the Pavilion.
Due to need for fire flow in the downtown area, a pressure regulating valve has been
placed in the downtown area. Flow must be increased to meet demand for commercial
development. This will require construction of a new line fore the Town Center. Exhibit
IX-2 indicates water locations.
Community Facilities Element                   Page IX-4                       Revised March 2001
Drainage
Drainage is an important consideration to an area which is changing in character from
rural to urban facilities since the total run-off becomes greater in quantity and intensity.
The Contra Costa Flood Control and Water Conservation District is a county-wide
organization which provides an overall program for the area especially on major creeks
such as Mt. Diablo, Mitchell and Donner. Drainage problems should be anticipated prior
to development and coordinated with the District. The City of Clayton should develop
local drainage standards.
Community Facilities Element                      Page IX-5                      Revised March 2001
The City of Clayton has entered into the Federal Emergency Management Agency
program for flood insurance discussed in the Safety/Seismic Safety Element. The
analysis of the 100-Year Flood does not provide adequate information for local drainage
problems associated with future development. Future needs must be incorporated in the
analysis of channel work needed. Exhibit IX-3 provides information regarding Clayton’s
watershed.
Fire Stations
Fire protection is provided within the study area by the Contra Costa County
Consolidated Fire District. The District has a two-pumper unit station located at Clayton
and Mitchell Canyon Roads at the present time. The standards established by the District
serve as a guide to the placement of future stations in areas where development is
relatively low. One fire station (with a pumper unit and crew) should be expected to
serve an area within a 5-minute response time.
Community Facilities Element                   Page IX-6                      Revised March 2001

The District has undertaken some preliminary planning that may result in the relocation
of the existing fire station in Clayton to a site closer to Kirker Pass and Concord
Boulevard to provide better and more economical area coverage with relation to other
existing stations. If the District were to pursue this relocation, it could not occur until
Keller Ranch development was approved. Development of the planning area at the
proposed densities will require that a new station be located in the planning area. The
General Plan recommends the future station to be located in the general vicinity of Marsh
Creek Road and the proposed extension of Concord Boulevard.
                                                    [Amended by Resolution No. 21-87, dated 5/6/87]
Fire station locations are based on studies undertaken to minimize the conflict with
barriers such as freeways, hills, and the creeks. The stations should be located on major
streets with good access and multiple direction possibilities. However, because of
potential congestion, they should be located away from intersections of major roads.
School Needs
This topic represents an area with a high potential for controversy between the City of
Clayton and the Mt. Diablo School district. At present the only school facility in Clayton
is Mt. Diablo Elementary School, located at 5880 Mt. Zion Drive. It has slightly over
800 students. Junior high students attend Pine Hollow Intermediate School, located on
Pine Hollow Road just outside the City limits. High school students attend Clayton
Valley High School, located on Alberta Way in Concord, approximately 2 1/3 miles from
the Town Center area.
Mt. Diablo Elementary School does not have the capacity to meet the growth of Clayton.
 There are no future school sites planned in Clayton. Future capacity should be located in
schools in Concord according to one philosophy.
The reduction in funds for schools, shifting population levels and declining enrollment in
inner city schools have created the posture of reallocating students to available facilities
rather than constructing new facilities. Based on this, the concept of community schools
or children walking to the school in their neighborhood may no longer feasible.
The size of Clayton and its facility limitations makes it important to have central
community facilities such as schools to provide information, reinforce the sense of
community and create a feeling of place for children.
                                                    [Amended by Resolution No. 21-87, dated 5/6/87]
The allocation of school facilities for Clayton must be viewed in the long term. As a
potential community of 12,000 people there is great opportunity for the community’s
support for the schools as well as full-time utilization of school facilities. Mt. Diablo
Elementary receives greater community use than any other facility in the District. There
is high community concern for the school’s welfare and greater potential for community
contribution toward enhancement of the facility and its operation. It will be necessary to
Community Facilities Element                     Page IX-7                          Revised March 2001

suggest and investigate alternatives to retain the opportunity of community elementary
schools. Clayton and the School district should be open to suggestions and mindful of
each others needs.
Traditional child care has been the domain of the mother, relatives or hired nannies. As
women have sought to establish careers outside the relatively short child rearing years,
both the traditional at home care and career goals have overlapped, creating a need for
qualified, convenient and affordable child care services.
An increase in single parent households has increased in recent years creating a demand
for child care.
The trend for women and careers and changes in traditional family structure require child
care services to be provided within the community. Current child care providers in
Clayton and nearby communities have waiting lists. School age children have few
choices for after school care.
Parents require child care facilities located near their homes or work or the child’s
school. The Oakhurst Project is providing a site for a preschool/child care facility. The
commercial development of the Oakhurst Project may require child care facilities.
Cooperation and assistance from all segments of the community, including, but not
limited to developers, employers, private foundations, public entities and agencies are
needed to address the existing and future needs for child care facilities.
Major Clayton development is limited to Oakhurst buildout. Buildout within the General
Plan 2000 will be for small to medium development. Many parcels are zoned for
multifamily, which provide an opportunity to encourage
child care facilities and programs. Commercial
development should provide similar facilities
and programs. The use of child care fees
and conditions of development approval
may be necessary to meet the needs
of the community. [Added by Resolution

Public Facilities
Exhibit IX-5 indicates the land area owned by the City. This area is divided between
open space areas and facilities.
Acquisition of Sites
Sites may need to be acquired for schools, parks or other public facilities needs to be
supported. For instance, in event the fire station on Clayton Road is relocated, the City
should acquire the present facility for a library or other public facility.
City Hall
The structure is 2,400 square feet in size and provides facilities for City staff and the
Police Department.
Community Facilities Element                    Page IX-12                        Revised March 2001
Library
The County Library Administration Office acknowledges the lack of adequate library
service in the southeast Concord-Clayton area, and has set as one of the top priorities
additional service to this general area.
The basic criteria for the establishment of a library outlet in a community is that the
library system furnish adequate library service in response to the facility furnished by the
City. Generally a 1.5 to 2 acre site is required by the County, located on a well-traveled
arterial. Most sites are in the proximity of schools. The County standard used to
determine facility size is one square foot of total floor space for each two persons in the
service area. Coupled with other County library system services, such as bookmobile
service, central depository and referencing facilities, Clayton should plan for a local
library facility of 15,000 to 20,000 square feet. Public-owned land or land dedicated for
public purpose should be considered for a library site.
Cultural Center
The construction of a community facility that would include a library, meeting rooms and
other features located in the Town Center would create a focal point for the community.

                      Section VIII
                  NOISE ELEMENT
GOALS, OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
                    THE EFFECT OF NOISE
          NOISE PROBLEMS IN THE CITY OF CLAYTON
                                        NOISE ELEMENT
Goal
To maintain or improve the overall environment and the general well being of the
community by reducing annoying levels of noise for all land uses in the city. Physically
harmful levels of noise (70 Ldn* and above) shall be mitigated to below harmful levels
and to levels of minimum annoyance (below 60 Ldn) where feasible.
Objective 1
To identify routes in Clayton with high levels of noise.
Policies
1a         Prepare noise contour maps for Kirker Pass Road, Clayton Road, Marsh Creek
           Road, Mitchell Canyon Road, Concord Boulevard, Main Street, El Molino, Pine
           Hollow Road, Oak Street, Mountaire Parkway, and Regency Drive. These maps
           are needed as a new baseline to reflect changes in noise levels due to the
           significant growth which has occurred since the last General Plan revision.
1b         Identify future routes with potential for significant levels of noise. Noise contour
           maps for these routes should be prepared when development is proposed which
           will affect noise levels on the routes.
Objective 2
To establish mitigation measures for reducing exposure to traffic noise.
Policies
2a         Require sound mitigation to 45 Ldn for indoor noise level uses and 60 Ldn for
           outdoor noise level uses in new developments.
2b         Require setbacks, sound walls, specific orientation and other measures where new
           uses are exposed to noise. Such measures shall be consistent with the intent of
           the Community Design Element.
2c         Permit noise attenuation measures that do not create traffic hazards along South
           Mitchell Canyon Road and Clayton Road and retain limited hours of trucking
           operations on weekdays from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM with no activity on weekends.
            Hours may be exceeded in event of emergency with prior city authorization.
2d         Require developer to conduct noise studies to determine an appropriate noise
           reduction plan in event development is proposed in areas where roadway or fixed
           point sources exceed 60 Ldn.
* Ldn and dBa definitions are provided in the Glossary, Section XII.
Noise Element                                      Page VIII-2                           March 2000
Objective 3
To provide control of fixed point sources.
Policies
3a         Encourage Concord Pavilion not to generate noise in excess of 60 dBa in Clayton.
3b         Limit construction activities to the hours of 7:00 AM to 5:30 PM on weekdays
           and 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM on weekends when adjacent neighbors are affected.
3c         Restrict home sound equipment noise in excess of 55 Ldn at the property line.
3d         Restrict operation of home power equipment before 7:00 AM to after 10:00 PM at
           a noise level above 55 Ldn at the property line.
3e         Consider an ordinance to reduce the nuisance effects of unattended pets.
Implementation Measures
1.         Adopt mitigation measures for affected areas.
2.         Provide information and assistance in measures to mitigation noise.
3.         Adopt and enforce noise control ordinances.
                                     THE EFFECT OF NOISE
Noise affects people in three ways:
1.         It is detrimental to their health.
2.         It interferes with their activities.
3.         It reduces their economic potential.
Noise can affect the health of people to a widely varying extent, depending on the
intensity. The impact can range from mildly involuntary physiological reactions to a
permanent injury or even death.
Noise interferes with human activities in a variety of ways, intruding upon the total
quality of life. Perhaps one of the more serious problems is disturbance of sleep; specific
sound levels for this effect have been established. Noise can also interfere with cultural
or leisure activities. For example, it detracts from the appreciation of park land, historic
sites and other outdoor activities.
Noise Element                                     Page VIII-3                         March 2000
Noise can have several effects with social or economic implications. These include
productivity for workers and students in both their jobs and in the schoolroom, as well as
indemnity payments for work-related hearing loss. The value of residential property can
be adversely affected by noise and result in reduced livability, reduced saleability,
transition from owner to renter status, conversion to nonresidential uses, and pressure for
zone change.
                  NOISE PROBLEMS IN THE CITY OF CLAYTON
The sources of adverse noise in Clayton can be separated into two categories, mobile (or
line) sources, and fixed point sources. The mobile sources include the major through
streets and, in particular, the route followed by the gravel trucks from the Lone Star
Industries Quarry.
Mobile or Line Noise Sources
Exhibit VIII-1 indicates noise contours for the City of Clayton based on monitoring in
January 1985. Exhibit VIII-2 provides projected contours based on anticipated short-
term growth. The monitoring and contours verify common knowledge in Clayton.
Points for development of contours are indicated in Exhibit VIII-3.
Truck and automobile traffic are the most common sources of noise in the City, and the
predominate source of this noise that of the gravel trucks going to and from the quarry.
Noise Element                                   Page VIII-4                           March 2000
Gravel truck noise is characterized by fluctuation in frequency and duration. These
changes are caused by the varying demands for the aggregates extracted by the quarry
and the consequent variations in the amount of gravel truck traffic. Truck noise is further
characterized by the fact that it occurs along a specific route, and the noise problems of
the community are intense along this route.
Truck and automobile noise are additionally intensified in the City because of the
existing crosstown thoroughfare, Clayton Road, which must serve as the truck as well as
passenger car through route to eastern Contra Costa County. There appears to be no
alternative truck route in the future.
Further compounding the problem of mobile noise along Clayton Road is the fact that
this street must serve as the only through access for emergency vehicles with the
attendant siren noise.
Noise Element                                  Page VIII-5                           March 2000
It should be noted that the identification, measurement, and examination of noise
problems, whether from mobile or fixed point sources, is critical to the considerations of
future land use planning. While problems for people who live in the existing homes may
be minimized by the enforcement of the proposed ordinance, the problems of noise for
future residents can better be addressed by appropriate planning and design. There have
been two complaints regarding noise of Clayton Road in the past year. Based on noise
contours it can be estimated that two parcels fall within the existing 70 Ldn contour and
51 parcels will fall within the contours projected for 1995. A total of 143 parcels
currently fall between the 70 and 60 Ldn contour and 109 parcels will fall within the
contour at 1995 levels. These contours identify base noise levels. They do not take into
account mounding, changes in elevation, walls or other measures that will affect noise
factors for specific homes. Individual homes can benefit from element information in
general but site specific monitoring is necessary prior to action. Noise prediction will be
affected by future population levels, street design and vehicle equipment standards.
Concord Boulevard will not be included until population is projected.
Data deriving from the survey are presented in Appendix F. Previous noise study data is
also included.
Noise Element                                  Page VIII-6                          March 2000
Critical Routes
The areas where existing and/or potential noise impacts are determined to have
potentially severe impact on individuals that can be classified as critical are as follows:
1.         The Clayton Road-Marsh Creek Road thoroughfare including the Main Street
           traffic through the Town Center area of Clayton.
2.         Mitchell Canyon Road, which is the gravel truck route from Lone Star Quarry.
           The proposed Concord Boulevard extension between Silver Creek II subdivision
           and the intersection with Marsh Creek Road.
3.         The proposed extension of Marsh Creek Road to the connection with the Concord
           Boulevard extension just east of the downtown area.
4.         The proposed extension of Center Street to connect with the Concord Boulevard
           extension.
5.         Other areas of the City in close enough proximity to a street where traffic noise
           generation is deemed likely to produce exterior noise levels of 60 or more dBa,
           considering the maximum traffic volume expected.
Noise Element                                    Page VIII-7                            March 2000
Characteristics of Mobile Source
1.         In numerous instances there was wide variation in the amount of noise produced
           by motor vehicles moving at the same speed.
           a.      Motorcycles, especially the two-cycle type, often produce more noise than
                   gravel trucks.
           b.      The amount of noise produced by the same size trucks can carry greatly,
                   depending upon the mechanical condition of noise muffling equipment,
                   and the design and condition of tires.
           c.      Passenger cars and pickup trucks equipped with special tires for snow and
                   mud sometimes produce as much noise as gravel trucks.
2.         Speed of the vehicle is closely related to the amount of noise produced, with
           increase from 25 mph to 35 mph causing a noise level increase of 4 or 5 decibels.
3.         Noise levels at stop signs are significantly higher in location having considerable
           truck traffic, due to braking, gear changing, and acceleration noises.
4.         Siren noises from emergency vehicles, especially ambulances, are a significant
           source of noise, particularly along Clayton Road.
Fixed Point Noise Sources
The two most prominent fixed point sources of noise in the Clayton area are located
outside the Clayton city limits. They include the Concord Pavilion and the Lone Star
Quarry. In both cases the city limits are over 1,000 feet away. Vibration from the
Concord Pavilion can be heard in the evenings when the performers use powerful
amplifying equipment. The configuration of the land may magnify the problem for
Clayton residents somewhat distant from the source, while Concord residents in homes
close to the Concord Pavilion may find the problem more acute. The nature of future
programming, including the type of entertainment, amplification of the sound, and the
positioning of loudspeakers, promises to influence the extent of this problem.
Complaints will first come from Concord residences; however, Keller development near
the Concord Pavilion should conduct noise analysis to determine the extent of this
problem and development-wide and parcel-specific mitigation.
Operational noise from the two quarries in the vicinity of Clayton are generated by
blasting in the course of excavating, and by machinery used in conveying, loading, and
crushing the rock. The sound of blasting is infrequent. Normally a two-week period
within six months will produce a single blast per day. The noise startles people and they
call City Hall, but it is not continuous. Posting of blast schedules would help this
problem. Machinery that is used to crush rock runs continuously during quarry hours (7
AM to 4 PM on weekdays). It is a vibration noise that can be perceived in Clayton but
does not exceed noise standards. Development of vacant parcels within city limits that
are near the quarry would increase resident exposure to noise. Unless adequate
mitigation or change in quarry operations occur, residential development near the quarry
should be prohibited. Mobile source noise from gravel trucks has been effectively
limited to specified hours. Other fixed point sources of noise generally fall into the
category of those which are problems for residents in the more immediate vicinity of the
source.
Noise Element                                      Page VIII-8                          March 2000
They may include, but are not limited to the following:
1.         Sound reproducing and amplifying equipment such as music (live or recorded)
           amplifiers, radios, and television sets.
2.         Construction noises resulting from the numerous home-building projects in the
           community.
3.         Barking dogs, which sometimes intrude upon peace and quiet and the rest of
           nearby residents.
4.         Homeowner-operated power equipment, such as saws, mowers, tillers, etc.
Mitigation Measures
1.         New developments, consideration of the noise impacts upon present and future
           residents must be an essential part of the environmental impact reporting and
           acceptance process. Mitigation measures which assure that the development will
           conform to State and local standards shall be required and enforced.
           Where new residential construction is proposed within an area identified as
           critical, a noise study together with acceptable plans to assure compliance with
           the standards shall be required. Required noise studies should be done
           simultaneously with or as part of the EIR preparation and planning process to
           assure that the results and recommendations will be incorporated into the project
           proposal, including the grading plan, street layout, height of buildings, orientation
           and design of buildings, design and elevation of noise barriers required, and any
           other elements of planning and design that may be related to the noise impacts.
2.         In the case of major changes to existing streets, the noise impacts upon the
           residents in the area will be considered. These impacts should be determined by a
           noise study provided by the City with appropriate requirements for mitigation.
3.         It is recommended that representatives of the Police Department, Fire
           Department, and local ambulance services meet for the purpose of establishing
           criteria for the use of emergency vehicle sirens. The aim of the criteria should be
           to prevent the indiscriminate or unnecessary use of sirens, while maintaining safe
           practices.
4.         The City, through the Police Department should vigorously pursue the
           enforcement of the California Motor Vehicle Code with regard to illegal
           operation and equipment of vehicles.
5.         In the case of locating and developing noise sensitive recreational areas and
           activities, the City should be cognizant of the existing and potential noise impacts,
           recognizing that a dBa of 55 is the level at which most noise begins to interfere
           with outdoor activity. Conversely, introducing outdoor recreational activity may
           produce noise which could annoy residents.
Noise Element                                       Page VIII-9                          March 2000
6.         A source of noise which could present a potentially significant problem for
           Clayton is the Concord Pavilion, as previously mentioned. The location of the
           Concord Pavilion being outside the legal jurisdiction of Clayton, but the potential
           effects of the noise falling inside the City, presents a possible future problem.
           The City should research all avenues of mitigation available, including seeking
           the utmost cooperation with those in charge of the programming, levels of
           amplification, and any other factors contributing to the potential for noise
           problems for people in Clayton. At the same time Clayton must use design
           measures to prevent unnecessary exposure to noise.
7.         Construction in critical noise areas should be preceded by acceptable noise
           mitigation measures including recommendations for changes in elevations,
           setbacks, construction of effective noise barriers, and any other items deemed to
           be necessary in an attempt to achieve the standard of less than 60 dBa in
           residential yard areas.
Ordinance/ Enforcement
The City should enact a comprehensive noise control ordinance. It is suggested that
Model Community Noise Ordinances, written by the California Office of Noise Control
be adapted to apply specifically to Clayton. The noise ordinance should contain
regulations and standards including, but not limited to the following:
1.         The exterior noise level of 60 dBa as the maximum allowable traffic noise for
           homes in areas of new construction. This standard should be based upon the
           predicted noise level for the maximum traffic flow expected through the area.
2.         Regulate construction activities so as to provide relative quiet during the more
           sensitive evening and early morning periods.
3.         Regulate the design and construction of public projects so as to cause as little as
           practical long-term noise inconvenience to existing residents.
4.         Require acoustical studies for major residential projects as required by the State
           of California, pursuant to the critical areas reflected in this element.
5.         Prepare a noise abatement program consistent with State and Federal guidelines,
           which is (a)legally valid, (b) not unduly costly, and (c) does not impose undue
           hardships on landowners.
6.         Require construction and maintenance of noise barriers at standards that do not
           permit gaps and cracks in protection.

          and resale of property, district formation and scenic easements.
5.        Identify distinctive natural and manmade features such as ridgelines, landmark
          trees, arroyos and rock outcroppings to be preserved.
                             OPEN SPACE/ CONSERVATION SETTING
Clayton is located at the base of the north slope of Mt. Diablo. The Clayton Planning
Area is bounded to the south by Mt. Diablo State Park and to the northeast by Black
Diamond Regional Preserve. The northern and western boundaries are shared with
Concord. In general, growth for the City of Clayton must be directed east. The
northeastern area and the eastern area beyond the planning area include rugged terrain
with many sites designated by the County as Agriculture.
Several natural creeks run through Clayton that have been integrated into a greenbelt
system of parks. This system allows park site expansion and connection to park facilities
at points throughout the system.                                               (Revised 6/28/95)
Open Space/ Conservation Element                   Page VI-3                           March 2000
                            CONSERVATION ISSUES AND CONCERNS
The size and location of the City of Clayton preclude many conservation concerns
identified in Section 65302(d) of the Government Code. For instance, within the General
Plan area of Clayton there is negligible hydraulic force to creeks; and there is no potential
for harbor, fishing or marina. Within the planning area one can find varying soils,
hillsides, creeks, woodland, a rock quarry and land subject to flooding.
When Clayton incorporated in 1964, the measure was largely fueled by the desire to
protect the city’s natural scenic resources. The City’s conservation effort has focused on
protecting the riparian corridor, limiting development on the Keller Ranch to less than
half the site, and promoting acquisition of land to the State Park.
In 1973 the City adopted its Master Trails Plan as an addition to the Recreation, Parks
and Open Space Element of the Clayton General Plan. Since then information was
updated by Contra Costa County in order to extend the Clayton Trails Plan to
development areas considered by the county.
The initial purpose of the plan was to provide riding and hiking trails for Clayton area
residents. The effect of this action was to preserve a riparian corridor for three creeks
beginning at the city limits of Clayton and terminating at the Mt. Diablo State Park.
Naturally, the alignment of the creeks through the Town Center will be difficult but the
remainder of the alignment on Mt. Diablo, Donner, Mitchell and potentially on Peacock
Creek will be preserved.
The City owns title or has easement rights to most of the creeks and measure will be
taken to acquire land to develop an unbroken chain of access from the City limits to the
State Park. Specific locations of creeks, rights-of-way and easements is available at the
Clayton City office. Riparian corridor protection provides protection to the entire
watershed.
In the course of development of Keller Ranch and any smaller parcels, strict development
control will be provided to prevent stream pollution or flooding. Flood improvements
will be made in conjunction with the County Flood Control District and will be funded
by developer fees and public measures such as a redevelopment agency or grant
programs.
As indicated in the Safety Element, the City of Clayton is a participant in the Federal
Emergency Management Agency Flood Control Program. As new areas annex, the City
will extend engineering to those areas.
Both creek bank and foothill erosion are problems of concern to Clayton. In both cases
vegetation and construction solutions are employed. New developments are required to
implement erosion control plans and bank work along the creeks is periodically
undertaken to limit loss of land and sedimentation.
                                                                              (Revised 6/28/95)
Open Space/ Conservation Element               Page VI-4                              March 2000

The Lone Star quarry lies within Clayton’s planning area but not its jurisdiction. The
quarry was established in 1949 and sells varying sizes of high grade rock to independent
contractors. There is very little complaint about the quarry because development has
been limited in its direct vicinity. There is continuous complaint about the trucks due to
noise, speeding and rock spill. Clayton has been working with the quarry to remedy
those problems. Clayton is also aware of the regulatory and protectionary measures
granted the quarry by the Department of Mines and Geology.
                                      OPEN SPACE ISSUES
The City of Clayton occupies approximately 2,400 acres of land. The Clayton Sphere of
Influence extends to 3,800 acres of land. Within Clayton, open space falls into four
categories: public park/open space, private open space, quarry and agriculture. Open
space is necessary to the community despite the fact that it does not promote maximum
feasible development intimated by the Housing Element. It is easy to see in this case that
without striking balance, the State’s conflicting intent between open space and housing
elements could force a jurisdiction into a conflict situation. In Clayton’s case, the
balance occurs by selecting infill lots and portions of large parcels that can most feasibly
be developed while preserving creeks, view corridors, and areas of greatest geologic
limitation.
As indicated in the previous section, the City has had a policy from incorporation to
protect its creeks from development to the extent possible through dedication,
acquisition, easement and design. The policy has been implemented at every approval.
Standards for active open spaces within Clayton are as follows:
          Developed Parks                                      3 acres per 1,000 population
          (athletic fields, picnic areas, tot lots, etc.)
          Maintained Open Spaces                               7 Acres per 1,000 population
          (greenbelt and trails, etc.)
          Total Active Open Spaces                             10 Acres per 1,000 population
Open Space/ Conservation Element                     Page VI-5                              March 2000

                                   OPEN SPACE DESIGNATIONS
The City of Clayton seeks to preserve open space and provide recreational opportunities
to Clayton residents within the City limits. Four designations have been created to fulfill
these goals: Private Open Space, Public Park/Open Space, Quarry and Agriculture. The
following text describes these four categories:
1.        Private Open Space (PR)
          This designation includes privately-owned open spaces. Typical examples in
          Clayton include the Oakhurst golf course and areas where development has been
          clustered to retain open space. Other examples include private recreational
          facilities such as the riding club southeast of Clayton, the swimming pools at
          Marsh Creek Park Villas and Dana Hills, and the open space within Dana Hills
          and Westwood. These facilities allow individuals to expand their recreational
          opportunities at cost and benefit to the users rather than the public at large. Such
          facilities should be promoted so long as traffic, noise and other related impacts
          are mitigated.
          Only open space development, recreation and preservation uses are allowed in
          this designation. Owners’ potential rights to other types of development on these
          properties have been clustered on adjoining parts of some parcels.
2.        Public Park/Open Space/Open Space and Recreational (PU)
          This designation applies to open space and recreational lands under City, County
          or State jurisdiction. Such uses within the planning area include City-owned open
          space areas and developed neighborhood and community parks, creek corridors,
          Mt. Diablo State Park, and the Open Space areas within the Oakhurst subdivision
          (dedicated to the City). Allowable uses in this designation include trails,
          greenbelts, playfields and parks, as well as accessory structures and uses normally
          auxiliary to them.
          a.         Regional Parks
                     Regional and State Parks offer a wide range of park and recreational
                     facilities intended to serve large sections of population living in a
                     metropolitan area. These parks generally provide for all-day or weekend
                     visitors, contrasted with local parks, which are designed for shorter, more
                     frequent use. There are fifteen regional/State parks located within an
                     hour’s drive of Clayton.
                     Some of the most beautiful and desirable areas in Mt. Diablo State Park
                     are in the northern portion, adjacent to Clayton. The City will encourage
                     the State to acquire land to the extent possible along the southern border
                     of Clayton. The City will cooperate with the State in providing access to
                                                                                    (Revised 6/28/95)
Open Space/ Conservation Element                      Page VI-6                             March 2000

                     these facilities. To the northeast of Clayton lies Black Diamond Regional
                     Preserve that is under the authority of the East Bay Regional Park District
                     (EBRPD). The District has closed the Nortonville Road, which provided
                     vehicular access to this facility, for security purposes. The trail is open to
                     pedestrians, horses and bicycles. The County road extends from the Black
                     Diamond Regional Preserve to the City limits of Clayton. Public right-of-
                     way does extend south to Mt. Diablo State Park. It is possible to establish
                     a trail/corridor between Mt. Diablo State Park and Black Diamond
                     Regional Preserve that would be under the authority of the East Bay
                     Regional Park District. Such trail/corridor would provide a physical and
                     conceptual linkage between the regional parks and the City’s system of
                     greenbelts.
          b.         Greenbelts
                     Greenbelts occur as a result of creek preservation and provide an
                     elongated or linear space incorporated into natural land forms along creeks
                     and other predominant natural features. Greenbelts provide pathway areas
                     for pedestrian, equestrian and bicycle travel. The pathways provide
                     passive recreation. Additions can be made to the greenbelts to provide
                     active recreation. Picnic areas, par courses and other facilities can be built
                     into the systems through funds generated by new development,
                     government programs and regional park programs. The greenbelts also
                     function as connections between major recreational facilities, residential
                     neighborhoods, commercial areas and school sites. Greenbelts are
                     acquired as flood control setback, as open space through density transfer
                     in PUD’s, though parkland dedication and through purchase by public
                     agencies.
                     Housing along greenbelts should have sufficient setback and site planning
                     so that greenbelts provide access to local streets, allow adequate police
                     protection and prevent a “boxed in” feeling or appearance.
          c.         Community Park
                     The City has recently developed a 20 acre Ballfields/Community Park
                     Complex. This complex provides three combination baseball/soccer fields
                     and a fourth soccer field. The complex also has sports related facilities
                     (parking, restrooms, concessions) and active play areas (picnic areas, play
                     structures, tot lots). This park is adjacent to Diablo View Middle School
                     and there is a joint use agreement for the fourth soccer field. Such joint
                     use opportunities between park and school use should continue to be
                     pursued in the planning and development of any new school facilities.
                                                                                    (Revised 6/28/95)
Open Space/ Conservation Element                      Page VI-7                              March 2000

          d.         Neighborhood Park
                     Neighborhood parks most commonly range in size from 3 to 5 acres.
                     They provide play equipment for children, paved courts, picnic tables,
                     benches and fields for team play. The neighborhood park function under
                     this description is fulfilled by the Lydia Lane Park and the playfield of Mt.
                     Diablo Elementary School. Neighborhood park facilities include play
                     equipment for children, paved courts, par courses, picnic tables, benches
                     and fields for team play.
                     Some standard park facilities should be added to the greenbelt system.
                     Facility areas will form activity nodes or concentrations within the passive
                     system that will generate additional use.
3.        Quarry (Q)
          Uses allowed under this designation include quarries and accessory structures and
          uses normally auxiliary to them.
          There are no quarries located within the City limits of Clayton; however, the Lone
          Star quarry is located on the southwestern edge of the community. The quarry
          produces high quality rock and gravel and the quarry has an expected life in
          excess of 50 years. There are two negative impacts generated by quarry
          operation. First, there are occasional blasts to separate the rock and secondly,
          there is an average of 160 trucks per day traveling along Mitchell Canyon Road.
          This figure is based on information obtained from Lone Star Quarry. The quarry
          has taken a series of measures to mitigate its effect upon Clayton.
          The quarry is designated as a State resource and cannot be curtailed by local
          action. It is important to consider the effects of proximity to the quarry prior to
          granting any change in adjacent land use.
4.        Agriculture (AG)
          Many land owners in the Clayton planning area have entered into the Williamson
          Act contract with Contra Costa County. The contracts are self-perpetuating 10-
          year agreements that preclude non-agricultural development. Use of these County
          designations will reinforce the Preserve Designation used by the County and
          promote a conservation context to future development analysis on these sites.
          Acres to the northeast and east of the City limits include rugged terrain that is
          primarily used as rangeland for livestock and other similar open uses. The City
          supports and encourages the continuation of agriculture in these areas. Given the
          low intensity of agricultural activities, the City encourages large lot zoning of at
          least 20 to 40 acres to ensure agriculturally viable sized lots.
                                                                                   (Revised 6/28/95)
Open Space/ Conservation Element                       Page VI-8                           March 2000
          The purpose of the Agriculture designation is to preserve and protect lands
          capable of and generally used for the production of food, fiber and plant

                              RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
As a major physical landform within the City, greenbelt concepts extend to policies
within land use, circulation, safety/ seismic safety, community design and town center
elements.
The greenbelt system must be integrated with the City’s circulation system as a
secondary non-motorized route. The greenbelt will augment scenic routes by providing
landscape borders and corridors.
The greenbelt system is integrated with
areas of hazard or development
limitation identified in Open Space and
Safety Element. The greenbelts provide
a major factor in community design and in
directing focus into the town center.
The use of the Open Space designation
will provide support for the consistency
with Safety Elements and Scenic Highway Elements.                        (Revised 6/28/95)

5/6/87)
                               GEOLOGIC SAFETY SETTING
The undeveloped regions of Clayton contain a number of potential geological hazards.
These include slopes with unstable expansive soil, high erosion potential, evidence of
springs, mudflow potential, rockslide potential and evidence of significant creep.
While landslides may occur on slopes of 15% or less in unstable areas, the risk increases
with steepness of slopes. Areas of old slide deposits are most subject to continued
failure. Areas of potential slope hazard are indicated in Exhibit VII-1.
Grading without engineered requirements tends to reduce slope stability so that road cuts
and the cut-and-fill pads typically prepared for hillside housing carry a greater risk of
slope failure than undisturbed hillsides. However, fill slopes engineered to today’s
standards may result in a more stable situation than in nature, particularly where smaller
slide deposits are improved or arrested.
Level to 15% slopes may be found in the downtown Clayton area, and to the area
immediately northeast of Clayton Road. Much of this area lies on alluvial-type soil,
which can amplify ground shaking. The seismic activity possible from area faults and the
reaction of alluvial soils should by considered and studied in detail for any proposed
development in these areas.
The foothill areas of Clayton contain slope stability problems which may be triggered by
improper grading. In addition, foothill areas may experience local slope erosion,
sedimentation or drainage problems, expansive soil reaction and other development
limitations requiring corrective measures prior to any grading or construction. Ground
rupture or slides along the general existing or suspected fault lines is also a possibility.
In slope areas greater than 15%, density should remain low. Development should be
restricted by City policy for major slope areas in excess of 26%. Some development and
slope correction will be permitted on slopes over 26% within the Keller Ranch and within
the Marsh Creek Road Specific Plan areas subject to site-specific city review and the
demonstration that such development is in conformity with any Specific Plan or other
detailed conditions developed for the subject area, the development is not visible when
viewed from developed portions of the City or from major road corridors, development
does not intrude on the visual integrity of Mt. Diablo, and the development does not
displace any sensitive plant or animal species, riparian corridors or wetlands. In no case
will development be allowed on slopes in excess of 40%.
                                                                                (Revised 6/28/95)

                        MEASURES OF SEISMIC ACTIVITY
Earthquakes are measured in two ways, by their physical effects and by the amount of
energy released. The scale used to measure intensity (physical effects) of an earthquake
is the Modified Mercalli Scale, and the scale used to measure the magnitude of
earthquakes (energy released) is the Richter Scale. Mercalli and Richter scales will be
described in greater detail in Appendix E.
The intensity of the physical effects of earthquakes are based on human reactions. At the
low end of the Modified Mercalli Scale is the reaction “felt indoors.”
Safety Element                                 Page VII-9                          March 2000

                    SEISMIC ACTIVITY AFFECTING CLAYTON
The probability of an earthquake originating in Contra Costa County that is “felt indoors”
is low to intermediate. Solid ground or rock tends to lessen ground motion due to
earthquakes, while poorly consolidated or water-saturated soils tend to amplify it. The
probability of earthquake effect must be measured against the bedrock and soils outlined
above. Areas sitting on hard bedrock, such as the Mt. Diablo range, can be expected to
perform satisfactorily under earthquake conditions, except where steep slopes, exposed or
sheared surfaces and relatively unconsolidated soils might make slumping or landslides
possible. The potential for physical effects is more highly probable as a result of
earthquakes originating outside the County.
The most critical faults locally, according to Woodward and Lundgren, are the San
Andreas, Calaveras and Hayward faults, due to their recent activity and energy potential.
 Nevertheless, the Antioch and Concord faults recently have produced damaging
earthquakes, the latter with a 5.4 magnitude in 1955. Prominent faults of undetermined
status include the Pinole, Bollinger, Las Trampas, Frankling, South Hampton, Clayton-
Marsh Creek, Midland, and Mt. Diablo Faults (see Exhibit VII-2). These faults have
shown inconclusive signs of activity or are associated with geologic processes and
features which could result in earthquakes.
In addition there is a system of radial and concentric faults surrounding Mt. Diablo not
known to be active but were created by the mountain uplift. This process still continues
and its effects may become more pronounced.
The Concord fault is known to be active. It is a creeping fault, and small to moderate
quakes are possible along the fault, with the capability of a 7+ magnitude.
Clayton Valley does contain alluviated areas which could amplify ground shaking in the
event the Concord fault shifts. The entire area is considered seismically active, and the
development plans should reflect this risk factor. Soil types, topography and bedrock
may serve to heighten risk or dampen it. The presence of contained water bodies within
these seismically active areas raises seiches as potential hazards, which should also be
addressed in development plans. The Clayton fault alignment is indicated in Exhibit VII-
3. The fault is not classified as active; however, there is preliminary evidence that the
fault may have displaced recent landslide materials. Due to this the fault should be
treated as active unless evidence proves otherwise. The fault does not fall within the
Alquist-Priolo requirements.
Seismic activity is presented in greater detail in Appendix E.

                                 FLOODING IN CLAYTON
The principal stream running through Clayton is Mt. Diablo Creek. It originates on the
steep north slopes of the 3,849 foot Mt. Diablo. Mt. Diablo Creek drains a watershed of
approximately 30 square miles. It flows northerly and westerly through the cities of
Clayton and Concord, the Concord Naval Weapons Station and eventually empties into
Suisun Bay. In the City of Clayton, Mt. Diablo Creek is joined by Donner and Mitchell
creeks, both of which originate on the slopes of Mt. Diablo and by Peacock Creek, which
flows from the Keller Ridge.
Flooding has occurred from Mt. Diablo Creek in the Town Center area of Clayton and in
the flood plain between Clayton Road and Kirker Pass Road. The major floods affecting
this area occurred in 1938, 1952, 1955 and 1963. The 1955 and 1963 floods both were
estimated as 25-year floods.
Despite these occurrences, Mt. Diablo Creek is not considered a creek with a high flood
history. Part of the reason for this is due to the long flood plain between Mt. Diablo
slopes and the City limits that serves to slow down velocity and delay peak flows.
As the Mt. Diablo Creek watershed continues to develop, the potential for serious
flooding increases. The proposed plan of improvements aims to accommodate the
increased flows and prevent flooding. Contra Costa Flood Control District studies show
that, although much of Mt. Diablo Creek has a 1,500 to 2,000 cfs (cubic feet per second)
capacity, in some areas its capacity is as low as 500 cfs. Within the City of Clayton,
flood waters are confined by berms and hills and directed back to the creek. There are no
stream-gauging stations along Mt. Diablo Creek, therefore, no historical stream runoff
data is available. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has developed
flood plain management maps which predict that, given the present level of watershed
development, a “100 year frequency” runoff event (a chance of one occurrence in a
hundred years) will have a peak of 4,060 cfs at Kirker Pass Road (see Exhibit VII-4). On
the basis of rainfall data and known characteristics of the watershed, a “synthetic flood
hydrograph” has been computed. The development level of the watershed was estimated
to the year 2030, using the General Plans of the cities of Clayton and Concord. Based on
the above data, the estimated peak flows at Bailey Road in Concord are 6,420 cfs and
7,170 cfs for the 50-year and 100-year runoff events (see Exhibit VII-5).
Mt. Diablo Creek, within its confined limits, is already incapable of providing adequate
flood protection. Even if land development within the watershed came to a complete
halt, the statistical probability of serious flooding would be considerable. The limitation
of land development, the utilization of flood plains, and the construction of engineered
improvements are the most useful methods for controlling floods.
No serious problems have occurred to date but unless some type of flood control project
is undertaken in the near future, the limited capacity of Mt. Diablo Creek will soon cause
serious flooding problems.

Flood Protection Measures
The primary objective of flood protection measures is to modify Mt. Diablo Creek to
provide sufficient capacity to carry the estimated 50-year frequency runoff event with
standard freeboard and the 100-year event without overtopping the banks. Other
objectives include the following:
a.         Keep the extent of right-of-way acquisitions and the relocation of residents to a
           minimum.
b.         Minimize channel improvement costs in order for the project to be feasible.
c.         Design channel improvements to be as environmentally and aesthetically
           acceptable as possible.
Presently, flood protection measures are some earthen levees in the housing tract north of
Clayton Road downstream from the confluence of Mitchell and Mt. Diablo Creek and at
the Westwood development where the creek was widened.
Flood protection can be achieved in two ways. The first is to determine the extent of the
100-year flood and to establish that area as setback for any uses that will be adversely
affected by inundation. Encroachment into flood plains by placement of fill reduces the
flood-carrying capacity and increases flood heights, thus increasing flood hazards in
areas beyond the area of the specific encroachment. Such encroachment is prevented
under the flood insurance program. An aspect of flood plain management involves
balancing the economic gain from flood plain development against the resulting increase
in flood hazard. The National Flood Insurance Program uses the concept of a floodway
as a tool to assist local communities in the setback aspect of flood plain management.
Under this concept, the area of the 100-year flood is divided into a floodway and a
floodway fringe. The floodway is the channel of a stream, plus any adjacent flood plain
areas that must be kept free of encroachment in order that the 100-year flood be carried
without substantial increases in flood heights. As minimum standards, the Federal
Insurance Administration limits such increases in flood heights to 1.0 foot, provided that
hazardous velocities are not produced. Flood fringe is the area that becomes ponded in
event of bank overflow. Development can occur in these areas under restrictions and
with flood insurance.
The second method of flood control is to provide creek alterations that will increase
capacity. Structures and alterations include concrete block energy dissipaters, concrete
channels, drop structures, berms, earth channels, culverts, inlet structures and similar
measures. The Contra Costa County Flood Control District prepared an engineering
report and a series of design alternatives in August 1983 to be considered and
implemented by the cities of Clayton and Concord.
As part of the General Plan implementation process, it will be necessary for the City of
Clayton to establish an overall flood control plan and continue to participate in the
Federal Flood Insurance Program and to require project EIR’s to identify contribution to
flooding and provide adequate mitigation. Since the county does not participate in the
regular program there are no corresponding FIRM maps for the Keller Ranch. As a part
of approval, Clayton’s FIRM maps will have to be expanded.                   (Revised 5/6/87)

                                      AIR QUALITY
Air quality in Clayton is primarily determined by meteorologic and topographic
conditions. Clayton is located in the upper reaches of Clayton Valley. In general, valleys
with box-end configurations such as this have a greater susceptibility to poor air quality
because they tend to trap air and usually there is a greater potential for temperature
inversions. Since surrounding ridges and mountains block winds, these areas lack the
flushing action that winds give to coastal and estuarine areas.
The air pollution potential of the plan area vicinity is mostly influenced by air quality in
the adjacent Concord area. Concord is particularly susceptible to air pollution due to
regional airflow patterns in conjunction with upwind emission sources. When
southwesterly or northwesterly winds occur, pollutants from the South Bay/Livermore
area or North Bay are carried into the Concord area. South-southwesterly winds
predominate about 40% of the time while northwesterly winds occur 5% - 10% of the
time. Pollutant concentrations can also increase further during relatively calm periods
because of local emission sources. Calm conditions occur about 30% of the time
(Department of Water Resources, 1978). Depending on meteorological conditions at the
Safety Element                                 Page VII-18                            March 2000
time, pollutants in the Concord area would tend to migrate and possibly accumulate in
the upper portion of the Clayton Valley at or near the project site.
Ambient air quality standards for California are provided in Exhibit VII-5.
                                         Exhibit VII-5
Air quality in the region is measured by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District
(BAAQMD). The closest monitoring station is located in Concord. Air quality data
collected at this station from 1978 through 1983 is shown in Exhibit VII-6.
Ozone and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are more regionally-oriented pollutants and their levels
have decreased in the Concord area since 1978. At the same time, more localized
pollutants (e.g., carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and total suspended
particulates (TSP) experienced a peak in 1981 and have decreased since then.
Light and heavy duty motor vehicles are the primary sources of carbon monoxide,
nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons. Industrial operations are the primary sources of
Safety Element                                Page VII-19                         March 2000
sulfur dioxide. Suspended particulate matter is produced from many diverse sources with
no single or primary sources.
Projections for the immediate future do not indicate a substantial increase in SO2;
therefore, Federal standards will not be exceeded. TSP levels are projected to increase
steadily between 1975 and 2000. Regional CO levels are projected to decline steadily
despite the increase in vehicle miles traveled but this decline is not expected to be
sufficient to meet CO standards. Nitrogen oxides are estimated to remain relatively
constant from 1975 to 2000 while hydrocarbon emissions are expected to decline
moderately by 1985 and rise back to the 1975 level by the year 2000. These projections
suggest that oxidant levels will be moderately reduced by 1985 but this improvement will
not be maintained through the year 2000.
The Bay Area Air Quality Plan (1979) provides direct controls for mobile and stationary
pollutant sources. More indirect controls for land use management were not included in
Safety Element                                Page VII-20                             March 2000
the adopted Plan. However, the objective of the land use management program is to
reduce the number and length of the automobile trips and to increase transit use in order
to decrease the amount of regional automobile travel. This could be accomplished by
achieving more compact development in the region by year 2000.
As jobs are being generated in the Concord, Walnut Creek and Danville areas, an
inadequate balance of residences is creating pressure on communities such as Clayton.
Clayton is closer than East County but further than a brisk non-polluting walk to work.
Car pool, park and ride and transit are measures that need greater attention in Clayton
provided there is support on a regional basis. Currently Contra Costa Transit has a route
through Clayton. An express commuter bus to BART is also being tried on a trail basis.
Another form of air pollution is dust generated by development. During construction of
new development, grading activities turn dust and increase suspended particulate matter
in the project region. Based on field tests conducted at construction sites, an average dust
emission rate of 1.2 tons per acre occurs for every month of active construction (US
Environmental Protection Agency, 1975). Assuming 60 percent of the generated dust is
of particle sizes greater than 30 micrometers, approximately 40% of the dust generated
would settle out in the first few hundred feet while the remaining 60% could remain
suspended indefinitely. Increased dust levels would be most noticeable to existing
residents located near areas where cutting and filling will occur.
Diesel-powered construction equipment emits nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulfur
oxides, hydrocarbons and particulates; however these emissions only increase local
concentrations slightly and do not measurably increase the frequency of violation of air
quality standards.
Long-term air quality impacts due to the area build out will result primarily from
increased vehicle emissions. Daily emissions of carbon monoxides, hydrocarbons and
nitrogen oxides from city buildout generated traffic are shown in Exhibit VII-7.
Although increases in these pollutants due to the project would not be considered
significant when compared to emissions for the entire San Francisco Bay region, they
could be substantial enough to affect local air quality under adverse meteorological
conditions. Such situations could arise when winds carry pollutants from upwind sources
into the Concord-Clayton Valley area and temperature inversions (calm conditions) trap
these pollutants in this area. With pollutant levels already high, local emissions due to
existing development and new development will aggravate the poor air quality
conditions.

Carbon monoxide is a localized pollutant and it is a useful indicator of the direct impact
of development on air quality along local roadways and in the immediate project vicinity.
 Road-side and area-wide carbon monoxide concentrations were calculated at Kirker Pass
using existing and projected traffic volumes as well as modeling techniques specified by
BAAQMD. Results of these calculations are shown in Exhibit VII-8. With build out
Clayton would increase area-wide carbon monoxide one Band-eight hour concentrations
by 12 percent. Carbon monoxide concentrations along Concord Boulevard (west of
Kirker Pass Road) would increase by 127 percent at buildout of the area. New
development would increase CO levels along Clayton Road by 57 percent at buildout of
the area. Increases along Concord Boulevard would be considered significant due to the
amount of increase resulting from the project and the proximity of sensitive receptors
(e.g., residential units) along most of Concord Boulevard. However, carbon monoxide
generated by existing traffic and traffic resulting from buildout would not exceed
standards and therefore would not present significant health hazards. Although CO
concentrations in Exhibit VII-8 do not threaten Federal standards, these concentrations
do not include CO generated upwind or in close proximity to the study area not do these
concentrations reflect variable meteorological conditions. Therefore, CO concentrations
in the Clayton regions would actually be higher when emissions from upwind sources are

carried to the Concord-Clayton area.
Cumulative residential occupancy would add to air pollution. Combustion of natural gas
for heating and cooking would generate small amounts of pollutants (primarily nitrogen
oxides). Use of fireplaces in project residences would also increase particulate levels. In
addition increased demand for sewage treatment would indirectly increase atmospheric
discharges from treatment plant operations.
With the control efforts of air quality agencies, it does not appear likely that levels of
pollution witnessed in Southern California will occur in this area. However, vehicle
exhaust is likely to be the highest polluter in this portion of Contra Costa County and
solutions to limit vehicle miles of internal combustion engines are needed.
Air quality degradation affect weaker members of society including the elderly, children
and persons with respiratory ailments. As a safety issue it may not be perceived as an
immediate threat, but it remains a danger exemplified by air quality alerts experienced in
other regions.

                                             FIRE
Because the natural vegetation in the trail system and adjacent parklands is extremely
flammable during the summer and fall, wildfire is a serious hazard in the City of Clayton.
 Slopes, high winds, and difficulty in access increase the hazards. Traffic congestion in
the case of fire can hinder fire fighting. Isolated homes set in wooded canyons or on ridge
tops with only one narrow, winding, or steep road are subject to a high fire hazard. Fire
services are provided by the Contra Costa Fire District. A station is located on Mitchell
Canyon and Clayton Road.
It is important that the City ensure that there exists: 1) adequate peak load water supply
for fire fighting, 2) all-weather road construction adequate for fire fighting equipment,
and 3) that construction be built to proper code standards.
It is important to establish a program to reduce the amount of dry brush with the
Greenbelt System.
                                            CRIME
Crime is low for all categories in the City of Clayton. The Police Department is
supporting new programs such as “Neighborhood Watch” to encourage citizens to help
keep crime low. Developments need to be reviewed to ensure crime prevention measures
are incorporated into the design.
                                       CIRCULATION
Circulation to Town Center needs to be improved to reduce the possibility of the town
being cut off by blockage of Clayton Road. Alternative emergency routes need to be
identified and plans for road improvements supported on the basis of safety.
                                     OTHER HAZARDS
There are no special or unusual hazards in Clayton. There is the possibility of disruption
of service lines. This includes PG & E transmission lines, gas lines and the Getty
pipeline. The lines are identified in Exhibit IX-4. At present it is not known whether
hazardous materials or waste pass through the community. Such information should be
pursued and appropriate action taken.

                            EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
Public protection services for fire, police and medical emergencies are essential to the
community in day-to-day emergencies. These services are provided by a variety of
agencies so that a high degree of communication and coordination of activities is
required to prepare for potential disaster conditions. Because of the community
development pattern and the nature of traffic circulation through the community,
evacuation and the free movement of emergency vehicles could be severely impeded in
event of a disaster by traffic congestion in key areas. Options need to be developed
based on different disaster scenarios.
Citizens’ action programs such as Neighborhood Alert and Operation Identification have
been shown to be effective in reducing theft and crimes of violence. Medical emergency
services are provided by the fire District, ambulances and two hospitals.
Primary exit routes out of Clayton to the north are Pine Hollow Road, Clayton Road, and
Concord Boulevard. To the south, the primary route is Marsh Creek Road. As financing
opportunities occur, Clayton must evaluate the safety benefits related to cross
connections between the evacuation routes. Such evaluation and update shall be
coordinated with the Mt. Diablo School District.

                                      LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
The General Plan Diagram indicates application, location, extent, type and density of
development. Designations provide assurance of city policy and guidance to homeowners,
landowners, and developers.                                                  (Amended by Resolution 25-2004, dated 6/1/04)
                                   RESIDENTIAL DESIGNATIONS
There are seven residential designations. The density ranges for each residential land use
designation are based on the developable acreage of the parcel. Developable acreage and
residential density calculations are further defined and described in the Clayton Municipal
Code regarding residential parcels with sensitive land areas. Maximum density cannot be
guaranteed but will fall within the range identified for each residential land use
designation. Due to differences in developable acreage because of the constraints
attributable to sensitive land areas, residential parcels with sensitive land areas shall fall
within the not to exceed maximum density for developable acreage and shall not have a
minimum density requirement. Second dwelling units are exempt from the determination
of residential densities.
                                                                            (Amended by Resolution 14-2017, dated 5/16/17)
When clustering is proposed for development, the City may provide relief from the lot
coverage standards discussed below.
Unless otherwise noted, the following uses are allowed in each of the General Plan
residential categories, provided they meet the requirements of the underlying zoning

Additional uses allowed under each category are described below.
                                 Rural Estate (0 to 1.0 Units Per Acre)
This density range is intended for single-family estates, or horse set-ups on individual lots
of an acre or more. Allowable uses include single-family homes, private stables and
corrals with access to greenbelts and equestrian facilities, and accessory structures and
uses normally auxiliary to them. Second dwelling units are also allowed.
              (Amended by Resolution 21-87, dated 5/16/87, Resolution 43-95, dated 6/28/95, and Resolution 25-2004, dated 6/1/04)
                       Single Family Low Density (1.1 to 3 Units per Acre)
This density range is intended for development of single-family houses on lots that range
between 12,500 and 40,000 square feet. This designation has been the predominant
density in Clayton. Uses allowed under this designation include single-family homes, and
the accessory structures and uses normally auxiliary to them. Second dwelling units are
also allowed.(Amended by Resolution 21-87, dated 5/16/87, Resolution 43-95, dated 6/28/95, and Resolution 25-2004, dated 6/1/04)
                    Single Family Medium Density (3.1 to 5 Units Per Acre)
This density is intended for and allows planned unit development (PUD) and single-family
subdivisions. Development will range from a standard single-family subdivision to a zero
lot line or single-family home. Accessory structures and uses normally auxiliary to them
are also allowed, as well as second dwelling units.
              (Amended by Resolution 21-87, dated 5/16/87, Resolution 43-95, dated 6/28/95, and Resolution 25-2004, dated 6/1/04)
                     Single Family High Density (5.1 to 7.5 Units Per Acre)
This designation is an urban single-family density that will allow patio homes, zero lot
line and cluster homes in a PUD development. Accessory structures and uses normally
auxiliary to them are also allowed, as well as second dwelling units. Second dwelling units
are also allowed. Development will require innovative design with a combination of
development concentration and open space. Development intensity will permit individual
parcel coverage of up to 75% provided common open space is provided. Development
excluding recreational amenities shall not exceed total structural land coverage of 25%.
               (Amended by Resolution 21-87, dated 5/16/87, Resolution 43-95, dated 6/28/95, and Resolution 25-2004, dated 6/1/04)
                       Multifamily Low Density (7.6 to 10 Units Per Acre)
This designation is intended for and allows cluster units such as duplexes, triplexes,
townhouses, garden units, and other types of PUDs, as well as single family detached
dwellings on smaller lots with a conditional use permit, that provide a development with

                    Multifamily Medium Density (10.1 to 15 Units Per Acre)
This designation is intended for and allows multifamily units, including duplexes,
triplexes, and townhouses, located where the site area, circulation system and other
features can comfortably accommodate increased density. Development within this
density shall be encouraged to use a PUD concept and standards with incorporation of
significant design and amenity in the project. Structural coverage, excluding recreational
amenities, shall not exceed 50% of the site area. Second dwelling units are allowed.
         (Amended by Resolution 21-87, dated 5/16/87, Resolution 25-2004, dated 6/1/04, and Resolution 11-2012, dated 4/3/12)
                            Multifamily High Density (20 Units Per Acre)
This designation is intended for and allows two-story (or higher) apartments or
condominiums located where higher densities may be appropriate, such as near major
public transportation and commercial centers. Development within this density shall be
encouraged to use a PUD concept and standards with incorporation of significant design
and amenity in the project. Structural coverage, excluding recreational amenities, shall
not exceed 65% of the site area.
         (Resolution 11-2012, dated 4/3/12, Amended by Resolution 49-2016, dated July 19, 2016)
                           Institutional Density (7.6 to 20 Units Per Acre)
This designation is intended for development of various forms of senior housing under
sponsorship of public or quasi-public agencies. The density of senior projects is not
always equivalent to standard concepts of density; therefore, a density range of 7.6 to 20
units per acre may be permitted. Group dining, limited vehicles, medicine-dispensing
services and other characteristics make this form of housing unique.
Senior projects must be submitted as planned developments and will have to be reviewed
for site limitations including density, number of stories and structure height, on a case-by-
case basis. It is assumed that densities can exceed 15 units per acre when possible impacts
can be mitigated. Development intensity can reach 100% structural coverage of each
individual parcel. Structural coverage shall not exceed 50% of the site area, however,
specific sites and relationship to adjacent uses may pose additional limitations.
         (Amended by Resolution 21-87, dated 5/16/87, Resolution 64-98, dated 12/1/98, Resolution 25-2004, dated 6/1/04, and
         Resolution 11-2012, dated 4/3/12)
                           Residential Density and Population Projections
The 2010 census indicated that Clayton had an average population of 2.72 persons per unit
for occupied units. Clayton’s high occupancy rate compared to other cities in Contra
Costa County is due to the large homes on large parcels. As homes decrease in size,
occupant size can also be expected to decrease.
The analysis of the relationship of units per acre to population is not direct. Population is
based on relationship of residential unit size and living pattern of residents. Generally the
size of the units will indicate the number of bedrooms. Variables include the reduced size
of the family, larger homes on smaller lots, ethnic and cultural preferences for family size
and use of space, economic fluctuations, percentage of unmarried shared rent households
and changes in taste. The projected population levels are as follows:

                                  COMMERCIAL DESIGNATIONS
The commercial designations, including uses and development standards are listed below.
The development standards apply to the net acreage of the commercial parcels and
exclude any areas dedicated for public right-of-way.                          (Amended by Resolution 05-2007, dated 2/6/07)
Town Center
This designation is located in the center of the City of Clayton which has been a historical
commercial center since Clayton’s inception.
Uses
The uses allowed within this designation are the retail sales, commercial service,
restaurant, bar, commercial recreation, child day care, office, upper-floor residential,
visitor-accommodation uses listed in the “Town Center Commercial” land use designation
of the Town Center Specific Plan. Population in residential uses is estimated at 1 person
per 300 square feet.
All new development projects shall be reviewed for design compatibility with existing
structures, as well as the theme and character of the Town Center, as described in the
Town Center Specific Plan. Building height shall not exceed forty (40) feet. Structural
coverage of a site primarily used for ground-floor retail with upper-floor retail, upper-floor
office, and/or upper-floor residential purposes shall comply with the standards listed
below. Structural coverage of a site primarily used for ground-floor office purposes or
other uses shall not exceed thirty-five (35) percent.
                                            (Amended by Resolution 21-87, dated 5/16/87 and Resolution 05-2007, dated 2/6/07)
1.       Parcels 10,000 square feet or less: Up to one hundred (100) percent structural
         coverage.
2.       Parcels between 10,001 and 40,000 square feet: Up to the percent structural
         coverage allowed by the following formula.
                   X = 100 – 2 (Y – 10)
                   X is the Maximum Structural Coverage in percent
                   Y is the Square Footage of the Parcel in 1,000's of square feet

         For example, a 30,000 square foot parcel is allowed 60 percent structural coverage.
                   X = 100 – 2 (30 – 10)
                   X = 100 – 2 (20)
                   X = 100 – 40
                   X = 60
3.       Parcels greater than 40,000 square feet: Up to forty (40) percent structural coverage.
                                                                             (Amended by Resolution 05-2007, dated 2/6/07)
Development projects must comply with the structural coverage standards applicable to
the square footage of the respective Parcel(s) as shown on the Assessor’s Maps of the
Contra Costa County Assessor’s Office as of January 1, 2007. Notwithstanding this
provision, any Parcel larger than one acre may be initially subdivided into two parcels.
Upon subdivision, each resultant parcel (termed “Resultant Parcel”) shall be subject to the
applicable structural coverage standard set forth in the above criteria which shall continue
to apply to any further subdivision of a Resultant Parcel. (Amended by Resolution 05-2007, dated 2/6/07)

Kirker Corridor
Kirker Corridor represents the only commercial location in the city limits of Clayton that
has regional potential. Nearly all of Clayton’s sales tax dollars are lost to neighboring
communities. The Kirker Corridor represents a series of sites that can serve to recapture a
portion of that lost income, provide local control over the types of shops and facilities
needed and reduce the extent of travel to commercial centers further away. The primary
emphasis is on retail facilities although the complementary office and retail service uses
are necessary for variety and market balance. Structural coverage shall not exceed thirty
(30) percent of the site and height shall not exceed fifty (50) feet.
                                            (Amended by Resolution 21-87, dated 5/16/87 and Resolution 05-2007, dated 2/6/07)
Uses
All uses permitted in the Town Center. In addition, the following shall be permitted: auto
sales and service, hotel and motel, wholesale distribution and other commercial uses
determined to be consistent with the designation and overall development.
In order to prevent the Kirker Corridor from becoming a strip commercial site or to limit
potential for future development, it will be necessary to present any specific proposal
within the context of concept master plans for the entire area covering issues such a
circulation, architectural design theme, and site planning.
Convenience Commercial
This designation is highly restricted and designated for those sites that provide specific
commercial needs for the community. Currently there are two sites along Marsh Creek
Road where such uses exist; a landscape nursery exists near the town center, and a general
store operates in the Marsh Creek Road Specific Plan area. This designation allows retail
uses of a neighborhood convenience nature where facility and operation are compatible
with surrounding residential areas. Structural coverage on these sites shall not exceed
twenty-five (25) percent of the site area. Building height shall not exceed thirty five (35)
feet.

Implementation
Implementing ordinances shall be developed to guide and control use and appearance for
all commercial designations. Development in the Kirker Corridor shall produce a unified
concept.
The size of Clayton and its commercially designated area provides a series of limitations
on the extent of uses that can be permitted. Uses that do not fit into the categories
mentioned, such as mini-warehouse, contractor yards and non-office industrial uses, may
have to locate elsewhere due to the severe space limitations.
               PUBLIC AND QUASI PUBLIC FACILITY DESIGNATIONS
This designation applies to public and private school facilities, city facilities, fire district
facilities, and other public and quasi-public uses. Day care facilities are consistent with
this designation.
New public facilities should be located so that they will not intrude on residential areas.
Where a public facility must be located adjacent to residences, all feasible mitigation
measures shall be considered.
                                                                                (Amended by Resolution 21-87, dated 5/16/87)
                                    OPEN SPACE DESIGNATIONS
The City of Clayton seeks to preserve open space and provide recreational opportunities to
Clayton residents within the City Limits. Four designations have been created to fulfill
these goals: Private Open Space, Public Park/Open Space, Quarry, and Agriculture. The
following text describes these four categories:
                                             (Amended by Resolution 21-87, dated 5/16/87, and Resolution 43-95, dated 6/28/95)
1.       Private Open Space (PR)
         This designation includes privately-owned open spaces. Typical examples in
         Clayton include the Oakhurst golf course and areas where development has been
         clustered to retain open space. Other examples include private recreational

Resolutions 14-17, 49-16, 12-12, 11-12, 04-08, 05-07, 13-05, 63-04, 25-04, 49-00, 64-98, 43-95               Page II-10
         facilities such as the riding club southeast of Clayton, the swimming pools at
         Marsh Creek Park Villas and Dana Hills, and the open space within Dana Hills and
         Westwood. These facilities allow individuals to expand their recreational
         opportunities at a cost and benefit to the users rather than the public at large. Such
         facilities should be promoted so long as traffic, noise and other related impacts are
         mitigated.
         Only open space development, recreation and preservation are allowed in this
         designation. Owners’ potential rights to other types of development on these
         properties have been clustered on adjoining parts of some parcels.
                                                                              (Amended by Resolution 43-95, dated 6/28/95)
2.       Public Park/Open Space/Open Space and Recreational (PU)
         This designation applies to lands under City, County or State jurisdiction. Such
         uses within the planning area include City-owned open space areas and developed
         neighborhood and community parks, creek corridors, Mt. Diablo State Park, and
         the Open Space areas within the Oakhurst subdivision (dedicated to the City).
         Allowable uses in this designation include trails, greenbelts, playfields and parks,
         as well as accessory structures and uses normally auxiliary to them.
                                                                              (Amended by Resolution 43-95, dated 6/28/95)
3.       Quarry (Q)
         Uses allowed under this designation include quarries and accessory structures and
         uses normally auxiliary to them.
         There are no quarries located within the city limits of Clayton; however, the Lone
         Star quarry is located on the southwestern edge of the community. The quarry
         produces high quality rock and gravel and the quarry has an expected life in excess
         of 50 years. There are two negative impacts generated by quarry operation. First,
         there are occasional blasts to separate the rock and secondly, there is an average of
         160 trucks per day traveling along Mitchell Canyon Road. This figure is based on
         information obtained from Lone Star Quarry. The quarry has taken a series of
         measures to mitigate its effect upon Clayton.
                                                                              (Amended by Resolution 43-95, dated 6/28/95)
4.       Agriculture (AG)
         Areas to the northeast and east of the city limits include rugged terrain that is
         primarily used as rangeland for livestock and other similar open uses. The City
         supports and encourages the continuation of agriculture in these areas. Given the
         low intensity of agricultural activities, the minimum parcel size is 20 acres but is
         encouraged to be 40 acres to ensure agricultural viability.
         The purpose of the Agriculture designation is to preserve and protect lands capable
         of and generally used for the production of food, fiber, and plant materials. The
         title is intended to be descriptive of the predominant land-extensive agricultural
         uses that take place in these areas, but the land use title allows other types of
         agricultural, open space or non-urban uses.
                                                                               (Amended by Resolution 43-95, dated 6/28/95)

                       ANNEXATIONS AND SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
The City of Clayton wishes to have control over those areas that demand services, that
make up its urban form, that affect its livelihood and that help create an efficient unit of
government services. It is therefore the policy of the City of Clayton to annex all land
within its Sphere of Influence and to promote development of land in the City of Clayton.
Support for the concept of City development is included in the scale of community
responsiveness to needs, efficiency and consistency of standards.
 The Sphere of Influence and Planning Area boundary should be reviewed at least at 5
year increments to determine whether expansion is warranted.
                                                                              (Amended by Resolution 43-95, dated 6/28/95)
If development is proposed in the un-sphered area north or east of Clayton, Clayton will
request expansion of its Sphere at that time to the limits of its Planning Area.
The City of Clayton will be interested in any development along Marsh Creek Road
between Clayton and Byron, due to the direct effect on traffic through the City. The effect
on Clayton circulation should be considered in any County proposal.
