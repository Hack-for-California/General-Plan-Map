INTRODUCTION
     “Realizing our vision depends upon…striving to attain a balance among
     residential, commercial, and industrial interests; [and] strengthening the
     character and appearance that defines Torrance as a model community…”.
     -City of Torrance Strategic Plan, 2008
The pride Torrance residents feel about their community is unique and very
evident. In many cities, the issues of the day center on what should change. In
Torrance, the community talks about what should not change. Residents tell
you about their safe and well-maintained neighborhoods, with quality housing
and a strong sense of community. Families and seniors praise the parks and
recreation facilities, programs, and services that are unparalleled in the South
Bay. Residents and small business owners describe the beauty and charm of
Downtown Torrance, an area that embodies the City’s history and aesthetic
character. Larger business owners speak about Torrance’s business-friendly
environment and the opportunities to grow. Residents and visitors tell you
about the beautiful and little-known ocean views and the pleasures of Torrance
Beach. From all, you hear about a community committed to preserving Torrance

CHAPTER 1:            Land Use Element
as a vibrant place – a balanced city – that past and present generations have
worked hard to create and maintain.
The City’s history, character, and amenities make Torrance a very desirable place
to live. Individuals and families looking for a quality living environment
understand that Torrance offers many diverse housing opportunities. People
drive from throughout the South Bay to Torrance to visit the City’s commercial
districts. Many businesses large and small, including significant healthcare
providers, appreciate Torrance’s advantageous location and access to a varied
labor pool. Thus, this Land Use Element reflects and supports the community’s
long-established goal to remain a balanced community, and to retain the
features that create a unique and successful city. Part of that balance includes
providing for the City's long-term fiscal stability, accommodating modest
residential growth to meet the housing needs of a diverse demographic,1
improving aging commercial and industrial areas, and implementing
infrastructure improvements that support changing needs over time.
When Torrance initiated its General Plan update in 2004, a key concern of
residents was that land use policy changes would result in uncontrolled
population growth. This Plan does provide for transition in targeted areas of the
City but for modest population growth. The anticipated growth will result from
natural birth and death rates, people moving to the City, and the expected
continuation of multi-generational households due to housing costs and family
care needs related to an aging population. With regard to residential
neighborhoods, the consequences of not anticipating and planning for this
growth can include an increase in substandard housing, overcrowding, illegal
garage conversions, and an increase in cars parking on residential streets.
Unmanaged growth can also strain the City’s existing infrastructure, parks,
water resources, and school capacity. The City must be smart and strategic
about how it plans to accommodate a growing regional population and how it
will provide the services, infrastructure, jobs and development conditions
needed to preserve the quality of life in Torrance. Additional and affordable
housing units will be needed not only to accommodate the population growth,
but to maintain a healthy business climate.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE
LAND USE ELEMENT
State planning law requires that the Land Use Element designate "the proposed
general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land" for
a variety of purposes (Government Code Section 65302[a]). Through maps and
1
  Compared with the 1992 General Plan land use, over a 20-year period, the General
Plan estimates growth that averages about 155 residential units per year. This 0.2%
yearly growth is modest in comparison with growth in the region.

text, this Element defines the distribution and intensity of development of
residential neighborhoods, commercial and industrial districts, parks and other
open spaces, and public or quasi-public uses of property in Torrance. In
particular, the Land Use Plan section contains the Land Use Policy Map, which
presents a pictorial representation of land use policy. The Land Use Element
also identifies study areas throughout the community where specific policies
will be implemented to guide the City toward its land use (and related) goals.
The Land Use Policy Map provides a two-dimensional description of land use
policy by indicating the location and type of permitted uses. Equally important
is the third dimension of character and form: How will new development fit
within the established City framework? How can good urban design and
landscaping be used to enhance the visual image Torrance conveys to residents
and visitors to the City? What form of development will encourage the use of
alternatives to the automobile? Objectives and policies in the Element address
land use planning issues related to the look and feel of the Torrance community
are discussed in the Urban Design section of this Element.
To provide guidance in implementing the Element’s goals, this Element also
defines the relationship between General Plan land use policy and zoning, as
the Torrance Municipal Code provides the primary means for implementing land
use goals. In addition, specific land use implementation programs are identified
in the General Plan Implementation Program (Appendix A). The Land Use
Element, in combination with the updated Land Use Policy Map and the other
General Plan Elements, will work toward the City’s goal of achieving a high
quality of life through a balanced mix of attractive residential neighborhoods,
economically prosperous commercial and industrial districts, well-maintained
parks, and superior public services.
                           A high quality of life achieved through a balanced mix
                           of attractive residential neighborhoods, high-quality
GOAL:                      public services, and economically viable and attractive
                           commercial and industrial areas
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER
GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Land Use Element provides the framework for all topics addressed in the
General Plan, since the manner in which land is used in Torrance affects the
City’s circulation system, economic development activities, parks and open
space resources, and public safety. For example, different land uses generate
various trip demands which influence the capacity and service levels of
Torrance’s street system. The Circulation and Infrastructure Element responds
by planning for transportation services and routes that will meet the demands
of existing and future development.

CHAPTER 1:            Land Use Element
The Land Use Element also designates areas to be used as open spaces, parks,
and recreation facilities. Goals and policies regarding the preservation and
maintenance of these areas are also addressed in the Community Resources
Element. Safety and noise abatement issues also relate to land use. To address
noise concerns associated with uses such as the airport, land use designations
have been established reflective of the noise contour maps in the Noise
Element. To mitigate or avoid damage and injury from natural and man-made
hazards, hazards maps in the Safety Element must also be consistent with the
Land Use Element.
The Land Use Element is the most intricately related to the Housing Element
and the Housing Element must be consistent with the Land Use Element. The
Land Use Element sets the framework for the City’s residential environment by
laying out the land designations for residential development and indicating the
type and density permitted by the City. Working within this framework, the
Housing Element identifies priority goals, objectives and program actions for the
next five years that directly address the housing needs of Torrance’s residents.
1.       LAND USE PLAN
In response to the community’s desire to maintain Torrance’s long-established
land use patterns, preserve the attractiveness of the City’s neighborhoods and
districts, maintain a sound economic base, and enhance the pedestrian
environment, this Land Use Plan has been crafted to guide the development,
maintenance, and improvement of land and properties. The Land Use Policy
Map, illustrated in Figure LU-1 and described below, will allow us to preserve
those qualities that define Torrance.
1.1      TERMS USED IN THE THIS ELEMENT
1.1.1 DENSITY AND INTENSITY
When describing areas of Torrance, we differentiate one area from another by
the principal use, such as homes (residential), shops and restaurants
(commercial), manufacturing businesses (business park), a park, or a school or
college. To describe the intensity of use – how much development exists on a
property or could be built (and presumably, what the associated activity level
is) – land use planners have developed quantitative measures called density and
intensity.

                                                CHAPTER 1:                   Land Use Element
Density and intensity are commonly
used in General Plans as a way to
meet legislative requirements to
define parameters of development
and quantifiable standards of
building intensity for each land use
                                                         Low Density                     Low-Medium Density
designation. State General Plan                    0-9 dwelling units/acre             9-18 dwelling units/acre
guidelines require that these
standards define the most intensive
use that will be allowed under each
designation.
The term density, as illustrated in
Figure LU-2, typically applies to               Medium Density         Medium-High Density           High Density
                                            18-31 dwelling units/acre 31-44 dwelling units/acre > 44 dwelling units/acre
residential uses and refers to the
population       and      development                                                        Figure LU-2:
capacity of residential land. Density                      Residential Density Example
is described in terms of the dwelling
units that can be accommodated on one acre of land (dwelling units per acre or
du/ac) and the population associated with that density (population per acre or
pop/ac)
                                      For commercial, industrial, and other
                                      nonresidential uses, intensity describes
                                      the degree to which a property is or can
                                      be developed. The measure of intensity
                                      Torrance uses is the floor-area ratio. The
                                      floor-area ratio, or FAR, describes the
                                      relationship between the total square
                                      feet of development on a lot and the
                                      area of that lot. The FAR is determined
                                      by dividing the gross floor area of all
                                      buildings on a lot by the land area of
                                      that lot. FAR and factors such as
                                      building square footage, building height,
                                      and the percent of lot coverage are all
                                      interrelated. For example, a 20,000-
                                      square-foot building on a 40,000
                                      square-foot lot yields an FAR of 0.50.
                                      This 0.50 FAR can accommodate a
                                      single-story building that covers half the
                                      lot or a two-story building with reduced
                    Figure LU-3:      lot coverage. Figure LU-3 illustrates

CHAPTER 1:              Land Use Element
1.1.2 SUBJECTIVE TERMS
In the Land Use Element and other Elements of the General Plan, terms such as
attractive and high quality are used to describe the type of development and
resources that the City strives to achieve. These terms are highly subjective,
and an evaluation of what is attractive or of high quality can change from
person to person and from time period to time period. This Element does not
establish specific guidelines for development design such as color palettes or
architectural styles. Rather, the Element outlines strategies to protect and
encourage the characteristics that make Torrance a desirable place to live. For
example, instead of indicating how commercial centers should look, the Plan
encourages commercial centers that function well financially and physically by
being located in visible and accessible areas and providing linkages to
neighboring uses and transit areas. City leaders and residents should use the
Plan as a foundation when making decisions related to aesthetic value as the
goals, objectives, and policies. These policy directives will provide guidance no
matter what the design trend or fad may be.
1.2       FOUNDATION FOR LAND USE PLANNING
Figure LU-4 identifies the distribution of land uses in Torrance as of July, 2005.
The predominantly residential land use pattern, with concentrations of
industrial and commercial uses, reflects the City’s history as a “company
town”, where homes were built to house the local work force of industries.

In 2005, residential development covered almost half of the City’s land area.
Industrial uses occupied the second largest land area, at 22 percent.
Commercial and Public/Quasi-Public/Open Space uses represented the third-
largest land uses in the City (12 percent each). Torrance also had a limited
supply of vacant land mostly within commercial and industrial areas. Given the
built-out character of the community, only minor land use changes from
baseline year 2005 conditions will occur over the long term.
1.3       LAND USE POLICY MAP AND DESIGNATIONS
The Land Use Policy Map (Figure LU-1) graphically represents the planned
distribution and intensity of land use citywide. The colors shown on the map
correspond to land use designations that describe the types of uses established
and planned in Torrance. Table LU-1 lists the General Plan designations and
indicates the nature and intensity of development that is permitted. There are
fourteen land use designations divided into residential, commercial, industrial,
and public categories.
The designations presented in Table LU-1 include the Residential-Office and
Hospital/Medical designations, introduced to recognize increased opportunities
for mixed-used development and to accommodate possible expansion plans of
major medical facilities in Torrance, respectively.
The Residential-Office designation is being introduced to recognize increased
opportunities for mixed-use and to protect established residential
neighborhoods from incompatible land uses and development. The Residential-
Office designation will be implemented by the L-P Limited Professional Office
District and R-P Residential Professional District. This area is intended for
mixed-use residential/commercial developments, multiple-family residences,
professional office uses, and less intense commercial activities that do not
generate noise or generate high volumes of vehicle trips. Neighborhood-serving
retail uses that do not generate substantial traffic impacts would also be
considered appropriate. Scale, intensity, site access, and proximity of
residential uses shall be considered when evaluating new development. The
Residential-Office Designation will also serve as transitional area between
established residential neighborhoods and commercial and industrial areas and
help buffer existing neighborhoods from the noise and traffic of arterial streets.
This designation will promote more compatible uses next to residences and
abate incompatible uses. Mixed-use residential and commercial developments,
live-work and work-live arrangements, and artist lofts are considered
appropriate uses.
The prior Local Commercial Designation was intended for neighborhood-serving
commercial uses with a maximum floor-area ratio of 0.40. Local Commercial
development was supposed to be designed to reduce automobile trips and
oriented toward pedestrians. Instead of facilitating neighborhood-compatible
development, the restrictive 0.40 FAR encouraged automobile-oriented uses,

CHAPTER 1:            Land Use Element
such as gas stations and drive-through restaurants, and inhibited mixed-use
development. The incorporation of Local Commercial into General Commercial
and Residential-Office will provide greater flexibility in use and development of
the sites without comprising the quality of life of neighborhood districts.
The General Commercial designation encompasses many types of commercial
development, from local-serving retail and service establishments to arterial
highway-oriented commercial centers. Mixed residential and commercial
developments may also be established within areas designated General
Commercial, subject to specific standards and conditions set forth in Torrance
Municipal Code. The 1.0 maximum FAR for mixed-use projects will encourage
the development of residential uses and compatible commercial uses on the
same property, allow the site to accommodate amenities, and help facilitate a
function design. In Downtown Torrance, FAR for mixed-use developments
traditionally range from 1.0 to over 3.0.
1.3.1 RESIDENTIAL LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Residential uses are located throughout Torrance at varying development
densities. The highest residential densities occur along major streets and near
major transportation corridors, in older neighborhoods, and in apartment or
condominium developments and Planned Development communities around
Sepulveda Boulevard and Plaza Del Amo between Hawthorne and Crenshaw
Boulevards. The lowest residential densities are largely located in the western
and southern portions of the City.
Five residential land use designations allow for a range of housing types and
densities. The City also permits accessory units and non-residential uses such
as schools, parks, child day care, and religious and charitable organizations in
these areas, consistent with State law and the Torrance Municipal Code. Typical
population density figures are included as required by State General Plan
guidelines. Typical population density is calculated based on the range of
dwelling units per acre allowed in the designation and persons per household
(dwelling) statistics from the California Department of Finance (2.623 persons
per household in 2006).
LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (R-LO)
The Low-Density Residential designation provides for
the development of single-family residences within a
density range of up to 9 dwelling units per acre.
Development is characterized generally by detached
single-family dwellings on individual lots forming a
cohesive neighborhood.
Unit Density: 0-9 dwelling units per acre
Typical Population Density: 3 - 24 persons per acre

LOW-MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (R-LM)
The Low-Medium Density Residential designation
provides for the development of small-lot single-family
homes, duplexes, attached multi-unit developments, and
mobile home parks within a density range of 9.1 to 18
dwelling units per acre. Mobile homes are included to
reflect current uses and as a guide for future
development.
Unit Density: 9.1-18 dwelling units per acre
Typical Population Density: 24-47 persons per acre
MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (R-MD)
The Medium Density Residential designation allows
townhouses and low-rise multi-unit buildings within a
density range of 18.1 to 31 dwelling units per acre.
Unit Density: 18.1-31dwelling units per acre
Typical Population Density: 47-81 persons per acre
MEDIUM-HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL                       (R-
MH)
Residential development accommodated in the Medium-
High Residential designation includes low- and medium-
rise multi-unit attached developments. Residential
development may occur within a density range of 31.1 to
44 dwelling units per acre. Areas in the City with an R-
MH designation are appropriate for subterranean parking.
Unit Density: 31.1 -44 dwelling units per acre
Typical Population Density: 81-115 persons per acre
HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (R-HI)
The High Density Residential designation accommodates
multi-family housing, and specifically housing
development of a more intensive form, including medium
and high-rise apartment buildings with a minimum
density of 44.1 dwelling units per acre. The R-HI
designation is appropriate for senior housing.
Unit Density: 44.1- 60 dwelling units per acre, with special
consideration for high-rise senior housing
Typical Population Density: up to 115- 120 persons per acre

1.3.2 COMMERCIAL LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Commercial uses provide critical support to the residential neighborhoods and
contribute significantly to the City’s tax base. There are distinctions between
commercial areas that serve surrounding neighborhoods and areas that serve
the region. Neighborhood-level commercial areas should be located within easy
walking distance of residential neighborhoods and consist of low-scale, stand-
alone commercial business and commercial centers. Regional commercial
corridors include Pacific Coast Highway, Hawthorne Boulevard, and Sepulveda
Boulevard. The largest concentration of commercial development is in the Del
Amo Business District, an area along Hawthorne Boulevard bounded by
Torrance Boulevard and Sepulveda Boulevard.
Three commercial land use designations are designed to support business
activity and provide tools to help businesses and districts maximize their
economic potential.

GENERAL COMMERCIAL (C-GEN)
The General Commercial designation is intended
to permit a wide range of commercial uses which
serve both the local and regional community.
Permitted uses include shopping centers,
professional and medical offices, food and
beverage        establishments,       entertainment
facilities, financial institutions, and automotive
sales. Mixed-use development consisting of
commercial and residential uses is permitted
pursuant to the detailed land use regulations
and development standards set forth in the Torrance Municipal Code. Solely
commercial uses are limited to a maximum FAR of 0.6. For mixed commercial
and residential projects, a maximum FAR of 1.0 is permitted.
Maximum Floor-Area Ratio:           0.6 for solely commercial projects
                                    1.0 for mixed-use projects
COMMERCIAL CENTER (C-CTR)
The Commercial Center designation applies to areas with a concentration of
diverse or intense commercial uses. The Del Amo Fashion Center and
Downtown Torrance are prime examples of
Commercial Center uses. Mixed-use commercial
and residential uses are also permitted.
Maximum FAR of 1.0 can be exceeded for mixed-
use projects with the approval of a conditional
use permit.
Maximum Floor-Area Ratio:           1.0
                                    Maximum FAR

                                    approval of a conditional use permit
RESIDENTIAL OFFICE (R-OF)
The Residential Office designation permits the location of less-intense office
uses and commercial uses adjacent to or in combination with residential uses.
The designation is intended to accommodate neighborhoods where businesses
and residential uses are gradually being combined. Smaller professional offices
are the most desirable office use in this designation. Housing can include low-
to medium-rise apartments or townhouses and condominiums on smaller lots.
Developments that integrate residential and office or commercial uses on a
single site will require approval of a conditional use permit.

1.3.3 INDUSTRIAL LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Torrance originally incorporated as a “Modern Industrial City”, and much of
Torrance’s industrial land remains a strong part of the City’s identity. Large
industrial areas include the Central Manufacturing District, located on the
eastern side of the City between Western Avenue and Hawthorne Boulevard,
from the San Diego Freeway to Del Amo Boulevard, and a second industrial
district located in the southern portion of the City, just north of the airport
from Skypark Drive to Kashiwa Street. A small concentration of industrial uses
can also be found in the East Victor Precinct, southwest of the corner of
Hawthorne and Del Amo Boulevards. The following three land use designations
provide areas for industrial and business park development.
HEAVY INDUSTRIAL (I-HVY)
Heavy Industrial uses are characterized by manufacturing
industries which process raw or extracted substances, or which
use hazardous materials. Heavy Industrial uses should be
segregated from other uses to mitigate safety hazards and
minimize noise, pollution, odors, vibrations, and other effects
on non-industrial properties. The oil refinery is the main use in
this designation.
Maximum Floor-Area Ratio: 0.6
LIGHT INDUSTRIAL (I-LT)
Uses in the Light Industrial designation
include a wide range of industrial uses
where manufacturing or assembly is
primarily limited to enclosed buildings,
professional and medical office, research
and development, warehouse, and wholesale uses.
Maximum Floor-Area Ratio: 0.6
BUSINESS PARK (I-BP)
Business Park uses include a mixture of business, professional and
medical office, research and development, and light industrial uses.
Ancillary retail uses are allowed to support these uses. Development
standards are more stringent than for other industrial designations to
maximize compatibility with neighboring uses.
Maximum Floor-Area Ratio: 0.6

1.3.4 PUBLIC AND MEDICAL LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Three land use designations provide for regulation and protection of publicly
owned properties, medical and medical-related facilities, and properties
restricted to airport uses.
PUBLIC/QUASI-PUBLIC/OPEN SPACE (PUB)
This designation provides for open space, land owned by
public agencies and jurisdictions, and land owned by private
entities for uses which serve the community, such as
utilities.
Floor-Area Ratio: Not Applicable
HOSPITAL/MEDICAL (HM)
The Hospital/Medical designation is intended to encourage the concentration of
established and proposed healthcare facilities and their related uses in a manner
that will provide for orderly growth of healthcare facilities. Appropriate uses
include hospitals, professional offices offering medical, dental, or related
services, and accessory buildings and facilities. For non-
hospital uses in this designation such as medical-related
offices, general office, and other non-medical uses, a
maximum FAR of 0.6 will apply. A maximum FAR of 1.0 will
apply to hospital-adjacent medical office uses. A maximum
2.5 FAR will apply only for full-service hospital uses. This
higher FAR for hospitals will allow greater flexibility for City
leaders to accept exceptional developments that mitigate
circulation and land use impacts. The expected FAR for
hospital development is closer to 1.0 FAR.
Maximum Floor-Area Ratio:         0.6 FAR for non-hospital uses
                                  1.0 FAR for hospital-adjacent medical office uses
                                  Maximum FAR may be exceeded for a full
                                  service hospital and related uses with approval
                                  of the Planning Commission and City Council.
AIRPORT (AIR)
The Airport designation applies to Torrance Municipal Airport and surrounding
City-owned properties.
Floor-Area Ratio: Not Applicable
1.3.5 IMPLICATIONS OF LAND USE POLICY
Over time, as properties transition from one use to another or property owners
choose to rebuild, land uses and intensities will gradually shift to align with the
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                   LU-15                            ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010
CHAPTER 1:            Land Use Element
intent of this Land Use Element. Given the almost built-out character of
Torrance, significant development activities may not occur over the life of this
General Plan and certainly, not all properties will be developed to the maximum
permitted intensities and densities. Table LU-2 summarizes the land use
distribution, expected level of development anticipated within each designation,
and the resulting residential and nonresidential outcomes that can be expected
through approximately 2025.
Implementation of the General Plan Land Use Plan to 75 percent of the
maximum potential is expected to result in 3,100 additional dwelling units,
7,800 new residents, and 1.3 million additional square feet of non-residential
development compared with expected build-out conditions under the 1992
General Plan land use. Over a 20-year period, this averages about 155 units per
year and 66,000 square-feet of non-residential development per year.
DEVELOPMENT ASSUMPTIONS
Density/Intensity
To define a realistic build-out scenario, assumptions about expected density
and intensity levels were made. Factors used to establish expected future
conditions include City policies in the Land Use Element, established land use
patterns, and past land use development trends. For the Low Density
Residential designation, a density of 6.8 dwelling units per acre is expected
based on existing conditions and on the limited likelihood that densities in
these neighborhoods will increase over the life of the General Plan. Expected
densities (du/ac) for all other residential land use categories are based on 75
percent of maximum allowable density, as units built within the past 20 to 30
years are not expected to be replaced, and physical conditions and provision of
on-site amenities will limit the ability of some redeveloped properties to achieve
the maximum densities. Similarly, for non-residential uses the maximum
permitted FARs will not be achieved citywide given relatively new commercial
uses surrounding the airport and constraints (for example, easements,
topography, access, parking, landscape, and buffering requirements) on
individual properties.
Projected Dwelling Units
Projected dwelling units in Table LU-2 have been calculated for each land use
designation that permits residential uses. Projected dwelling units are
calculated by multiplying the acres of residential land by the expected density
for that designation. Potential expected dwelling units included in the
Commercial Center and General Commercial designations are based on housing
units created through development of various mixed-use projects that were
constructed during the period from the adoption of the previous General Plan
update in 1992 to 2006. The calculation assumes that a proportionate number
of units will be created in the next 20 years. This is a conservative estimate, as
development along the Hawthorne Boulevard Corridor Specific Plan is largely
contingent upon the market demand for mixed-use residential/commercial
projects.

Assumptions:
a. Persons Per Household figure of 2.623 is from California Department of Finance data, 2006
b. Residential Occupancy Rate of 97.46% is from California Department of Finance data, 2006
c. FAR for Public/Quasi-Public/Open Space and Airport land uses is not considered an appropriate measure of the intensity of
impacts. Expected intensity (FAR) is for analysis purposes only
d. Density (du/ac) for the residential land use designations is based on 75% of maximum allowed density. As Torrance is mostly
built out and development has not, and is not expected to, reach the maximum allowed intensity over the life of the Plan, the 75%
figure is used to estimate future conditions.
e. Expected FAR figures are based on established development patterns for newer uses.
f. Residential Office assumes 50% residential, 50% office.
Notes:
1. For the Low Density Residential designation, a density of 6.8 dwelling units per acre is expected based on existing conditions
and on the limited likelihood that densities in these neighborhoods will increase over the life of the General Plan. All other
residential land use designations are based on 75% of maximum allowed density.
2. Dwelling units in the Commercial Center and General Commercial designations are based on housing units created within the
Hawthorne Boulevard Specific Plan Corridor between the 10-year period from the specific plan's inception in 1996 to 2006. The
calculation assumes that the same number of units created in that time period will be created in the next two 10-year periods (20
years). (Figure = current units + units created in the next 20 years).
3. Solely commercial uses in the General Commercial designation are limited to a maximum FAR of 0.6. To enable development of
mixed commercial and residential projects within this designation a maximum FAR of 1.0 will apply to mixed-use projects only.
4. For non-hospital uses in this designation such as general office and other non-medical uses, a maximum FAR of 0.6 will apply.
A maximum FAR of 1.0 will apply to hospital-adjacent medical office uses. The maximum FAR may be exceeded for a full service
hospital and related uses with the approval of the Planning Commission or City Council.
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                                    LU-17                                     ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010
CHAPTER 1:              Land Use Element
Dwelling units are also calculated for the Residential Office designation. Acres
within the Residential Office designation are divided into residential and office
uses, as indicated by the residential/office assumption of 50 percent residential
and 50 percent office.
Estimated Square Footage
Estimated square footage accounts for all building area of non-residential
buildings, meaning commercial, business park, and institutional uses. The
projection for non-residential development is calculated by multiplying the land
use acres for each land use designation by the expected FAR. The result is then
converted from acres to square feet.2 This yields the estimated square feet. The
numbers used in Table LU-2 are presented as a thousand square feet for ease of
reading.
Estimated Population
Estimated population is calculated by multiplying the projected dwelling units
by two factors: number of persons per household (2.623) and the occupancy
rate (97.46%). The number of persons per household and the occupancy rate
will change year to year, but for projection purposes, the City has used year
2006 estimates from the California Department of Finance, Demographic Unit
for the City of Torrance.
1.4       LAND USE AND ZONING CONSISTENCY
The Planning and Land Use Code (commonly referred to as the Zoning Code)
within the Torrance Municipal Code serves as the primary implementation tool
for the General Plan. Whereas the General Plan is a policy document and sets
forth direction for development decisions, the Torrance Municipal Code is a
regulatory document that establishes specific standards for the use and
development of all properties in the City. The Code regulates development
intensity using a variety of methods, such as setting limits on building
setbacks, yard landscaping standards, and building heights. The Code also
indicates which land uses are permitted in the various zones.
The City of Torrance is a charter city and is governed on the basis of a charter
that establishes its powers and authorities, as contrasted with a general law
city, which enjoys only those powers specifically granted to it by the State.
While general law cities are required by Section 65860 of the California
Government Code to have zoning ordinances that are consistent with the
General Plan, zoning ordinances in charter cities like Torrance are not required
to be consistent with the General Plan. Nonetheless, the City of Torrance
strives to have a zoning ordinance that is consistent with the objectives,
policies, general land uses, and programs in the General Plan. Table LU-3
identifies the correlation between Torrance’s zone districts and the General Plan
land use designations.

City.

CHAPTER 1:            Land Use Element
The City will work to ensure General Plan and zoning consistency by
prohibiting zoning of an isolated parcel in a manner which is inconsistent or
incompatible with surrounding zoning or land uses, and reviewing development
proposals for consistency with all applicable land use regulations.
The new Hospital/Medical land use designation will be implemented by the H-
M-D Hospital-Medical-Dental District. Hospital facilities are an important
resource that the City will work to protect and whose future expansion needs
will be important given the region’s growing and aging population.
Hospital/Medical uses are discussed in more detail in Sections 7.1 of this
Element. The policies in this section also address the need to create a zone
district to implement the General Plan Business Park designation.

2.         MAINTAINING A BALANCED
           COMMUNITY
The Oxford Dictionary defines balance as “a
condition in which different elements are                                                  Torrance City Seal:
equal or in the correct proportions.” The                                                  The City seal
                                                                                           promotes a balance
idea of Torrance as a balanced City dates                                                  in land uses to create
back to its founding days. Even though                                                     a place for people to
                                                                TOR RANCE
Torrance was founded as an industrial area,                                                live, work, and play.
City founders anticipated a need to balance
the major types of land uses. This belief                                     c 1984
was represented in the City motto: "A
Balanced City, Industrial, Residential,
Commercial." Balance is important to Torrance because it provides
opportunities for housing, commerce, and employment. Balance creates places
for people to live and a mechanism for the City to pay for the services that
residents and the business community need, such as safety services and
infrastructure. A good measurement of balance is the jobs-to-housing ratio,
which identifies potential imbalances between housing and employment
opportunities. The ratio of jobs to housing is estimated by dividing the number
of total number of projected jobs (total employment) by the total number of
dwelling units. In 2003, Torrance had a jobs-to-housing ratio of 2.02:1, or
slightly more than two jobs for each dwelling unit.4 This ratio is significantly
higher than the County of Los Angeles as a whole. In 2003 the County of Los
Angeles had a jobs-to-housing ratio of 1.22:1, or slightly more than one job for
each dwelling unit.5 In Torrance, the ratio of two jobs per dwelling unit means
that our community has more jobs than houses and it imports workers. The
City is proud of its large employment base and the financial and public service
benefits it provides to the community.
Balance also means ensuring that new development does not overwhelm the
City’s infrastructure and transportation systems. Balance can mean enacting
land use changes in appropriate locations to encourage improvements in areas
that do not function well due to age or lack of private investment. It also means
balancing the community’s desire to manage growth and protect the City’s
character with the rights of private property owners to develop their property.

CHAPTER 1:                 Land Use Element
2.1        A COMPATIBLE LAND USE PATTERN
A major issue in cities considered as highly desirable places to live, such as
Torrance, is the desire to protect the character of established neighborhoods
and districts from new development. The fear is that new construction will
result in developments that conflict with and even devalue established uses,
such as a new residential unit of a size, scale, or design that negatively impacts
surrounding uses. In Torrance, the General Plan and the Torrance Municipal
Code establish building and development standards for every property in the
City. If a property owner is compliant with these standards, they have an
inherent right to develop. The General Plan sets the City’s vision and provides
City staff with the necessary tools to work with property owners to
communicate the specific vision for a neighborhood at the outset of the
development process. One recurring theme in this Element and in the General
Plan that can be communicated is the desire to encourage uses that are
compatible physically and functionally with their surroundings. This includes
not only the size or look of a building, but also impacts on existing
neighborhoods or districts such as traffic, parking, noise, and school
enrollment. Policies in this Element encourage the transition of undesirable or
ineffective land uses, the establishment of compatible land uses, and the
consideration of development impacts on existing neighborhoods and districts.
2.2        BALANCING NEW DEVELOPMENT AND
           INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES
The City’s circulation system, which includes all modes of travel, has a
significant role in maintaining balance in Torrance. The City’s circulation system
must be able to support the type and intensity of land uses promulgated by
this Land Use Element. One of the most noticeable impacts from new
development is the increased demand on the City’s circulation and parking
infrastructure. The City’s Municipal Code warns that “failure to enhance the
ability of the City’s transportation system to accommodate increased traffic by
improving traffic flow will make it more difficult for residents, employers, and
employees to access residences and places of employment and could cause
unacceptable harm to the quality of life in the City.”6
The City recognizes and will promote strategies that mitigate traffic generated
by future development. To balance development demands on the City’s
circulation infrastructure, the City has enacted several impact fees. These fees
are assessed on new development to ensure that new development funds its
fair share of the cost to accommodate an increased demand on infrastructure
and services necessitated by that development. New development does not pay
for infrastructure and service gaps created by growth in general, only the

growth attributed to that specific development.7 New developments are
required to upgrade utilities, sewers, storm drain systems, and water lines to
offset the increased demand and pay school and park and recreation fees. The
City has implemented a Development Impact Fee Program to help finance
transportation enhancements, underground utilities, sewer and storm drain
improvements, and Police and Fire Department programs. The Development
Impact Fees are based on the type of development and the number of units or
floor area created. In addition, a major goal and theme of the Torrance General
Plan is to promote and facilitate travel by alternative modes of transportation
such as public transit, walking and bicycling.
2.3         SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
The Land Use Element will serve as a tool to plan for the future development of
the City of Torrance and to set priorities and goals for development types,
locations, and character. Inherent in the City’s long-range view of development
is the concept of sustainability. Planning for tomorrow’s Torrance includes
understanding that natural resources are limited and that these natural
resources must not be consumed faster than they can be replenished. But
sustainability does not preclude development, growth, and advancement.
Sustainability can promote positive economic growth and can stimulate
technological innovation, advance competitiveness, and improve our quality of
life.
A sustainable future for Torrance, under this General Plan, will utilize various                                Sustainability policies are
strategies to conserve and enhance local resources and safeguard the                                            discussed in detail in the
environment. The concept of sustainability is used throughout this General Plan                                 Community Resources

developments that reduce or better distribute travel demand, development
design and amenities that support transit and other alternative forms of
transportation, including bicycling and walking, and mixed-use developments
that encourage location of employment and commercial offerings near
residential units. The Community Resources Element includes policies and
programs that promote community sustainability and effective management of
renewable and non-renewable natural resources through energy and water
conservation, solid waste management, urban runoff reduction, recycling, and
sustainable, or green, building practices, including low impact development
practices which mimic a site’s pre-development hydrology by using design
practices and techniques that effectively capture, filter, store, evaporate, detain
and infiltrate runoff close to its source.

CHAPTER 1:            Land Use Element
A commonly accepted definition for sustainability, "development that meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs" calls for cities to become better stewards of the
environment to preserve a high quality of life for future generations of Torrance
residents.
2.4      LAND USE STUDY AREAS
Maintaining a balanced community requires periodic identification of areas
where growth or change will benefit the City. Because vacant land is scarce,
opportunities to enact positive changes through land use are limited. During
the General Plan process, several areas were identified as transition areas
experiencing land use changes, physical blight, or
stagnation and where properties are underutilized
or undervalued. The study areas were identified
based on interviews with the City Council, City
department heads, and members of the
community; community workshops; and City staff
and Planning Commission recommendations.
They represent areas where change will be
encouraged during the 20-year planning horizon of
this General Plan. These areas provide
opportunities for:
    More efficient or productive use of land
     resources;
    Potential for innovative mixed-use projects;
    Orderly expansion of health care facilities;
    Attractive and compatible new housing;
    Enhancing the City’s commercial base; and
    Recycling aging industrial uses and obsolete
     buildings.
While seven study areas were identified during the
General Plan update process, further analysis
revealed that only four of these study areas            In the study areas land uses may not be functioning to their full

than one percent of the total area within the City.8 The location of the study
areas that included land use changes at the periphery of the City is consistent
with expressed public desire to retain the qualities and character of distinct
residential neighborhoods, and to protect commercial and industrial districts
from intrusion from incompatible uses. New policies encourage more intense
uses along the City’s most-traveled corridors and create opportunities for
modest housing growth.
Several of the study areas have been in transition since the adoption of the
City’s 1992 General Plan, and the new land use designations reflect land use
changes that have occurred since. This is the case
along Redondo Beach Boulevard and Border
Avenue, where residential and commercial uses are
side by side, and in the Jefferson Oak study area,
where residential development has replaced
industrial uses that dated almost to the City’s
founding. Land use changes in the study area aim
to improve otherwise underused or poorly
maintained areas that have not lived up the
potential envisioned in prior General Plans. Along
Western Avenue, where small-scale commercial
and industrial uses have languished, land use
policies promote more intense uses and even
mixed-use to attract the private investment that
the area deserves.

STUDY AREA 2: WESTERN AVENUE SOUTH
Western Avenue forms the City’s eastern boundary
between Artesia Boulevard and 238th Street, and the
study area extends along Western Avenue between
Plaza Del Amo and 228th Street, just north of
Sepulveda Boulevard. Older offices and industrial
and business uses are the most predominant land
uses along this portion of the Western Avenue
corridor. The study area is surrounded on the west,
south, and east by residential neighborhoods.
To encourage the transition of aging and obsolete
industrial buildings to modern facilities and uses
more compatible with the adjacent residential
neighborhood, the Land Use Policy Map designates
all properties within the study area as Business Park.
As with the Crenshaw/Amsler area, the City
envisions that the incentive of increased intensity
and a broader range of allowed uses will encourage
new private investment and redevelopment.

STUDY AREA 3: BORDER AVENUE
The Border Avenue study area encompasses the
properties on the west side of Border Avenue just
south of Carson Street and north of Plaza del Amo.
Historically, Border Avenue has supported office and
light industrial uses, with several homes on small lots
interspersed among those uses. Due to the small lot
sizes, the plan to create a business park environment
has never been realized. The existence of residential
uses has further hindered this effort. The area is
located adjacent to a successful industrial district to
the east and a residential neighborhood to the west.
Transitioning of uses in this area will create a better
buffer between a major industrial district and
residential neighborhoods.
To accommodate the location of small, less intense
office uses adjacent to residential uses, the Land Use
Policy Map designates all properties in the study area
as Residential-Office (R-OF; Max. 0.6 FAR for solely
commercial or residential projects, 1.0 FAR for mixed-  The introduction of the Residential-Office land

CHAPTER 1:                Land Use Element
STUDY AREA 4: WESTERN AVENUE NORTH
The Western Avenue North study area spans Western Avenue
between Artesia Boulevard and 190th Street. Historic land uses
include neighborhood commercial businesses from 178th Street
to 186th Street, with larger, general commercial uses at major
intersections such as Artesia Boulevard and 186th Street. A
large mobile home park is located just south of the Southern
California Edison utility easement. South of 178th Street, the
study area is adjacent to single-family neighborhoods.
Issues in this area include the presence of outdated industrial and
commercial properties, an influx of newer commercial and
residential uses, and a need to develop a clear vision of how the
corridor should develop over the next 20 years.
A transition to more intense commercial use will encourage the
recycling of aging, poorly maintained industrial uses and create
tax generation opportunities. All properties are designated
General Commercial (C-GEN; Max. 0.6/1.0 FAR).

 uses lends to a lack of identity along this major corridor.

The study area includes a variety
of land uses. Commercial uses
consist mainly of local-serving
businesses. Larger commercial
clusters are located at the major
intersections             (Hawthorne
Boulevard, Prairie Avenue, and
Crenshaw Boulevard). Several
single-family               residential
properties are located on
commercially designated land
located east of Crenshaw Boulevard. Institutional facilities include a large
parking lot for El Camino College at the southwest corner at Crenshaw
Boulevard and a private elementary school at Ainsworth Avenue.
From the western edge of the City (at the intersection with Hawthorne
Boulevard) to Crenshaw Boulevard, residential land use designations have been
applied to reflect as-built densities of most of the properties, which is Medium
Density Residential (R-MD; 18.1-31 du/ac) to Medium-High Density (R-MH;
31.1-44 du/ac).
To provide opportunities for more intense commercial development and to
encourage commercial/residential mixed-use development, commercial
properties are designated General Commercial. Traditional commercial uses will
be limited to a maximum FAR of 0.6, whereas mixed-use developments may be
built up to a 1.0 FAR, consistent with zoning regulations.
Land use changes in this portion of the study area will reflect actual existing densities and
provide opportunities for more intense commercial development.

The Roadium Drive-in site (see Figure LU-11) is designated General Commercial,
reflective of the long-time prior use of the property as a drive-theater and later
as an outdoor swap meet. Given the limited permanent improvements on the
property, over time the site could transition to a commercial center with uses
that serve the neighborhood. Alternatively, this large site is well suited for a
mixed-use development.
Properties east of Atkinson Avenue are designated Residential Office (R-OF;
Max. 0.6 FAR for solely commercial projects, 1.0 FAR for mixed-use projects
and 18.1-31 du/ac). The transition to a Residential Office designation will
accommodate neighborhoods along the corridor where compatible office,
business, and residential uses can exist. The Residential Office designation will
permit the location of small, less-intense office uses adjacent to residential
uses. Citywide General Plan policies applicable to the residential uses on the
Roadium property emphasize protecting established residential neighborhoods
from new development impacts related to parking and traffic. The location of
this site at the City’s northern edge allows for easy access from a major
roadway and, pursuant to the policies in the Plan, the City may limit access to
the site via Redondo Beach Boulevard to reduce cut-through traffic into
adjacent single-family neighborhoods.

medical facilities in a manner that will establish and maintain orderly growth of
health care facilities in Torrance. In that regard, an additional study area with
similar issues was examined: the area of Lomita occupied by Torrance Memorial
Hospital. Like the Victor Precinct area, Lomita will be impacted in an as yet
unforeseeable manner by the expansion needs of the hospital. As the hospitals
are an important part of the community, a concept will be introduced for these
two areas that will look at the ”sphere of influence” of the hospitals, and allow
for changes in General Plan and zoning designations within that sphere. This
will allow for maximum flexibility both for the hospitals and for the City to
analyze and make use of the properties within the hospitals spheres of influence
in the most beneficial manner without having to make specific designations on
what may be a changing environment.
2.5       FLOOD MANAGEMENT
Consistent with AB162 (2007), the Land Use Element of the General Plan must
identify areas identified by flood plain mapping by either the Federal Emergency
Management Agency or the Department of Water Resources. To prepare and
mitigate hazards from flooding, the City of Torrance participates in the National
Flood Insurance Program. Flood Insurance Rate Maps, which are prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, maps potential flood zones. The
General Plan Safety Element presents flood hazard areas in Figure S-3.
2.6       BALANCED COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES AND
          POLICIES
Maintaining a balanced community remains a priority for Torrance. The
objectives and policies in the General plan will help the City balance continued
development pressures with the community’s desire to protect the charm and
character that has made Torrance a desirable place to live. The objectives and
policies address the need for new development that is functionally compatible
with the City’s existing neighborhoods and districts, proposes modest land use
changes to improve older areas at the City’s periphery, and ensures that new
development does not overwhelm the City’s infrastructure.
OBJECTIVE LU.2:                 A compatible land use pattern

                                Encourage the transition of incompatible, ineffective, and/or
Policy LU.2.2:                  undesirable land uses to land uses that are compatible and
                                consistent with the character of existing neighborhoods.
                                Consider both the impact of a proposed development on
Policy LU.2.3:                  surrounding property and the impact of existing uses on new
                                development.

3.        RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
Residential neighborhoods comprise the largest land use category in the City. In
2005, approximately 49 percent of land in the City was occupied by residential
development. Based on 2005 data, 38 percent of residential uses could be
categorized as Low Density, 11 percent Low-Medium to Medium-High Density,
and only 0.1 percent of units were considered High Density. Residential unit
growth in Torrance has remained very stable over time, showing only slight
growth since the adoption of the 1992 General Plan. Figure LU-14 shows that a
three percent growth in housing units occurred between 1992 and 2006, lower
than the five percent housing unit growth in Los Angeles County as a whole.9
The quality and character of the residential environment is one of the City’s
assets. Homes in Torrance are generally well maintained and in good condition.
Because they are proud to call Torrance home, residents expressed a desire to
maintain the quality and character of residential neighborhoods.
The demand for new, affordable homes throughout the Los Angeles region has
placed growth pressures on Torrance, and residents question how future
development patterns will affect their neighborhoods. The City recognizes the
diversity and quality of Torrance’s residential neighborhoods and is committed
to preserving established single-family neighborhoods by regulating
development and encouraging both property maintenance and rehabilitation.

          Long-time residents and newcomers to the community value the range of
          housing choices available. Census figures indicate that as of 2005, the median
          age of housing units in Torrance was 44 years10. As the City’s housing stock
          ages, the replacement of units is expected to increase over the life of this plan.
          The scarcity of vacant properties and the high cost of land will also prompt
          recycling of residential properties and a desire for more intensive residential
          uses that takes maximum advantage of property size. As an example, this
          function of vacancy and land costs has prompted an increased demand for
          condominiums and townhouses that resemble single-family homes at a lower
          housing cost.
          3.1          RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENT
          To acknowledge the diversity and character of Torrance residential areas, a
          closer look at the major residential areas is included below. Factors such as the
          type of housing, density, age, and demographic composition have played an
          important role in the development of these neighborhoods. The objectives and
          policies in this section are aimed to address the future development and
          maintenance issues in these areas.
          However, several issues resonate within all neighborhoods. Neighborhood
          residents place a high value on parks, trees, green space, and safety and
          security. Residents value the relatively low-scale nature of most neighborhoods
          and have expressed concern about a trend toward more intense development
          approaches both within their own neighborhoods and on properties that
          historically have supported non-residential uses. Residents have expressed that
          a key community value is to maintain the predominantly single-family character
          of residential neighborhoods.

RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRICTS IN TORRANCE
To best reflect in this General Plan the ideas and values or Torrance residents,
City staff met with the Coalition of Homeowners groups in 2007-2008 to
identify and describe the City’s residential districts. During these meetings,
residents contributed their thoughts and concerns about their neighborhoods,
as well as their vision. The following six residential neighborhood district
profiles respond to and reflect this community outreach effort. Figure LU-15
shows the location of the neighborhood areas.

boundary
The north end of Torrance is notable for its
proximity to the Mobil Oil Refinery and I-
405 freeway. The mix of residential types
includes single-family homes, multi-family
apartments,        and       condominiums.
Residents in North Torrance indicate that
they are less impacted by traffic issues
than are other areas of the City due to
ease of access to the I-405 and the well-
defined street grid in their neighborhoods.
Availability of parkland and freeway access are the most favored characteristics
in the area. While housing affordability in this area is seen as a benefit,
residents worry about housing maintenance issues.
Key issues that North Torrance residents would like to have addressed in their
neighborhoods include undergrounding of utilities, improved streetscape,
housing maintenance, and enhanced greenery. Traffic concerns focus on
improving mass transit opportunities and easing traffic congestion at major
intersections.

Neighborhood District: Old Torrance
Location: Bounded by Dominguez Street, Van Ness Avenue, and Torrance
Boulevard on the north, Western Avenue on the east, Plaza Del Amo on the south,
and Crenshaw Boulevard on the west
The Old Torrance neighborhood is notable for its historic structures, narrower
streets, small and narrow lots, and pedestrian-friendly character. Old Torrance
includes the original Torrance Tract and the Downtown redevelopment project
area.
Residents prize the historic homes, abundant and stately trees, and walkability
of the community. Of concern is the new face of development in the area, seen
as overly dense and not respectful of the existing historic ambiance. Many
residents would like to see historic preservation pursued more vigorously
through a Historic Preservation Overlay Zone or ordinances that would
recognize and protect Torrance’s physical history, as expressed through
buildings and public realm enhancements.
Neighborhood District: Central Torrance
Location: South of 190th Street, North of Sepulveda Boulevard, East of Prairie
Avenue, and West of Western Avenue
The central areas of Torrance contains a mix of residential, commercial, and
industrial uses such as the Mobil Refinery, the Industrial Redevelopment Project
Area, the Honda and Toyota Headquarters, the Torrance Civic Center, and the
Madrona Marsh Nature Center. Central Torrance also includes the Pueblo
neighborhood located along Del Amo, several 1980s- and 1990s-era planned

unit developments along Plaza Del Amo, and the single-family residential areas
west of Crenshaw Boulevard and north of Sepulveda Boulevard.
The Pueblo neighborhood, located on Del Amo Boulevard between Crenshaw
and Van Ness, is notable both for its age and direct proximity to the Mobil Oil
refinery. This area has many long-term and even multi-generational residents,
and has changed dramatically from an area in the early 1970s that had no street
paving into an area divided by a four-lane street that is used by cross-town
traffic. Homes in the Pueblo neighborhood have seen change as well, with a
mix of new homes side-by-side with original dwellings. Residents in this
neighborhood expressed concerns regarding potential contamination that may
result from proximity to the refinery.
Torrance Gardens is the subdivision adjacent to the Civic Center, and is notable
for its low-scale, single-family character. Homes are generally well kept,
traditional 1950s and 1960s residences, with some remodels to accommodate
changing family needs. Given the neighborhood’s proximity to the Del Amo
Fashion Center, residents have expressed concern about new development at
the Center and the associated impacts on the neighborhood. Similar concerns
arose subsequent to development of a sizeable gated community to the north,
with density compatibility and traffic generated by that development identified
as the top two concerns.

Neighborhood District: West Torrance
Location: South of 190thStreet, West of Prairie Avenue, North of Sepulveda
Boulevard to the western City boundary
The West Torrance neighborhoods encompass the Del Amo Fashion Center and
financial center, and the Hawthorne Boulevard commercial corridor. The district
includes pockets of multi-family developments located primarily between
Torrance Boulevard and Spencer Street and along Anza Avenue from Torrance
Boulevard to Del Amo Boulevard. However, the predominate type of residential
development consists of detached homes.
Residents appreciate and respect the separation between commercial and
residential uses. They have worked hard and wish to maintain attractive, well-
kept neighborhoods and community spirit. Residents worry about the
economic health of the commercial sector, and want to ensure that viable
businesses remain and that all commercial buildings maintain a neat and
professional appearance. Similar to residents in other neighborhoods, West
Torrance residents are concerned with traffic and with preserving what they see
as a highly desirable life-style.
Neighborhood District: South Torrance
Location: South of Sepulveda Boulevard, North of Pacific Coast Highway, bounded
on the west by Calle Mayor and Anza Avenue and extending to the eastern City
boundary.
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                  LU-41                         ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010
CHAPTER 1:            Land Use Element
The focal point of the South Torrance district is Torrance Airport, which is
bounded by light industrial businesses and the Torrance Memorial Hospital.
The Hawthorne Boulevard commercial corridor traverses the area, with
concentrations of commercial uses along Sepulveda Boulevard and Pacific Coast
Highway.
The majority of residential neighborhoods in South Torrance are of single-family
character, with pockets of multi-family developments west of Crenshaw
Boulevard, along Pacific Coast Highway. Area residents mention the parks and
open space, the pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, and the single family
character of the area as defining and desirable qualities. Airport noise is a
significant concern due to airport proximity. Residents are also concerned about
traffic and high-density development.
Neighborhood District: The Hillside
Location: South of Pacific Coast Highway, west of Calle Mayor and Anza Avenue,
South of Sepulveda Boulevard and bounded by the City borders to the West
This area of the City is notable for its less urban feel, with narrower, tree-lined
winding streets, hillsides, and views. The district is comprised almost
exclusively of single-family homes, with the exception of a few areas adjacent to
Pacific Coast Highway and Palos Verdes Boulevard. Residents mention the
scenic qualities and larger residential lots as the neighborhoods’ key character-
defining qualities. The Seaside Ranchos area is renowned for its Christmas light
display, while the Riviera neighborhood is well known for its dramatic ocean
and city vistas and distinctive architecture. Walteria, one of the City’s earliest
neighborhoods, contains a collection of noteworthy homes constructed prior to
the post-World War II housing boom. Residents feel a strong sense of
community.

The character of development is highly influenced by the Hillside Overlay Zone,
which is intended to protect views, light, air, and privacy. Residents are
concerned with overly large “McMansion” development in the hillside
neighborhoods, as well as the traffic and congestion impacts of home-based
businesses. Although concerns are constant regarding trees and viewshed
protection on individual lots, generally residents would like to see more street
trees. Residents look to preserve neighborhood character by ensuring that new
homes are built to scale with the rest of the neighborhood. Although the
hillside district has not been affected by local building trends that favor more
dense development, residents are nonetheless concerned that such trends will
impact their neighborhoods.
3.2       RESIDENTIAL OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The objectives and policies presented in this section and throughout the Land
Use Element will ensure that new development is respectful of existing
neighborhoods and contributes positively to the aesthetic quality of Torrance’s
neighborhoods. The main objective with respect to the residential environment
is to assure development that will most benefit the community while
acknowledging the interests of private property owners.

4.        COMMERCIAL
          DISTRICTS
Quality of life depends on a healthy local
economy. Businesses in Torrance’s commercial
districts provide important services to residents
and create a strong tax revenue base for the City.
Revenue from commercial businesses supports

services, community services, and public
facilities. In 2002, retail sales in the City made

opportunities remain, Torrance’s long-term fiscal stability is closely tied to the
continued stable financial performance of its existing commercial districts.
While some retail sectors function better than others, overall Torrance has a
stable tax base. A 2005 study indicated that between 1992 and 2000, the
total taxable sales transactions remained relatively constant from $3.1 billion in
1992 to $3.5 billion in 2002 (using constant 2004 dollars).12 The largest retail
growth (83 percent growth between 1992 and 2002) was for the auto dealers
and supplies category, while taxable retail sales for apparel, food stores, and
home furnishings declined between1992 and 2002.13 Locally and regionally,
Torrance’s retail market is one of the strongest. Taxable retail sales per capita in
Torrance were the second highest among the South Bay cities, at $19,935. El
Segundo had the highest per capita taxable retail sales among these cities at
$22,320. In comparison, the County of Los Angeles had per capita taxable retail
sales of $8,048.14
Commercial districts in Torrance vary in character and intensity based on
location. Commercial districts serving a more local market are dispersed
throughout the City in proximity to residential neighborhoods and at key
intersections. Regional commercial districts along Hawthorne Boulevard,
Crenshaw Boulevard, and Pacific Coast Highway cater to a broader population
base. Torrance’s pattern of concentrating regional and local serving commercial
development along key commercial corridors is one the City will maintain. In
addition, the location of regional centers in areas with adequate transportation
access and public transit availability is important. Larger retail attractors in
regional centers play an important role, as they generate a spill-over effect
benefiting smaller, adjacent businesses. This pattern also provides the
opportunity for a greater use of transit, bicycling, and walking.
Similar to residential areas, the scarcity and high cost of land will, in addition to
a more competitive regional commercial market, contribute to the desire to
intensify existing commercial areas to take full advantage of a property’s
economic potential. Advanced planning for commercial uses in Torrance must
balance land use recycling and private redevelopment, which will allow the
intensification of existing commercial uses and contribute to higher retail tax
revenue for the City, with the ability to mitigate the implications of more
intense developments such as traffic and parking.

CHAPTER 1:             Land Use Element
4.1       COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS IN TORRANCE
As of 2005, commercial uses accounted for
approximately 12 percent of all land uses in
the City. Commercial districts include
retail and service uses, professional and
medical offices, restaurants, entertainment
facilities, banks, and automotive sale uses.
Commercial development in Torrance is
located as shown in Figure LU-16, along
Hawthorne Boulevard, Torrance Boulevard,
Sepulveda Boulevard, and Pacific Coast
Highway; in Old Torrance; and the Del
Amo Business District. Over the life of the
General Plan, each of Torrance’s
commercial districts will encounter issues
related to continued financial success as
markets change and the need to upgrade
aging structures.
4.1.1 HAWTHORNE
          BOULEVARD
Hawthorne Boulevard serves as the City’s
main commercial corridor. Spanning six
miles from the northern to southern City
limits, the corridor supports several large
shopping centers located at key
intersections.      Large shopping centers
                                             Commercial districts in Torrance vary in character and intensity based on

Fashion Center), Artesia Boulevard (South                                                         Figure LU-16:
Bay Galleria-in the City of Redondo Beach),
and Del Amo Boulevard (Promenade).                             Commercial Districts in Torrance
Commercial development located outside
the Del Amo business district generally is characterized by older “strip”
developments common in many Southern California cities. Because of increased
demand for commercial services, many property owners have undertaken full or
partial redevelopment, and continued improvements are expected over the life
of this Plan.
To provide a comprehensive and integrated plan for this important commercial
corridor, the City adopted the Hawthorne Boulevard Corridor Specific Plan
(HBCSP) in July of 1996. The HBCSP includes provisions for new and more
intense commercial development, including increased housing opportunities,
ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010                         LU-46                         CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN

while protecting existing and future residential neighborhoods from potentially
intrusive impacts.
Maintaining a competitive retail environment and addressing traffic concerns
while providing for future growth and intensification along Hawthorne
Boulevard will be a key challenge for the City. The success of the corridor is tied
to allowing for a broad range of commercial uses reflective of market demand,
easily accommodating regional traffic and consumers, providing better transit
access, and integrating uses such as higher-density housing at key locations.
General Plan policies that encourage pedestrian- and transit-friendly site design
and require mitigation of traffic impacts necessitated by new or intensified
developments will guide this success.
4.1.2 DEL AMO BUSINESS DISTRICT
The largest and most intense concentration of
commercial development in the City is at the Del
Amo Business District, generally bounded by
Ocean and Madrona Avenues and Torrance and
Sepulveda Boulevards. The Del Amo Fashion
Center, Del Amo Financial Center, and many
other retail and office uses are located in this
area. The Del Amo Fashion Center is a super-
regional shopping center that includes a
approximately three million square feet of retail
space.15 Once considered a premier shopping
center, the original Del Amo Mall experienced a
downturn in the 1990s due to lack of investment
and outdated site design and retail offerings. An
extensive renovation of the north wing was
completed in 2006 to create a two-level outdoor Del Amo Fashion Park: The Del Amo Fashion Center is a
promenade         with      retail,     dining,       and super-regional shopping center that serves as a major

entertainment establishments. Access will be
improved with the extension of Del Amo
Boulevard between Crenshaw Boulevard and Maple Avenue, and the widening a
segment of Del Amo Boulevard between Maple Avenue and Prairie Avenue.
Policies that encourage maintenance and upkeep of properties will be important
for assuring that the district remains a retail driving force and can adjust to the
changing demands of the retail market. The fiscal health will also be tied to the
success of neighboring areas, particularly Hawthorne Boulevard, as it will
provide opportunities to attract new customers and visitors to the area.

Torrance remain important City
objectives. While the layout and
architectural character of commercial
uses in Old Torrance provide an ideal
opportunity for people to visit several
different shops and services within
walking distance of each other, growth
and renewal of this area may be
inhibited by the small parcel sizes, the
lack of expansion space, and
insufficient parking for many existing stores and businesses.
To make Old Torrance a dynamic and more viable downtown, improvements in
the area must focus on intensification of uses, strengthening the type of and
mix of tenants, and attracting recognizable retailers to the area that
complement local businesses. Parking deficiencies must also be addressed, as
this may be deterring a rise in activity. The City envisions an invigorated Old
Torrance that attracts “magnet” or “destination” uses−uses that have regional
appeal and attract other retail tenants. Priority should be placed on attracting
uses that create activity and generate foot traffic. For example, many uses in
Old Torrance have one-stop patrons who leave the area once their business is
complete. A rise in activity levels and the establishment of complementary uses
to those in the area can persuade business patrons to extend their visits in
Downtown.
Commercial development in Old Torrance also needs to build upon and enhance
the qualities that set this area apart from other commercial areas in the City.
New businesses should respect the historical pattern of development and offer

design that is compatible and complementary with the area’s established
character. The adaptive reuse of older structures will be supported, as this can
preserve architectural treasures by creating a new uses for the structure.
Overall, creating a vision for the future Old Torrance that encourages economic
growth while satisfying the interests and desires of the Old Torrance business
community, historic preservation groups, and residents will be the key
challenge.
4.1.4 COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS
Significant commercial development in Torrance is
located along major roads such as Crenshaw, Lomita,
Torrance, and Sepulveda Boulevards, and Pacific Coast
Highway. Along these corridors, larger shopping
centers located at key intersections serve as anchors for
smaller commercial uses located mid-block.
While many shopping areas in the City exhibit high-
quality architecture and outstanding landscaping, many
consist of older structures and outdated site design
that do not encourage pedestrian activity.            As
commercial competition in the region increases,
businesses will need to adapt to the changing
marketplace. As renovation and turnover occur in older
commercial areas, updated site design, façade
improvements, and incorporation of design themes Torrance Crossroads Shopping Center: Attractive
that complement individual districts will be building and site design, extensive landscape
                                                             treatments, and retailers and food establishments
encouraged. Site design that facilitates and encourages with a regional appeal have contributed to the success
pedestrian and transit access can create organic growth of the shopping center.
by improving activity for neighboring businesses. For
newer shopping areas, site maintenance and upkeep will help these centers
from becoming obsolete, help them to remain competitive, and continue to
attract customers and desirable retailers.
4.2       COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS OBJECTIVES AND
          POLICIES
The City will maintain a viable retail base on which to base future revenue and
in turn provide a high level of public services to residents and businesses. To
ensure a successful commercial base, the City and business community will
need to respond to changing trends in the marketplace. On-going evaluation of
the commercial base, balanced distribution of commercial land uses, and high
maintenance standards will maintain the City’s commercial districts as leading
retail destinations in the South Bay.

5.       MIXED USE
Mixed-use development refers to the mixing of compatible land uses such as
residential, commercial, and office. While existing in different varieties, in most
mixed-use structures or developments, commercial retail is encouraged as a
focal point, particularly on ground-floor levels, as it can encourage increased
activity at neighboring uses. Housing can be integrated within the same
building or as separate, adjacent, free-standing use. Walkability and pedestrian
access are key considerations for successful mixed-use developments.
Combining land uses in appropriate locations and with appropriate site design
can be beneficial to businesses and residents. Retailers have the assurance that
they will always have customers living right above them or nearby, while
residents have the benefit of being able to walk to get groceries, find personal
services, have dinner, or see a movie.

   Mixed-Use in Old Torrance: Mixed-use in Torrance will vary between lower intensity development that reuses buildings
   of architectural interests (left) and newer, larger scale development (right).
5.1        MIXED-USE IN TORRANCE
The location of mixed-use developments in appropriate locations is essential for
its success. Mixed-use developments should be located in areas where services
and transportation are most available and do not interfere with established
residential neighborhoods. In Torrance, future mixed-use developments will
most likely be located in Old Torrance, along major commercial corridors, and at
key activity nodes such as major commercial intersections where development
is compatible with surrounding land uses. These corridors include Redondo
Beach, Hawthorne, Torrance, Crenshaw, and Sepulveda Boulevards. In Old
Torrance, mixed-use can revitalize older building and add to the charm and
character of the area. The design of many older buildings also offers
opportunities for creative mixed-use projects, as the ground floors and upper
floors are already visually distinct.
The General Plan allows mixed-use development within the General
Commercial, Commercial Center, and Residential-Office) land use designations.
General Commercial encourages commercial and office or residential mixed-use
developments along major corridors by allowing a higher intensity of
development (1.0 FAR), compared with solely commercial uses.16                               In
neighborhoods where office/business and residential uses are already gradually
being combined, the Residential-Office land use designation will allow the
location of small, less-intense office uses adjacent to residential uses. In these
areas, smaller professional offices are the most desirable office use. Residential-
Office housing can include low- to medium-rise apartments or townhouses and
condominiums on smaller lots. Developments that integrate residential and
office uses within one structure and live-work arrangements will continue to
require some form of discretionary review, such as a conditional use permit.
16
   Solely commercial developments will be limited to a 0.6 FAR.

CHAPTER 1:            Land Use Element
Pending the establishment of mixed-use design guidelines for Torrance, a case-
by-case review of individual project proposals will be required to ensure that
the development is located on appropriate sites, compatible with surrounding
land uses, and appropriately integrates commercial and residential or office
uses. Project review ensures that concerns are mitigated prior to construction.
Relevant issues to be considered during project review include parking, on- and
off-site pedestrian and vehicular circulation, transit access, the provision of
open space and recreational facilities for residents, and impacts from traffic,
noise, glare, and pollution on the residential component of the project.
5.2      MIXED-USE OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Mixed-use in Torrance offers residents the opportunity to live in an urban
environment without disrupting established residential neighborhoods, and
provides the City with a way to incorporate a mix of housing on a small scale
while enhancing the aesthetic character of commercial areas. Mixed-use also
has the potential to invigorate struggling areas and spur economic development
by enhancing an area’s unique identity and development potential. Due to
recent construction of mixed-use projects in Torrance the viability of mixed-use
is gradually gaining community acceptance. For mixed-use to succeed in
Torrance, this type of development must be approached in a comprehensive
manner that addresses site location, design, functionality, and amenities.
Creating a vision for mixed-use and how it will help achieve City goals − and
including community participation in this process − will be key goals during
the life of the General Plan. Urban design issues for mixed-use development are
addressed in Section 8.2.6 of this Element.

6.        INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS
Torrance was developed as a City with prominent industrial uses, and these
uses continue to be an important part of the City’s identity. Torrance has
periodically reinforced policies which preserve its industrial base, encourage
cooperation in the maintenance and improvement of the industrial
environment, and minimize conflicts between industry and adjacent land use.
This General Plan continues emphasize the importance of industrial uses to the
City’s financial future.
6.1       INDUSTRIAL USES IN TORRANCE
Industrial uses in Torrance provide the City with a valuable source of
employment and revenue, as well as a regional industrial focal point that
includes many multi-national corporations and valuable oil production and
processing plants. Torrance industry has contributed to a concentration of
industrial employment compared with the County of Los Angeles as a whole.
In 2005, manufacturing industries contributed approximately 15 percent of the
total employment in the City of Torrance, a figure slightly higher than the
proportion of industrial jobs at the County level (12 percent).17
A 2005 land use survey indicated that industrial uses cover 2,276 acres, or 22
percent of the City’s total land use.18 Industrial uses in Torrance include light
and heavy industry, which include traditional industrial processes such as
manufacturing, processing, warehousing, packaging or treatment of products,
and business park uses, which typically include research and development,
warehousing, and office uses, with ancillary and limited commercial uses.
Industrial development is concentrated in two main districts: the Central
Manufacturing District (generally between Western Avenue and Hawthorne
Boulevard, from I-405 to Plaza Del Amo), and the Southern Industrial District
that includes airport land and areas north of the airport. The East Victor
Precinct located north of Torrance Boulevard and west of Hawthorne Boulevard
has a smaller concentration of industrial uses.

                                             Industrial Districts in Torrance
6.1.1 CENTRAL MANUFACTURING DISTRICT
The Central Manufacturing District contains the largest concentration of
industrial uses in Torrance. Because it is bordered by major roads, the district is
reasonably well buffered from conflicting land uses such as residential
neighborhoods.
ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010                                    LU-54                        CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN

  The most dominant physical and industrial feature of this district is the Exxon
  Mobil Oil Company refinery. The refinery, established in 1929, produces nearly
  10 percent of the gasoline sold in California, employs nearly 800 people, and
  generates millions of tax dollars for the City.19 Industrial uses from 190th
  Street to Torrance Boulevard include the campus environments of the American
  Headquarters of Honda and Toyota. Land use changes in this area are not
  anticipated over the life of this General Plan, although the expansion and
  upgrade of the automobile company campuses are likely to occur. Given the
  employment and revenue benefits to Torrance, protecting industrial land in this
  area represents a City priority.
  6.1.2 SOUTHERN INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
  The Southern Industrial District is developed with a mix of light industrial uses,
  including office, light manufacturing, and warehousing and distribution. This
  industrial area is buffered from non-industrial land uses by major roads and
  commercial development. Because the north boundary is adjacent to residential
  uses, manufacturing uses require a Precise Plan of Development to minimize
  land use conflicts.

  Nearby commercial uses will play an important role in the future of this area, as
  the leading issue is the development pressure from neighboring commercial
  uses. As commercial uses in this area look to expand, they are constrained by
  residential uses and may explore future development possibilities on industrial

land. The City recognizes the importance of this area as a means to achieve
employment objectives and will limit commercial expansion into this area.
Strengthening industrial uses here and citywide through design plans and
business development will also promote viable industrial development.
6.1.3 EAST VICTOR PRECINCT
The East Victor Precinct industrial area is located southwest of the Hawthorne
and Del Amo Boulevards intersection. Formerly a manufacturing area, the area
now contains a mix of industrial, office, and residential uses. Many of the
approximately 33 acres of industrial land are surrounded by residential uses. To
minimize land use conflicts in this area, the City will continue to require a
Precise Plan of Development for industrial uses and work toward attracting
clean, quiet industrial uses that offer employment and revenue benefits.
6.2      INDUSTRIAL OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Torrance recognizes the importance of retaining its strong industrial base to
meet revenue and employment needs. Therefore, the City will preserve the
primary industrial land uses and encourage intensification and/or
redevelopment of underutilized industrial parcels. Expanding industrial uses
significantly is not feasible due to the lack and high cost of vacant land.
However, over time, market forces may create a demand for more office space or
more intense business park or warehouse uses than exist in the industrial
districts. Considering ways to increase the intensity of uses throughout the
City’s industrial areas will encourage more productive use of limited land
resources.
More non-traditional, non-industrial uses, such as medical offices, retail sales of
large home appliances and building supplies, recreational facilities, wholesale
and retail warehouse stores, vocational schools, and churches, have been
allowed in industrial areas. Non-industrial uses, when regulated through by
development and performance standards or through a use permit on a case-by-
case basis, are often more appropriately located in an industrial or business park
setting rather than in commercial area or residential neighborhood where
impacts would be greater or more harmful. The provision of sufficient on-site
parking shall be considered when non-industrial uses result in higher parking
demand. Potential impacts created by the permanent or interim use of tenant
space for non-industrial uses should be adequately mitigated. The ability to
convert or reconvert a building or tenant space for an industrial use should be
considered when allowing a non-industrial tenant. Ensuring the presence of
appropriate tenants in industrial developments can minimize safety and traffic
conflicts and ensure that these areas are preserved for industrial businesses that
contribute positively to the City economy through jobs creation and tax
revenue.

In areas where industrial uses are located in close proximity to residential,
public, or commercial uses, the City will continue to minimize land use
conflicts by requiring a Precise Plan of Development and working with
businesses and developers to mitigate impacts related to industrial processes.

                                maintain safe, high-quality industrial developments.
7.        PUBLIC AND QUASI-PUBLIC USES
Public and quasi-public uses include private and publicly owned land serving
public agencies. Public uses include the Civic Center, public schools, parks,
government facilities, police and fire stations, libraries, and water treatment
facilities. Quasi-public uses include land owned by private entities that serve a
community-wide function, such as private schools and utility easements.
Public and quasi-public uses are an important part of what makes Torrance a
desirable place to live. The Public/Quasi-Public land use designation is intended
to protect, encourage, and expand, where possible, uses essential for the
provision of public services. In response to changing demographics over time,
the City will re-evaluate its public services and facilities to better serve the
community. For example, the increase in senior-aged residents will necessitate
community facilities that can serve the health, education, and cultural
enrichment needs of senior citizens. Community facilities and services such as

CHAPTER 1:            Land Use Element
parks and recreation, libraries, schools, sumps (basins), and drainage facilities
are discussed in detail in the Community Resources Element. Emergency
facilities such as police and fire stations are discussed in the Safety Element.
Hospitals and the Torrance Municipal Airport are discussed below to address
land-use-related issues.
Although not included in the Public/Quasi-Public designation, private amenities
in residential development provide additional, although limited community
resources. The Torrance Municipal Code (Division 9: Land Use) establishes
requirements for inclusion of useable open space in residential development.
7.1       HOSPITAL FACILITIES
The City of Torrance has two full-care hospitals within its corporate limits.
Little Company of Mary Hospital (LCMH), located north of Torrance Boulevard
between Earl Street and Hawthorne Boulevard, features 317 acute care beds and
a full range of primary care and medical-surgical services. In addition to the
primary hospital facility, LCMH operates an Outpatient Radiology Center
located just north of the Del
Amo Shopping Center, the
LCMH Pavilion, a 121-bed
transitional and long-term care
facility located a block west of
the hospital, and offices for

In addition to providing invaluable medical resources, these two major hospitals
generate revenue and employment benefits to Torrance. National labor
statistics indicate that wage and salary employment in the healthcare industry
is projected to increase 27 percent through 2014, compared with 14 percent for
all industries combined.20 This increased demand can benefit the Torrance
community, as average earnings of non-supervisory workers in most health care
segments are higher than the average for all private industry, with hospital
workers earning considerably more than the average and those employed in
nursing and residential care facilities and home healthcare services earning
less.21 Average earnings often are higher in hospitals because the percentage of
jobs requiring higher levels of education and training is greater than in other
segments.
Previous General Plan policies sought to contain medical uses within their
historic locations due to perceived traffic impacts and limited expansion needs.
Through the first decade of the twenty-first century, the need for medical
services and full-service hospitals in particular has become acute, and these
demands are anticipated to increase. Factors contributing to high demand for
health services include an aging population which will continue to require more
services, medical technological advances which have increased longevity and

care focal point for the South Bay and create higher wage jobs for the Torrance
community. Expansion efforts will also include addition of medical office space
in close proximity to the hospitals. Medical offices are a critical component of a
hospital campus, as they allow doctors to locate private offices in close
proximity. By concentrating medical uses, the City of Torrance can benefit from
economic activity related to medical uses and a potential increase in the
number of professional, higher-paid medical jobs.
To support the concentration of existing and
proposed healthcare facilities and their related
uses in a manner that will establish and maintain
orderly growth of health care facilities, a new
land use designation has been created. The
Hospital/Medical designation will encourage the
establishment and expansion of hospitals;
professional offices offering medical, dental, or
related services; and accessory buildings and
facilities. The Hospital/Medical designation
allows a 0.6 FAR for non-hospital uses such as
medical related offices, general office, and other
non-medical uses. The 0.6 FAR may be exceeded
for a full-service hospital and related uses with
the approval of the Planning Commission or City
Council. A maximum FAR of 1.0 is allowed for
                                                     The Hospital/Medical (HM) land use designation will encourage

a new 225,000-square foot hospital tower that would necessitate the addition
of 500 parking spaces.22 The new tower will accommodate 178 beds, a variety
of support services, and an expanded emergency room. LCMH also looks to
expand its medical offerings with the addition of medical office space in areas
adjacent to or near the main hospital. Between 2006 and 2020, LCMH hopes to
add 400,000 square feet of office space and 2,000 parking spaces.
The City of Torrance will work closely with LCMH and Torrance Memorial
Hospital to facilitate the expansion of medical facilities within the ”sphere of
influence” adjacent to or in close proximity to the existing hospital facilities. In
these areas, the City will consider land use and zoning changes to
accommodate hospital-related development, as reflected in Policy LU.9.7. The

expansion of medical facilities will only be undertaken with affected property
owners’ consent and participation in the process. Neither the City nor the
hospitals will acquire properties through condemnation. The sole intent of
Policy LU.9.7 is to facilitate expansion of hospital facilities as those properties
become available to the hospitals.
In addition to accommodating land use and zoning changes, expansion of
hospital facilities on non-contiguous properties will be acceptable. This
expansion of medical facilities will also occur in a manner and timeline that
takes into consideration parking requirements and the capability of existing
infrastructure to absorb increased activity. As is the case with other types of
development, hospital facilities will pay their full fair share of the cost of added
services and public facilities necessitated by their expansion.
7.2       TORRANCE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT
Torrance Municipal Airport, also known as Zamperini Field, has been of service
to the aviation community for many years by
providing regional aviation access to recreational
pilots, businesses, and emergency services flights.
Many aeronautics-related businesses are located
on the 500-acre airport property. Of this area, 140
acres are leased at commercial rates for non-
aeronautical purposes, and a total of 360 acres are
dedicated to aeronautical use. About 140 acres of
the aeronautical land is open and partially used for
agriculture.23 The benefits of having a municipal
airport extend beyond airport property. The airport
can facilitate business attraction and retention, as
it provides local air access to businesses and
industries that rely on frequent air travel.
The airport is owned and operated by the City of Torrance Municipal Airport: The goals of the Torrance
Torrance. Originally called Lomita Flight Strip, the Municipal Airport are: Safe operations to, from, and
                                                            around the Airport, harmony among the diverse

the City in 1948, and finally deeded in 1956. The
City has full control of the administration and daily
operations at the Airport. The City coordinates with agencies such as the Los
Angeles County Airport Land Use Commission and the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on issues related to safety. The FAA is responsible for
control of airspace. The City limits based aircraft to 825 airplanes, which does
not include transient aircraft which visit the field for a brief time, and which
may be parked or tied down at the airport. Some types of aircraft are banned
from the airport because they are considered too noisy and incapable of

meeting the City's stringent noise ordinance (Municipal Code Division 4,
Chapter 6, Article 8: Aircraft Noise Limits). While noise related to aircraft
operations is expected, noise complaints and noise levels have declined over the
years since the inception of the City's Noise Abatement Program.
7.2.1 AIRPORT LAND USE COMPATIBILITY AND SAFETY
         ZONES
The variety of air services and separate
flight paths at an airport require regional
coordination to prevent confusion in
flight patterns and to maintain safety.
Potential damage to aircraft may also
result in loss of life and property along
flight paths. Noise-related issues also
negatively      affect   residents     and
businesses located in close proximity to
the airport’s flight path. To avoid such
outcomes, the FAA has established land
use restrictions to areas surrounding
airports and flight paths. To comply with
FAA regulations, a Runway Protection
Zone (RPZ) has been established at each
end of each active runway at Torrance
Municipal Airport. A RPZ is an area at
ground level that provides for the
unobstructed passage of landing aircraft
through the above airspace.24 The
geographic scope of the RPZ is

                                                   CHAPTER 1:           Land Use Element
State law requires that General Plans be consistent with land use compatibility
plans established by an Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC). The Los Angeles
County ALUC Land Use Plan, which covers Torrance Municipal Airport, was
adopted in 1991. The land use plan is intended to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare of the public by minimizing the public’s exposure to
excessive noise and safety hazards within and around public use airports.
When a city whose territory falls within the influence area of a particular airport
amends its General Plan, referral must be made to the appropriate ALUC for
determination on consistency with the ALUC’s Comprehensive Land Use Plan
(CLUP).25
To maintain land use compatibility in and around the airport, the City will
require that land use decisions within the airport-influence area be consistent
with the General Plan Safety Element and the Torrance Airport CLUP. To ensure
the City’s vision for the future of the airport is consistent with regional airport
planning efforts, close coordination with the Los Angeles County ALUC will be
maintained, particularly when the Commission commences revisions to the
Airport Land Use Plan. Airport-related safety and noise issues are addressed in
more detail in the Safety and Noise Elements, respectively.

8.        URBAN DESIGN
Urban design encompasses many components for cities: the functional aspects
of buildings and space, landscaping, safety and accessibility, and elements of a
more subjective nature. The primary objective of urban design is to achieve
beautiful, inspiring, and successful neighborhoods and business districts. Well-
designed, well-built projects that fit into existing neighborhoods are good for
the community. Good community design is not only intended to improve the
physical appearance of the City, but also to invigorate the local economy by
attracting shoppers and visitors. Areas in Torrance where urban design is
critically important include Old Torrance, older commercial and industrial
districts that will be re-developed during the life of this General Plan, and new
residential developments.
When discussing urban design, it is important to note that while design
objectives that aim to improve the appearance of the City are important and
future establishment of design guidelines will be appropriate in Torrance, these
topics and documents must function with the acknowledgement that existing

regulations may prevail, specifically zoning, and that they must be balanced
with the rights of owners to develop their property in accordance with
established regulations.
8.1       WHAT IS GOOD URBAN DESIGN?
Desired design elements should be required of homeowners, business owners,
architects, and developers to achieve superior quality and design of new
construction and additions to existing buildings in Torrance. In general, good
urban design aims to:
         Establish distinct identities for residential neighborhoods and
          commercial districts;
         Create attractive and functional urban environments;
         Increase occupant satisfaction and community pride, inspiring ongoing
          concern and care for the project or building;
         Enhance and help stabilize neighborhoods, primarily through the pride
          and commitment of occupants’ or owners’ respect for the project;
         Ensure durability and easy maintenance; and
         Appreciate in value, all other things being equal.
Throughout the General Plan, terms such as attractive and high quality are used
to describe the type of development that Torrance will strive to achieve. As
mentioned in the introduction to this Element, these terms are highly
subjective, and an evaluation of what is attractive or of high quality can change
from person to person and from time period to time period. The Land Use
Element and this section in particular can serve as a foundation for decision-
making related to aesthetic value. The goals,
objectives, and policies can guide future efforts to
establish urban design guidelines or standards.
8.2       URBAN DESIGN
          COMPONENTS
Urban design initiatives aim to improve both the
beauty and function of developments, areas, and
even whole cities. Architecture, landscaping, and
signage together can convey a city’s values,
standards, and cultural past, which in turn can
create a sense of “place” and an identity. Rather than

look and activity of the spaces between them. As
interest in the development market for mixed-use structures in Torrance
increases, urban design concepts such as landscaping, walkable site design,
gateways, and signage will be important.

CHAPTER 1:            Land Use Element
Figure LU-21 indicates activity nodes, gateways, and major corridors where
urban design concepts can be applied.
8.2.1 LANDSCAPING
Landscaping enhances the look and feel of cities. Often treated as a secondary
consideration or eliminated altogether due to cost constraints, landscaping is a
critical component of any successful development project and should be
considered an essential part of the design process. Landscaping along major
corridors in Torrance creates a first impression of the community. Landscape
treatments provide a more inviting environment for pedestrians in key activity
centers and corridors. In keeping with the recurring theme of walkability, urban
design should take into account how and when pedestrians will interact with
the environment. If new development and redevelopment in Torrance is to
contribute to the aesthetic beauty of the City, landscaping will be an important
tool to achieve this.
The Community Resources Element addresses street aesthetics and the
importance of trees and landscaping. As mentioned in that Element (Section
3.7), the City will continue to implement a master landscaping plan that
defines the types, sizing, and spacing of street trees, and that sets forth a
comprehensive approach for replacing older trees that die. As appropriate, this
effort will be accomplished in conjunction with the development of corridor
plans for arterial streets and with plans for key entry points into Torrance. The
Implementation Program for the Community Resources Element also includes
programs to create master landscaping plans for all City streets and parkways,
defining the types, sizing and spacing of street trees.
Appropriate landscaping as part of low-impact development (LID) site design
can also contribute to compliance with storm water regulations as LID uses the
landscape areas in developments to filter and infiltrate storm water. In LID
principles and practices, water can be managed in a way that reduces the
impact of built areas and promotes the natural movement of water within an
ecosystem or watershed. LID is discussed in the Community Resources
Element.

8.2.2 WALKABILITY
Good urban design that includes pedestrian access and amenities and offers a
pleasurable walking environment can help create successful shopping centers
and residential areas. Because of the demands of automobile travel in urban
areas, cities face challenges in making adequate provisions for pedestrians. But
encouraging pedestrian amenities can be beneficial, especially in retail
commercial areas. While many residents
make one-stop shopping trips, walkability
can encourage shoppers and visitors to
venture on foot beyond their intended
destinations and reduce the number of
automobile trips.
In residential areas, creating walkable
environments and especially pedestrian
linkages to commercial or public uses will
encourage residents to consider alternatives
to the automobile and also create a sense of
camaraderie between neighbors that can

CHAPTER 1:            Land Use Element
8.2.3 GATEWAYS
Entry into City limits or “gateways” are
important to Torrance’s image because
they provide important first impressions
for motorists and pedestrians entering the
City. Creating boundaries and entries can
successfully signal arrival into Torrance
and are important to perceptions of a
strong City identity.
Gateway indicators that can help define
the City’s major entry points include
                                                Southern Pacific Bridge: Located just west of Western

elements, and signage.         Together or from neighboring jurisdictions.
separately, these indicators can portray a
distinguishing visual identity for the City. City limit entryways along major
corridors are potential locations for gateway elements (Artesia Boulevard,
190th Street, Del Amo Boulevard, Torrance Boulevard, Sepulveda Boulevard,
Lomita Boulevard, Pacific Coast Highway, Hawthorne Boulevard, Crenshaw
Boulevard)
                                                                                Anchor Building
8.2.4 SIGNAGE
Signs influence the overall character and
appearance        of     Torrance’s      street
environments, and should be given as much
consideration as design elements such as
architectural styles or building siting.
Because of its importance as business
identification, signage must be a part of the
overall design of a project, not additive or an
afterthought. Commercial signage in
Torrance should serve the City's interests in      Smaller building pads

                                                  CHAPTER 1:          Land Use Element
         Be architecturally integrated with their surroundings in terms of size,
          shape, color, texture, and lighting so that they are complementary to
          the overall design of the buildings,
         Complement a building's style and coordinate with the City’s desired
          street character,
         Be clear and legible for pedestrians and motorists, and be consistent in
          style and color, and
         Be enhanced with the use of landscaping or other design elements such
          as street furniture.
As tenants install signs, such signs must be in conformance with all applicable
sign regulations and fit with the architectural character, proportions, and
details of the development. Through the sign ordinance (Division 8, Chapter 8:
Signs), the Environmental Division has the power to review, consider, approve,
modify or disapprove any sign program which does not conform to all the
provisions of ordinance with appeal rights to the appropriate commission. The
review is guided by the following considerations:
         All signs are architecturally compatible with the buildings on the
          premises
         Compatibility with the character of the established neighborhood.
         The proliferation of signs
         The effect of signs on traffic safety
         Land use on adjacent properties
These principles will continue to guide review of commercial signage.
Cities have long traditions of using signage to call attention to civic uses and
focal points. Torrance has a variety of opportunities to highlight its various
neighborhoods, cultural and historical places of significance, and civic uses
through signage. The signage will not only highlight these locations but also
offer directional assistance to visitors.
8.2.5 SITE DESIGN
Site planning is not just about locating buildings but also locating, parking
areas, pedestrian walkways, driveways, trash enclosures, loading docks and
service access, open space, landscaping, and other physical characteristics. A
good site plan design incorporates all the physical characteristics of a large
commercial, industrial, or office center into a logical design that avoids
pedestrian and vehicular conflicts, increases functional compatibility between
buildings and facilities, locates buildings along the street, and includes
pedestrian amenities such as plazas or paseos. Site planning also takes into
account pedestrian and automobile circulation. Both are necessary for the
success of large commercial centers.
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                    LU-71                          ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010

CHAPTER 1:            Land Use Element
Encouraging good site design can also minimize the visual impact of wide
expanses of parking lots seen in many shopping centers. Good site design can
also minimize the proliferation of commercial strip developments by adding
interest to the look of the center through variations in facades and building
depths.
Good site design can also meet the City’s sustainability goals (especially related
to storm water management) by incorporating low impact development (LID)
principles. LID has numerous benefits and advantages over conventional storm
water management approaches as it is a more environmentally sound
technology and a more economically sustainable approach to addressing the
adverse impacts of urbanization. By managing runoff close to its source though
intelligent site design, LID can enhance the local environment, protect public
health, and improve community livability.
8.2.6 MIXED USE DESIGN
The increase in popularity of mixed-uses will necessitate the establishment of
design and performance guidelines to ensure high-quality development that
suits the character of Torrance neighborhoods and districts. The success of
mixed use derives from the idea of creating complementary and supportive
services and activities. If accomplished correctly, mixed-use developments can
become activity centers and destinations for living, eating, shopping, working,
and socializing.
Mixed use works best when it is developed out of a comprehensive plan that
emphasizes the connectivity and links among the uses. Results may be
haphazard without guidance about the mix of uses, how those uses are
spatially related, and how those uses should contribute to a neighborhood’s
aesthetic character. A key goal of the City will be to create mixed-use
developments that are unique and incorporate high-quality architecture and
design. Establishing design guidelines and related performance standards will be
the first step in guiding new development and ensuring that mixed-use in
Torrance is of superior quality and meets the City’s high standards. Design
guidelines and performance standards should require that mixed-use
developments:
        Clearly articulate the function of commercial uses from residential or
         office uses
        Include site design and location that strongly encourages pedestrian
         activity and public transit use
        Incorporate design elements that enliven the street level and create a
         sense of place for visitors
        Include communal plazas and open space to encourage visitors to
         extend their stay and explore the area and private open space areas for
         project residents that are designed to limit intrusion by non-residents

         Integrate an appropriate amount of parking without allowing parking
          areas to become the focus of the development
         Are located in areas with adequate vehicular circulation
Mixed use in Torrance will vary in character and intensity based on location,
and mixed-use guidelines and standards must be created to respond to the
specific physical, financial, and locational differences. In Downtown Torrance,
for example, mixed use will have decidedly different character than mixed use
along major corridors due to the unique street grid pattern and presence of
structures of historical or architectural significance.
8.2.7 PUBLIC ART
Public art programs enhance the quality of the visual environment, both natural
and built, and in so doing add to the visual quality of life and raise the level of
citizen awareness to the importance of aesthetic and intellectual experiences in
everyday life. Public art programs are intended to integrate public art with
private development and can:
         Increase public access to art and to promote understanding and
          awareness of the visual arts in the public realm,
         Contribute to the civic pride and economic development of a
          community, and
         Enhance the climate for artistic creativity in a community
In 2000, the City of Torrance established an Art in Public Places (AIPP)
Exploratory Committee to research establishing an AIPP program in Torrance. in
addition, a preliminary inventory of public art in Torrance was established. From
this effort, the Committee established a mission to:
     “…foster art in public places, to enhance neighborhoods and urban
     environments through the installation and maintenance of permanent
     artworks that reflect the local environment, cultural values and artistic vitality
     of the community.”
The Committee recommended preliminary guidelines for minimum project
valuations that would require a public art component and estimates for fees to
be charged. The General Plan will promote further exploration of a public art
program in Torrance as part of Implementation Program I-20 that recommends
that the City develop and adopt design guidelines that cover general and
citywide issues and topics.
8.3       URBAN DESIGN OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Design guidelines establish general criteria to be used in directing future
building, site design, and landscape efforts. Policies and implementation
programs direct the City to establish design guidelines and prioritize areas

which possess a unique character or which may benefit from a unified design
theme. Focused plans can preserve the character of areas of architectural or
historic significance and help create identifiable themes in areas that lack such
distinction. Design efforts must also look to issues of land use and circulation
from an integrated perspective to provide for the coordination of private and
public development and to create a truly integrated, visually pleasing
environment.
Mixed-use development approaches are anticipated to be consistent with land
use policy direction, and clear design objectives and guidelines will establish the
City’s expectations. Design standards for commercial centers will be needed, as
many center owners may pursue renovations due to the age of the properties
and increased competition in the commercial market. Due to the concentration
of activity in commercial centers, and the associated traffic impacts, particular
attention will be given to creating or augmenting an integrated circulation
pattern with strong emphasis on pedestrian and transit access.

9.        ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND
          REDEVELOPMENT
9.1       ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
The City recognizes the connection between economic development and quality
of life. Economic development will continue to be a central factor in the
success of Torrance, as it will strengthen the community through the expansion
of the tax and employment base. A strong tax and employment base will allow
the City to support a higher quality of life for its residents. Establishing and
maintaining uses that create well-paid jobs can also attract residents who
continue the cycle of economic growth; a skilled, well-paid population base will
strengthen local spending that can increase the success of local businesses and
employers, and provide private investment in the community.
9.1.1 BUSINESS ATTRACTION AND RETENTION
The prosperity of businesses in Torrance is paramount to the City’s economy.
The City will focus retention and expansion efforts on industries that provide
high-quality jobs, such as those found in the manufacturing, health care,
information technology, and professional services industries. These types of
businesses provide higher wages and better benefits relative to other sectors.
The City’s Economic Development Office (EDO) facilitates and develops the
relationship between the City and the Torrance business community. The EDO
coordinates the use of City resources to assist business creation, attraction,
retention, and expansion within the community to increase economic viability
and ultimately, to pursue the following goals:26
         Goal 1. Enhance Employment Opportunities
         Goal 2. Increase the City's Revenue and Tax Base
         Goal 3. Create a Healthy and Balanced Community and Improve the

9.2       REDEVELOPMENT
While most areas in Torrance function well physically and financially, some
areas need an extra push to spur economic growth and revitalization.
Redevelopment is a tool that is used in Torrance and many cities in California to
spur economic activity and investment in urbanized areas that have experienced
economic decline. Because of economic incentives, redevelopment is one of the
most effective and sometimes only way to reinvigorate older neighborhoods
and districts.
Redevelopment is a process created by the State of California to assist local
governments in eliminating blight and revitalizing designated project areas.
Redevelopment provides communities with the ability to obtain funding to
make infrastructure improvements, acquire property, and otherwise bring about
desired development, reconstruction, and rehabilitation.           A portion of
redevelopment funds must also be used to promote affordable housing
opportunities in the community.27 The ability to fund economic development
activities can aid in encouraging private businesses to do the same.

   California Health and Safety Code, Section 33000 et seq.
ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010                                  LU-76            CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN

                                                  CHAPTER 1:          Land Use Element
The California Health and Safety Code provides the basis for redevelopment
activities (starting at Section 33000, also known as the Community
Redevelopment Law). Section 33037 states that the basic goal of
redevelopment is the removal of blight. Blight is a term used to describe a
variety of physical and economic conditions, some of which may not fit the
public's general perception of blight. Examples of physical blight include
buildings that are deteriorating, aging, or poorly maintained. Blight may also
describe buildings that are in good condition but need design or configuration
improvements to meet current business needs. Inadequate streets, sewers, and
other infrastructure are other examples of blight. Economic blight can be
characterized by vacant buildings or land, high tenant turnover rates, residential
overcrowding, or the inability to attract or retain businesses in a particular area.
The Torrance Redevelopment Agency was created in 1964 and works in
conjunction with City departments to achieve the goals set forth by the
Redevelopment Agency. The Agency uses a process called tax increment
financing to carry out its goals. When an area is designated as a redevelopment
area by the City Council, the property within the boundaries of the project area
has a certain total property tax value. If this total assessed valuation increases
due to redevelopment effort, most of the taxes that are derived from the
increase go to the Redevelopment Agency. These "tax increments" can be used
only in the same redevelopment project area where they were generated, except
for residential projects which benefit low-and moderate income households.
The Redevelopment Agency has used set-aside money to rehabilitate buildings
such as the El Prado Apartments and the Newberry Building, and to finance
new residential development. These new units add to the community’s supply
of long-term affordable housing units.
The City has three redevelopment project areas.28 The areas have individual
Redevelopment Plans that set forth development policies and objectives. While
the underlying General Plan land use designation represents the typical land use
policy, the adopted Redevelopment Plan for each area takes precedent. The
redevelopment project areas also have a timeline within which redevelopment
activities may occur (40 years). When a redevelopment project ends, the
property taxes from the increase in property values return back into the City’s
General Fund. This money, no longer needed to help improve infrastructure,
can now be used to improve the schools, roads, libraries, and increase public
safety service to the community.
Torrance’s Redevelopment Project Areas include:
         The Skypark Project Area, the second redevelopment project area
          established, encompasses approximately 30 acres of commercial
          properties located between Hawthorne Boulevard, Skypark Drive,

          1976 and has a plan duration limit of 40 years, expiring in 2016.
         The Industrial Redevelopment Project Area, on the east side of the City,
          previously was developed with large heavy industrial facilities. The
          project area encompasses approximately 290 acres of industrial
          properties. The area now is home to American Honda national
          headquarters, several corporate headquarters, and master planned
          business and industrial parks.30 The Industrial Redevelopment Project
          Area plan was adopted on July 19, 1983 and has a plan duration limit
          of 40 years, expiring in 2023.
         The Downtown Redevelopment Project Area, located adjacent to the
          Industrial Redevelopment Project Area, encompasses 88.5 acres and
          contains the original commercial core of the City. The Redevelopment
          Agency has been instrumental in providing funds for new development
          and property maintenance and rehabilitation. The Downtown
          Redevelopment Project Area plan was adopted on July 10, 1979 and
          has a plan duration limit of 40 years, expiring in 2019.
The Meadow Park Redevelopment Project Area expired in March 2007. This Plan
area represented the Agency's first redevelopment project effort. Prior to
redevelopment, the area was plagued with frequent flooding, irregularly shaped
lots, and insufficient infrastructure facilities. It is now home to many successful
businesses which have taken advantage of the location and amenities offered at
Meadow Park.

CHAPTER 1:             Land Use Element
The General Plan previously designated all the properties in the Meadow Park
Redevelopment Project Area for General Commercial uses. The original
redevelopment plan for the area intended for two primary uses: light industrial
and commercial. To reflect the light industrial development pattern existing in
the area today and to remain consistent with development patterns allowed
under the flight path of Torrance Municipal Airport, properties in the Meadow
Park Redevelopment Project Area north of 240th Street will be designated for
Light Industrial. To secure consistent development in this area, development
standards will be modified to resolve any inconsistencies between the General
Plan designation and the Hawthorne Boulevard Corridor Specific Plan
designations.
Awareness and fear of eminent domain has increased among property owners
with the Supreme Court decision of Kelo v. City of New London in 2005.
Eminent domain is the ability to take private property for public use by the
state or municipality with just compensation. In California, eminent domain
can only occur in the context of a redevelopment plan, and the legislature and
the courts require careful scrutiny to make sure actual blight exists before
eminent domain can occur. The City of Torrance strictly abides by restrictions in
the California Code that aim to restrict eminent domain. State Code requires
that “eminent domain have a time limit, not to exceed 12 years from the
adoption of the redevelopment plan, for commencement of eminent domain
proceedings to acquire property within the project area. This time limitation
may be extended only by amendment of the redevelopment plan after the
agency finds, based on substantial evidence, both of the following: (a) that
significant blight remains within the project
area, and (b) that this blight cannot be
eliminated without the use of eminent
domain.”31 The City of Torrance respects the
right of property owners and has in the past
used eminent domain only once since the
inception of the Redevelopment Project
Areas.32 Because of the time that has elapsed
since the adoption of the Project Areas, the
use of eminent domain in the Project Areas is
no longer allowed.33 Policy LU.13.3 in this
section requires the City to use eminent
domain sparingly and then only for
establishing uses that are truly "public uses" Downtown Torrance: Redevelopment activity in Downtown
                                                       Torrance has included street improvements and several

9.3       ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND
          REDEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The future of Torrance is closely tied with its financial health. Objectives and
policies in this section aim to maintain a high quality of life by ensuring the
land use decisions consider the financial implications and employment benefits
to residents. Redevelopment objectives and policies propose identifying new
areas where redevelopment may assist in economic development activities.
Because of the age of many of the Project Areas, finding innovative strategies to
leverage benefits from redevelopment will be important to the City. Once
redevelopment project areas expire, analysis of land use and development
standards will be competed to maintain consistency between the land uses and
development standards in the General Plan, Torrance Municipal Code, and any
applicable specific plans.

INTRODUCTION
“Safe, convenient, and efficient movement of people and goods is crucial for the
quality of life of residents and for the vitality of the local economy.”
     -    City of Torrance Strategic Plan, 2008
The Circulation and Infrastructure Element plans for the efficient and effective
movement of people and goods between destinations within Torrance and
throughout the region. A well-planned circulation system is a high priority,
given that Torrance plays a unique role in the geography of the South Bay
Region. Torrance borders the cities of the Palos Verdes Peninsula and five other
smaller communities. All of these cities’ residents or professionals drive
through Torrance to reach their destinations. Unlike most other cities, regional
shopping, entertainment, and employment centers in Torrance are not located
directly near freeways. Commuters and visitors to the City must travel on
surface streets to reach their destinations resulting in a high travel demand
placed on the local street network. These unique characteristics of the City's
land use and circulation systems are important considerations in the
development of long-range plans for movement of people and goods. Torrance
is a mature city, with land use patterns and the roadway system well
established. Creative solutions, technology, right-of-way acquisition, and
cooperation with adjacent cities are keys to addressing circulation issues and
managing growth.
While the Circulation and Infrastructure Element recognizes that automobiles
will remain the leading mode of transportation for most Torrance residents and
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                          CI-1                   ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010

CHAPTER 2:             Circulation and Infrastructure Element
visitors, the objectives and policies included in this Element also stress the
importance of accommodating and encouraging alternatives to automobile
travel. The provision of facilities for pedestrians and bicycles and a
comprehensive transit system will ensure that non-automobile transportation
is a convenient alternative.
In addition to planning for the City’s long-term mobility needs, this Element
also addresses the circulation of energy, water, sewage, storm drainage, and
communications. Given the built-out, urban nature of the City and the age of
infrastructure, providing and maintaining a superior infrastructure system is
critical for the day-to-day functioning of the City.
PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE
CIRCULATION AND
INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
The Circulation and Infrastructure Element focuses on planning for circulation
and utility systems that will support land use densities and intensities. To
meet this objective, the element identifies a transportation system capable of
responding to growth occurring consistent with the Land Use Element, and
utility systems that provide the service levels Torrance residents and businesses
expect. This element describes physical improvements needed to attain
circulation objectives, and introduces other techniques (for example, restricted
street parking, transportation systems management plans) that can be used to
improve traffic flow. In addition to automobile circulation, the Circulation and
Infrastructure Element addresses circulation of pedestrians, cyclists, and transit
riders plus aviation services.
Under State law, circulation is broadly defined to include public utilities and
similar infrastructure, such as telecommunications, since this infrastructure also
supports the land use plan. Thus, this Element addresses:
         Responsiveness of the                     Visual quality of roadways
          roadway system to the                     Protection of neighborhoods
          requirements of the land use               from through traffic
          plan                                      Public transit
         Efficient use of transportation           Bicycle transportation
          resources                                 Utility Systems
         Provision of adequate parking             Energy delivery systems

             CHAPTER 2:          Circulation and Infrastructure Element
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER
GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
General Plan law emphasizes coordination between the Circulation and
Infrastructure Element and the Land Use Element. The future transportation
conditions presented in this Element were established using the same
projections and geographic distribution of population and economic activity
used in the Land Use Element. In turn, the circulation system policies and
improvements contribute to the achievement of the planned land use pattern.
The Community Resources Element identifies regional air quality and pollution,
and examines mitigation programs that may influence transportation and
circulation objectives. Coordination between these two elements balances
circulation and mobility objectives with regional air quality improvement goals.
The Circulation and Infrastructure Element also has bearing on noise conditions,
as presented in the Noise Element, since City streets and the airport represent
the main sources of localized noise.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER
PLANNING EFFORTS
The circulation system in Torrance is as part of a regional network, and regional,
State, and federal transportation policies and programs affect local circulation
planning. As mentioned in the Introduction, the General Plan is a foundation
document for many other planning efforts. These efforts may include City plans
and programs related to circulation and infrastructure such as the Capital
Improvement Plan. The General Plan sets transportation policy for the next 15
to 20 years and as such, must remain relevant though changing local
conditions. This necessitates a general approach as opposed to an approach
based on details and statistics that may only be relevant in the short term.
While many of the policies are derived from shorter-term plans and programs,
the details of those programs are not included in their entirety in this Element.
Instead, overarching policies are included and are intended to go hand-in-hand
with current planning studies that should be maintained and updated to remain
consistent with General Plan direction.

CHAPTER 2:            Circulation and Infrastructure Element
Regional plans also influence City policies. Because motor vehicle traffic
contributes substantially to the region's air pollution problems, State-mandated
regional programs have a placed a greater emphasis on linking transportation
and land use planning to reduce automobile emissions and improve air quality.
Political pressure to relieve regional traffic congestion problems also has
resulted in State and regional mandates that affect local decisions. Legislation
aimed at addressing regional air quality and congestion problems will require
the City to take a more active role in meeting regional objectives during the
planning period, or face direct regulation by outside agencies or loss of funding
for local transportation system improvements. Table CI-1 summarizes the
programs and legislation at the different levels of government which influence
local transportation planning efforts in Torrance. Related regional transportation
plans and programs are discussed in further detail in the General Plan
Introduction.
The overarching goal of the Circulation and Infrastructure Element is to provide
a balanced transportation system that efficiently moves people and goods
throughout the City and region and an infrastructure system that adequately
supports the local economy and quality of life.
GOAL:                     A balanced transportation system that provides for
                          the safe, convenient, and efficient movement of
                          people and goods throughout the city and region and
                          an infrastructure system that supports the local
                          economy and quality of life in Torrance.
1.       BASELINE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
         AND LEVEL OF SERVICE GOALS
1.1      MEASURING TRAFFIC FLOW
This Element uses several traffic engineering concepts to describe traffic
conditions in Torrance. Level of Services (LOS) describes the efficiency and
quality of traffic operations and is generally measured at intersections. Six
categories of LOS–using letter designations A to F–describe traffic conditions,
with LOS A representing excellent conditions and LOS F representing extreme
congestion.
Two types of LOS descriptors are used in this Element which are based on two
types of traffic analysis methodologies. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM) analysis methodology is used to determine the operating LOS at an
intersection based on stopped delays experienced by drivers at signalized and
unsignalized intersections. These LOS range from LOS A (free-flow conditions)
to LOS F (severe congestion conditions). The Intersection Capacity Utilization
(ICU) analysis methodology describes the LOS (also from LOS A to LOS F) of
signalized intersections based on a Volume-to-Capacity Ratio (V/C Ratio)

Table CI-2 shows LOS levels and a description of expected traffic conditions for intersections based on
both study methodologies.
1.2       PERFORMANCE GOALS
Evaluating the ability of the circulation system to serve residents and businesses requires establishing
suitable performance standards. The performance standards used to evaluate volumes and capacities
on the roadway system are based on average daily roadway volumes and peak-hour intersection data.
These performance standards establish a basis from which to evaluate the need to improve roadway
facilities in response to increased traffic congestion.
The Citywide Traffic Study evaluated the levels of service of all signalized intersections, and forecast
future traffic volumes associated with future development in the City and the surrounding region. The
study was used to determine the desired level of service standards and to identify improvements
needed to achieve performance goals. The City’s target for intersection operation is an LOS D or
better. The LOS D objective for the roadway system design reflects the City’s desire to maintain stable
traffic flow, realizing that peak-hour congestion may occur at locations near freeways or other
locations with unusual traffic characteristics due to regional traffic flow.
1.3       BASELINE TRAFFIC STUDY
To better identify and address traffic issues in the City, and to serve as a foundation for transportation
policies in this General Plan, the City of Torrance conducted a comprehensive Citywide Traffic Study
between November 2004 and November 2007. The study evaluated 171 intersections in Torrance
during the weekday A.M. peak hour, weekday mid-day peak hour, weekday P.M. peak hour, and
weekend mid-day peak hour.           Holiday season data were collected for 43 intersections and 16
roadways in December 2004 to analyze differences in traffic volumes between the holiday season and
non-holiday season. Truck classification counts were conducted at 39 intersections to approximate
truck traffic volumes in Torrance. Finally, a pass-through traffic analysis was performed along 11
arterial roadways to determine the percentage of traffic passing through the City.
The study examined traffic conditions under three scenarios:
         Baseline 2005 conditions
         Near-term future - assumed trip generation of approved projects and ambient traffic growth
         Long-range future - assumed build-out of the City consistent with the General Plan Land Use
          Policy Map (Land Use Element, Section, 1) and horizon year 2030 conditions in the South Bay
          region in accordance with SCAG projections

As the General Plan for the City has a horizon of 15 to 20 years, discussions in this Element will focus
on long-range conditions. Intersection improvements recommended in the traffic study, however,
include improvements for the near-term and long-range conditions. Including improvements for these
two scenarios will assist the City in prioritizing improvements through its capital improvement
process.
The Citywide Traffic Study determined that 122 of the 171 study intersections operate at or are
forecast to operate at an acceptable LOS D or better during weekend and weekday morning, mid-day
and evening peak hours. For intersections that operated at or are forecast to operate at a deficient
LOS, recommended improvements to achieve acceptable LOS are included a part of the Circulation and
Infrastructure Element Implementation Program (Appendix A) and summarized in Section 2.4 of this
Element. A detailed list of study intersection and corresponding level of service for baseline and future
conditions is included in Appendix A of the General Plan.

2.        CIRCULATION PLAN
2.1       ROADWAY PLAN
The street system in Torrance serves two key functions: streets facilitate movement of people and
goods, connect neighborhoods, and streets create statements of civic pride and beauty. While the
primary purpose of the road network is to facilitate movement within and through Torrance, streets
lend identity to our neighborhoods and business districts. To better understand the function
identified in the Roadway Classification Map, a review of the City’s roadway functional classifications
is included below.
2.1.1 ROADWAY FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATIONS
Streets and highways are grouped into classes or systems according to the character of the service
they are intended to provide. This grouping is called functional classification. This approach
recognizes that individual roads and streets do not serve travel independent from the rest of the
highway system. Rather, most travel involves movement via a network of roads, so it is necessary to
determine how this travel can be channeled within the network in a logical and efficient manner.
Functional classification can be applied in planning highway system development, determining the
jurisdictional responsibility for particular systems, and in fiscal planning. Functional classification is
also important in determining eligibility for federal funding.
In Torrance, the circulation network consists of six roadway categories, described below. Figure CI-1
presents schematic cross-section standards for each type of roadway. Deviations from these
standards may occur in cases where physical constraints and/or right-of-way limitations are present,
and where preservation of neighborhood or community character dictates special treatment. Provision
of bikeways and sidewalks may also affect the specific design of roadways. In addition, the median
width of major and secondary arterials will vary according to the area being served, right-of-way
constraints, and turn lane requirements.
          Freeways                        San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405)
Freeways are limited-access, high-speed, divided roads included in the State and federal highway
systems. Their purpose is to carry regional through traffic (traffic passing through Torrance without
stopping). Access to the regional highway system for Torrance residents and visitors is provided at
interchanges.

              CHAPTER 2:            Circulation and Infrastructure Element
The design, construction, and operation of freeways are under the jurisdiction of the California
Department of Transportation (Caltrans). The San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405) is the only interstate
freeway in the City of Torrance, with five local freeway exits: Hawthorne Boulevard, Redondo Beach
Boulevard, Artesia Boulevard, Crenshaw Boulevard, and Western Avenue. Although Interstate 110
does not pass directly through the City, the freeway provides indirect access to Torrance via six exits:
Artesia Boulevard, Torrance Boulevard (via Hamilton Avenue), Carson Street, 223rd Street, Sepulveda
Boulevard, and Pacific Coast Highway.
     Principal Arterial                 Hawthorne Boulevard
Principal Arterials are capacity roadways that provide regional access. Direct access to adjacent parcels
should be minimized to maximize speed and limit interference with flow. Hawthorne Boulevard, a
divided roadway with four travel lanes in each direction over most of its length, is the only roadway
designated as a Principal Arterial.

accommodate trips and capacity at a lower level that Principal Arterials. Direct access to adjacent
parcels should be minimized to maximize speed and limit interference with flow.

CHAPTER 2:            Circulation and Infrastructure Element
Minor Arterials are intermediate-capacity roadways that provide local access to major commercial and
industrial parcels, as well as some regional access. Minor Arterials normally have two travel lanes in
each direction, may have central medians, and are used to bring together traffic from Collector roads.

Collector streets are intermediate capacity roads that provide access between local streets and the
arterial street system. Speeds are generally higher than on local streets, and on-street parking may be
limited in some cases to provide smoother traffic flow. There are generally one or two moving lanes in
each direction.
LOCAL STREETS
Local streets provide direct access to individual parcels and are not designed for through traffic.
Rather, these streets should move traffic toward the nearest collector street. Therefore, speeds on
Local Streets are relatively low, and on-street parking is usually permitted. Typically, Local Streets in
Torrance are two-lane roadways without medians.
ROADWAY CLASSIFICATION MAP
The Torrance Roadway Classification Map (Figure CI-2) represents the City’s planned roadway system.
Like the Land Use Policy Map in the Land Use Element, this map provides the context for future
decision-making on transportation-related issues. The Roadway Classification Map, in coordination
with polices and plans related to alternative modes of transit, is designed to provide a transportation
system in Torrance to accommodate projected needs and achieve circulation objectives.

CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN

CHAPTER 2:             Circulation and Infrastructure Element
The system plan is based on the level of development that may occur over the life of this General Plan.
Because the actual level of development experienced over the horizon of the Circulation and
Infrastructure Element may diverge somewhat from these assumptions, the plan will be periodically
reviewed with a focus on the relationship between land development and its transportation impacts.
The demands of specific development projects on nearby roadways and intersections may also result
in the need for additional system improvements. Improvements to the circulation system should not
be considered a complete list from meeting growth demands, but as a guideline to be amplified and
modified over time as development takes place and system improvements are implemented.
As part of the 2007 update to this Element, the City:
         Re-designated Ocean Avenue (from PCH to Torrance Boulevard) from a Collector to a Local
          Street, and
         Re-designated Newton Street (from Calle Mayor to Hawthorne Boulevard) from a Collector to
          a Local Street.
         Along with several other roadway segments
Changes to Ocean Avenue and Newton Street are intended to protect the character of these
residential areas by discouraging cut-through traffic and high speeds (intended for major corridors
such as Hawthorne Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway).
2.2       REGIONAL CIRCULATION AND GOODS MOVEMENT
A network of freeways, railroads, and major highways connects Torrance to areas around the South
Bay and throughout the Southern California region. The City depends on an efficient regional network
to facilitate business activities, allow residents to commute to and from work, and handle normal day-
to-day traffic.
Regional transportation planning and management requires cooperation and coordination among all
the affected jurisdictions, such as local cities, counties, Caltrans, and the Los Angeles Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (Metro). Working together, agencies can address the physical infrastructure
needed to support regional demands and ensure that convenient alternative transportation modes
allow for an integrated approach to addressing traffic problems.
2.2.1 FREIGHT AND GOODS TRANSPORTATION
An important aspect of a multimodal regional economy is the movement of goods and merchandise.
This is particularly critical in the Los Angeles area, where cargo makes its way to and from local ports
via highway and rail links. However, commercial traffic has the potential to impede movements of
other traffic and adversely affect adjacent land uses. Torrance has designated its one Principal
Arterial−Hawthorne Boulevard−and most Major Arterials in the City as truck routes, illustrated in
Figure CI-3 and consistent with the City’s Truck Route Ordinance (Torrance Municipal Code Division
6, Chapter 1, Article 9). These routes have been designated because these roadways are designed or
constructed to accommodate large vehicles, and the adjacent land uses require truck accessibility to
deliver goods. The truck route system provides access to all areas of the City, as is intended for both
local deliveries and through trucks. Frequent on-street stops by trucks for deliveries during the peak

requires adequate parking and loading areas for all new developments.
Projections of sustained economic growth for the region include increases in cargo tonnage at ports
and rail links, which translates into more heavy trucks and commercial vehicles on area highways and
local arterials. In particular, the Alameda Consolidated Transportation Corridor operates as a major
regional freight-carrying link. The Alameda Corridor, opened in 2002, is a 20-mile-long rail cargo
expressway linking the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to the transcontinental rail network near
downtown Los Angeles. The City's east-west arterials and the San Diego Freeway provide access to
that transportation corridor to support warehousing and industry in Torrance, which depends on the
harbor area for transportation of raw materials or finished products.
The Citywide Traffic Study estimated the proportion of truck traffic along designated truck routes.
Roads carrying the highest proportion of truck traffic along segments designated as truck routes
include 190th Street (18 to 24 percent), Carson Street (15 to 29 percent), Anza Avenue (22 to 30
percent), Hawthorne Boulevard (13 to 25 percent), and Crenshaw Boulevard (18 to 25 percent). These
high truck traffic areas correspond to industrial and commercial activity areas where freight and goods
movement is necessary to sustain the economic viability of businesses. Overall, mobility of goods is a
critical component of a healthy economy, and local governments need to do their share to ensure this
mobility. A goal of the Circulation and Infrastructure Element is to accommodate this increased
movement of goods to and throughout the region. The City's commitment to providing for the safe
and efficient movement of freight and goods through the City includes the following policies:
         Facilitating commercial vehicle traffic through Torrance while minimizing adverse impacts
         Regulating off-street truck parking
         Minimizing intrusions of commercial vehicles into residential neighborhoods
         Enforcing the use of truck routes
         Regulating the operation of commercial vehicles to minimize conflicts with surrounding land
          uses
         Supporting regional efforts to provide rail service to local industries
         Regulate the parking of oversized vehicles and trailers1
2.2.2 RAILROADS AND COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE
Torrance's industrial districts are served by rail lines of Union Pacific (formerly Southern Pacific) and
the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railways, or BNSF (formerly Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, or
AT&SF). These lines actively transport and deliver goods and materials throughout the region.
However, the Union Pacific Company is considering the potential abandonment of the portion of its
Torrance Branch within the City. The BNSF rail lines that run through Torrance will continue to serve
businesses and help supplement the Alameda Corridor route. In addition, the BNSF will have
consolidated much of the freight-carrying operations of its Harbor Subdivision into the Alameda
Consolidated Transportation Corridor. Therefore, use of existing right-of-way within Torrance is

  The City’s Oversized Vehicles and Trailers Ordinance, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 12 of the Torrance Municipal Code,
defines oversized vehicles as those vehicles that exceed twenty (20) feet in length, seven (7) feet in width, or eight (8) feet in
height and do not include pickup trucks or sport utility vehicles, which are less than twenty-five (25) feet in length and
eighty-two (82) inches in height. Trailers include trailers, semitrailers, camp trailers (including tent trailers), unmounted
campers, or trailer coaches or fifth-wheel travel trailer, as defined in Section 324 of the California Vehicle Code

anticipated to diminish. The City will work with regional agencies to promote the rail connections
within the Alameda Corridor. The BNSF does not anticipate abandonment of this branch line since it
will still provide access to the Alameda Corridor for local freight handling.
Although the industrial base of Torrance will move toward less intensive industrial activities, many
businesses will continue to rely on moving freight by rail. Land use policy supports these uses by
designating areas for new industrial development in proximity to rail freight facilities, which will
minimize impact on adjacent land uses and at-grade railroad crossings. Where possible, the City will
encourage industries to share rail facilities to eliminate duplications. To reduce congestion on arterial
streets, elimination of at-grade crossings of major streets is a continued objective.
2.2.3 COMMUTER RAIL
Torrance is not currently served directly by intercity passenger rail. Torrance Transit provides service to
Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles for people who use intercity rail transportation.
2.2.4 LIGHT RAIL
The Los Angeles Metro light rail system extends into the South Bay via the Green Line, with the
nearest station located at Marine Avenue in Redondo Beach. Torrance Transit provides service to
several Green Line stations, as well as the Artesia Blue Line station. However, Metro' long-range plans
includes two substantial light rail service expansions into the South Bay. In 2009, MTA approved
major funding to begin the process of conducting further environmental study of a proposed Green
Line Extension from its current terminus in Redondo Beach to Torrance. MTA also approved a 1.7
billion dollar 8.5 miles extension of the Crenshaw Line, that connects the Exposition Line at Crenshaw
and Exposition Boulevards, to the Green Line at Aviation Boulevard. As part of the Crenshaw
extension, the MTA is projecting a Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) proposed “people mover”
tram service to then connect the Crenshaw line to Los Angeles International Airport terminals.
Should the future planned extension of the Green Line into Torrance, the Crenshaw Line expansion,
and LAWA airport connection service become realized as planned, Torrance residents will have the
ability to reach the Los Angeles International Airport via light rail service. The City will continue to
participate with regional and other local governments to plan and advocate light rail and other high-
capacity transit services for the South Bay, and to ensure that Torrance Transit continues to provide
links desired by residents.
2.2.5 CALTRANS FACILITIES
In addition to its freeway oversight responsibilities, Caltrans also maintains three state highways
through Torrance; Hawthorne Boulevard north of Pacific Coast Highway (SR 107), Western Avenue
south of the 1-405 (SR 213), and Pacific Coast Highway (SR I) are all owned and maintained by
Caltrans. This circumstance requires that the City work through Caltrans for any planned efficiency or
aesthetic improvements to these roadways.

with their impacts on regional transportation and air quality, and to develop partnerships among
transportation decision-makers on devising appropriate transportation solutions that include all mode
of travel. The City of Torrance, along with other local jurisdictions, is required to participate in the
CMP to receive its portion of State gas tax revenue. The City has maintained its compliance with the
CMP since its creation in 1999 and receives close to $900,000 annually in gas tax funds. CMP

Hawthorne Boulevard, Artesia Boulevard, and 1-405.
2.3      REGIONAL CIRCULATION OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
In addition to providing local residents access to the regional network, City infrastructure must also
accommodate regional through traffic originating in other communities.

               CHAPTER 2:           Circulation and Infrastructure Element
2.4       LOCAL CIRCULATION
As described above, the local roadway system is comprised of Freeways, Principal Arterials, Major
Arterials, Minor Arterials, Collectors, and Local Streets. Each roadway group serves a different
purpose by carrying local or regional traffic and thus, speed limits and parking requirements vary
accordingly. Planning safe and efficient roadways includes consideration of the intensity of use and
condition of roadways. Streets must be periodically repaired and rehabilitated to maintain
performance.

example, different land uses generate various trip demands which                  All elements of the
                                                                                  General Plan are

The City recognizes and will promote strategies that address traffic generated by new development.
To offset development impacts on the City’s circulation infrastructure, the City has enacted
development impact fees. These fees are assessed on new development to ensure that new
development funds its fair share of the cost to accommodate an increased demand on infrastructure
and services necessitated by that development. New development does not pay for infrastructure and
service gaps created by growth in general, only the growth attributed to that specific development.2
The City has approved a development impact fee to cover the cost of improvements to the street
network, undergrounding of utilities, and sewer and storm drain improvements.
2.4.2 PARKING
Adequate off-street parking and effective regulation of on-street parking are significant concerns
throughout the City. Although parking is typically considered a separate issue from vehicle
circulation, the presence of on-street parking has a direct effect on roadway capacity. In addition, off-
street parking deficiencies can cause vehicles to re-circulate on a public street in search for parking,
which also increases traffic volumes and congestion by reducing capacity for through traffic.
Therefore, adequate off-street parking is necessary for a healthy business environment, to allow
arterial streets to be used for efficient movement of traffic, and to prevent parking problems from
spilling over onto adjacent properties and residential streets.

  “The amount of transportation impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be limited to the cost of
transportation impact mitigation attributable to new development. The amount of transportation impact fees
collected shall not include the cost of transportation impact mitigation measures made necessary by existing
development.” Torrance Municipal Code. Division 2, Chapter 9, Article 1, Section 29.1.1.E

CHAPTER 2:            Circulation and Infrastructure Element
The Torrance Municipal Code requires that parking be provided for all uses on a site. These regulations
apply to all new developments and may be applied to existing uses that are modified or expanded.
The City will continue to enforce these provisions.
Parking is an issue that will become
more critical to the City as traffic
volumes increase and on-street
parking conflicts with the movement
of vehicles.        Because of the
importance of on-street parking to
many existing businesses, removal
of parking must be coordinated with
provision of off-street parking in
areas where existing off-street
parking      is    inadequate      and
businesses depend on street
parking.

community needs. For retail, service,
and residential trips, sufficient on-site parking will be required to prevent parking problems from
spilling over to adjacent properties and public streets.
2.4.3 ROADWAY AESTHETICS
Major streets serve as gateways to the City and contribute significantly to the character of the
neighborhood through which they traverse. Coordinated street landscaping and improvements
enhance main business corridors, soften the transition between commercial and residential areas, and
create pleasant residential neighborhoods. Streetscape aesthetics cover a wide variety of features, and
include lighting, signage, street trees, landscaping (street and road median plantings), and gateways
that help mark the entry into the City. These topics are discussed in detail in the Community
Resources Element.
Streetscapes also include amenities such as bus shelters, bicycle parking, benches, and trash
receptacles. All of these features benefit pedestrians, transit riders, and motorists, and contribute to
the ambiance of Torrance.
The City will identify corridors and gateways in Torrance for future streetscape improvements and
beautification. The beautification plans will ensure that aesthetic improvements will create a safe and
pleasant experience for not only motorists, but also for pedestrians and transit riders. This may
include sidewalk improvements, new lighting, bus shelters, and transit signage. Torrance Transit is
committed to increasing the number of bus shelters throughout the City.

2.4.4 DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS
In recognition of the relationship between projected new development, needed transportation and
other infrastructure improvements, and estimated costs of improvement, the Torrance City Council
approved and adopted a Development Impact Fee program in August 2005. The costs of
improvements funded by fees are fairly apportioned to new development relative to the benefits
conferred to new development or the need created by new development. The fee is a one-time cost to
developers, not other than a
tax or special assessment
fee. The fee is applied to pay

it should be expanded.
2.4.5 ADDRESSING LOCAL CONGESTION
A well-designed local roadway system is the foundation of Torrance’s multi-modal circulation
network. Roadways provide primary travel routes for automobiles, and form the backbone of
Torrance’s pedestrian, transit, truck, and bicycle options. Traffic congestion is an important local
roadway concern in Torrance, and the City uses several approaches to alleviating congestion on local
streets. The approaches include traffic management and demand reduction in addition to physical
improvements.
TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT (TDM)/ INTELLIGENT
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITS)
To reduce travel demand and improve the efficiency of the circulation system, the City has
implemented a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) program and Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS). These programs serve as alternatives to physical expansion of transportation facilities
that comes at a substantial economic cost and disruption.
TDM programs are designed to reduce demand for transportation by making more efficient use of
existing transportation facilities through various means such as the use of transit. TDM seeks to
increase the carrying capacity of roadways and transit systems, and in so doing, not increase the
number of trips that are made. Activities such as ridesharing, riding the bus, walking, bicycling, or
telecommuting are examples of TDM strategies that enable trip purposes to be accomplished while
reducing the number of vehicle trips used to do so.
TDM objectives are accomplished through the Land Use Element policies that encourage site and
building design which reduce or better distribute travel demand and encourage the use of
development design and amenities that support transit and other alternative forms of transportation,

including bicycling and walking. The Community Resources Element encourages the use of City-
sponsored transportation, ride-sharing, and the Torrance Transit System by community residents for
transportation to local recreational and community facilities.
To further local trip reduction goals and comply with regional congestion and air quality programs, the
City has adopted a TDM Ordinance. Ordinance No. 3371 requires new non-residential development
of commercial, retail, or industrial developments encompassing more than 25,000 square feet to
incorporate transportation strategies, some of which include bicycle storage facilities, preferred
parking for carpools, and transit information. The City must review all new development applications
to ensure these types of facilities are included as feasible.

                                                                                 The City of Torrance has a

signal operation, monitoring, and control real-time traveler information.
Motorists thereby have the ability to change their travel route in response
to traffic conditions. In addition ITS can improve circulation issues by
helping the City more efficiently identify and fix traffic signal malfunctions, detect and manage chain-
reaction incidents on freeways and arterials, improve traffic control during the holiday season and
planned events, and increase interjurisdictional coordination.
The City has extensively studied traffic during the holiday season in the vicinity of Del Amo Fashion
Center. Holiday weekend traffic volumes around Del Amo Fashion Center can increase by as much as
79 percent relative to non-holiday periods. Significant areas of weekend holiday traffic around the
Fashion Center include Madrona Avenue south of Fashion Way, Del Amo Circle north of Carson
Street, Plaza Del Amo near Del Amo Circle East, and Center Way just east of Hawthorne Boulevard. To
alleviate traffic congestion during the holiday season, the Del Amo Fashion Center puts into effect
internal circulation improvements such as on-site traffic control barriers to improve the internal flow,
personnel to direct vehicular and pedestrian traffic within the parking lot at certain high-flow areas,
and utilizing a shuttle system and off-site parking for employees to increase parking for patrons. To
augment these measures, Torrance limits construction activities that require lane closures or
blockages along major roadways starting the Monday of Thanksgiving week to the first week of
January to minimize overall delays. Increased traffic flows during the holiday season may also be
improved based on the improvements along Hawthorne Boulevard (at Carson Street, Torrance
Boulevard, and Sepulveda Boulevard) included in Table CI-4.

PHYSICAL SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS
Not all system needs can be met by reductions in demand. Over time, the City will need to undertake
targeted physical improvements to the road network to maintain desired levels of service.
The Citywide Traffic Study confirmed that overall, traffic in Torrance flows efficiently and LOS
objectives are attainable. Of the 171 study intersections, 120 (70 percent) were confirmed to function
or forecast to function at acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better) during peak and off-peak
weekday and weekend study periods for existing, near-term, and long-term conditions. Where
deficiencies (LOS F) are anticipated, physical system improvements have been identified and
incorporated into this Element.
Planned physical improvements are listed in Table CI-3. Table CI-3 sets forth needed improvements,
differentiating between near-term and long-range as a means to help prioritize system enhancements.
Near-term generally means prior to 2015, although timing will depend upon actual demand, based on
traffic volume increases. Together with demand reduction, these key improvements are expected to
provide acceptable future traffic conditions in a cost-effective manner. Additional focused
improvements may also be warranted as a result of specific projects.

2.5       LOCAL CIRCULATION OBJECTIVES AND
          POLICIES
To provide an effective and efficient local circulation system, objectives and
policies stress the need to coordinate circulation planning closely with land use
planning and expected levels of development. Reducing the number of trips that
originate through transportation demand strategies will continue to help
improve circulation in the City and will be prioritized. Traffic originating from
school activity and regional shopping centers will be mitigated, and residential
impacts such as parking and traffic intrusions will be minimized.
                               A coordinated street network that complements and supports
OBJECTIVE CI.2:                the planned level of development, as expressed in the Land Use
                               Element
                               Require that all circulation improvements conform to the
Policy CI-2.1:
                               Roadway Classification Map (Figure CI-2).
                               Establish and maintain a complete set of Public Works Street

Policy CI.2.2:                 City’s streets. The City may accept different standards for
                               roadways in older developed areas of the City which do not meet
                               present day standards, or under other special circumstances.
                               Maintain an up-to-date Capital Improvement Program or Action
Policy CI.2.3:                 Plan that is consistent with this Element and provides for the
                               improvement and long-term maintenance of local roadways.
                               Coordinate land use planning with planned future roadway and
Policy CI.2.4:                 freeway improvements to ensure that the circulation system can
                               accommodate proposed new development.
                               Require developers to provide roadway system improvements
Policy CI.2.5:
                               consistent with this Element.
                               Continue to measure and monitor circulation system capacity,
Policy CI.2.6:                 and identify circulation system deficiencies through the City’s
                               Traffic Modeling Program.
                               Consistent with Land Use Policy LU.11.4, establish corridor
Policy CI.2.7:                 plans along major roads and continually assess traffic and
                               infrastructure conditions.
                               To maintain a Level of Service D or better at intersections within
OBJECTIVE CI.3:                the City
                               Pursue trip reduction and transportation systems management
Policy CI-3.1:                 measures to reduce and limit congestion at intersections and

3.        ALTERNATIVES TO THE
          AUTOMOBILE
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 5,419 workers (or eight percent of the
population) in Torrance age 16 years and older commute to work without a car.
These include people who used public
transportation, walked to work or
utilized other means, and people that
work       from    home.          Several
transportation options are available in
Torrance, including public transit and
facilities for pedestrians and cyclists.
Bicycling, walking, and using public
transit play increasingly significant
roles as sustainable alternatives to the
automobile. The City facilitates the use
of automobile alternatives by providing
and maintaining facilities for these
modes of travel. Vehicular traffic must
be accommodated but should not be Well-maintained sidewalks and lighting are key factors that make
allowed to dominate land use and downtown Torrance pedestrian friendly
transportation decisions.
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                    CI-31                           ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010
CHAPTER 2:             Circulation and Infrastructure Element
3.1      PEDESTRIANS
Walkability, access, and connections are essential components of a circulation
plan that accommodates pedestrians. Walkability includes wide sidewalks, safe
street crossings, minimizing obstructions along sidewalks, features that
encourage cautious driving, and a pleasant and safe walking environment and
adequate lighting.        Walkways, well-designed pedestrian crossings, and
pathways allow people to travel easily from one destination to another.
Pedestrian connections should be provided primarily to and from activity
centers such as schools, community centers, civic facilities, major commercial
areas, and transit centers. Dedicated pedestrian paths can provide access
between residential and activity areas, especially if streets do not connect.
Handicapped access strategies should also be incorporated into all street and
pathway plans. Walkways and other public spaces should be well lighted and
open to public view.
Throughout Torrance, the City has developed sidewalks and paths that connect
residential neighborhoods to public facilities, parks, schools, and major
commercial areas. The City will continue to develop and encourage facilities
that enhance pedestrian access through and around the more congested areas
of the City. Curb cuts into commercial and retail sites will be combined where
practical to enhance the safety of pedestrian mobility on sidewalks, as well as
within a site. Internal circulation that considers pedestrian movement will be a
required component of all new and renovated site designs. On streets served by
bus routes, walking distances from bus stops to adjacent land uses will be
minimized. There should be at least one walkway link between the sidewalk and
any building on a site.
From a transit perspective, it is especially critical to integrate pedestrian access
into the design of shopping centers, schools, parks, transit stops, libraries,
community facilities, and employment centers/work sites. Through
implementation of Land Use Element policies and site design review, pedestrian
access will be facilitated by encouraging smaller commercial and retail setbacks
from streets, integrating walkways, and placing parking away from the street
fronting the site.
An important consideration in making any site pedestrian friendly is the
inclusion of facilities for disabled access. Any walkway should contain adequate
width to accommodate wheelchairs and other mobility enhancements.
3.2      TRAILS
Trails are multi-purpose pathways located in parks or along major roadways or
drainage channels. Single-purpose and multi-purpose trails enhance community
mobility and provide opportunities for recreation and exercise. A well-defined,
interconnected trail system can also reduce dependence on the automobile for
short local trips. The South Bay Bike Trail is a 22-mile paved path that runs

              CHAPTER 2:          Circulation and Infrastructure Element
from Will Rogers State Beach in the north and ends at Torrance Beach. This
trail is shared by bicyclists, joggers, and pedestrians. Consistent with the
Community Resources Element, re-use or dual use of abandoned railroad and
Southern California Edison right-of way will be explored as potential resources
for expanding trails and open space facilities.
3.3       TRANSIT
Promoting the use of transit within, to, and from Torrance is a sustainable
practice that reduces the number of vehicles on the road and the amount of
fossil fuels consumed by commuters. By using transit, we reduce traffic
congestion, reduce the need for costly roadway improvement projects, improve
air quality, and encourage a healthier population. Also, some Torrance residents
cannot drive or choose not to drive. Pre-teen and teenage youth, the elderly,
and disabled persons rely on public transit to go shopping, visit doctors, and
attend community activities and events.
In addition to alleviating traffic congestion
and improving mobility and transportation
options, transit also can expand job
accessibility in Torrance and help revitalize
commercial districts and activity centers.
Public transportation in Torrance consists of
fixed-route bus service and a Senior and
Disabled taxi program. The City is exploring
opportunities to establish a Regional Transit
Center in Torrance, with options focused on
a central location that will serve as a hub for
many regional bus lines. This transit terminal
is envisioned as a multi-agency terminal that
may be funded by federal dollars and
matching funds.
The City has acquired the 14.5 acre former PPG property located at 465
Crenshaw Boulevard, which is adjacent to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Railroad right-of-way, with the intent of creating a multi-modal transit station
on this property in the future. This transit center would serve as a hub for bus
routes and shuttle services, park and ride facility, and could potentially serve as
a light rail station should the Green Line light rail line be extended through the
City.
3.3.1 TORRANCE TRANSIT
The Torrance Transit System provides a general purpose fixed-route bus system
as well as demand responsive services for seniors and the disabled. The fixed-
route service area includes all of Torrance, with routes going into Los Angeles
via Gardena and Hawthorne, one route going into downtown Long Beach, and

CHAPTER 2:            Circulation and Infrastructure Element
another serving the Metro Blue Line station in Compton. Torrance Transit also
serves Union Station in downtown Los Angeles.
Torrance Transit has operated weekday service on fixed-routes continuously
since 1940. Torrance Transit bus service has stops at major destinations
throughout the City, including Del Amo Fashion Center, Torrance Civic Center,
Madrona Marsh Preserve, and Downtown Torrance. Three of the routes (Routes
5, 7, and 9) provide service within the City. Five routes provide regional
connections to Los Angeles (Routes 1 and 2), Long Beach (Route 3), Metro Blue
Line Artesia Station (Route 6), and the Los Angeles International Airport (Route
8). All of the routes, except Route 6, offer Saturday service, with more limited
Sunday service.
Route 3, which traverses the City along Torrance Boulevard and Carson Street,
accounts for half of total Torrance Transit ridership. The route connects to the
Del Amo Fashion Center and the Long Beach Transit Center, which significantly
contribute to the total number of boardings. Route 8 and 1 have the next
highest level of ridership, as these routes connect major destination such as Del
Amo Fashion Center, the Galleria at South Bay, and Harbor UCLA Medical
Center. Overall 40 percent of weekday boardings occur during the mid-day
period.
According to the 2003 Los Angeles County Short Range Transit Plan, which
focuses on the phasing of transportation improvements, improvements to
Torrance Transit include service coordination improvements, facility
modifications, ITS enhancements, and a universal fare system. The agency also
plans on adding new bus technology such as automated locaters utilizing
Global Position System (GPS) technology, Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)
service, establishing rapid routes, new fare boxes, and SMART card technology.
By utilizing new bus technology, Torrance Transit can provide residents with
more efficient and convenient bus service.
Torrance Transit also offers specialized transit service for South Bay residents.
The Torrance Community Transit Program (TCTP) provides taxi service (Senior
Taxi and Dial-A-Taxi) to disabled and senior residents. This service enables
seniors and disabled residents to be conveniently picked up and taken to
locations throughout Torrance. This important service for senior and disabled
residents has operated as an on-demand taxi service since October of 2004.

3.3.2 METRO TRANSIT SERVICES
Metro operates several bus lines that service
Torrance, including Lines 210, 211, 232, and
344. Bus lines 210, 211, and 232 are all
north and south local buses. Line 210 runs

344 runs from Los Angeles’ Union Station to to transit systems in the cities of Gardena, Rancho
Rancho Palos Verdes via Hawthorne Pals Verdes, and Carson
Boulevard, Artesia Boulevard, and the Harbor Expressway.
3.3.3 MUNICIPAL AREA EXPRESS (MAX)
MAX, the Municipal Area Express, is a commuter bus service that
runs during the peak morning and afternoon commuting hours
serving South Bay residents. The Torrance Transit System acts as
the lead agency for MAX. The service offers three routes through
the South Bay, and Line 3 provides commuting service between
Torrance and San Pedro. The service has 11 stops in the City, all
of which are located along Crenshaw Boulevard.                Each
participating city contributes money, usually Proposition A or
Proposition C Local Return dollars, to fund MAX’s operating and
capital costs. These contributions are supplemented by fare
revenues and grant monies from Metro.
3.3.4 OTHER TRANSIT PROVIDERS
Gardena Transit Route 2 services Torrance and runs along the western edge of
the City along Western Avenue. Route 2 has over 20 bus stops along
approximately four miles of Western Avenue in Torrance. Route 1 can be
accessed just outside the City near Redondo Beach Boulevard and Western
Avenue. The Palos Verdes Peninsula Transit Authority (PVPTA) operates two
fixed bus routes that service the southwestern corner of Torrance along Palos
Verdes Boulevard. Route 225 and 226 operate on weekdays and run along Palos
Verdes Drive northbound and southbound, respectively. The City of Redondo
Beach operates Beach Cities Transit and offers services in the southwestern part

              CHAPTER 2:           Circulation and Infrastructure Element
Torrance Transit also offers connection with the Carson Circuit transit system,
which provides service throughout Carson.
3.4       BICYCLES
Bicycle travel offers many benefits. For some people, it can be more cost-
effective than driving. Bicycling promotes good health. Cycling also proves
helpful for our air quality, since bicycles do not emit fumes. Because Torrance’s
weather and topography are both conducive to cycling, it can be a year-round
activity.
Torrance has a Bicycle Master Plan that provides a framework for future
investments in public and private bicycle facilities and education. Figure CI-5
shows the location of existing and proposed bikeways. The Master Plan
establishes three bikeway classifications:
      Class 1 Bikeway              Class II Bike Lane         Class III Bike Route
Off-road routes: located      On-road routes: located     On-road routes: shared
along designated multi-       along arterial roadways,    use with pedestrians or
use trails or obsolete rail   they are delineated by      motor vehicle traffic, they

separated from streets.       features.                   signed but not striped.
The Master Plan (Figure CI-5) illustrates existing and proposed bikeways and
designates places for public bicycle parking. These are located at public parks,
libraries, and the Civic Center. Through the development review process, the
City of Torrance regularly evaluates implementation of new Class I, II, and III
bikeways. The City also encourages bicycling as an alternative mode of
transportation through Ordinance No. 3371, Transportation Demand
Management.
Metro has published a comprehensive guide for bicycle commuters and
recreational bikers detailing 1,252 miles of bike paths, on-street bike lanes and
designated bike routes in Los Angeles County. In cooperation with the City’s
efforts to promote bicycle commuting, all Torrance Transit buses are equipped
with bicycle racks. The City continuously seeks funding opportunities for
augmenting bikeway facilities and promoting bicycle commuting.
3.5       ALTERNATIVES TO THE AUTOMOBILE
          OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Torrance will continue to coordinate efforts to improve alternative mobility
services and facilities, while providing residents with a wider range of
alternatives to the automobile. The City will continue to support and encourage
safe and convenient ways for transit riders, pedestrians, and bicyclists to move
throughout Torrance.

fixed based operation site. Some types of aircraft are banned from the airport
because they are incapable of meeting the City's stringent noise ordinance.
The airport property encompasses 500 acres. One hundred forty acres are
leased at commercial rates for non-aeronautical purposes. A total of 360 acres
are dedicated to aeronautical use. As a policy matter, the City has determined
that the airport will not expand its operations. The airport will continue its
general aviation status and will not expand services into commercial operations.
Safety issues and land use issues related to the airport are discussed in more
detail in the Safety Element and the Land Use Element, respectively.
4.         UTILITY SYSTEMS
Although often invisible, public utility infrastructure comprises an essential
physical support system that enables us to live healthy, productive lives. These
include reliable water supply systems, effective sewage collection and treatment
facilities, stormwater control, and energy and telecommunication systems. In
Torrance, the City maintains a portion of the water distribution system and
local sewage collection and storm drain systems. Water supplies are purchased

Angeles County Department of Public Works.
4.1       WATER SYSTEM
Protection of water supply and water quality is imperative for the health and
quality life of Torrance residents, businesses, and visitors.
4.1.1 WATER SUPPLIERS
Two water agencies provide drinking water to Torrance residents and
businesses: the Torrance Municipal Water Department (TMWD) and the
Rancho Dominguez and Hermosa-Redondo Districts of the California Water
Service Company (CWS). Service area boundaries are shown in Figure CI-6.
TMWD serves about 78 percent of Torrance residents and businesses,
conducting water quality maintenance and monitoring and operation of the
water system distribution system. TMWD also deals with agencies such as the
State Health Department of Health Services regarding water quality matters.
TMWD is a direct member agency of the Metropolitan Water District (MWD),
which provides over 88 percent of the City’s potable water supply. Water
sources from the MWD include imported water from the Colorado River
Aqueduct and from the State Water Project via the California Aqueduct, as well
as groundwater from district wells. Additional water sources include
groundwater (including desalinated water) purchased from the Water
Replenishment District of Southern California and recycled water purchased
from the West Basin Municipal Water District. In addition to the Yukon Tank,
which is the one active above-ground water storage tank in the City, TMWD
maintains the Walteria and Ben Haggot reservoirs.
Because the Southern California region is a region of natural water deficiency in
relation to local consumption, water conservation is paramount. The City’s
Urban Water Management Plan sets forth strategies the City pursues to ensure
water service reliability during normal, dry, or multiple dry years. Like other
communities in Southern California, Torrance will face additional water resource
challenges in the future. Conservation strategies include water recycling,
groundwater recovery, desalination, surface water storage, and in-region
groundwater conjunctive use.
The City plans to build additional wells and to improve supply facilities that
transfer imported water from the MWD to Torrance. To meet future water
system needs, the City also plans a series of modernization projects that may
include the installation of remote sensing and monitoring stations to help
detect water leaks and breakages. The City uses reclaimed water for industrial

4.2       SEWER SYSTEM
The Public Works Department of the City of Torrance maintains local sewer and
storm drain systems. The Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County (LACSD)
is the regional agency responsible for the collection and treatment of
wastewater. This includes the construction, operation, and maintenance of
sanitation facilities used to collect, treat, recycle, and dispose wastewater.
Torrance lies within Sanitation Districts No. 5 and 30. The nearest wastewater
treatment facility to Torrance is the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant
(JWPCP) in Carson. The JWPCP is one of the largest wastewater treatment
facilities in the world, and treats approximately 320 million gallons of
wastewater a day. About five million gallons of the treated water is reused for
irrigation purposes. The remainder of the treated water is discharged into the
Pacific Ocean.
As an older city, Torrance has many sewer lines requiring repair or replacement
due to failing pipes and joints. The City has identified several areas, such as
downtown Torrance, as having deficient sewage collection capabilities due to
age and limited line capacity. The Public Works Department has a proactive
program to remediate conditions in downtown, including repairs in place by the
insertion of a plastic liner within existing sewer lines. The City’s Capital
Improvement Program includes planned improvements to all areas identified as
having system deficiencies. The City will also continue to identify anticipated
deficiencies in the system over time.
Continuing efforts will be directed toward alleviating deficiencies in the City’s
sewer system and accommodating new development needs. This may involve
upsizing of existing lines to increase capacity, the collection of the
Development Impact Fee which would fund sewer enhancement projects, and
installing new manholes where, none currently exist, to provide adequate
access to the system. In addition to system enhancements, the impacts of new
development may also be mitigated through the continued requirement of low
flow plumbing fixtures.
In addition, the City of Torrance is required to prepare a Sewer System
Management Plan (SSMP) per new Waste Discharge Requirements being
adopted by the State Water Resources Control Board. The SSMP must cover

system cost management, control of sewer system overflows, system wet
weather pipe capacities and/or deficiencies, system’s operation and
maintenance program, design and performance standards, an overflow
emergency response plan, a Fats, Oils and Grease Program, SSMP biannual audit
program, and a capital improvement program which meets the requirements of
the SSMP.
4.3      STORM DRAINS
Storm water is rainwater plus anything the
rain carries along with it. For example, in
urban areas, rain from roofs or collected on
paved areas is carried away through a
system of gutters, pipes, and culverts.
Storm water runoff flows directly into the
City's storm drain system via street
gutters, catch basins, and other inlets, and
this flow in turn discharges into the Pacific
Ocean, City or County maintained sumps,
or County flood control channels, which
ultimately drain to the Pacific Ocean. Two
important issues for storm drain
management are to ensure adequate
capacity necessary to collect and carry           “No Dumping” signs are a reminder that rain water picks up

regional effort to improve water quality
discharged into rivers and the Pacific Ocean.
In urbanized areas such as Torrance, vegetation and top soil have been replaced
by a high percentage of impervious surfaces such as buildings, roads, sidewalks,
and parking lots. Urban storm water run-off occurs when rainfall that would
have been absorbed by groundcover or soil drains into storm drain facilities. In
areas with extensive impervious surface coverage, the runoff can contain
significant contaminants, and this polluted water drains from the
collection/control facilities into the Pacific Ocean, sumps, or regional channels.
The management of storm drain and flood control facilities in Torrance, like
sewer system management, is a cooperative City/County effort. The Los
Angeles County Department of Public Works provides for the planning,
development, operation and maintenance of flood control facilities on a
County-wide basis. The City is responsible for providing drainage from
developments in the City and ensuring that storm drains properly feed into the
ocean, sumps, or regional system.
Upgrades to existing public storm drains or on-site detention of storm water
may be necessary as undeveloped parcels are converted to urban uses,

particularly in areas where flood-related problems occur. The payment of
Development Impact Fees by developers will also help to fund storm drain
enhancement projects that would help resolve system deficiencies. The
Department of Public Works of the City of Torrance maintains a master plan of
drainage that identifies system deficiencies. The City does not maintain a storm
drain Capital Improvement Program but has identified priority improvements:
         Vista Montana Storm Drain Replacement – from Paseo de las Tortugas
          to Mesa Street

          Boulevard to Regina Avenue
         Redondo Beach Service Road east of Crenshaw Boulevard - install new
          storm drain
To help control runoff and pursuant to requirements established by the State
Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region, individual projects
may be required to provide on-site storm water detention, infiltration, and
treatment prior to discharge into the local and then regional systems. The
federal Water Pollution Control Act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant to
navigable waters from a point source unless the discharge is authorized by a
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. In Torrance,
NPDES permits are issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control
Board, Los Angeles Region as part of its Storm Water Program. The City has
obtained funding for an upgrade to the Storm Drain Master Plan to coordinate
future drainage improvements with recent NPDES requirements. NPDES and
storm water runoff is discussed in detail in the Water Conservation and Quality
section of the Community Resources Element (Section 3.3.2). Areas of localized
flooding are delineated through Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
flood hazard maps. These areas require flood insurance for structures within
these areas. Flood hazards are discussed in the Safety Element (Section 1.1.3)
The City’s 14 detention basins help the City address existing and pending Total
Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) storm water regulations. TMDL is the amount of a
particular pollutant that a particular stream, lake, estuary or other water body
can 'handle' without violating state water quality standards. Section 303(d) of
the federal Clean Water Act, requires States to identify waters that do not meet
water quality standards after applying effluent limits. TMDL regulations requires
that loads from all pollution sources within an impaired watershed be allocated
and that a number of programs and agencies work together to achieve the
desired level of pollution control. The State Water Resources Control Board and
Regional Water Quality Control Boards have ongoing efforts to monitor and
assess water quality, to prepare the Section 303(d) list, and to develop TMDLs.
The City of Torrance is required to comply with TMDL limits for bacteria in
watersheds tributary to the Santa Monica Bay and with a trash TMDL limit for

watersheds tributary to Machado Lake. The Walnut Avenue detention basin,
originally taken off line with the construction of a County storm drain, is
proposed to be reconnected to assist in compliance with the trash and other
pending TMDLs for Machado Lake.
Through its Storm Water Basin Enhancement Program, the City is improving
these storm water basins in West Torrance to provide natural treatment
systems and improve groundwater recharge. This project will address bacteria
and trash tributary to the Santa Monica bay via the Amie, Henrietta, and
Entradero Detention Basins, and provide the community more opportunities for
sports fields and walking trails.
To reduce or maintain storm water runoff and increase capacity in the storm
drain system, the Community Resources Element identifies low-impact
development which is an approach to land development (or re-development)
that works with nature to manage storm water as close to its source as
possible. Unlike traditional storm water management, which collects and
conveys storm water runoff through storm drains, pipes, or other conveyances
to a centralized storm water facility, low-impact development takes a different
approach by using site design and storm water management to maintain the
site’s pre-development runoff rates and volumes.
4.4      ENERGY UTILITIES AND
         TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Energy and telecommunications systems are essential to perform most of our
day-to-day activities. Natural gas and electricity provide heat and light and
power our appliances. Through telephone lines, fiber optic cables, and the air
waves, we connect with each other for business, for school, and with our
friends and family.
4.4.1 ENERGY UTILITIES
In Torrance, the Southern California Gas Company and Southern California
Edison Company provide natural gas and electric power services, respectively.
These service providers install and maintain mainline systems throughout the
City. Generally, the distribution systems adequately serve local customers, and
the companies provide upgrades over time as needed to meet changing
demands. A broader issue of concern is increased use of nonrenewable
resources and providers ability over time to meet regional demands. Resource
conservation issues are addressed in the Community Resources Element.

Telecommunications includes media and technologies, including radio, fiber
optics, television, telephone, data communication, and computer networking.
The advancement of telecommunications has changed dramatically with the use

              CHAPTER 2:          Circulation and Infrastructure Element
of the Internet, wireless networking, portable computers, cell phones, global
positioning systems, and other technological advancements. Increasingly,
campuses, business complexes, hotels, and coffee houses offer wireless
connections. In the years to come, technology will continue to advance, and
the nature of telecommunications will continue to evolve.
Considerable growth in the flow of information in telecommunication systems
is expected in the future. Fortunately, much of the increase is expected to occur
through better utilization of existing facilities, which will require relatively
limited physical expansion beyond the established infrastructure. Substantial
investments may be made in upgrading wire systems to optical fiber and in
upgrading central facilities to handle higher capacities. Providing high-capacity
data and video links may be important in reducing vehicle trips by increasing
the potential for telecommuting and teleconferencing and allowing more people
to work from home.
Continued growth will, however, require expansion to the existing network to
serve new development. As with the electrical system, the City actively pursues
its policy of undergrounding these utilities. The City recognizes the benefits to
be achieved by requiring all new utilities to be placed underground and to
retrofit existing aboveground systems, where possible, in association with new
construction. Often, undergrounding of these telecommunication systems can
be coordinated with Southern California Edison undergrounding activities. The
City utilizes residential and non-residential undergrounding impact fees to
further this goal.
4.4.3 OIL AND GAS PIPELINES

oil derricks scattered throughout the City. Although the number of oil wells            As a major oil-producing

A complex network of pipelines transports petroleum products through the
City and region, with activities concentrated in the central and northern part of
Torrance, but may be found throughout the City. Shipping lines are typically
larger lines leading from tanks to the refinery, and are generally operated under
high pressure. Because of the potential hazards associated with high-pressure
lines, these pressurized lines are regulated by the State Fire Marshal. Shipping
lines are generally located parallel to major arterials, railroad rights-of-way, and
the Southern California Edison easement. Field distribution lines, lead lines, and
tank-to-tank lines are typically small lines (two inches to four inches in
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                    CI-47                             ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010

diameter) that transport product from the wells to the tanks and from tank to
tank. These lines are operated at low pressure and are maintained by individual
operators. The City anticipates that substantial recovery operations will
continue over time, with changes to existing facilities and pipelines occurring as
the industry adjusts to demands and new recovery methods. Additionally, new
field distribution and tank-to-tank lines may be necessary to accommodate new
operations or to replace older deficient lines.
The major area of potential environmental concern related to oil and gas lines is
oil spills, which can occur adjacent to wells, at a storage tank, due to broken
pipes, and during operation and maintenance. A secondary concern is
explosions from gas plants and pressurized facilities. The City has strict
regulations for crude oil production site cleanup. The Safety Element addresses
hazards associated with oil operations and abandoned oil wells.
The City retains a series of maps of existing oil pipelines and should require that
the developer of any property near these pipelines contact the appropriate state
agency and pipeline operators. The City shall continue to require the
appropriate abandonment of oil line facilities that are no longer in use in the
Public right of way. Some oil companies have left the City (such as Kelt Oil) and
these oil field lots have been developed for residential uses.
4.5       INFRASTRUCTURE OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Improvements to the City's circulation system are necessary to accommodate
land use changes over time pursuant to the Land Use Element. Similarly,
infrastructure must respond to and guide change if City residents are to be

INTRODUCTION
“Education, Diversity, and Enrichment have been identified as a strategic priority in
order to recognize the contribution of Torrance’s diverse population and to
encourage their participation in meaningful activities that contribute to personal
and community well-being.”
- City of Torrance Strategic Plan, 2008
The goals, objectives, and polices in this Community Resources Element focus
on the enhancement of community qualities that distinguish Torrance. These
resources contribute tremendously to the quality of life in Torrance and allow
residents to enjoy and experience features not found in many urban
environments. The open space resources, wide variety of community facilities
and activities, superior educational and cultural facilities, and historic resources
such as those found in Torrance are the pride of the community. Maintaining,
preserving, and enhancing these resources are a priority for the City and the
General Plan.
The Community Resources Element combines three elements that were
included as separate elements in the previous General Plan: the Conservation,
Open Space, and Parks and Recreation Elements. Many of the topics covered in
the three elements have similar threads, such as the provision and conservation
of community and natural resources. The Community Resources Element sets
forth goals, objectives and policies that build on current recreation, social
services, and resource conservation programs.              Policies focus on the
preservation and management of open space, providing parks, recreation, and
community facilities for all residents, historic preservation, natural resource
conservation, preservation of scenic resources, managing energy resources,

the City’s physical assets with the community’s educational, cultural, and              as important community
social offerings.                                                                       assets.
Torrance has made a strong commitment to providing the highest quality and
variety of cultural, recreational, educational, informational, and social programs
to respond to residents’ needs. Given the City’s longstanding policy of
providing quality community services, this element broadly defines Torrance’s
resources to include:
        Open Space. The preservation, acquisition, and maintenance of open
         space are inherent in the goal of community resources conservation.
         Open space promotes the well being of the residents and the City by
         enhancing the overall character of the community and creating
         opportunities for outdoor recreation, enjoyment, personal
         development, and healthy lifestyles.
        Parks, Recreation, Cultural, and Community Facilities. The provision of
         park space and quality cultural, recreational, educational, informational,
         and social programs are City priorities. Quality education and children
         and youth services at facilities promote quality of life.
        Resource Conservation. Programs that promote good air and water
         quality and that encourage recycling, energy conservation, and prudent
         water use are required to comply with State and federal laws; the
         benefits include a healthy community and environment. Creating
         opportunities for sustainable building practices will further preserve the
         community’s resources. Protecting the City’s historical resources will
         help preserve the City’s link to its past.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER
GENERAL PLAN
ELEMENTS
The Community Resources Element most closely relates to the Land Use
Element and the Circulation and Infrastructure Element. The Land Use Element
identifies desired future uses for all lands within the City, including public and
privately owned open spaces, parks, and recreational, cultural, and educational
facilities to meet the needs of future generations. The goals and policies of the
Circulation and Infrastructure Element encourage the use of alternative forms of
transportation, which will contribute improved air quality.
1.        OPEN SPACE
Open space, as used in the General Plan, refers to any parcel or area of land or
water which is essentially unimproved and devoted to the preservation or
managed production of natural resources, outdoor recreation, or public health
and safety. Although Torrance is highly urbanized, open space exists in many
forms. Even landscaped road medians represent important open spaces that
provide visual relief from urban streetscapes.
The overarching goal regarding open space is to preserve and create a diversity
of open space resources that meet the City’s recreation and resource
conservation needs.
                            Superior open space resources that meet the City’s
GOAL:                       recreation and resource conservation needs
1.1       THE ROLE OF OPEN SPACE IN THE URBAN
          ENVIRONMENT
Open space serves many functions in Torrance. Public parks and private
recreation areas allow residents and employees of local businesses to engage in
healthful exercise or to sit quietly in the shade with a book or picnic lunch.
Open space areas along bluffs or hillsides guard against slope erosion.
Landscaped areas between buildings and the street represent private open
spaces that provide greenery and visual enhancement. In natural areas, open
spaces can provide habitat for wildlife species. Figure CR-1 displays open space
resources in Torrance and opportunity areas for additional open space.

CHAPTER 3:            Community Resources Element
                                                                         Park at Torrance Beach: Open space
                                                                         contributes to the health and well-
                                                                         being of local residents.
1.1.1 OPEN SPACE THAT ENRICHES
Open space for outdoor recreation includes regional, community, and
neighborhood parks; public school grounds; golf courses; and public trails for
walking and biking. Private open space in residential neighborhoods or
industrial-commercial areas serves more limited purposes and people.
However, both public and private open space recreation areas contribute to the
health and well-being of residents. Because many of these facilities provide
community services functions, the Parks, Recreation, and Community Facilities
section of this Element addresses recreational open space.
1.1.2 OPEN SPACE THAT PROTECTS
Open space for public health and safety refers to lands restricted from
development via easements, dedication, or other regulatory control due to
hazardous conditions or important flood control functions. Drainage channels
and retention and detention basins protect people and property from flood
hazards. Open space buffers along fault zones or at the tops or toes of slopes
or on otherwise geologically unstable lands prevent development from
occurring in these potentially unsafe areas. Expected effects of global climate
change include an increase in wildfires, flooding, and drought. The Safety
Element identifies areas where these conditions occur.
1.1.3 OPEN SPACE THAT BEAUTIFIES
As part of any development project or City building initiative, open space can
be used as a visual amenity. Landscaped medians and street edges make travel
along local arterial roads a more pleasing experience. Open space areas in
Torrance that contribute to City character and add welcome green space and
visual interest include hillsides, properties that contain significant stands of
trees or other predominant vegetation, open landscaped malls, large landscaped
expanses around industrial and commercial developments, and street corridors.

1.1.4 OPEN SPACE THAT PRESERVES
Natural systems require protected open space areas to ensure that species can
survive and thrive. Scarce or unique vegetation and wildlife communities that
cannot tolerate the intrusion of urban development require buffers and areas
sized to support populations. Such open space areas help preserve ecological
diversity and create opportunities for scientific study. Research has indicated
that one of the most effective ways to address global climate change is to
increase vegetative groundcover and natural plant species. Moreover, natural,
protected open space preserves irreplaceable resources such as coastal beaches
for enjoyment by present and future generations.
Natural wildlife habitats still exist within Torrance. The City has recognized the
value of a natural place in our environment through the preservation of the
Madrona Marsh. Local residents may willingly travel several hours on crowded
highways to view wildlife in State and federal reserves; they may now
experience similar associations with nature in our own community. Madrona
Marsh is one of the few vernal marshes remaining in Southern California. This
42-acre site, located in central Torrance, is surrounded by residential and
commercial uses and lies within one of the most impacted locations in the Los
Angeles basin. This rich natural area was privately owned until November of
1986 when the Torrance Investment Company and the Santa Fe Land
Improvement Company deeded the lands to the City of Torrance. This event
had been preceded by over 13 years of local efforts to save the marsh from
extinction.
The existence of the marsh within the City preserves a critical habitat and
provides outstanding opportunities for research, education, and enjoyment.
Seldom are urban residents, particularly children, able to observe and study
wildlife in their natural habitat.
1.2       Increasing Open Space in Torrance
Because Torrance is largely built out, limited opportunities are available to
develop new parks or similar open spaces. Thus, the City’s efforts are focused
on creating pockets of green space and areas where people can relax and engage
in community activities. For all new development, the Municipal Code requires
that open space be an integral part of a development plan. Importantly, the
open space must be functional and accessible. Open space can serve dual
functions, such as a flood detention or retention basin providing passive,
accessible recreational green space. In particular, the Ocean and Bishop
Retention Basins have the potential for conversion into park land. Also, small
pockets of land within residential areas can be used for tot lots and
neighborhood gathering places.

CHAPTER 3:              Community Resources Element
2.        PARKS, RECREATION, CULTURAL,
          AND COMMUNITY ENRICHMENT
The quality of parks, recreation, and community facilities in a city reflects the
importance that city leaders place on the health, happiness, and enrichment of
residents. These resources also contribute to the attractiveness of a city and the
overall quality of life. In Torrance, this is truly the case. The City’s Community
Services Department operates and manages over 40 parks and recreation
facilities, libraries, and open spaces for residents of Torrance and the South Bay.
Through the provision of quality park facilities, a diversity and quantity of
community facilities and programs, and excellent educational and cultural
institutions, Torrance distinguishes itself and sets a model other cities look to
achieve. These resources form a critical component of a balanced city.
This commitment to community enrichment dates to the early days of the City.
The provision of parks and recreation facilities in Torrance has its roots in a plan
for the City developed by John and Fredrick Law Olmsted Jr., sons of the famous
landscape architect Fredrick Law Olmsted. Their original town plan provided for
several parks, including El Prado Park. This park was planned to be the focal
point and geographic center of Torrance, and the Olmsteds envisioned it as the
location for major civic buildings. Many of the plan’s features have had enduring
influence, including the importance of common open recreational spaces and
aesthetic considerations in the development process.
These objectives and policies identify the City’s continuing commitment to
provide high-quality and readily accessible parks, recreation, and community
facilities for all Torrance residents.
GOAL:                         Provide high-quality and readily accessible parks,
                              recreation, and community facilities for all Torrance
                              residents
2.1       PARK AND RECREATION FACILITIES
Torrance is fortunate to have many different types and sizes of parks distributed
throughout the community. Figure CR-2 shows park and recreation resources
in Torrance. Parks provide residents areas for recreation, cultural, leisure, and
social time with family and friends; they also enhance the beauty and character
of Torrance. Demands on parks increase with a younger population, and in
Torrance in particular, the rise in organized sports activities has created greater
competition for available field space. Providing parks and open spaces that
address changing demands and use is a challenge. This Element sets forth the
City’s commitment to maintain established park and recreation facilities, and to
find new ways to expand resources as demographic changes continually refocus
the demand for and function of these facilities.

2.1.1 PARK FACILITIES
Parks in Torrance range in size from the 0.1-acre John F. Kennedy and Keller
Memorial Squares to 52-acre Columbia Park. Depending on size, each park
offers differing levels of recreation use, from purely passive recreation to heavily
programmed use. The two largest parks in Torrance are Columbia Park (52
acres) and Wilson Park (44 acres). Figure CR-2 shows the locations of these
parks and facilities, and Table CR-1 summarizes parks and recreation facilities.
                                                                                     Wilson Park: Parks in

The City classifies its parks as follows:
         Mini Parks may be as large as one acre although they typically occupy
          infill parcels. These parks are used to address limited recreation needs
          and generally offer targeted amenities.
         Neighborhood Parks are the basic unit of the City’s park system.
          Neighborhood parks range in size from one to 10 acres and generally
          accommodate informal activities and passive recreation.

                               CHAPTER 3:          Community Resources Element
         Community Parks serve a broader purpose than Neighborhood Parks.
          Community Parks meet the City’s recreation needs for more formal and
          highly programmed activities. Amenities include lighted sports fields,
          gymnasiums, art venues, and community meeting facilities.
         Regional Parks serve an area larger than the community in which they
          are located and are usually over 40 acres in size. Amenities at Regional
          Parks are similar to those at Community Parks, but at a larger scale that
          attract users from a wider area.
         Special Use Properties/Facilities provide more specific park and
          recreation facilities such as tennis courts and pools.
Park classification is based both on the size of the park and the available
amenities. For example, the Pueblo Recreation Center, at 0.96 acres, is the size
of a Mini Park. However, because of the Center’s many recreation activities, the
City considers it a Neighborhood Park.
Several park facilities in adjacent jurisdictions are also available for use by
Torrance residents, including parks in the cities of Lomita, Redondo Beach,
Rolling Hills Estates, Palos Verdes Estates, Los Angeles, and the County of Los
Angeles. Torrance Beach is managed by the Los Angeles County Department of
Beaches and Harbors. Beach area improvements include public restrooms, a
snack bar, sand volleyball courts, and bike paths.
To enhance the appearance, character and quality of the City’s parks, the
Community Services Department offers Adopt-a-Park and City Beautification
programs. These programs encourage businesses, community groups and
individuals to become involved in city-wide beautification and maintenance
projects. Once a site is adopted, sponsors participate in litter pick-up efforts,
plantings, and community service projects.
PARK FACILITY STANDARD AND SERVICE AREA
At the national level, professional park planners have not adopted a parkland
acreage goal or standard for urban areas. As a rule of thumb, many cities
throughout California use 3.0 to 5.0 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents as a
benchmark for sufficient park space. Recognizing that parks are not the only
recreation resources in the City, recreation and special use facilities are also
used to quantify the provision of open space and park resources to Torrance
residents. As of 2009, Torrance residents enjoyed access to approximately
355.2 acres of park and recreation facilities (Table CR-1), with an additional
12.7 acres available at community centers, senior citizen centers, libraries, and
the Torrance Cultural Arts Center. Based on a 2009 population estimate of
149,111 persons (California Department of Finance), Torrance provided 2.47
acres of recreation area per 1,000 residents. The 1992 General Plan set a goal of
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                     CR-17                             ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010

CHAPTER 3:             Community Resources Element
10 acres of public recreation land per 1,000 residents. Achieving this ratio
would require adding almost 1,200 acres of public recreation land. Part of this
goal is achieved through ongoing joint-use arrangements with Torrance Unified
School District, as described in Section 2.1.3. The combined resources of the
City and Torrance Unified School District yield 618 acres of active green space
and recreation facilities, which improves the ratio to 4.14 acres per 1,000
residents, still far short of the City’s goal.
The objectives and policies in this section encourage the development of
commercial recreational facilities and the multiple use of utility easements and
the conversion of abandoned or out-of-service railroad rights-of way to
augment the City’s recreational offerings. These objectives will help increase the
City’s open space resources while improving environmental objectives related
to global warming by providing open space linkages between neighborhoods,
schools, and other public facilities and potentially reducing the need for
automobile use for short trips.
Access to park facilities is also an important gauge of quality parks. While
recognizing the importance of acres per population park facility standards as a
gauge of physical park space provision, the City’s commitment to a high level of
public services is more accurately demonstrated through the large quantity and
variety of programs and activities offered at City facilities, and the ease of access
to parks for most residents in Torrance.
Service area standards recommended by the National Recreation and Parks
Association (NRPA) indicate that a park typically should cover a one-half- to
one-quarter mile service area radius, depending on the size and function of the
park. Based on these standards, only a few residential areas in Torrance are
underserved (Figure CR-3). The NRPA standards diagrammed in Figure CR-3
are applied only to park facilities listed in Table CR-2, exclusive of special use
facilities.
While neighborhoods north of Artesia Boulevard have parks within one-half
mile, access to these parks is not convenient; residents have to cross major
roadways to access them. Neighborhoods without ready access to parks
(Figure CR-3) include one south of I-405 and north of 190th Street, several
immediately south of Sepulveda Boulevard, and those in the southwesternmost
tip of the City.

                            CHAPTER 3:          Community Resources Element
In addition to its parks, Torrance offers residents recreation and education at
the ATTIC Teen Center, the Madrona Marsh Nature Preserve and Center, the Las
Canchas Tennis Facility, the Sea Aire Park & Golf Course, the Victor E. Benstead
Plunge, and Torrance Beach (Figure CR-2).
YOUTH FACILITIES
The City is committed to providing services, activities, and resources for
Torrance youth. These resources include a youth-oriented community center, a
number of after-school and summer programs, recreational areas and activities,
and supportive services.
The ATTIC Teen Center is a public center for 9th through 12th grade students.
The ATTIC provides a meeting room and offices that house the Options program.
This program consists of peer counseling, life session training, post-graduate
decision making, health education, academic tutoring, job training, classes,
sports, tournaments, and access to several online computers. The main focus of
the Options program is to offer self-help resources and access to human service
professionals.
                                                                              The ATTIC Teen Center: The

MADRONA MARSH NATURE CENTER/PRESERVE
The Madrona Marsh is one of the last remaining vernal marshes in Southern
California. The preserve encompasses elements of four associations/habitats of
plants and animals. The Nature Center offers education programs and guided
walks. The Madrona Marsh is discussed in detail in the Resources Conservation
section of this Element.
OUTDOOR RECREATION FACILITIES
To add to the offerings at City parks and community centers, the City maintains
a tennis facility, public golf course, and public pool. The Las Canchas Tennis
Facility, a privately managed, public club, has eight fully lighted courts, a pro
shop, snack bar, and locker rooms. Classes are available for players of all skill
levels.

CHAPTER 3:            Community Resources Element
The Sea-Aire Golf Course is a nine-hole, three-par, pitch-and-putt course. The
golf course offers reduced rates for youth and senior residents and is open year-
round. Recreational swim and swim lessons for all ages are offered at Victor E.
Benstead Plunge, which is also open throughout the year.
TORRANCE CERTIFIED FARMERS MARKET
The City hosts a year-round farmers market at Charles H. Wilson Park every
Tuesday and Saturday to provide the community with access to fresh, local
produce, baked goods, eggs, nuts, flowers, and other items. Farmers markets
help keep local farms viable, thereby sustaining regional open space. They also
provide access to fresh and healthy food sources. The Torrance Certified Farmers
Market is just one way the City promotes sustainable practices in the
community. Sections 3.12-13 describe additional sustainable practices in
Torrance.
2.1.3 JOINT-USE FACILITIES
Public school facilities in Torrance offer additional places where residents can
enjoy outdoor recreation. Joint use of facilities by cities and school districts can
reduce costs, maximize the usage of physical facilities, and provide better
services to the community. The City of Torrance and the Torrance Unified
School District (TUSD) have a reciprocal use agreement. The agreement allows
the City to use TUSD facilities for community recreation activities and in turn,
TUSD uses City facilities that may not be available on school campuses. School
grounds in the City encompass over 250 acres of recreational land. The City and
TUSD have worked cooperatively for many years to expand the program to
benefit both entities and the community as a whole. Comprehensive
agreements that apply to more facilities throughout Torrance will help the City
work toward its open space goals and assist TUSD in its efforts to fund
improvements and minimize investment in new school facilities where perhaps
City facilities might meet such needs.
2.2      COMMUNITY FACILITIES
Whereas recreational open space provides Torrance residents with
opportunities to pursue physical health goals, cultural and community centers
can provide the community places to nourish cultural and social health, as well
as personal development and lifelong learning. While these issues are not
directly related to open space and conservation, the City recognizes its role in
enhancing the community’s cultural and social environment.
The Community Services Department organizes and runs comprehensive
recreational activities and human service programs to meet the educational,
informational, social and recreational needs of individuals and families, youth
and seniors. Senior centers, youth centers, cultural centers, art museums,

                              CHAPTER 3:         Community Resources Element
multi-purpose community centers, and neighborhood branch libraries offer
educational and recreational activities and services for all ages. The City also
has several facilities that can be rented to the public or community groups for
parties, business meetings, seminars, lectures, receptions, trade shows, family
gatherings, and other activities.
2.2.1 COMMUNITY CENTERS
The North Torrance Community Center is located at McMaster Park and
includes the North Torrance Branch Library, Herma Tillim Senior Citizen Center,
meeting rooms, park buildings, and a police community center. The Torrance
Police Department staffs four community centers to provide general
information, conference centers for community groups, safety information, and
related literature at the following locations:
         Del Amo Police Community Center, #73 Del Amo Fashion Square
         Downtown Torrance Police Community Center, 1215 El Prado Avenue
         North Torrance Police Community Center, 3624 Artesia Boulevard
         South Torrance Police Community Center, Walteria Park, 3855 242nd
          Street
2.2.2 SENIOR SERVICES AND FACILITIES
Several centers focus on meeting the health, education, and social needs of
Torrance’s older residents. The principal senior citizen center is the Bartlett
Center, with more limited programs provided at the Herma Tillim Center, Ken
Miller Recreation Center, and Walteria Park. Seniors can engage in special
interest classes, weekday hot lunches, exercise and dance classes, card playing,
shuffleboard, bingo, billiards, and singing groups. Featured speakers on diverse
topics are scheduled regularly. Information on legal and financial issues, social
services (including Medicare, Medi-Cal, and Social Security), transportation, and
other needs is also available. Focal Point, a volunteer-run program sponsored by
the City, also provides information and referrals to seniors and their families
and caregivers. The program publishes a local directory for service providers and
disseminates program and resources information at health fairs and workshops.
2.2.3 TORRANCE CULTURAL ARTS CENTER/TORRANCE ART
          MUSEUM AT THE JOSLYN CENTER
The Joslyn Recreation Center was dedicated on April 11, 1964. At the time, the
Center offered adult craft classes and special events for senior citizens. When
the Senior Citizens Association grew too large for the Joslyn Recreation Center,
the City found other facilities to house senior programs, freeing the Joslyn
Recreation Center to become a fully dedicated facility for the arts. In 1991,
responding to the need for arts in the community, the City opened the Torrance
Cultural Arts Center (TCAC). Conceived as a "town square" for Torrance

residents, the TCAC is now home to the Torrance Art Museum, the Ken Miller
Recreation Center, arts classrooms and dance studios, the 500-seat James R.
Armstrong Theatre, the George Nakano Theater, the Torino Festival Plaza, the
Toyota Community Meeting Hall, and the Pine Wind Japanese Garden. The
TCAC also houses a theater and arts education program.

                                                           Center: TCAC is home to a

                                                           for residents.
The George Nakano Theatre is a flexible performing arts venue for live theater,
music, and performing arts education programs seating up to 200 people. The
Learning Center for Arts Excellence is an arts education program designed to
engage the public in a wide variety of arts education, performance, and
exhibition activities.
In 2004-2005, the 9,200-square-foot Joslyn Center building was subject to a
major renovation, creating the Torrance Art Museum. The facility is operated by
the Cultural Services Division of the Community Services Department, with
oversight from the Cultural Arts Commission.
2.3       ENHANCING PARK AND RECREATION
          RESOURCES
The City’s commitment to accessible and high-quality park and recreation
facilities will be demonstrated through creative approaches to expanding park,
cultural, and recreation resources. The City has and will continue to use the
Park and Recreation Facilities Fund established for the planning, acquisition,
improvement and expansion of public parks, playgrounds, and recreation
facilities. An approximate fee of $1,8001 is collected per building permit for
construction of new residences. The fee is split between the Recreation Fund
and the Open Space Fund.
The City will also continue to pursue other sources of funding, such as State
and federal outdoor recreation and open space grants. In this respect, the City

                            CHAPTER 3:              Community Resources Element
will support enactment of State and federal legislation that would establish park
and open space acquisition funds that could benefit the Torrance residents. The
dedication of land for recreational purposes will also be required in areas which
are demonstrated to be made deficient in parkland by virtue of the project. In
addition, compulsory dedication of park and open space land, as a condition for
approval of final subdivision maps, is permitted by the Subdivision Map Act.
Creative use of land for recreation use will also be explored through methods
such as:
         Developing mini-parks on small, otherwise marginally usable parcels
         Reuse of abandoned railroad right-of-way and utility easements
         Use of vacant industrial and commercial land for seasonal recreation
          activities
         Reclaiming any flood control features that can either serve a dual
          purpose or are not longer needed for flood control
         Explore the sue of detention and retention basins (sumps) for possible
          use as open space or recreation
         Expanding joint use arrangements with the Torrance Unified School
          District
2.4       PARKS AND RECREATION OBJECTIVES AND
          POLICIES

2.5       EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES
A community that values and promotes education and learning benefits its
residents and businesses. An educated community contributes to economic
success, and keeps youth and adults engaged in productive activities. High-
quality schools and libraries provide a positive learning environment for youth,
as well as job training opportunities for adults.
2.5.1 TORRANCE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
The Torrance Unified School District functions independently from the City.
However, TUSD’s programs and facilities supplement the recreation and
community services resources available to Torrance residents. TUSD
encompasses all properties within Torrance and includes 17 elementary
schools, eight middle schools, five high schools (one of which is a continuation
school), three adult education centers, and a child development center. The
TUSD mission statement states that the District “... strives to ensure that each

                                 CHAPTER 3:      Community Resources Element
Every year, student populations at individual schools fluctuate, and TUSD seeks
to relieve overcrowding at specific locations by providing opportunities for
students to attend schools other than their neighborhood schools. Also, when
enrollment falls below capacities, the District can accept inter-district transfers
from families in adjacent communities or for students whose parents work in
Torrance.
A key concern is the impact of new residential development on schools. The
District’s 2004 Fee Justification Study indicated that new, single-family
detached development has a school facility cost impact of $7,484, while multi-
family residential development has a school facility cost impact of $4,3712.
State law allows school districts to collect fees from new development projects
to offset the costs of providing new school facilities. In 2006, school fees
included in building permits were as follows:
         Residential Construction         $ 2.63 per sq. ft.
         Commercial/Industrial            $ 0.42 per sq. ft.
         Motels/Hotels                    $ 0.359 per sq. ft.
School fees assessed for new development are periodically re-evaluated and
adjusted by TUSD.
ADDITIONAL EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES
To supplement K-12 education in the City, the Southern California Regional
Occupational Center (SCROC) provides entry-level and advanced job training
and employment assistance for high school students16 years of age and older,
as well as for adults in the South Bay and surrounding communities. SCROC is
located in Torrance, and as part of a Joint Powers Agreement, the SCROC serves
the Torrance Unified School District and six other local school districts.
Torrance Adult School is also part of the Torrance Unified School District.
Torrance Adult School classes are open to all adult residents and residents in
surrounding communities. Classes include computer and vocational training,
English as a Second Language, citizenship, GED, parent education, exercise and
fitness, home decorative arts, cultural programs, arts, communications, and
languages. Adult school classes are offered at:
         Hamilton Adult Center, 2606 W. 182nd Street
         Levy Adults School, 3420 W. 229th Street

CHAPTER 3:             Community Resources Element
To assist students and their families, several Torrance elementary and middle
schools host the After School Club, a City-sponsored, supervised location for
school children to learn and socialize after school. The club offers structured
homework time, cooperative games, arts/crafts, field trips, and projects. With
the increase in the number of families with two working parents, after-school
programs will continue to be an important resource for families in Torrance.
In addition to public schools, Torrance is home to many private and parochial
schools including St. James Academy, St. Catherine Laboure, and Bishop
Montgomery High School, one of the largest private high schools in the South
Bay.
Supporting quality educational facilities and programs is a priority for the City,
as they reflect the value the community places on education. The City will
encourage and foster increased coordination and communication with Torrance
Unified School District to enhance and maintain a high quality of educational
resources for residents.
2.5.2 LIBRARY SERVICES AND FACILITIES
Established as a City department in 1967, the Torrance Public Library includes
six library branches located throughout the City:
         Katy Geissert Civic Center Library, 3301 Torrance Boulevard

   and entertainment options.
Library resources include over 400,000 books and approximately 900 periodical
subscriptions. The Library also provides materials in a variety of formats such
as DVDs, videocassettes, music, and books on compact disc, books-on-tape,
Braille talking books, large print books, and government documents. Assistive
technology for individuals with disabilities, including fully adjustable computer
workstations with text to speech and magnification software, closed-circuit
television for individuals with sight disabilities, and mobility devices such as a

Center Library. The Katy Geissert Civic Center Library also provides free
wireless access to the internet and contains a large meeting room that, for a
fee, may be reserved by public agencies and organizations, as well as residents.
Through community partnerships with the South Bay Cities Genealogical
Society and the South Bay Literacy Council, the Library is able to offer special
collections such as the Genealogical Society’s research library and services such
as reading instruction for adult new readers.
The Library offers a mix of electronic and print services and databases, many of
which are full text, and can be accessed through the internet from a home or
office computer.
The Library sponsors many adult and juvenile programs, including book
discussion groups, educational lectures and informational presentations,
exhibits and displays, and cultural events. A home delivery program entitled
“Words on Wheels” allows residents who are unable to visit the library due to
illness or disability to borrow library materials. Specialized programs target
Torrance’s younger residents through toddler and pre-school storytime,
story/craft programs, Homework Help, Reading Partners, science and art
programs, teen game nights, and youth book discussion groups. The El Retiro,
Henderson, Southeast, and Walteria libraries have formed Teen Advisory Boards
to help the libraries plan activities and provide input on collections, services,
and programs.
A school relations program fosters cooperation between the Library and the
Torrance Unified School District, as well as other educational institutions in the

City. Classroom visits to all library locations are scheduled throughout the
year, and librarians make outreach visits to schools to promote literacy, special
reading programs, and provide orientation and instruction on how to use the
library and its resources.
The City of Torrance and the TUSD joined together to obtain a grant to build a
new North Torrance Library and Community Services Center at McMaster Park.
Although bond measures to provide matching funds for library construction
have failed to pass, the City continues to work towards construction of the new
North Torrance Library and Community Services Center at McMaster Park.
2.5.3 TELECOMMUNICATIONS CENTER
The Stanley E. Remelmeyer Telecommunications Center provides 15,000 square
feet for Torrance’s Office of Cable and Community Relations. CitiCable
broadcasts local programming 24 hours a day, seven days a week to local
subscribers from the center. It features regular coverage of public meetings,
both live and taped, as well as local news, entertainment, sports, events,
cooking, arts and crafts, business profiles, and health and safety information.
CitiCable also provides live and taped emergency information as needed. The
Telecommunications Center features two studios, eight edit suites, classroom
area, conference rooms, viewing rooms and administrative offices.

3.        RESOURCES CONSERVATION
Effective conservation practices allow for protection of the natural and human
environments, and efficient use of nonrenewable resources. This Resources
Conservation section addresses the historic, aesthetic, and natural resources
that distinguish Torrance and contribute to community vitality and health.
                            The careful conservation and managed use of
GOAL:                       resources to ensure a quality environment for
                            Torrance residents
3.1       HISTORIC PRESERVATION
The identity of a community is, in part, derived from its past. By preserving
historic structures, places, and landmarks in Torrance, we show our respect for
and pride in the literal foundations of our City.
3.1.1 TORRANCE HISTORY
In 1911, Jared Sidney Torrance, a Pasadena real estate promoter, purchased
approximately 3,000 acres of the Rancho San Pedro from the Dominguez family.
His plan was to create a new city, a garden environment with parks, fine
schools, and wide tree-lined streets. To develop his vision of a planned garden-
industrial community, he hired the Olmsted Brothers, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.
and Charles Olmsted, of Brookline, Massachusetts, sons of Frederick Law
Olmsted, the celebrated landscape architect whose work included Central Park
in New York City and the original Stanford University campus.
The Olmsted Brothers included in their plan a landscaped common that ran
down the center of El Prado Avenue from Carson Street to Cravens Avenue.
From Cravens Avenue, El Prado Avenue was a paved street that continued to
the Pacific Electric Railway Depot on Cabrillo Avenue. El Prado Avenue was
aligned to frame a vista of Mt. Baldy and the San Gabriel Mountains 50 miles to
the northeast. The original city plan was designed to separate the industrial
areas from the residential areas. The boundaries of the original Torrance Tract

CHAPTER 3:            Community Resources Element
are Dominguez Street to the north, Western Avenue to the east, Plaza Del Amo
to the south and Crenshaw Boulevard to the west.
Groundbreaking for the model garden-
industrial city commenced in 1912
with the renowned Irving Gill as the
chief architect. Since 1912, several
structures of aesthetic or historic
interest were built. Gill’s buildings are
characterized by clean simple lines free
of ornamentation. His most famous
structures in Torrance are the Pacific
Electric Railway Depot and the
Southern Pacific Railroad bridge over
Torrance Boulevard. Although many
structures have been lost through the
passage of time, these structures and
a number of other significant buildings
remain.      They have provided an
enriched sense of community to the
citizens and a reserve of heritage.
They classify Torrance as one of a small
handful of American cities with                                                       Figure CR-4:
auspicious origins in early city                                    Original Torrance Tract
planning and architecture.
Torrance has grown to the west, north, and south of the original tract. Old
Torrance is characterized by its narrow streets, small lots, and low-scale
buildings. Many of the older commercial buildings have been adapted for more
modern commercial enterprises, and home owners have taken pride to preserve
the original look of the houses built to house workers in Torrance’s early
industries.
3.1.2 HISTORIC RESOURCES
HISTORIC RESOURCES INVENTORY
Torrance is fortunate to have residents with a keen interest in documenting and
preserving the City’s history. In 1978, the City conducted a local historic
resources survey to inventory historically and architecturally valuable sites and
structures built before 1945. Over 1,000 structures were inventoried, and
eventually 120 structures were selected as being particularly significant in
terms of their role in the community's growth and development, relationship to
noted persons in the City's history, and architectural importance.

The inventory represents a "character analysis" of Torrance expressed through
building design and associated local history. The historic structures and
landmarks lend character to neighborhoods and provide an incentive for
preservation and maintenance of community identity. They serve as resources
to planners, historians, students, and interested citizens seeking information
about Torrance history, period architectural styles, or significant persons.
NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES
Structures in Torrance listed on the National Register of Historic Places include
Torrance High School, the Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge, and Fern Avenue
School. Listing in the National Register provides recognition and assists in
preserving historic properties by:
         Placing them under consideration in planning federally assisted projects
         Making them eligible for tax benefits
         Qualifying them for federal grants for historic preservation

The structures formerly occupied by Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Co.,
Torrance City Hall, Stone and Myers, and Pacific Electric Railway Station are
presently occupied by new uses. The following structures are no longer in

Beach Club.
3.1.3 HISTORIC PRESERVATION OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
To encourage and support a growing public awareness and interest in
Torrance’s history and architectural heritage, the City is committed to shared
endeavors with local historic groups that will promote preservation and public
education. Preservation of structures identified as historically significant should
be achieved whenever feasible, consistent with the interests of individual
property owners. Over time, additional neighborhoods and districts or
structures within them may be recognized as historic and representative of
specific architectural periods or events. The City will continue to encourage

                             CHAPTER 3:           Community Resources Element
historic preservation efforts and make it an integral part of the community's
planning process.
To encourage the preservation of historic resources, the City is creating a
voluntary historic preservation ordinance that takes advantage of the Mills Act
property tax abatement program. The Mills Act program allows the property
owner of a qualified historic property, who maintains and/or restores their
property in a manner prescribed by a contact entered into with the City, to
receive property tax relief.
While the following polices identify the City’s general approaches to historic
preservation, the General Plan Implementation Plan (Appendix A) outlines
specific methods to achieve the objective and polices contained here. In
addition, goals, objectives, and polices in the Land Use Element apply to
historic preservation, such as ensuring consistency between the zoning code
and the General Plan and requiring new construction to be consistent in scale,
mass and character with defining structures in an established neighborhood or
district. Time-honored setbacks and the location of curb cuts will be considered
when reviewing new development in an established neighborhood.
OBJECTIVE CR.12:               Preservation of sites of local historical or cultural importance

                               programs for recognition of historical assets within the City.
3.2       AIR QUALITY
Each of us breathes about 3,400 gallons of air every day. Unfortunately, our air
is contaminated on a daily basis by human activities such as driving cars,
burning fossil fuels for energy, and manufacturing chemicals. These activities
are also the largest contributors to global warming from greenhouse gas
emissions. Natural events such as wildfires and windstorms also degrade air
quality. Although air quality in Southern California has improved since the
1960s, the Los Angeles region still has some of the most polluted air in the
nation. With the region’s substantial economic expansion and population
growth, further improvements will be needed to ensure clean air for future
Torrance residents.

CHAPTER 3:             Community Resources Element
3.2.1 GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE CHANGE
One of our emerging greatest concerns is related to climate change, global
warming, and the source of these problems: greenhouse gas emissions. This
generation recognizes the imperative of addressing this issue to preserve our
quality of life for generations to come.
Global warming and climate change are largely due to an increase in the level of
greenhouse gases emitted throughout the world. These two terms—global                  California Global Warming
warming and climate change—have subtly different meanings. Global warming              Solutions Act of 2006
relates directly to the greenhouse effect, which is an increase in temperature as      (Assembly Bill 32) requires
a result of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trapping the sun’s               California to reduce
                                                                                       greenhouse gas emissions
warmth below our atmosphere. This process then causes rising sea levels, as
                                                                                       to 1990 levels by 2020.
water stored in the form of icecaps, icebergs, and glaciers begins to melt at
accelerated rates. Climate change is a broader effect of global warming, and can
include changes in rainfall patterns and increased intensity and frequency of
extreme weather events. Some expected changes in climate due to global
warming include water scarcity in some regions and increased precipitation in
others, changes in mountain snowpack, adverse health effects from warmer
temperatures, and effects on agriculture and other food sources.
Greenhouse gases are made up of a variety of different gases, including carbon
dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Carbon dioxide is the gas of most concern,
as it represents approximately 85 percent of the U.S.’s greenhouse gas
emissions. Concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the
atmosphere have increased significantly as a result of human activities over the
past few centuries, and now far exceed amounts found during pre-industrial
times. The global increase in carbon dioxide concentrations is due primarily to
fossil fuel combustion and land-use changes, while those of methane and
nitrous oxide are primarily due to agriculture, including livestock. In urban
areas, methane emissions from landfills are another source of greenhouse gas.
The State of California has taken a leadership role in addressing climate change
through the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Assembly Bill
32). This bill states that “global warming poses a serious threat to the
economic well-being, public health, natural resources, and the environment of
California.” The bill created the first-ever statewide cap on global warming
pollution, requiring that the State’s global warming emissions be reduced to
1990 levels by 2020. The California Air Resources Board is responsible for
determining the level of greenhouse gases emitted in 1990 and developing
mitigation measures to reach that level. The bill culminates in a target 80
percent reduction of greenhouse gases from 1990 levels by the year 2050.
Policies addressing climate change are integrated throughout the Torrance
General Plan, as indicated in Table CR-3. The primary avenues to address

climate change in urban areas are by lowering transportation emissions and
encouraging energy conservation and efficiency. In addition, cities should
address the urban heat island effect resulting from land use patterns, and
encourage recycling, which reduces the amount of trash sent to landfills,
lowering methane emissions. Recycling also reduces the amount of energy
needed to produce products.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Smart Communities Network,
buildings account for 35 percent of greenhouse gas emissions across the
country. The most emission-producing activities in buildings are related to
heating and cooling and electricity consumption. As such, developing strategies
to create and retrofit buildings to be more energy efficient is one of the primary
ways to combat global warming. Cities can begin by addressing their own
public buildings to act as examples throughout the community on green
building practices. Local governments can also save money and energy by
purchasing energy-efficient office equipment. In Torrance, the City government
will act as a leader and example in sustainability and reduction in greenhouse
gas production. The City will pursue business in the most greenhouse gas-
sensitive way, promoting resource efficiency and conservation in buildings and
office equipment.
Additionally, approximately one-third of the greenhouse gases emitted in the
United States derive from transportation sources, including trucks and personal
automobiles. In the Los Angeles area, much of the urban landscape lends itself
to significant commutes and traffic. Municipalities can work to shift this pattern
of development, to create opportunities for alternative forms of transportation,
and to foster effective public transportation systems. Torrance promotes
alternatives to the automobile and will continue to support and encourage safe
and convenient ways for transit riders, pedestrians, and bicyclists to travel
throughout Torrance.
Due to its largely urban nature, Torrance experiences an “urban heat island
effect” which means ambient temperatures are higher than in more suburban or
rural areas. The main cause of the urban heat island is the replacement of
natural environments with paving, buildings and infrastructure. Waste heat
generated by energy usage also contributes to an increase in temperatures in
cities. Displacing trees and vegetation minimizes the natural cooling effects of
shading and evaporation of water from soil and leaves, while at the same time,
dark materials commonly used in urban areas, such as asphalt, retain the sun’s
heat and increase the temperature of the air. Policies to increase open space,
utilize light-colored development materials, and encourage the planting and
preservation of trees for shading of streets and buildings can help reduce the
heat island effect in Torrance.
Climate change is a global problem, but the solutions require local-level
leadership and participation. By fostering sustainable communities, conserving
energy, and encouraging alternative energy sources, municipalities are a crucial
component in the state’s drive to meet climate change goals. Integrating
principles of sustainability into all facets of planning, as indicated in Table CR-3,
can help shift lifestyle patterns and reduce our impact on the Earth’s resources.

                            CHAPTER 3:         Community Resources Element
The City of Torrance has taken steps to address climate change impacts
collaboratively through agreements with other local governments. Torrance has
joined the Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) Campaign, a program
administered by the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives
(ICLEI). To date, more than 800 local governments worldwide participate in the
Campaign, including 78 cities and counties located in California. Participant
governments in the program commit to lowering greenhouse gases through the
achievement of five milestones. These milestones are: (1) conducting a baseline
emissions inventory identifying the sources of greenhouse gases, and
calculating the volume contributed from energy use, transportation, and waste
management; (2) adopting an emissions reduction target; (3) developing a local
action plan: (4) implementation; and (5) monitoring. In addition, Torrance
signed the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, an aggressive global
warming initiative which calls for cities to enact policies and programs to
reduce global warming pollution levels to seven percent below 1990 levels by
2012.
3.2.2 SOUTH COAST AIR BASIN
Torrance is located within the South Coast Air Basin, a 6,000-square-mile area
which encompasses Los Angeles County and the non-desert portions of
Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. The South Coast Air Quality
Management District (SCAQMD), created in 1976, is the regional agency
authorized to develop and enforce air pollution control standards mandated by
the federal and state Clean Air Acts. Since Torrance is located within the
SCAQMD planning area, the City must comply with the provisions of the
AQMP, including the adoption of an Air Quality Element or its equivalent in the
General Plan to implement appropriate air pollution control measures.
                                                                                 Blue skies over Torrance:
                                                                                 Torrance normally
                                                                                 experiences better air
                                                                                 quality than found in
                                                                                 communities farther

Many factors contribute to the poor air quality in the South Coast Air Basin:
the area is highly populated, industrialized, and mobile. The particular climate
and geography of the area are major contributors as well. The generally light

CHAPTER 3:              Community Resources Element
winds and cool, marine layer capped by a temperature inversion layer restrict
the dispersal of the Basin's emissions.
Pollutants are emitted into the atmosphere from a variety of sources. Carbon
monoxide (CO) is formed by the incomplete combustion of fuels and is
primarily the product of vehicular emissions. Ozone (O3) is formed by
photochemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and reactive organic
gases (ROG). Fine particulate matter (PM10/PM2.5) refers to small particles 10
or five microns or less in diameter suspended in the air. These particles can be
formed in the air by chemical reactions or directly emitted by fuel combustion,
through abrasion, or soil erosion.
Torrance is located in the SCAQMD’s Southwest Coastal monitoring area. Due
to its geographic location and the prevailing westerly winds, Torrance normally
experiences better air quality than found in basin communities farther inland.
Nonetheless, the air basin is a “non-attainment” area for federal and state air
quality standards for ozone and state standards for particulate matter less than
10 microns in diameter (PM10). Peak air quality statistics for the six principal
pollutants measured in the year 2005 in the Southwest Coastal Los Angeles
County area, which includes Torrance, show that only one of the peak values in
the Southwest Coastal Los Angeles County area exceeded the federal or state
ambient air quality standards: ozone. SCAQMD data indicate that in 2005,
State standards for ozone were exceeded only on one day3. Days in excess of
State or federal standards for PM10 have been consistently dropping. The
maximum allowable concentration of PM10 was exceeded 12 times in 2002,
three times in 2003, two times in 2004, and no times in 2005.4
3.2.3 EMISSIONS
Historically, Torrance and other South Bay cities experience better air quality
relative to other Basin cities due to the proximity of the ocean and prevailing
temperature and wind patterns. For example, during the summer, when
photochemical smog is normally at its worst, the sunlight needed to create
photochemical smog is often blocked out by morning fog and low clouds,
which prevents the formation of smog along the coast.

However, the City is home to a number of emission sources which affect the
ambient air quality in the region. These emission sources are divided into two
categories, direct and indirect. Direct sources include stationary emission
sources, such as power plants and manufacturing and petroleum industries.
Indirect sources are businesses and activities which generate motor vehicle
traffic and therefore cause emissions.
DIRECT SOURCES
Direct sources for emissions primarily come from industrial processes. As the
twentieth century ended, heavy manufacturing businesses—regionally and
locally—moved out of the region and were replaced by light industrial
businesses which do not emit the level of pollutants generally associated with
heavy manufacturing. This transition has helped to improve the overall air
quality in the City and region. Industries that have remained include major
chemical and petrochemical businesses which contribute substantially to the
local economy.
The drilling and maintenance of oil wells also contributes to local air pollution.
To minimize environmental impacts from oil well activities, the City has
developed a policy to eliminate isolated wells as they are retired from use
(primarily in residential areas) and to encourage producers to convert to a
combined oil district method of pumping oil, whereby dispersed wells are
consolidated at a primary pumping station, thereby reducing oil activities and
associated negative environmental impacts.
INDIRECT SOURCES
Automobile emissions are a primary source of air pollution the Los Angeles
Basin. Thus, efforts to reduce emissions from this source can result in
significant improvements in air quality. The City has adopted a Trip Reduction
Ordinance (Municipal Code Division 9 Chapter 10) to incentivize walking,
cycling, use of public transit, and carpooling to work. In addition to
automobiles, the construction and operation of buildings are estimated to use
one-third of all energy consumed in the United States. This energy use
produces carbon dioxide emissions, a primary contributor to global warming.

CHAPTER 3:            Community Resources Element
The refrigerants used in air-conditioned buildings not only use more energy,
these systems produce emissions that can deplete the earth’s ozone layer.
Building materials are also a major source of air quality problems as they may
emit damaging sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and particulate emissions. Building
design and construction practices can be modified to reduce the amount of
energy and fossil fuels used and reduce emissions that erode the region’s air
quality. These design and construction processes can be achieved without
compromising safety and comfort or increasing construction and operating
costs. Energy efficiency in buildings is discussed further in two sections below:
3.8 Energy Conservation and 3.14 Sustainable Building Practices.
Trip reduction strategies are addressed in the Land Use and Circulation
Elements. The Land Use Element includes policies to encourage site design that
is conducive to walking. To reduce vehicle traffic and congestion within
Torrance, the Circulation Element includes policies to encourage the use of
alternative forms of transportation and Transportation Demand Management
(TDM) strategies to be implemented by employers, developers and merchants
within the City. TDM strategies include promoting the use of carpools,
vanpools, work-related transit use, bicycling and walking as a means to improve
air quality and to minimize congestion on the local and regional network.
Implementation actions for air quality as they relate to reduced automobile trips
are included in Appendix A.
3.3      AIR QUALITY OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The long-term improvement of air quality is a regional concern requiring the
coordination and cooperation of all jurisdictions within the South Coast Air
Basin. While Torrance residents enjoy relatively good air quality, the City
recognizes that its position as a regional employment center attracts vehicle
trips from locations where the air quality is not so good. The City recognizes
its responsibility to help reduce vehicle trips, continue to encourage industries
to adopt air friendly practices, and to reduce energy consumption that
contributes to air pollutant emissions.

3.4       WATER RESOURCES AND CONSERVATION
The Los Angeles Basin is a semi-arid desert environment. Average yearly
precipitation in the Torrance area is about 13 inches.5 Water is considered a
limited natural resource given climate conditions and the fact that Southern
California communities rely upon domestic water supplies imported from as far
away as the Colorado River. As part of a larger water system that imports
water, Torrance could, with careful management, reduce overall water use,
enhance local water resources, and reduce the City’s reliance on imported
water.

CHAPTER 3:            Community Resources Element
3.4.1 WATER SUPPLY
Two water agencies provide drinking water to Torrance residents and
businesses: the Torrance Municipal Water Department (TMWD) and the
Rancho Dominguez and Hermosa-Redondo Districts of the California Water
Service Company.
TMWD receives approximately 68 percent of its water supply from Metropolitan
Water District of Southern California (MWD) and 32 percent from local
supplies. Local sources include groundwater, desalinated groundwater, and
recycled water. Recycled water comprises approximately 21 percent of TMWD’s
water supply, while groundwater supplies (including desalinated groundwater)
make up approximately 11 percent. The Circulation and Infrastructure Element
provides additional information regarding water supplies, infrastructure, and
wastewater treatment.
3.4.2 WATER CONSERVATION AND QUALITY
Water conservation represents the most cost-effective and environmentally
sound way to reduce water use. Homeowners can take many actions to reduce
consumption, such as installing water-conserving plumbing fixtures and
appliances, fixing leaks, planting drought-tolerant landscaping, and simply
avoiding excessive watering of plants. Industrial and commercial users cannot
so easily reduce water use, particularly if manufacturing processes or
commercial enterprises require substantial water volumes.
The Urban Water Management Plan prepared by TMWD identifies several
demand management measures the City will pursue to ensure that the City has
enough water for everyday and emergency use. These include:
       Residential water surveys for residential customers
       Residential plumbing retrofit programs
       Distribution system water audits, leak detection, and repairs
       Landscape conservation programs
       High-efficiency washing machine rebate program
       Public information programs
       Water efficiency rebates for commercial and industrial customers
       Implementation of the City’s Water Waste Ordinance that requires
        conservation measures in the case of water shortages
       Residential ultra low-flush toilet program
Recycled water (also referred to as reclaimed water) represents an important
resource that can be used to offset use of potable water for non-potable
purposes, particularly for landscape irrigation. Recycled water is domestic
wastewater that is purified through primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment.
In response to increasing demands for water, the West Basin Municipal Water

                               CHAPTER 3:            Community Resources Element
District (WBMWD) has developed a regional water recycling program known as
the West Basin Water Recycling Project. WBMWD is a public agency that
purchases imported water from MWD and wholesales the imported water to
cities, mutual water companies, investor-owned utilities and private companies
in southwest Los Angeles County. TMWD purchases recycled water from the
WBMWD through the Water Recycling Project. The recycled water comes from
the West Basin Water Recycling Plant located in El Segundo. Current recycled
water users include Casmir, Arlington, and Magruder Schools and McMaster,
Descasno, Guenser, and Columbia Parks.6 The ExxonMobil Oil Refinery is the
largest user of recycled water in the City, using approximately 97 percent of all
recycled water within the City7.
The City’s commitment to encourage recycled water use is best demonstrated
through the reclaimed water ordinance in the Municipal Code (Section 76.5.1).
The purpose of the ordinance is to:
          Establish a City policy with regard to the use of reclaimed water that is
           consistent with State of California law.
          Preserve the reliability of the potable public water supply during times
           of water shortage by diversification of source of supply through the use
           of reclaimed water for various non-potable uses.
          Provide an alternative water supply source that will, in the long term,
           lower overall water costs to water customers in the City.
          Provide a uniform means of implementing a reclaimed water program in
           the City.
In addition, the updated Recycled Water Master Plan will identify and prioritize
public and private sites for possible connection to the recycled water system.
The City’s Urban Water Management Plan also identifies potential users of
recycled water and methods such as financial incentives to encourage recycled
water use.
To promote water conservation, the City will continue to implement water
conservation measures set forth in the Municipal Code and the Urban Water
Management Plan.
STORM POLLUTANTS
The federal Water Pollution Control Act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant
to navigable waters from a point source unless the discharge is authorized by a
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. NPDES permit
requirements were established in 1987 with the passage of the Water Quality

CHAPTER 3:            Community Resources Element
Act. The NPDES permit program controls water pollution by regulating point
sources that discharge pollutants into so-called waters of the United States.
In Torrance, NPDES permits are issued by the California Regional Water Quality
Control Board, Los Angeles Region (RWQCB) as part of its Storm Water
Program. The Los Angeles Region has jurisdiction over all coastal drainages
flowing to the Pacific Ocean between western Ventura County and the eastern
Los Angeles County line, as well as the drainages of five coastal islands. The
NPDES program coordinates the actions of all incorporated cities within this
region (except Long Beach) and the Los Angeles County government to regulate
and control storm water and urban runoff into Los Angeles County waterways
and ultimately, into the Pacific Ocean.
In support of the permit (NPDES No. CAS004001) and the obligation to keep
waterways clean by reducing or eliminating contaminants from storm water
and dry-weather runoff, the City complies with the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board’s Monitoring and Reporting Program. The City has a
storm water education program, an aggressive inspection team that issues
citations for water quality violations, and requires the use of “best management
practices” in many residential, commercial, and development-related activities
to reduce runoff.
DETENTION AND RETENTION BASINS
Three storm water retention basins (referred to locally as sumps) and fourteen
detention basins throughout Torrance serve the primary purpose of controlling
storm water runoff and preventing localized ponding and flooding. (Refer to the
discussion in the Safety Element.) Retention basins hold water after a storm
but have no outlet. Detention basins have an outlet and retain the water for a
period of time. Although not originally intended as a means of collecting
pollutants, they do serve this dual function. As the County upgrades the
capacity of the regional storm drain system, several basins will no longer be
needed for flood control purposes. Basins have the potential to serve as
combined flood control and recreational areas. The retention basins have a
greater potential for use as parks as water quality regulations do not apply to
them.

3.6       MINERAL RESOURCES
The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA) requires
that all cites consider mapped mineral resources designations (as defined by the
State Mining and Geology Board) in long-term planning efforts. SMARA was
enacted to promote the conservation and sensitive use of significant mineral
deposits. The law ensures that significant aggregate resources are recognized
and considered before land use decisions are made that may compromise the
long-term availability of these resources.
The State Mining and Geology Board classifies lands in California based on
availability of mineral resources.              Four Mineral Resources Zone (MRZ)
designations have been established for the classification of sand, gravel, and
crushed rock resources:
         MRZ-1 – Adequate information indicates that no significant mineral
          deposits are present or likely to be present.
         MRZ-2 – Adequate information indicates that significant mineral
          deposits are present or there is a high likelihood for their presence, and
          development should be controlled.
         MRZ-3 – The significance of mineral deposits cannot be determined
          from the available data.
         MRZ-4 – There is insufficient data to assign any other MRZ designation.
The classification system is intended to ensure consideration of statewide or
regionally significant mineral deposits by the City in planning and development
administration. These mineral resource designations are intended to prevent
incompatible land use development on areas determined to have significant
mineral resource deposits. Figure CR-5 identifies the locations of the mineral
resource zones in Torrance. According to the State Mining and Geology Board,
the majority of land within Torrance is classified as MRZ-1 and MRZ-38. A small

3.7      WILDLIFE PROTECTION
Madrona Marsh is the most important wildlife habitat area in Torrance.
Although the City has many beautiful open space areas, these largely are highly
developed and programmed urban parks which support birds and small animals
commonly found in such environments.
                                                                        Madrona Marsh: Vernal

3.7.1 MADRONA MARSH
Madrona Marsh represents a significant achievement in natural resource
conservation. After 15 years of effort by the City and the Friends of Madrona
Marsh to save the marsh from extinction, the Madrona Marsh was established
as a permanent ecological preserve in 1986.
The Marsh was privately owned until November, 1986, at which time it was
deeded to the City of Torrance by the developers of the Park Del Amo project,
the Torrance Investment Company, and the Santa Fe Land Improvement
Company.
The Madrona Marsh and adjacent sandy upland has been designated by Los
Angeles County as a Significant Ecological Area. This designation was the result
of a growing awareness that natural areas of real value were fast disappearing.
This remnant area is viewed by the environmental, educational, and scientific
communities as a resource that should be preserved for future generations.
Madrona Marsh is a remnant of a natural vernal wetland sustained by a historic
drainage basin that no longer exists. The marsh covers approximately 11 acres
within a larger open space preserve area; the balance of the area is sandy upland
and wetland. Vernal marshes are distinct in that they flood during the rainy
season and dry out after the rainy season has passed. This wetland regime

                             CHAPTER 3:          Community Resources Element
produces a unique ecosystem, and its significance is evidenced by the diversity
of life that resides there. This 42-plus acre site is home to over 110 species of
plants, over 65 families of insects, two amphibian species, three species of
reptiles, about 160 types of birds, and at least four mammal species.
As an ecological preserve, the Marsh also provides the community with the
benefits of a natural park, zoo, and arboretum combined. In 2001, the 8,000-
square-foot Madrona Marsh Nature Center was established. The facility is an
educational and interpretive center for the Madrona Marsh Preserve's natural
resources. The Center offers special educational programs, laboratories,
displays, books, and other aids to understanding the Marsh’s unique habitat.
The Center includes a reception area, exhibit room, classroom, project lab,
curator's lab, restrooms, gift shop, staff offices, administrative area, and
volunteer room.
3.7.2 ADDITIONAL WILDLIFE RESOURCES
In addition to Madrona Marsh, many detention and retention basins, selected
open parkland, and other sites on public and private property contain natural
habitat systems. These sites have the potential for restored natural habitat.
Valuable sites include:
         Entradero Park – well over half of this park is natural open space but
          not managed for habitat
         Henrietta Marsh (across from West High School) – Historical/seasonal
          wetland/marsh, contoured as a storm water detention basin
         Los Arboles Park – Lower slope on the south Torrance hillside is natural
          area with native plant communities
         Torrance Beach – Beach sand and shoreline/tidal system, unique sand
          bluffs, and restorable habitat communities
         Walteria Detention Basin – The remains of historical Lake Walteria, a
          seasonal lake and wetlands with potential for waterfowl and general
          bird sanctuary
         Amie, Entradero, Walnut, and 237th Street detention basins – These
          sumps have the potential for wildlife habitat, habitat restoration, and
          public education

3.8     WILDLIFE HABITAT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Madrona Marsh is one of the City’s most important assets. The marsh’s
contribution to the preservation of natural habitat in an urban environment and
to the educational and recreational enrichment of residents is invaluable. As a
steward of the preserve, the City is committed to the proper management of
the physical and biological resources on the property and non-destructive
public use of the site.

3.9     TORRANCE BEACH
While many people do not think of Torrance as a beach community, Torrance
Beach is a hidden resource that residents treasure. Torrance Beach extends
roughly one mile along the Pacific Coast and reaches inland approximately 200
feet. This community resource provides about 20 acres of beach for the
swimming, surfing, and sunbathing enjoyment of residents and visitors. The

southern portion of Torrance Beach is controlled by the City through
ownership, easement, or lease from the State of California, and the northern
portion is owned and/or controlled by the County of Los Angeles. The Los
Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors manages the beach
services and facilities.
   Torrance Beach: The Beach provides approximately 20 acres of beach access to the Pacific
   Ocean.
Facilities at Torrance Beach include public restrooms, showers, a lifeguard
facility, concession stand, volleyball courts, swing sets, strand walkway, a bike
path, and a parking lot. Five paths provide easy beach access, including access
for handicapped visitors.
3.9.1 TORRANCE BEACH OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Torrance Beach, like the Madrona Marsh, is an open space resource that
benefits the community and complements developed parks and open spaces.
The City recognizes the beach as a place for recreation and refuge from urban
life. The City is committed to working with the State and County agencies to
ensure cooperation and the proper maintenance and safeguard of this
significant coastal resource.

3.10 AESTHETIC RESOURCES
One of Torrance’s greatest assets is the aesthetic quality of our community. As
visitors cross from neighboring cities and county areas into Torrance, the
canopy of street trees and landscaped boulevards create a feeling of calm and
distinction. The attention paid to quality private development and public spaces
shows that we care about community appearance. Although aesthetic value is
subjective and can change over time, we always expect high standards.
3.10.1 URBAN FOREST
Trees create the “urban forest” of Torrance and enhance the aesthetic quality of
the City. They also contribute to clean air, provide cooling shade, support
wildlife, increase property values, control soil erosion, conserve water, create
sound barriers, absorb greenhouse gases from the air, and provide protection
from high winds. The urban forest is comprised of a street tree system, trees on
parks and other public lands, and trees on private properties and in yards
throughout Torrance.
                                                                      Tree-lined Neighborhood near

Torrance is fortunate to have numerous mature specimen trees. Many trees
were planted in the early decades of the 1900s as street trees in residential
neighborhoods and windbreaks on what was once agricultural land. Because of
the age and size of these trees, a comprehensive approach to their eventual
replacement is needed to maintain the qualities they contribute to the
community aesthetic.
The eucalyptus trees that parallel Torrance Boulevard between Madrona Avenue
and Border Avenue average over 60 feet in height and 80 years in age.
ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010                           CR-56                   CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN

Eucalyptuses of similar age and height line segments of Pacific Coast Highway
between Crenshaw Boulevard and Calle Mayor, along Plaza Del Amo from
Carson Street to Arlington Avenue, and in the Walteria area. Downtown
Torrance contains acacias, palms, camphors, jacarandas, and California pepper
trees dating to establishment of the area. In the Hollywood Riviera
neighborhood are excellent examples of pine, eucalyptus, palm, and bottle
brush trees which were planted in the late 1920s.
To preserve these community assets, the City is developing a program to map
street trees. Such an inventory yields important information regarding the age
and condition of trees and an indication of areas that will benefit from
additional plantings. The City will continue to implement a master landscaping
plan that defines the types, sizing, and spacing of street trees and that sets
forth a comprehensive approach for replacing older trees that die. As
appropriate, this effort will be accomplished in conjunction with the
development of corridor plans for arterial streets and with plans for key entry
points into Torrance.
Additionally, the City will work to preserve specimen trees on public and
private property. For example, where specimen trees may be threatened by
street widening projects, trees may be saved by relocation and/or reducing the
width of sidewalks. On private property, the preservation of specimen trees
should factor into land development decisions. In July 2001, the City’s street
tree policy established special designated areas where street trees have created
an ambiance and image for Torrance and should be protected and conserved.
This policy will apply to additional areas over time as new streets trees are
planted and existing trees mature.
3.10.2 SCENIC VISTAS
The topography of Torrance creates many scenic vistas throughout the City.
From the hillsides along the City’s western and southern boundaries, one can
see the distant San Gabriel Mountains to the north. The hillsides of the Riviera
neighborhood look over the Pacific Ocean. Recognizing the value of these
scenic views, the City has adopted policies for the hillside areas that require
review of development proposals. Similar protections are appropriate for views
from public places, including street rights-of-way.

Artificial light sources used in abundance can create irritating glare effects and
light pollution. Glare can impact residents’ enjoyment of their outdoor living
spaces, and light pollution can hinder clear views of the night sky. To minimize
adverse impacts of light and glare, the City will adopt outdoor lighting
standards. The standards may also require the use of energy conservation
lighting fixtures to reduce energy consumption.

3.12 ENERGY CONSERVATION
When we drive our children to school, boil a pot of water, or cool down the
house on a warm sunny day, we use energy. The energy that keeps our
appliances and vehicles running generally requires the burning of fossil fuels.
Given the nonrenewable nature of fossil fuels, California consumers and power
providers continue to evaluate other sources of energy and adopt energy
conservation strategies.
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                  CR-59                               ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010
CHAPTER 3:            Community Resources Element
Energy conservation is the practice of decreasing the quantity of energy used
while achieving a similar outcome of end use. Energy conservation has the
added benefit of decreasing pollutants released into the air and preserving
natural resources. Individuals and organizations often conserve energy to
reduce energy costs and promote environmental values. Industrial and
commercial users may want to increase efficiency and maximize profit.
3.12.1 RENEWABLE ENERGY
Renewable energy sources capture energy from on-going natural processes such
as sunshine, wind, flowing water, biological processes, and geothermal heat
flows. The advantage of renewable energy sources is that they can be
replenished within a relatively short time period. Alternative energy resources
may be used directly or used to create other more convenient forms of energy.
Examples of direct use include solar ovens, geothermal heating, and water-
wheels and windmills. Examples of indirect use which require energy harvesting
are electricity generation through wind turbines or photovoltaic cells, or
production of fuels such as ethanol from biomass.
The City of Torrance and much of Southern California are fortunate to have
abundant sunshine making it possible to design or modify buildings to take
advantage of passive solar heating and natural cooling. Use of solar heating
and natural cooling can also result in more pleasant interior environments
because of increased natural light and reduced noise from mechanical
equipment.
3.12.2 OIL RESOURCES AND PRODUCTION
Oil and gas are non-renewable resources that must be extracted from the earth.
A considerable portion of Torrance overlies oil- and gas-bearing strata that
constitute part of the Torrance Oil Field, which extends from the Redondo
Beach offshore area on the northwest to the Wilmington Oil Field on the
southeast. Petroleum has been pumped continuously from the Torrance Oil
Field since the early 1920s; since 1922, over 200 million barrels of oil have been
withdrawn from the field.
Given the value of these oil resources to the local economy and the importance
of petroleum products to many industries, the City supports continued
productive oil recovery operations within the Torrance Oil Field, provided such
activities do not represent a safety hazard or cause localized visual or economic
blight. As emerging technologies allow for extraction activities to become
increasingly efficient, the City will promote and encourage consolidated
operations, the conversion of idle oil lands to more productive uses, and the
revitalization of marginal facilities. (Refer to the Land Use Element for a
discussion of related land use compatibility issues and the Safety Element for a
discussion of the safety aspects of oil production.)

The City promotes energy conservation through the implementation of State of           standards.
California Title 24 building code energy performance requirements. Title 24
measures require, for example, minimum ceiling, wall, and raised floor
insulation, and minimum heating, ventilating, air conditioning and water
heating equipment efficiencies. The City also recognizes the role of sustainable
building practices in achieving energy efficiency (see discussion in Section 3.14
below).

3.14 SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES
3.14.1 SOLID WASTE GENERATION AND RECYCLING
Since the late 1970s, an increasing shortage of refuse disposal sites and
diminishing landfill capacity led the California Legislature to implement the
Integrated Waste Management Act (AB 939) to reduce, recycle, and reuse solid
waste generated in the state. Specifically, the Act requires jurisdictions to
divert 50 percent of solid waste from landfill disposal through recycling or
source reduction programs, as well as to oversee the disposal of household
hazardous wastes. The state has continued to refine program goals and work
toward preserving land resources for productive uses, not landfills. To meet
these goals, the City established a Source Reduction and Recycling Element to
define the diversion goals for waste haulers contracted with the City of
Torrance.
The City Council, residents, and businesses have also entered into the Resource
Conservation Awareness Partnership to raise awareness about conservation
and recycling. Through various waste collection, reduction, and recycling
programs, Torrance residents and businesses recycle over 10,000 tons of
materials each year. In addition, the City partners with the Torrance Unified
School District. To further encourage recycling and waste reduction, the City is
committed to expanding residential and commercial curbside waste collection
to include collection and recycling of green waste.

Energy efficient buildings are certified “green” by the U.S. Green Building
Council’s Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) rating system.
The LEED rating system is a nationally accepted standard that rates
development that minimizes the use of energy, water, and other natural
resources. The City of Torrance is home to one of the world’s largest and most
publicized models for green building. In 2003, the south campus addition to
the Toyota Motor Sales headquarters became the largest project to receive a
Gold rating in the U.S. LEED green building program (gold is the second highest
level).
3.14.3 LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT
One innovative approach to sustainable development practices is low impact
development (LID) which is an approach to land development (or
redevelopment) that works with nature to manage storm water as close to its
source as possible. LID employs principles such as preserving and recreating
natural landscape features, minimizing effective imperviousness to create
functional and appealing site drainage that treats storm water as a resource
rather than a waste product. LID benefits water supply and contributes to
water quality protection. Unlike traditional storm water management, which
collects and conveys storm water runoff through storm drains, pipes, or other
conveyances to a centralized storm water facility, LID takes a different approach
by using site design and storm water management to maintain the site’s pre-
development runoff rates and volumes. LID’s goal is to mimic a site’s
predevelopment hydrology by using design practices and techniques that
effectively capture, filter, store, evaporate, detain and infiltrate runoff close to
its source. There are many practices that have been used to adhere to these
principles such as bioretention facilities, rain gardens, vegetated rooftops, rain
barrels, and permeable pavements. By implementing LID principles and
practices, water can be managed in a way that reduces the impact of built areas
and promotes the natural movement of water within an ecosystem or
watershed. Developer cost savings can be achieved through reductions in
clearing and grading costs, and the costs of pipes, ponds, curbs and paving
usually associated with traditional development.

The City will undertake a phased approach to adopting green building practices.
Public education will be a key to implementing green building design and
construction on a wide scale. Programs will focus on educating residents and
businesses regarding the environmental and financial incentives of sustainable
design. A recognition program will serve as a tool to publicize outstanding
examples of sustainable buildings and clarify misconceptions about the look
and cost of sustainable building and design.
3.15 SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES OBJECTIVES AND
          POLICIES
The City will continue to implement strong waste diversion and recycling
programs to increase public awareness of sustainable practices and reduce
pressures on regional landfills. Green building will be promoted, with the City
taking a leadership role in demonstrating the benefits of sustainable design and
construction.

INTRODUCTION
“Providing for a safe and secure community is an important part of the mission of
the City of Torrance.”
- City of Torrance Strategic Plan, 2008
Providing a safe living environment is one of the most important challenges
cities face today. Torrance is located in a region exposed to natural disasters
such as earthquakes and landslides, and the increased concern over terrorism
we have experienced as a nation have elevated public safety issues in the public
consciousness. Residents and businesses look to the City to protect the
community from threats to public safety. People recognize that a low crime
rate, fire prevention, and reliable emergency response services contribute to the
attractiveness of Torrance. While the City has no control over earthquakes or
landslides, we can set forth policies that minimize exposure to these hazards.
By identifying threats to our safety, we can better guard against disasters and
develop effective response plans.
The Safety Element sets forth policies designed to minimize threats from natural
and human-caused hazards. By implementing the Safety Element, the City of
Torrance can deliver timely emergency service delivery and focus on the
expansion of such services throughout the City. Likely increases in traffic
congestion, population growth, and ever-changing needs within the
community will continue to place demand on resources. This Element can help
to establish safety-related priorities for the City.
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                       S-1                        ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010

CHAPTER 4:            Safety Element
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER
GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
Keeping Torrance safe is a theme addressed throughout the General Plan. The
Land Use Element limits the range of land uses allowed in hazardous areas to
reduce the number of people and buildings exposed to risk. Objectives and
policies in the Circulation and Infrastructure Element aim to make Torrance a
safe place to drive, bike, and walk. The Circulation and Infrastructure Element
also addresses water supply. The Noise Element establishes policies and
priorities to protect residents from noise related to traffic and aircraft
operations.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE
SAFETY ELEMENT
The Safety Element is one of the required General Plan elements. The City has
long emphasized a proactive approach to planning, which involves identifying
and avoiding or mitigating hazards present in the environment that may
adversely affect property and threaten lives. Government Code Sections
65302(g) and 65302(f) identify several issues to consider in such planning
efforts, as does California Health and Safety Code Section 56050.1. In Torrance,
issues of concern include:
        Seismic hazards, including seismically induced surface rupture, ground
         shaking, and ground failure
        Dam/reservoir failure
        Non-seismic ground failure such as slope instability leading to
         mudslides, landslides, and liquefaction
        Flooding
        Wildland and urban fires
        Presence of hazardous materials and many large-scale industrial uses
Within this Element, safety issues are organized into four broad themes:
Natural Hazards. Addresses seismic hazards such as earthquakes, earthquake-
related ground failure, landslides, and flooding.
Human Activity Hazards. Addresses fire hazards, hazardous materials, oil
production, and Torrance Municipal Airport (Zamperini Field).
Emergency Response and Public Safety. Emergency response efforts are
essential to prevent or minimize potential loss of life or property damage and to

respond effectively to safety hazards, accidents, and natural disasters. The City
has emergency plans which establish emergency preparedness and emergency
response procedures through the Hazard Mitigation Plan and the Multi-Hazard
Functional Plan. Police and fire protection services create a safe community for
residents and businesses. Low crime, foresight in the development process,
and adequate enforcement lead to a safe environment.
Effective Land Remediation. The remediation and development of high priority
contaminated sites will help protect public safety and the environment of
Torrance and its residents.
                           The highest level of protection of life and property
GOAL:                      from natural and human-caused hazards
1.        NATURAL HAZARDS
Torrance residents, along with most Southern Californians, have long accepted
that we are vulnerable to major and potentially devastating natural disasters.
Because of this life-long familiarity with earthquakes, floods, and landslides, we
generally feel comfortable about our ability to confront and address these
hazards. However, the public consciousness has become attuned to newer,
less familiar hazards such as terrorism. The City recognizes its role and
responsibility to minimize the effects of natural hazards to the greatest extent
possible and to guard against newer threats to community safety.
1.1       SEISMIC AND GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS
Seismic and geological hazards represent the most significant natural hazards in
Torrance. Earthquakes and their related effects have the greatest potential to
impact a large portion of the population. Other geologic hazards such as
landslides and ground subsidence have more localized effects but can still have
catastrophic results. The combination of sound planning practices and
continued public education will minimize risks to the community and protect
the health, safety, and welfare of Torrance residents.
1.1.1 EARTHQUAKES
An earthquake is a manifestation of the constant movement and shifting of the
earth’s surface. Movement occurs along fractures or faults, which represent the
contact point between two or more geologic formations. Earth movement —
known as seismic activity — causes pressure to build up along a fault, and the
release of pressure results in the groundshaking effects we call an earthquake.
The primary results from earthquakes are strong ground shaking and surface
fault rupture.      Secondary effects include landslides, slope deformation,
liquefaction, and ground subsidence.

CHAPTER 4:            Safety Element
Ground-shaking effects felt locally depend upon many factors, most notably the
intensity of the event, distance to the earthquake epicenter, the depth of the
earthquake, and local soils conditions. Seismologists use a logarithmic
magnitude scale to describe the intensity of earthquakes. However, what
impresses us most when an earthquake occurs are its effects. What kind of
damage correlates to, for example, a 5.4 Magnitude earthquake? The Modified
Mercalli Scale, presented in Table S-1, was developed to provide a description,
in layman terms, of the potential destructive effects of earthquakes associated
with the varying magnitudes of the logarithmic Magnitude earthquake scale.

Earthquake-triggered geological effects include ground shaking, surface fault
rupture, landslides, liquefaction, subsidence, tsunamis and seiches, all of which
are discussed below. Earthquakes can also lead to urban fires, reservoir failures,
and toxic chemical releases.
GROUND SHAKING
The greatest source of earthquake damage is caused by ground shaking,
particularly horizontal ground acceleration. The City is susceptible to ground
shaking caused by multiple nearby earthquake fault zones. The 200-mile
stretch of the San Andreas fault, which is commonly referred to as “Big Bend”,
is located approximately 75 miles north of Torrance. This area is highly
susceptible to earthquakes because the Pacific and North American tectonic

plates are colliding rather than sliding past each other.1 The constant collision
creates thrust faulting through localized compression. Some of the region’s
most recent damaging earthquakes have occurred on thrust faults, including the
1971 San Fernando (MW2 6.7), the 1987 Whittier Narrows (MW 5.9), the 1991
Sierra Madre (MW 5.8), and the 1994 Northridge (MW 6.7) earthquakes.
The potential for ground shaking in Torrance depends on the proximity to the
affected fault and the intensity of the seismic event along the fault. Since
Torrance is close to multiple fault zones, movement along any of the zones has
the potential of adversely affecting the City. The highest risks from earthquake
fault zones come from the Palos Verdes fault zone, the Puente Hills fault, the
Newport-Inglewood fault zone, the Elysian Park fault zone, the Malibu Coast-
Santa Monica-Hollywood fault zone, and the Whittier fault zone. Figure S-1
illustrates the spaghetti-like pattern of faults within and surrounding our City
and the proposed Fault Hazard Management Zone, discussed later in this
section, that encourages the study of the onshore segment of the Palos Verdes
fault to conclusively determine whether or not it is an active structure. As
shown on Figure S-1, faults identified within the City are located primarily
south of Pacific Coast Highway and both within the Torrance Municipal Airport
and north of it.
Table S-2 identifies faults thought capable of producing very substantial seismic
events by producing horizontal ground accelerations of Modified Mercalli
Intensities greater than VII in the Torrance area. The table shows the
approximate distance between the fault and various points in Torrance and the
maximum magnitude earthquake (Mmax) each fault is estimated capable of
generating.
FAULT RUPTURE
Fault rupture is a ground movement that occurs during an earthquake.
Although primary ground rupture usually results in a small percentage of the
total damage in an earthquake, structures located close to a rupturing fault may
be severely damaged.3 In 1972, the Alquist-Priolo Fault Zoning Act was
enacted with the purpose of mitigating the hazard of fault rupture by
prohibiting buildings along all active fault lines. As of 2009, no Aquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zones had been designated within the Torrance city limits.
However, if the Palos Verdes fault were ever zoned as an active fault, then an
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone would include a southern portion of
Torrance.

MINIMIZING RISKS FROM EARTHQUAKES
To reduce the hazards associated with seismic activity, the City requires that all
new development abide by the most recently adopted City and State seismic
and geotechnical requirements to protect injury and structural damage due to
geologic and seismic hazards.
Historically, the greatest structural damage from earthquakes has been to
unreinforced masonry buildings, especially in areas of artificial fill or water-
soaked alluvium. The City has a mandatory retrofit seismic ordinance that was
adopted in 1987. Torrance was also the first city in California to use a bond
instrument as a tool to finance the seismic retrofit of privately owned
buildings.4 Using subsidies, the City of Torrance prioritized the retrofit of older
buildings, especially unreinforced masonry buildings that needed to be
reinforced and strengthened. The City hoped that through this project, the
owners of affected structure would be more willing to pay for retrofit plans if
the work were subsidized. In addition, the subsidy conveyed the City's concern
regarding the life safety hazard posed by unreinforced masonry buildings and its
interest in seeing the issue addressed. As a result of these measures, most of
the unreinforced masonry buildings in the City have been brought into
compliance with the City’s mandatory strengthening requirements.
The most pressing issue related to earthquake safety concerns the area around
the Palos Verdes fault. Geologic studies on the Palos Verdes fault suggest that
seismic activity on this fault could exceed movement that most engineered
structures are not designed to withstand, so buildings that straddle the fault
will most certainly be damaged beyond repair if and when the fault breaks the
surface. Since it is impractical to reduce the damage potential to acceptable
levels by engineering design, the most appropriate mitigation measure is to
simply avoid placing structures on or near active fault traces. However, given
the extensive urbanization in the area, the opportunity to avoid the fault when
siting habitable structures has already been lost. During re-development of
these lots, geologic studies should be conducted to locate the fault, with
structural setbacks established around the active fault traces. However,
implementation of this measure is likely to take decades, as the replacement of
fault-impacted prime real estate with greenbelts or other non-habitable uses
may be unpopular with property owners.
Because of the complexity of most active fault zones — particularly at the
surface where they may become braided, splayed, or segmented — locating and
evaluating the active traces of a fault is often not an easy or inexpensive task.
Nevertheless, given the significant surface fault rupture hazard in the area, the
City will establish a fault hazard management zone around the traces of the
Palos Verdes fault that are considered more recently active (Figure S-1). The

intent of the fault hazard management zone is to require that geologic
investigations, which may include fault trenching, be performed if conventional
structures designed for human occupancy are proposed within the zone.
1.1.2 SEISMIC-RELATED ACTIVITY
The potential for large magnitude earthquakes in our region is a reality we live
with daily. In addition to ground shaking, earthquakes present the potential for
ground and slope failure. California law requires identification of liquefaction
zones, where the stability of foundation soils must be investigated, and
landslide zones, where the stability of hillslopes must be evaluated.
Areas with the potential to experience landslides or liquefaction-induced
ground displacements are shown in Figure S-2.
                                                                                     Figure S-2:

Figure S-2 shows areas where previous occurrences of landslide and liquefaction
movement, or local topographic, geological, geotechnical, and groundwater
conditions indicate a potential for permanent ground displacements such that
mitigation as defined in Public Resources Code Section 2693c would be
required.
The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act (SHMA, Public Resources Code 2690 et
seq.), which was passed by the State in 1990, addresses non-surface fault
rupture earthquake hazards such as ground shaking, liquefaction, and
landslides. Whereas the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act specifically
addresses surface fault ruptures, the Mapping Act deals more with other
earthquake hazards, and helps to identify and mitigate these hazards to
minimize the loss of life and property. The Act is implemented by the California
Geological Survey, whose seismic hazards map for the three quadrangles that
cover the City show that liquefaction and earthquake-induced hazards are
present in some areas of Torrance. In accordance with the SHMA, all projects
within a State-delineated Seismic Hazard Zone for landslides and liquefaction
must be evaluated by a certified engineering geologist and/or registered civil
engineer. Likewise, project review by the local agency must be performed by
geologists and engineers with the same credentials and experience. Seismic
Hazard Maps may not show all areas that have the potential for liquefaction
and landslides, nor is information shown on the maps sufficient to serve as a
substitute for detailed site investigations.
LANDSLIDES
Ground shaking from earthquakes can cause landslides in areas with steep or
unstable slopes. Seismically induced landslides can overrun structures, people,
or property; sever utility lines; and block roads, thereby hindering rescue
operations after an earthquake.
In a landslide, surface rocks and bedrocks can fall onto the roads, buildings, and
utility lines below the slope, causing damage to residents and properties. In
general, slopes steeper than about 15 degrees are most susceptible. However,
failures can occur on flatter slopes if unsupported weak rock units are exposed
in the slope face. Figure S-2 identifies the boundaries of areas vulnerable to
earthquake-induced landslides and slope instability, particularly steep slope
areas south of Pacific Coast Highway.
For suspect slopes, appropriate geotechnical investigation and slope stability
analyses should be performed for both static and dynamic (earthquake)
conditions. For deeper slides, mitigation typically includes such measures as
buttressing slopes or re-grading the slope to a different configuration.
Protection from rock falls or surface slides can often be achieved by protective
devices such as barriers, retaining structures, catchment areas, or a
combination of these. The runout area of the slide at the base of the slope and
the potential bouncing of rocks must also be considered. If it is not feasible to
mitigate unstable slope conditions, building setbacks should be imposed.

CHAPTER 4:            Safety Element
LIQUEFACTION
Liquefaction is a geologic process that causes various types of ground failure.
Liquefaction typically occurs in loose, saturated sediments primarily of sandy
composition. When liquefaction occurs, the sediments involved have a total or
substantial loss of shear strength and behave like a liquid substance.
Liquefaction can cause structural distress or failure due to ground settlement, a
loss of bearing capacity in the foundation soils, and the buoyant rise of buried
structures. In Torrance, the greatest risk of liquefaction occurs along the bluffs
overlooking Torrance Beach.
Residential or commercial development is not planned to occur in the
liquefiable area along the beach. However, structures and improvements such
as roadways, major utility lines, and park improvements could be vulnerable to
damage from liquefaction if mitigation measures have not been included in their
design. Construction planned for these areas should include appropriate
liquefaction mitigation measures.
A considerable part of the City’s mapped liquefiable areas — along the channel
of Dominguez Creek — are already built upon, mostly with residential and
commercial development. A nearby moderate to strong earthquake could cause
extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure in these areas. Since
retrofitting measures are generally not feasible due to cost, the City will be
prepared to respond to damage and disruption in the event of an earthquake.
Any new development will require liquefaction susceptibility studies prior to
design and construction.
TSUNAMIS
A tsunami is a large sea wave generated by any large-scale disturbance of the
ocean floor that occurs in a short period of time, such as an earthquake,
volcanic eruption, or coastal landslide, which can cause a sudden displacement
of water. Though local earthquakes may cause tsunamis, most past tsunamis in
Southern California were associated with distant earthquakes that traveled
great distances across the Pacific Ocean basin.
The tsunami hazard for Torrance, which is encompassed in the Southern
California region from the Palos Verdes Peninsula south to San Diego, is
moderate5 due to proximity to several active offshore faults.

To respond to natural disaster such as a tsunami, Torrance’s Emergency Services
program has established a recovery system for residents, which includes the
following action items6:
         Replace, reconstruct, remove, and relocate damaged/destroyed
          infrastructures/buildings
         Establish priorities for emergency repairs to facilities, buildings, and
          infrastructures
         Economic recovery and community development
         New or amended zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building
          and sanitary codes
In addition, the City has established eight Area Disaster Centers that provide
communication to and from Torrance’s Emergency Operation Center. The
centers are located at major City buildings and library branches, and assist with
communication during a disaster.7 Table S-3 lists the name and location of the
centers.

1.1.3 FLOODING
Floods are natural and recurring events that only become hazardous when
humans encroach onto floodplains, modifying the landscape and building
structures in the areas meant to convey excess water during floods.
Unfortunately, floodplains have been alluring to populations for ages, since
they provide level ground and fertile soils suitable for agriculture, as well as
access to water and transportation routes. Notwithstanding, these benefits
come with a price – flooding is one of the most destructive natural hazards in
the world, responsible for more deaths per year than any other geologic hazard.
Torrance and surrounding areas are, like most of Southern California, subject to
unpredictable seasonal rainfall. Most years, the scant winter rains are barely
sufficient to turn the hills green for a few weeks, but every few years the region
is subjected to periods of intense and sustained precipitation that results in
flooding.
STORM FLOODING
The City lies at the western edge of the greater floodplain of the Los Angeles
and San Gabriel Rivers. Prior to human intervention in historic times, these
rivers collected runoff from the surrounding mountains, spreading storm water
and sediment loads across the basin. Today, runoff is largely controlled by
streets, retention and detention basins, storm drains, and flood control
channels.
In coastal Los Angeles County, including the Torrance area, flooding is difficult
to predict, and thus plan for, because rainfall varies from year to year. In 1983,
for example, flooding occurred at California Street/Hawaii Avenue and along
Torrance Boulevard between Van Ness and Western Avenues. The channels in
the Torrance area are typical for Southern California. Except for runoff from
human activities, such as irrigation and industrial discharges, stream flow is
negligible other than during and immediately after rains. In addition to
channels, three retention and fourteen detention basins scattered throughout
the City collect and store runoff. The basins are cleaned periodically to
maintain their storage capacity. As the County upgrades the capacity of its
storm drain system, these basins are likely to be abandoned.8
To prepare and mitigate hazards from flooding, the City of Torrance participates
in the National Flood Insurance Program. Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs),
which are prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),
maps potential flood zones. Flood hazards related to storm events generally are
described in terms of 100- or 500-year flood. A 100-year flood is defined as a
major flood event that has a one percent or greater chance of occurring during

CHAPTER 4:             Safety Element
any one year. Flood hazard planning practices addresses such storms, as well
as 500-year events. As implied, the 100- and 500-year floods are the largest
flood events that may be expected to occur within 100-year and 500-year
periods, respectively. These floods are considered severe but ones which can be
reasonably predicted and therefore reasonably mitigated.
According to the FIRMs, and shown on Figure S-3, only a few, small, isolated
areas within the City have been mapped as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA),
and these result primarily from ponding of water in shallow depressions or
sumps, and not from channel flooding. Several of the SFHAs occupy low points
that were once natural closed depressions in the El Segundo Sand Hills. For
example, the Madrona Marsh Nature Preserve, the largest SFHA in the City,
occupies what was once a large, natural depression. Other SFHAs appear to be
human-made depressions or sumps. In addition, flooding from coastal
processes may pose a hazard to Malaga Cove.9 While not located in a FEMA
delineated flood zone, in 1983 flooding occurred around the intersection of
California and Hawaii Avenues and along Torrance Boulevard between Van Ness
and Western Avenues.
Although flood hazards in Torrance have been estimated by FEMA to be minor,
property owners in potential flood areas can make modifications to their houses
to reduce the impact of flooding. FEMA has identified several flood protection
measures that can be implemented by property owners to reduce flood damage.
These include installing waterproof veneers on the exterior walls of buildings;
putting seals on all openings, including doors, to prevent the entry of water;
raising electrical components above the anticipated water level improvements;
and installing backflow valves that prevent sewage from backing up into the
house through the drainpipes. The City will continue to improve and maintain
storm drain systems to convey water flows and minimize damage from flood
events. The Circulation Element of the General Plan addresses the City’s storm
drain system and identifies future storm drain improvements.
DAM OR RESERVOIR FAILURE
Dam inundation occurs when structural damage to a dam results in a flood.
Dam failure can occur due to an earthquake, erosion, design flaw, or water
overflow during storms. There are two enclosed water reservoirs in Torrance.
These reservoirs, referred to as the Walteria and Ben Haggot reservoirs10, are
located in the southern part of the City, on the north flank of the Palos Verdes
Hills, and south of the Palos Verdes fault zone. Because of their size, these
reservoirs are considered dams and are therefore under the purview of the

    The Ben Haggott reservoir is also referred to in the State database as the 18M
Walteria, or Walteria Dam 2.

California Division of Dam Safety. In the event of rupture of the Palos Verdes
fault, earth movement could shear the main water lines serving portions of the
City, essentially leaving the area without water for some time after the
earthquake. Rupture of the water mains could also result in the flooding
immediately surrounding and down-gradient of the failed pipes. According to
the City’s Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan (2004), if these reservoirs fail
catastrophically as a result of earthquake-induced damage, they could empty as
quickly as 18 minutes. This would allow little time to evacuate the areas
immediately down-gradient from the reservoirs, with the potential for loss of
life and damage to property.
The inundation pathway for these reservoirs has been mapped, as required by
the California Division of Dam Safety, and is shown on Figure S-3. With an
estimated maximum discharge of 7,300 cubic feet per second, reservoir failure
would impact both residential and commercial areas near Crenshaw Boulevard
and Pacific Coast Highway, and would flow onto the southeastern edge of
Torrance Airport. To guard against catastrophe, the City will ensure that the
design of the Ben Haggott and Walteria reservoirs can withstand ground
accelerations from nearby faults.
1.2       NATURAL HAZARDS OBJECTIVES AND
          POLICIES
The presence of many faults within and near Torrance poses real risk of upset to
residents and workers. Continuing investigation of faults will provide
important information to help assess the level of risk and evolving approaches
to guard against widespread damage. The goals and policies emphasize land
use and building requirements for structures in seismic hazard zones, limiting
exposure of residents to geologic hazards, particularly in steep slope areas, and
protecting residents and businesses from flood hazards.
                                To protect the community from hazards related to earthquakes,
OBJECTIVE S.1:                  seismic-related activity, and flooding

                                Reduce the risk associated with structures which would likely be
                                seriously damaged during a major earthquake, such as those

2.       HUMAN ACTIVITY HAZARDS
Securing public safety in Torrance includes providing protection from the
hazards we create ourselves. Unlike natural disasters, human-caused hazards
can be greatly minimized and prevented through public education, regulating
the use of hazardous materials and processes, and coordination with regional
safety agencies. In Torrance, human-caused hazards we can easily address
include automobile accidents, fires, oil recovery activities, the disposal and
handling of hazardous waste material, and operations at Torrance Municipal
Airport.
2.1      AUTOMOBILE COLLISIONS
Automobile collisions account for many safety incidents in Torrance. The
Torrance Police Department Traffic Division works to reduce the number and
severity of traffic collisions. One of the division’s goals is to reduce the number
of accidents through traffic enforcement, accident investigation, and education.
The motor officers, “Driving Under the Influence” (DUI) officers, education
officer, parking enforcement officers, and crossing guards within the Traffic
Division work to reduce traffic accidents in the City.
2.2      FIRE HAZARD
2.2.1 URBAN FIRES
Residential homes have special fire protection needs, including the requirement
to have fire and life safety systems in place, such as automatic fire sprinklers
and smoke detectors, in conformance with the City’s Building and Fire Codes.
The City has a fire sprinkler ordinance for all multi-family residential units.
Nearly 70 percent of Torrance’s residential stock dates from before 1970, prior
to the City’s adoption of fire sprinkler ordinances. Therefore, many older
housing units do not have sprinklers unless sprinklers have been added as part
of alterations or repairs to the structure. Building fires, although only a small
percentage of the incidents that the Fire Department responds to on an annual
basis, account for a high percentage of the yearly losses in the City (60 percent
in 2003 and 85 percent in 2005).
Structural fires are especially an issue in high-density areas, where there is a
higher potential for fire to spread from one structure to the next. Furthermore,
ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010                              S-18                    CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN

                                                          CHAPTER 4:          Safety Element
the narrow spaces between the structures and the property lines in medium- to
high-density areas provide limited room for emergency access. In the older
section of downtown Torrance, which is bounded by Dominguez Street to the
north, Van Ness Avenue and Border Avenue to the east, Plaza Del Amo to the
south, and Crenshaw Boulevard to the west, streets and alleys make it difficult
to maneuver and position response vehicles to be most effective in fighting a
fire. Structure fires in this older section — where many buildings date from the
1910s to 1930s, were built to older building standards and fire codes, and are
made from non-fire resistive construction materials with no internal sprinklers
and other fire safety systems in place — present higher risks.
The large industrial and commercial base in Torrance creates the potential for
chemical fires to occur, which could impact nearby residential neighborhoods.
The City has adopted the 2007 California Fire Code, with City amendments and
exceptions to address specific local conditions and needs. These provisions
include constructions standards and sprinkler and fire hydrant requirements in
new structures and remodels, road widths and configurations designed to
accommodate the passage of fire trucks and engines, and requirements for
minimum fire flow rates for water mains.
2.2.2 WILDLAND FIRES
In Los Angeles County, wildland fires historically have occurred in the brush-
covered hills that frame many communities, including the Palos Verdes Hills, in
the southern portion of Torrance, and south of the City, in what is now Rolling
Hills, Rolling Hills Estates, and Palos Verdes Estates.11 Small vegetation fires
occasionally still occur on these slopes, but the Fire Department is able to
respond quickly and minimize threats to adjacent structures.12 The California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection maintains Very High Fire Hazard
Severity Zones Maps that include the southern portion of the City, adjacent to
the Palos Verdes Hills, as a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone.
To prevent fires in the City’s hillside areas, Section 85.2.20 of the City’s
Municipal Code allows the Fire Chief to require the removal of brush, flammable
vegetation, and combustible growth in an area 30 to 100 feet surrounding
buildings and structures in cases of extra-hazardous conditions. In some cases,
especially on hillside properties, the Fire Chief may require the fire break to
extend up to 200 feet from a structure to mitigate the convective and radiant
heat transfer resulting from the slope of the property.

CHAPTER 4:            Safety Element
2.2.3 FIRE PREVENTION
Fire prevention is a key consideration in new and modified developments in
Torrance. For all discretionary application and most administrative applications,
a description of the project and/or plans is sent to the Fire Prevention plan
checker and the Hazardous Material specialist for review and comment. The Fire
Department reviews construction drawings when they are submitted into the
Building Department for permits. There is also a Fire Prevention representative
at all Planning Commission meetings and at the pre-application Plot Plan
meetings.
The Municipal Code establishes regulations to facilitate fire suppression
activities. For example, Section 85.2.22 establishes a minimum road width in
residential developments of not less than 25 feet and wider in cases where
parking infringes on road width:
        25 feet wide when no parking is permitted on either side of the
         roadway,
        28 feet wide when parking is permitted on one side of the roadway, and
        34 feet wide when parking is permitted on both sides of the roadway.
In addition, fire hydrant spacing is required at approximately every 300 feet
along public ways in industrial, commercial, high density and multi-unit
residential areas and every 500 feet in areas where construction is limited to
single family, duplex, and triplex residential. Additional regulations can be
found in Division 8, Chapter 5 of the Municipal Code.
2.3      OIL-RELATED ACTIVITIES
Torrance was founded as an oil field boom town. Few operating oil wells
remain, as the majority have ceased operation after years of operation. The City
recognizes the economic value of productive wells and their associated uses,
and local regulations support continued oil production activities. The City also
recognizes the public safety hazards associated with oil field operations, such
as improperly abandoned wells, unidentified subsurface pipes, contaminated
soils, and the risk of explosion. In addition, petroleum contains carcinogens
that are considered hazardous by the State of California.
The California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and
Geothermal Resources oversees the drilling, operation, maintenance, and
plugging and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells. Regulatory
programs emphasize the development of oil, natural gas, and geothermal
resources in the State through sound engineering practices that protect the
environment, prevent pollution, and ensure public safety.
The City will continue to follow the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal
Resources’ established requirements for new construction over or adjacent to

abandoned oil wells. Additionally, the City will continue to enforce Section
81.5.1 of the Building Code, which restricts new development or construction
on identified hazard areas, defined as areas that contain material that may be
detrimental to public health, welfare, and property. Section 2.3 addresses the
hazards associated with methane gas formation in oil field and oil wells.
2.4       HAZARDOUS WASTE
The California Health and Safety Code defines a hazardous material as any
material that, due to quantity, concentration, physical, or chemical
characteristics, poses a significant potential hazard to public health and safety
or to the environment. The manufacturing, use, and transport of hazardous
materials are considered potential human activity hazards. Issues associated
with the storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials are highly relevant to
Torrance given its varied industrial base.
Commercial and industrial businesses located in Torrance and adjacent
communities use hazardous materials, including such businesses as dry
cleaners, film processors, auto service providers, landscape contractors, and
paint shops. Larger businesses, primarily in industrial areas, can generate, use,
and/or store large quantities of hazardous products. Torrance’s land use
pattern generally separates industry from residential uses, although large-scale
industrial activities have the potential to impact broad areas in the event of an
accident. Also, commercial freight carriers transporting hazardous substances
along major roads or railways present potential hazards. Federal, State, and
County agencies enforce regulations for hazardous waste generators and users,
and these regulations provide a high degree of protection. Figure S-4 shows the
location of hazardous material sites and critical facilities.
2.4.1 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SITES
Figure S-4 shows the location of these hazardous materials sites in relation to
critical facilities such as schools and hospitals. The map includes Superfund
sites, Toxic Release Inventory sites, Large Quantity Generator sites, and
methane-producing sites (closed landfills and the Torrance oil field). The
Torrance Fire Department keeps an updated inventory of Superfund sites, toxic
release inventory sites, and large quantity generator sites.
SUPERFUND SITES
The Superfund Act, which is also referred to as the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), is
a federal law designed to protect the environment from risks created from
previous chemical disposal practices. The Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) designates Superfund sites as neglected or abandoned sites with
hazardous waste that could possibly threaten local ecosystems and community

members. The EPA assigns “archive” status to sites where no immediate or
long-term risks to human health are posed. In 2005, the EPA listed two
CERCLA/Superfund sites in Torrance.
TOXIC RELEASE INVENTORY SITES
The EPA also monitors a list of sites known to release toxic chemicals into the
air. In 2005, the EPA registered 19 facilities in the City on the Toxic Release
Inventory (TRI) list.      Subsequently two of the sites were converted to
residential uses and are no longer considered TRI sites.
LARGE QUANTITY GENERATOR SITES
Many types of businesses can be producers of hazardous waste. Small
businesses like dry cleaners, auto repair shops, medical facilities or hospitals,
photo processing centers, and metal-plating shops are typical generators of
small quantities of hazardous waste. Larger businesses are sometimes
generators of large quantities of hazardous waste. These include chemical
manufacturers, large electroplating facilities, and petroleum refineries. The EPA
defines a large-quantity generator as a facility that produces over 1,000
kilograms (2,200 pounds or about 275 gallons) of hazardous waste per month.
Large-quantity generators are fully regulated under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA) which amended, in 1976, the Solid Waste Disposal
Act to establish a regulatory structure for the management of solid and
hazardous wastes.
METHANE GAS
Methane and other natural gases can form at great depth, where they are most
often associated with petroleum deposits. Oil and gas seeps are common
occurrences in many parts of California, including in and around Torrance. The
Torrance Oil Field underlies a large portion of Torrance, extending between the
city’s east and west borders, and from about Lomita Boulevard on the south to
approximately the BNSF railroad right-of-way on the north. Under certain
conditions, the gas can become trapped under an impermeable layer. As the
gas accumulates under the impermeable layer, it can build up to high
concentrations and pressures. Human-made structures, such as pavement or
building foundations, can also prevent gas from venting to the atmosphere.
Methane can accumulate in the upper reaches of poorly ventilated building
components, such as basements, crawlspaces, and attics, sometimes with
catastrophic results such as explosions.
TORRANCE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
DIVISION
The Los Angeles County Fire Department’s Health Hazardous Materials Division
is the Certified Unified Program Agency for Torrance. The Torrance Fire
Department serves a participating agency and is responsible for implementing
Chapter 6.95 (hazardous materials disclosure and the California Accidental
Release Program) and Chapter 6.7 (underground storage tanks) of the California

CHAPTER 4:            Safety Element
Health and Safety Code. The County enforces the hazardous waste regulation
in the City.
The Torrance Fire Department maintains a Hazardous Materials Response Team
consisting of State Certified Hazardous Materials Specialists. Members of the
Hazardous Materials Team have specialized training for dealing with emergency
responses for hazardous materials. The Torrance Fire Department also requires
every business in the City that handles a certain amount of hazardous materials
complete the following forms: Business Owner/Operator Identification,
Emergency Response Business Plan, Hazardous Material Inventory Form, and
the Emergency Response Business Plan Certification Checklist. These forms
help the City to monitor hazardous materials to help reduce adverse impacts
hazardous waste can have on the community and the environment.
2.5      TORRANCE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT (ZAMPERINI
         FIELD)
Torrance Municipal Airport is a general aviation facility that encompasses 500
acres, 140 acres of which are leased for non-aeronautical purposes. Torrance
Airport can handle planes with a maximum per wheel weight of 20,000
pounds. However, the majority of airplanes are light, single-, sometimes twin-
engine models, used mainly for recreational purposes, limited in size and
seating capacity (usually two to eight), carrying less than 200 gallons of fuel on
average, and with a typical gross weight not exceeding 12,500 pounds.
Between 1988 and 2004, 26 general aviation accidents occurred at or near the
airport. Of these, two were fatal accidents. The potential impact of an airplane
crash at Torrance Municipal Airport is limited due to the speed, weight, and fuel
load restrictions of small airplanes and helicopters.
The Torrance Fire Department maintains vehicles that are equipped with
automatic gate openers that allow them direct access to the airfield.
Consistent with State aviation regulations, a Runway Protection Zone (RPZ)
has been established at each end of each active runway. The size of the RPZ is
determined by the type of landing approach used for that runway. The Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) mandates the airport operator to restrict uses of
RPZ land under its control to those compatible with airport operations. The
Runway Protection Zone for Torrance Municipal Airport is shown on Figure S-5.

Although air crash incidents at the airport have been infrequent, the City will
continue to minimize risks by following the FAA’s land use restrictions to areas
surrounding airports and flight paths. Per FAA standards, the airport will
maintain RPZ for each end of the airport’s active runways. The City will ensure
that all land use decisions close to the airport are consistent with standards
contained within the Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan. Further details
about operations at the airport are included in the Circulation and
Infrastructure Element.
2.6      HUMAN ACTIVITY HAZARDS GOALS AND

CHAPTER 4:             Safety Element
3.       EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PUBLIC
         SAFETY
The best approach to dealing with public safety threats involves two key
strategies: 1) plan to prevent them and 2) develop responses that minimize the
extent of upset when a disaster occurs. The City of Torrance has consistently
provided its residents, businesses, and visitors with superior emergency
services. This commitment will continue by reducing hazards and responding
quickly and efficiently to emergencies. With a combination of reliable
emergency services, use of the best available technologies, and community
involvement, Torrance will continue to be one of the safest cities in the region.
To recoup the cost of providing safety services to new developments the City
adopted a Development Impact Fee (DIF) program. The dwelling unit fee
implemented by the DIF is applied to pay a portion of the costs identified for
public facilities used for transportation services, the undergrounding of utilities,
sewer and storm drain facilities. In 2007, the DIF was amended to include police
and fire services.
3.1      EMERGENCY SERVICES
3.1.1 POLICE DEPARTMENT
The mission of the Torrance Police Department is to preserve public safety and
quality of life, to respond effectively to the changing needs of the community,
and to promote mutual respect between the community and the Police
Department.13

The Police Department includes specialized divisions that allow for focused
prevention and response:
         The Patrol Bureau provides specialized unit services including a Crime
          Scene Investigation unit, a Gang Detail unit, the Special Weapons and
          Tactics (S.W.A.T.) unit14, and a Canine Detail unit.
         The Special Operations Bureau consists the Detective Division, Vice and
          Narcotic Division including a Crime Impact Team that works
          undercover, as well as a Narcotics Team, and Intelligence Section along
          with the Traffic and Special Events Division consists of Commercial
          Enforcement, Parking Enforcement, and the Police Motor Squad.
         The Communications Division manages the City’s Public Safety
          Dispatch Center.
         Community Affairs Division provides information to the Community
          related to crime prevention and emergency preparedness.
         Emergency Services Division is responsible for the City’s emergency
          plan, City employee emergency disaster training, management of the
          City’s Emergency Operation Center, management and training of the
          City’s Disaster Service Volunteers, and providing emergency
          preparedness training to the community.
To further the effectiveness of its public safety efforts, the Torrance Police
Department has established Focus Based Policing — a method of policing that
enhances a connection with the community and responsibilities of community
members as well. The Police Department also administers two Police
Community Centers that provide a variety of non-emergency police services to
the community and provide a line of communication to City residents.
Establishment of a Community Affairs Division will be evaluated as a way to
further community involvement and focus-based policing.
In addition to community connections, keeping abreast of the latest technology
is a priority for the Police Department. Technology used for crime scene
investigations, crime analysis, mass notification, and improved communications
can improve crime prevention and emergency response.
3.1.2 FIRE SERVICE
The Torrance Fire Department is guided by its mission of dedication to protect
the community and provide for life safety, environmental protection, and
property conservation through education, hazard reduction, and emergency
response. The Department’s core value is commitment to the highest
standards of professionalism and integrity that are the tradition of the fire
service. The Torrance Fire Department has six fire stations and a Fire Prevention
and Hazardous Administration office. The Fire Department provides safety,
environmental protection, and property conservation through the provision of

        Station 1 houses two engine companies, one ladder truck company,
        one paramedic rescue unit, a Hazardous Materials Response Unit and
        the shift commander (Battalion Chief). The Fire Department’s
        administrative offices are also located here.

The Torrance Fire Department responds to over 12,000 incidents a year.
Approximately 70 percent of the responses are medical and rescue emergency

calls. Fires represent less than three percent of all calls, and structure fires
represent less than 0.5 percent. This is due to the use of modern fire and
building codes, effective fire prevention inspection work by the Fire Department,
and effective public education. Fires, when they do occur in newer occupancies,
are kept small by fire sprinkler systems and the efforts of the Fire Department.
In addition to fire suppression services, the Fire Department responds to all
medical emergencies in the City with an Advanced Life Support (ALS) paramedic
rescue squad, and all life-threatening medical emergencies receive Basic Life
Support (BLS) unit response in addition to the ALS. The BLS units are equipped
with life-saving medical equipment and staffed with Emergency Medical
Technicians. The Fire Department relies on traffic signal actuation devices at
critical intersections to deal with traffic congestion and improve the driving
time response.
As an indication of the superior fire services available to Torrance residents and
businesses, the Insurance Services Office (ISO), which provides rating and
statistical information for the insurance industry in the United States, has given
Torrance the highest rating possible (Class I).
One of the most critical issues for fire response is the availability of water in an
emergency, particularly for widespread structural fires after earthquakes.
Although a seven-day emergency storage supply is recommended, especially in
areas likely to be impacted by fires after earthquakes, as of 2006 the water
storage reservoirs in Torrance provide only one and one-half days of emergency
storage supply.
3.1.3 MUTUAL AID AGREEMENTS
While the Torrance Police Department is tasked with preserving the safety and
quality of life of the community and the Torrance Fire Department is tasked with
the responsibility of fire prevention and fire suppression, both departments
team with other public safety agencies to work together during emergencies.
These teaming arrangements are handled through automatic and mutual aid
agreements, which obligate the public safety departments to help each other
under pre-defined circumstances. Torrance is part of the California Fire and
Rescue Master Mutual Aid System under Los Angeles County Operation Region
1 area, and more specifically, part of, and coordinator for, the South Bay area
(also referred to as Area G). As a result of being part of the same operational
area group, all of these jurisdictions have mutual aid agreements that allow
them to obtain additional emergency resources, as needed, from non-affected
members in the group. As coordinator for Area G, the City is charged with
communicating and coordinating mutual aid requests from Region 1 to all
South Bay cities. Torrance also coordinates mutual aid requests from other
south bay cities in Area G to assist each neighboring agency as needed.

CHAPTER 4:             Safety Element
3.2       EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
Torrance sets emergency preparedness as one of its top priorities, recognizing
that proper planning at all levels in the community — from response agencies
to businesses and residents — will minimize the adverse effects of natural and
human-caused disasters. The Emergency Services Division within the Police
Department is responsible to ensure City employees receive up to date
emergency disaster training. Through a coordinated effort by the Emergency
Services Division, Community Affairs Division and the Disaster Service
Volunteers, the City provides the community emergency preparedness
information and outreach.
3.2.1 EMERGENCY PLANS
The City of Torrance adopted and approved a Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan in
2004, and the State of California and FEMA approved the plan in 2005. The
plan promotes policy to help reduce the risk against natural hazards such as
earthquakes, landslides, and floods. The plan encourages raising public
awareness, documenting resources for risk reduction and loss-prevention, and
incorporating safer and more sustainable building practices.15
The City has an emergency plan which establishes emergency preparedness and
emergency response procedures for both peacetime and wartime disasters. The
plan is termed a “Multi-Hazard Functional Plan,” prepared in accordance with
the State Office of Emergency Services guidelines for multi-hazard functional
planning. This plan, establishes the emergency organization, assigns tasks,
specifies policies and general procedures, and provides for coordination of
planning efforts of the various emergency staff utilizing the Standardized
Emergency Management System (SEMS) and National Incident Management
System (NIMS). The plan establishes that the City of Torrance is primarily
responsible for emergency actions and will commit all available resources to
save lives, minimize injury to persons, and minimize damage to the
environment and to property. The Police Department, through the Emergency
Services Division, is responsible to ensure the City’s emergency plan is current
and follows both State and federal mandates.
The Torrance Fire Department is required to prepare and follow an area plan for
emergency responses to hazardous materials releases. In 2006, the Torrance
Fire Department rewrote its area plan to bring it up to date. The area plan has
been submitted to the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services as required
under the Health and Safety Code.

3.2.2 EMERGENCY OPERATIONS
In the event of a major emergency or disaster, the City centralizes emergency
management at its Emergency Operation Center, or EOC. Centralizing the
location of authority and information facilitates a coordinated response by
emergency services personnel. The number and level of staffing at the EOC
depends on the specific emergency.16 To maintain lines of communication open
during emergencies, Torrance has established eight Area Disaster Centers
(ADC) to serve as points for communication to and from the City’s Emergency
Operation Center in the event no electronic devices are operating because of a
natural disaster or emergency. When an emergency event occurs, City staff and
Torrance Amateur Radio Association radio operators respond to these ADCs:
         Southeast Torrance Library
         Henderson Branch Library
         North Torrance Library
         Walteria Branch Library
         El Retiro Branch Library
         Sea-Aire Golf Course
         Alta Loma Park
         Bartlett Center
The City has several warning systems in place to notify residents in the event of
a major emergency. A specific response plan has been developed in the event of
an accident at the Exxon/Mobil Refinery. A barrier system along Crenshaw
Boulevard automatically restricts traffic movement, and nearby residents receive
evacuation information as needed.
The systems local to Torrance include:
         Community Warning Siren: Alerts public in close proximity to
          Exxon/Mobil Refinery of a chemical release and the need to shelter in
          place
         Crenshaw Barrier System: Restricts traffic on Crenshaw Boulevard by
          the Exxon/Mobil Refinery
         CityWatch: The City’s emergency telephone notification system that
          alerts residents in the event of an emergency
         Radio Alert Network: City-activated radio system within certain public
          and private facilities, including some private homes, to warn of an
          emergency
         Phone Bank: The City has designed and implemented a phone bank
          which relieves calls going to the Police and Fire dispatch centers and
          provides necessary information to the community if they call. The
          phone numbers are made available on the local cable television station,
          the City website, and via press releases in the event of an emergency.

that end, the City will focus on enhancement of the City’s EOC to provide the
most up-to-date emergency response services to the Torrance community.
Technology and capital upgrades will be prioritized as funding becomes
available. Funding sources outside the City will also be used to augment the
City’s emergency response resources.
3.2.3 EMERGENCY RESPONSE VOLUNTEERS
In the case of an emergency, community volunteers will enhance emergency
response activities by the City. The City’s Emergency Services Division through
the Police Department oversees the Disaster Service Volunteer Programs to
provide for continual disaster readiness. Community Emergency Response Team
(CERT) Program educates community members about disaster preparedness for
hazards that may impact their area and trains them in basic disaster response
skills. The Torrance Amateur Radio Association provides emergency
communications during a major communications outage. Utilizing a seven-
band ham station coupled with licensed amateur radio operators stationed
throughout the community, the association ensures vital information is shared
among first responders. The Animal Disaster Team provides medical treatment
and shelter for animals impacted by disasters.

3.3       COMMUNITY SAFETY
3.3.1 CRIME AND TERRORISM
In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the City of
Torrance’s emergency preparedness and response services expanded to address
terrorism issues that confront the nation and local communities. Since the
events of 9/11, a considerable amount of information has been generated on
potential vulnerabilities, protective measures, and anti-terrorism/security
technologies. The Police and Fire Departments recognize the need not only to
learn from the lessons from 9/11, but also to collectively address the terrorism
planning and policy issues that most affect Torrance residents.
The City credits a strong relationship with federal law enforcement, vertical
sharing of information, close coordination and communication, with its success
in securing the City.17 The City’s approach to terrorism focuses on prevention,
but awareness, knowledge, and skills will be enhanced in order to avert crime
and terrorism events before they occur.18 To further the City’s efforts in
identifying and preventing crime and terrorism threats, the goals, policies, and
implementation programs in this Element also apply to terrorism readiness and
response.
3.3.2 CRIME PREVENTION THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL
          DESIGN (CPTED)
Torrance values the effect of crime prevention and strives to find creative ways
to make residents and businesses safe.                   Crime Prevention through
Environmental Design (CPTED) refers to defensible space planning that uses
design techniques, building orientation, and features of the built environment
to deter criminal activity and positively influence human behavior and the
perception of safety.
The concepts of CPTED offer non-invasive and permanent measures to prevent
crime in the City of Torrance. CPTED include the following five concepts:
         Territoriality: Clearly identifying the boundary of a property or an area
          through walls and fences can discourage intrusion.
         Natural Surveillance: Arranging populated functions or rooms to face
          the street allows easy surveillance by building occupants.

CHAPTER 4:            Safety Element
        Access Control: Circulation and access can be controlled through
         designating paths and placing bollards or fences to limit access.
        Activity Support: Supporting activities on the street attract people and
         encourage natural surveillance.
        Maintenance: Maintenance of sidewalks, street trees, lighting, and
         private property discourages negative behavior such as littering and
         vandalism.
Crime prevention also requires public participation. The Police Department
administers a Neighborhood Watch Program that relies on Torrance residents
as its most effective tools of crime prevention. The program provides training
to volunteers who maintain neighborhood safety by being watchful and
reporting suspicious behavior.
The success of CPTED depends on maintenance of all these programs.
Maintaining streets, lighting, and landscaping facilitate natural surveillance and
access control. Maintaining private and public properties requires participation
by property owners and the Public Works Department. Continuation and
monitoring of these programs will enhance safety in Torrance neighborhoods.

   CHAPTER
                            NOISE
                            ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
Noise that is experienced by people who did not produce it is "second-hand sound,"
and is among the most pervasive pollutants today. Like second-hand smoke, it has
detrimental effects on people who had no part in creating it.
- Noise Pollution Clearinghouse, 2004
Excessive noise can disrupt our lives. Noise can interrupt our conversations,
thoughts, and leisure activities. Noise sensitivity varies depending on the time
of day, its duration and pitch, and preferences of individuals. Despite this
variability, most residents agree that too much noise or the wrong type of noise
can be irritating and interfere with sleep, speech, recreation, and tasks that
require concentration or coordination. Therefore, noise not only decreases
environmental quality but can also adversely affect our physical and mental
health.
In Torrance, street and freeway traffic represent the primary source of noise. The
I-405 Freeway, which traverses the northeastern portion of the City, presents
concerns where it runs adjacent to residential neighborhoods and schools.
Other significant sources of noise include arterial roadways and intersections,
the Santa Fe Railroad, and Torrance Municipal Airport.
Because Torrance is largely built out and the street system well developed, the
City faces challenges in separating noise-sensitive land uses from primary noise
sources. Thus, the Noise Element establishes policies to guard against creation
of any new noise/land use conflicts and to minimize the impact of existing
noise sources on the community.
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                    N-1                            ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010
CHAPTER 5:             Noise Element
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER
GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
Land use relationships and noise associated with roadways, train traffic, and
operations at Torrance Municipal Airport represent the focus of community
noise concerns. Therefore, policies in this Noise Element are tied most closely
to policies and programs set forth in the Land Use and Circulation Elements.
For example, community noise standards affect the location or treatment of
proposed new land uses, such as uses within the noise contours of the airport.
With regard to the local road network, this Element contains noise contour
maps that identify anticipated noise levels associated with future traffic
volumes, and includes policies and programs intended to reduce adverse noise
conditions.
SCOPE AND REQUIREMENTS
OF THE NOISE ELEMENT
In recognition of the adverse health effects associated with excessive noise, the
California Government Code, Section 65302(f) very specifically identifies the
types of community noise to be addressed in the General Plan. The Noise
Element addresses noise sources from:
        Highways and freeways
        Primary arterials and major local streets
        Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid
         transit systems
        Commercial, general aviation, heliport, and military airport operations,
         aircraft over-flights, jet engine test stands, and all other ground
         facilities and maintenance functions related to airport operations
        Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad
         classification yards
        Other stationary ground noise sources identified by local agencies as
         contributing to the community noise environment
1.       MEASURING NOISE
Noise is often described as unwanted or irritating sound. Defining noise with a
single unit of measure is difficult because noise consists of several components
— pitch, loudness, and duration — and because noise includes subjective
qualities. At the objective level, scientists have developed the A-weighted
sound pressure level, or dB(A), to describe the loudness of a sound or sound
environment based on the sensitivity of the human ear. At 60 dB(A), noise

impairs the ability to hear speech, and sound levels over 40 to 45 dB(A) can
disturb sleep. A person’s likelihood of hearing loss strongly increases at
prolonged exposure to sound levels over 85 dB(A). To provide some
perspective on the relative loudness of various types of noise, Table N-1 lists
common sources of noise and their approximate noise levels.

CHAPTER 5:            Noise Element
Acousticians have developed noise metrics to account for the fact that noise
during nighttime hours can be more bothersome than daytime noise. The noise
metrics apply a weighted ambient noise level average over a 24-hour period,
and assigns “penalties” to noise that occurs between 10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M.
These metrics are defined as either the Community Equivalent Noise Level
(CNEL) or Day-Night Level (Ldn).
Figure N-1 shows common CNEL and Ldn noise exposure levels at different
locations. The highest dB(A) level is listed for the area next to a freeway, which
has a noise exposure level of 85 dB(A). The lowest dBA level is listed for a farm,
which is 40 dB(A). The figure also indicates that 65 dB(A) is the common
standard for noise level in outdoor residential areas, and 45 dB(A) is the
common standard for the interior of residences
The objectives and policies in this element aim to meet the City’s overarching
goal for noise regulation in the City of Torrance:
GOAL:                       Minimize exposure of residents to noise
2.        BASELINE NOISE CONDITIONS
The community noise environment can be described using contours derived
from monitoring major sources of noise. Noise contours are analogous to
topographic contours on a map showing terrain. Just as topographic contours
illustrate elevations of the ground surface, noise contours define noise levels at
particular locations. The contours generally represent average noise levels, such
as the CNEL or Ldn, based on major noise sources in the community. The
contours assist in setting policies for distribution of land uses and
establishment of development standards.
A study of baseline noise sources and levels was completed in August, 2006.
Noise level measurements were collected during a typical weekday at 20
locations throughout Torrance. Criteria for site selection included geographical
distribution, land uses suspected of noisy activities, and proximity to
transportation facilities and sensitive receptor locations. The primary purpose
of noise monitoring was to establish a noise profile for the community that
could be used to determine areas of concern.
Figure N-2 shows noise contours for noise conditions in Torrance in 2006. The
contours account for the many noise sources in the City, including I-405,
arterial and collector roadways, train operations along the Santa Fe Railroad, the
Honeywell facility, and Torrance Airport. Each source is described in greater
detail in Figure N-1.

2.1       TRANSPORTATION-RELATED NOISE
2.1.1 I-405 FREEWAY
Interstate 405 crosses the northeastern portion of Torrance and is busy for
most daylight hours. Traffic levels create noise conditions in excess of 65 CNEL
along the freeway’s path. As noted in Figure N-1, this is generally considered
the threshold noise level for residential use. Figure N-2 shows that several
residential neighborhoods and public facilities are exposed to high noise levels
from freeway traffic.
As freeways are under the jurisdiction of Caltrans, this State agency is
responsible for addressing noise abatement issues where Caltrans’ activities
have created adverse noise conditions, pursuant to the Streets and Highway
Code. Consistent with Section 216 of the Code, Caltrans has, for example,
implemented a School Noise Abatement Program that takes measures to reduce
classroom interior noise levels to below 52 dB(A). Yukon Elementary, located
immediately north of I-405 between Crenshaw Boulevard and Prairie Avenue, is
exposed to noise levels of 75 dB(A) and higher; the school has benefitted from
soundproofing and air-conditioning as part of this program.1 As regional traffic
continues to increase, freeway noise mitigation will continue to be a key policy
issue for Torrance.
2.1.2 MAJOR ROADWAYS
Residents whose homes either abut or are in proximity to major roadways may
experience high noise levels during peak commute hours. Generally, Torrance’s
historic land use patterns have resulted in commercial and industrial land uses
along arterial roadways. Also, the noise contours shown on Figure N-2
indicate that roadway noise generally does not exceed 65 CNEL. As of 2006,
the only roadway sections with noise levels at or above 65 CNEL were
Crenshaw Boulevard between Carson Street and Sepulveda Boulevard and the
intersection of Sepulveda Boulevard and Hawthorne Boulevard.
2.1.3 SANTA FE RAILROAD
In Torrance, noise from the Santa Fe Railroad is sporadic because trains do not
run continuously throughout the day. However, when trains do run through
the City, they are as noisy as peak hours of automobile and truck traffic.
Freight trains pass through Torrance daily in route to and from Long Beach.
Figure N-2 indicates that, compared to noise effects of I-405, a limited buffer
area surrounding the railroad is exposed to noise levels of 60 CNEL or higher.

A few residential uses near the intersection of Torrance Boulevard and the
railroad line are adversely impacted by railroad noise.
2.1.4 TORRANCE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT (ZAMPERINI FIELD)
Torrance Municipal Airport is a general aviation facility that accommodates
both propeller and jet aircraft (although jet traffic is limited by the fact that jet
fuel is not sold at the airport). The Torrance Municipal Code includes stringent
noise standards intended to make the airport compatible with adjacent land
uses. The airport follows the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) land use
restrictions, which regulate land uses surrounding airports and flight paths. In
addition to safety concerns, these restrictions also restrict incompatible land
uses near airports because of noise concerns. The City also has adopted a strict
Airport Noise Abatement Program. Noise monitors report excessive aircraft
noise to City staff, and staff works with pilots to find ways to meet the
established noise limits.
                                                                        The City’s Noise Abatement
                                                                        program has resulted in reduced
                                                                        noise complaints from aircraft
                                                                        activity at Torrance Airport.
Figure N-3 indicates that critical noise contours associated with Torrance
Airport do not impact any residential neighborhoods. In fact, most of the 60
dBA noise contour is confined to airport property, although properties along
the north most sections of Skypark Drive are marginally affected by noise. The
majority of noise affecting the rest of Skypark Drive, Hawthorne Boulevard, and
Pacific Coast Highway is automobile related.
Adjacent to Torrance Airport, Robinson Helicopter manufactures civil
helicopters. Helicopter noise often may be more irritating than noise from
other aircraft because helicopters operate at low altitudes and therefore produce
more noise. Robinson Helicopter adheres to the City’s noise standards to
ensure that late-night helicopter operations are limited.
2.2       NON-TRANSPORTATION NOISE
Non-transportation noise sources include various activities in commercial and
industrial districts, which may include potential stationary noise sources.
As a matter of practice, the City reviews all development applications to
identify issues of concern, including potential noise exposure and generation.
An acoustical analysis is required for projects that could have potentially
adverse noise effects on sensitive receptors such as schools, hospitals,

CHAPTER 5:            Noise Element
churches, and residential neighborhoods. Mitigating features or conditions
must be included in a project when significant noise impacts are identified.
Other sources of community noise are often associated with ordinary daily
activities such as property maintenance and construction. Excessive noise from
lawnmowers, leaf blowers, mechanical equipment, power tools, and the like can
generate complaints when noise-generating activities occur in the evening or
during restful weekend hours. The City’s noise standards will be implemented
to help maintain optimal interior and exterior noise levels within residential
areas.
3.       FUTURE NOISE CONDITIONS
As Torrance is largely developed, new development over time will be limited to
the recycling of uses to slightly higher densities and intensities at limited
locations. The long-established land use patterns generally will not change.
More intense development will be focused along major corridors, such as
Hawthorne Boulevard.
Over the long term, noise conditions in Torrance are not anticipated to change
significantly from the baseline conditions modeled in 2006. Future noise
contours have been developed based on anticipated traffic volumes, rail traffic,
airport operations, and general land use activity. These contours assist in the
review of land use and development proposals. Figure N-4 presents the
projected noise contours and noise impact areas.
Overall, the increase in noise over the life of the General Plan is minimal. The
primary stationary noise sources — Torrance Municipal Airport and major
industrial operations — will continue to exist. Roadway noise along major
roads such as Hawthorne Boulevard and Crenshaw Boulevard will increase
slightly due to increase in traffic volumes mostly attributable to regional
growth. Small entryway segments of Torrance Boulevard and Carson Street at
the east end of the City will also experience minimal increases in noise. A small
segment of Prairie Avenue just north and south of the I-405 will also experience
an increase in noise levels attributable to expected traffic growth along the I-
405. Areas that are expected to experience increased noise levels are primarily
limited to non-residential areas. Most residential areas will not experience
noise levels above baseline conditions with the exception of two short
segments of Palos Verdes Boulevard (the segment from Torrance Boulevard to
Sepulveda Boulevard and a segment just north of Calle Mayor).
Table N-3 establishes the noise/land use compatibility criteria Torrance will use
in determining whether a new use is appropriate within a given noise
environment.

1. The normally acceptable standard is 60 db(A). The higher standard is acceptable subject to
    inclusion of noise-reduction features in project design and construction.
2. Maximum exterior noise levels up to 70 dB CNEL are allowed for Multiple-Family Housing.
3. Regarding aircraft-related noise, the maximum acceptable exposure for new residential
    development is 60 dB(A) CNEL.
 These compatibility criteria serve as guidelines. For example, an acoustical
 analysis must be prepared when noise-sensitive land uses are proposed within
 noise impact areas. The analysis must show that the project is designed to
 attenuate noise to meet the City’s noise standards in order to receive approval.
 If the project design does not meet the noise standards, mitigation can be
 recommended in the analysis. If the analysis demonstrates that the noise
 standards can be met by implementing the mitigation measures, the project can
 be approved conditioned upon implementation of the mitigation measures.

4.        NOISE ABATEMENT
Recognizing the need to protect residents from noise, the City has adopted
specific regulations for noise produced by transportation sources, trains, and
aircraft. These regulations offer protection to residents and users of facilities like
schools and libraries, where noise can have particularly disruptive impacts,
while also balancing the need of industry and commuters to make a reasonable
amount of noise associated with commerce and industry during a workday.
4.1       NOISE ABATEMENT PROGRAMS
4.1.1 AIRPORT NOISE ABATEMENT PROGRAM
The City’s Noise Abatement Program, which is enforced by the Environmental
Division of the Community Development Department, provides for on-going
monitoring of aircraft noise. City ordinances do not allow aircraft landing on or
taking off from the airport to exceed a Single Event Noise Exposure Level
(SENEL) of 88 dB(A) or a maximum sound level of 82 dB(A), measured at
ground level outside the extended airport boundaries. The program imposes
even more restrictive noise limits for night flights.
Established in 1977, the noise abatement program has dramatically decreased
noise complaints related to airport operation. The airport program relies on
noise monitors in areas of the community under aircraft flight paths. If an
aircraft exceeds specified noise limits, pilots are notified by the City. The City
also aims to be proactive in stemming aircraft noise complaints by working with
pilots to test noise levels and find ways to safely get planes in and out of the
airport without exceeding the established noise limits. This type of aircraft noise
mitigation is possible for most aircraft using the airport. Since the inception of
the noise abatement program, the variety of aircraft using the airport has
become noticeably quieter, and the number of noise violations per operations
has decreased over the years to well below one percent. The majority of noise
violations are made by transient aircraft.
Since its inception almost 20 years ago, the program has become one of the
most effective programs in the country, and has been used as a model by other
cities and airports. The program significantly decreased aircraft noise violations
from between 4.5 to 5 percent of operations in 1976 to less than one percent
by 1987.2 Noise violations have been reduced to less than 0.2 percent of total
airport operations. Through this program, the City has successfully balanced
the airport’s needs with the community’s requirements for a livable
environment.

CHAPTER 5:            Noise Element
4.1.2 MUNICIPAL CODE NOISE AND LAND USE
         COMPATIBILITY REGULATIONS
Quality of life is tied to living in an environment where we can carry out daily
activities without the interference and harmful effects from excessive noise. The
Municipal Code has noise guidelines that stress the importance of protecting
indoor and outdoor noise environments. Protecting sensitive receptors and
residential neighborhoods is particularly important, and the City has
established maximum acceptable noise levels within noise zones.
Municipal Code, Division 4: Public Health and Welfare (Chapter 6 - Noise
Regulation) establishes noise level limits in most residential areas of 50 to 55
db(A) between 7:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M., and 45-50 db(A) between 10:00 P.M.
to 7:00 A.M., depending on location. The regulations establish regions with
differing noise regulations, as indicated on Figure N-5.
        Region 1 includes the predominantly industrial areas in and around the
         refineries and industrial uses on the western edge of the City.
        Region 2 includes the area in and around the airport and includes the
         commercial and industrial uses south of Lomita Boulevard and north of
         Pacific Coast Highway.
        Region 3 encompasses the residential neighborhoods south of Pacific
         Coast Highway and west of Hawthorne Boulevard.
        Region 4 includes the remainder of the City.
Acceptable noise levels are lower for neighborhoods in Region 3. Noise levels in
most of the City’s industrial and commercial areas cannot exceed 60 dB(A)
during the day or 55 dB(A) during the night. The ordinance offers flexibility in
the areas surrounding the oil refineries (Region 1), where noise levels cannot
exceed 70 dB(A) during the day or 65 dB(A) at night.
Understanding that certain types of noise are more harmful and annoying, the
City’s noise regulations penalize certain types of noise sources by lowering the
permitted decibels allowed. In other cases such as those where noise is not
continuous and occurs only during a very limited timeframe or duration, decibel
limits can be higher.

City of Torrance Municipal Code
For construction work, the ordinance limits the use of power construction tools
or equipment for construction work adjacent to residential areas. With regard
to railroad noise, the ordinance places restrictions on night-time operations and
the decibel level of train whistles.
4.1.3 MOTOR VEHICLE NOISE
As Figure N-4 indicates, noise from vehicles traveling along Torrance’s
roadways will continue to represent the primary noise source in the
community. The City has very limited ability to abate vehicle-related noise at a
local level. The State of California establishes noise limits for vehicles, and at
the local level, the City can cite any driver on City streets whose vehicle
exceeds the limits. This applies to engine and exhaust system noise, as well as
any noise from inside the vehicle that can be heard (or felt) beyond the vehicle.
With regard to freeway noise, as discussed above, Caltrans is responsible for
noise abatement. The City’s best defense against exposing any additional
residents or noise-sensitive uses to I-405 noise is to apply the noise/land use
compatibility criteria set forth in Table N-3 in the review of development
applications.
4.2        NOISE GOALS AND POLICIES
The City’s goals and policies regarding noise aim to minimize adverse noise
impacts and to preserve the high quality of life for City residents. Torrance will
maintain a peaceful environment by identifying noise impacts and mitigating
noise problems through acoustical treatments and appropriate land use
policies.
ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2010                                 N-16                    CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN

Transportation routes represent the predominant noise source in Torrance.
Sounds emitted from automobiles, aircraft, and rail can be mitigated through
sound barriers, and with regard to Torrance Municipal Airport and rail activities,
strict enforcement of Municipal Code provisions that pertain to noise
abatement.

   CHAPTER
                         HOUSING
                         ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Housing Element is designed to provide the City with a coordinated and
comprehensive strategy for promoting the production of safe, decent, and
affordable housing within the community.
ROLE AND ORGANIZATION
OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The Housing Element is one of seven mandatory General Plan elements. It
identifies ways in which the housing needs of existing and future residents can
be met. Consistent with State Housing Element laws, it must be updated on a
regular basis. This Housing Element covers the period extending from January
1, 2014 to December 30, 2021.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
         An introduction of the purpose and organization of the Housing
          Element
         An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing characteristics and
          trends
         A review of potential market, governmental, and environmental
          constraints to meeting the City’s identified housing needs
         An evaluation of land, administrative, and financial resources available
          to address the housing goals
         A review of past accomplishments under the previous Housing Element
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                     H-1                              HOUSING ELEMENT

CHAPTER 6:           Housing Element
        A Housing Plan to address the identified housing needs, including
         housing goals, policies, and programs
STATE REQUIREMENTS AND
LEGISLATIVE CHANGES
The California Legislature has determined that a primary housing goal for the
State is ensuring every resident has a decent home and suitable living
environment. Section 65580 of the California Government Codes describes the
goal in detail:
a.       The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the
         early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment
         for every Californian, including farm-workers, is a priority of the highest
         order.
b.       The early attainment of this goal requires cooperative participation of
         government and the private sector in an effort to expand housing
         opportunities and accommodate the housing needs of Californians of
         all economic levels.
c.       The provision of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income
         households requires the cooperation of all levels of the government.
d.       Local and state governments have a responsibility to use the powers
         vested in them to facilitate the improvement and development of
         housing to make adequate provision for housing needs of all economic
         segments of the community.
e.       The Legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility, each
         local government also has the responsibility to consider economic,
         environmental, and fiscal factors and community goals set forth in the
         general plan and to cooperate with other local governments and the
         state in addressing regional housing needs.
State law requires housing elements to be updated on a regular basis to reflect
a community’s changing housing needs, unless such timeline is otherwise
extended by State legislation. The Government Code also requires that each
draft Housing Element be reviewed by the California Department of Housing
and Community Development and that the Department’s findings be
incorporated prior to adoption, or that specified findings be made in response
to the Department’s comments.
In response to updated Housing Element law, this Housing Element addresses
SB 812 that requires the housing element to assess the housing needs of
developmentally disabled persons. SB 244 requires cities and counties, prior to
adoption of the Housing Element, to address the infrastructure needs of
disadvantaged unincorporated communities outside the city’s limits but within
HOUSING ELEMENT                                  H-2                       CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN

                                                 CHAPTER 6:         Housing Element
the city’s planning area. Because the Torrance planning area does not contain
any unincorporated areas, no such conditions exist.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER
GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Torrance General Plan consists of the following elements: Land Use,
Housing, Circulation and Infrastructure, Community Resources, Safety, and
Noise, as well as an Implementation Program. The Housing Element builds
upon the other Elements, and is consistent with the General Plan’s policies and
proposals. The Housing Element draws upon the development capacity levels
given in the Land Use Element to determine the appropriate location for
affordable housing development. When any element of the General Plan is
amended, the City will review the Housing Element and if necessary, amend it
to ensure continued consistency among elements. State law requires that the
Safety and Conservation Elements include an analysis and policies regarding
flood hazard and management information upon revisions to the Housing
Element. The City of Torrance completed a comprehensive General Plan update
in 2010. As such, information on flood hazard and management is up to date.
Moving forward, the City will ensure compliance with this requirement by
reviewing its Safety and Conservation Elements upon future Housing Element
revisions.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Public participation played an important role in the development of this
Element. Section 65583(c)(6)(B) of the Government Code states: “The local
government shall make diligent effort to achieve public participation of all
economic segments of the community in the development of the housing
element, and the program shall describe this effort.” This process not only
includes residents of the community, but also coordinates participation among
local agencies and housing groups, community organizations, and housing
sponsors.
All segments of the Torrance community were encouraged by the City to
participate in the preparation of the Housing Element through a combination of
public notices and direct contacts with organizations serving low-income and
special needs groups. They were invited to a public workshop on the Housing
Element with the Planning Commission on May 1, 2013 at City Council
Chambers.
To reach all economic segments of the community, the following non-profit and
community services organizations were contacted during the preparation of the
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                   H-3                             HOUSING ELEMENT

the Housing Element workshop to provide comments. In addition, invitations to
the workshop were sent to a variety of homeowner association coalition
members and a variety of non-profit and for-profit developers. As appropriate,
their comments and concerns have been integrated into the Housing Element as
policies and programs.

One member of the public made comments at the May 1, 2013 workshop, and
several of the Planning Commissioners asked questions about the draft Housing
Element. Those questions and comments were as follows. These were either
addressed as part of the workshop or incorporated into the draft Housing
Element submitted to HCD for review.
         With regard to the Regional Housing Needs Allocation, how does
          Torrance compare to Inglewood and Rancho Palos Verdes? Is Torrance
          required to provide more lower-income units?
         To which zones do the density bonus provisions apply? Is the R-1
          zone included?
         The City’s parking standards are not strict enough, especially for the
          single family zones.

DATA SOURCES
Data from a variety of resources inform the crafting of the Housing Element.
One of the most cited sources is the 2010 Census and the 2010 and 2011
American Community Survey (U.S. Census Bureau). The 2010 Census provides
consistent demographic characteristics that are widely accepted. California
Department of Finance 2011 Population and Housing Estimates supplement the
Census data. Additional information has been drawn from the 2012
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data. CHAS data are
based on special tabulations for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) from sample Census data.

1. COMMUNITY NEEDS
          ASSESSMENT
1.1 INTRODUCTION
Like many residents of communities throughout the South Bay and Southern
California, Torrance residents face significant issues regarding housing
availability and affordability. Key concerns are a high demand for housing and
limited opportunities for new residential development. Being an older City in
the midst of a well-established area, Torrance is virtually built out, with limited
land available for future residential development. As a result, Torrance and
many built-out communities in California have experienced a tight housing
market for several years, with home prices skyrocketing and rents increasing
dramatically. The City’s reputation for quality schools and neighborhoods has
contributed to the high demand and cost for housing in Torrance. Concerns
about cost and availability are magnified for special needs groups such as
seniors, large families, and disabled residents who face severe limitations in
their ability to find decent housing due to physical or economic constraints.
The Housing Needs Assessment presents information that forms the basis for
the objectives, policies, and programs that seek to address housing needs. This
assessment addresses population characteristics, employment patterns, and
income levels. The information illustrates how Torrance has grown and
changed, and identifies patterns and trends that serve as the basis for defining
the City’s housing policies and programs. Projections are also provided to show
how the community is expected to change over the next two decades. To
provide a regional context, conditions in Torrance are compared with
surrounding communities and Los Angeles County in general.
The data used in this needs assessment have been collected from a variety of
sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau (1990 and 2000 Census, 2010
Census, 2006-2010 American Community Survey Estimates), California
Department of Finance, and Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG). In comparison to the 2000 the Census, the data provided by 2010 the
Census are limited and in most instances, instead of providing 100%
population data for demographic factors, provide estimates. Many of these
estimates (such as the 2006-2010 American Community Survey and California
Department of Finance data) are shown solely as percentages, as the raw
numbers carry a significant margin of error, especially for smaller geographies
such as cities and Census-designated places. Nonetheless, the percentages give
a general indication of population and employment trends. The information

CHAPTER 6:           Housing Element
contained in the City’s 2012 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy
(CHAS) data is drawn from Census 2010 data. CHAS data are based on special
tabulations from sample Census data. Thus, the number of households in each
category often deviates slightly from 100% due to extrapolations to the total
household level. Because of this, interpretations of CHAS data should focus on
proportions and percentages, rather than on precise numbers.
1.2 POPULATION TRENDS
Torrance’s proximity to the coast, location near regional freeways, and stable
residential neighborhoods make the City an attractive destination for
homebuyers and renters. As demand for housing grows in this built-out City,
housing need must be met through redevelopment, infill development, and
neighborhood revitalization. To clarify the type of housing that will be needed
to meet future demand, Housing Element law requires an assessment of
population and employment trends. Characteristics such as age, ethnicity, and
employment influence the type and cost of housing needed or in high demand
in the City. Tracking demographic changes can also help the City better respond
to or anticipate changing housing demand.
1.2.1            POPULATION GROWTH
Torrance founded in 1912 and incorporated in 1921 with a population of 1,649.
The City’s founders touted Torrance as “a balanced city,” with housing
development occurring in tandem with industrial development so that
employees could live close to work. Early residential development trends in
Torrance generally followed the pattern of the greater Los Angeles regions, with
the largest population surge occurring in the post-World War II years.
Between 1950 and 1960, the population more than quadrupled and the
housing stock grew by eightfold. During that time, housing production rates
outpaced population growth because of a significant decrease in household
size. In 2010, the Census Bureau indicated that the City had reached a
population of 145,438. More current population estimates for 2012 place the
City’s population at 146,115 (California Department of Finance, Demographic
Research Unit), with slightly more women (51.4%) than men (48.6%) (2011
American Community Survey). Between 1990 and 2012, Torrance’s population
increased by 12 percent, the majority of which occurred between 2000 and
2007. This population change closely paralleled the experiences of many
surrounding communities and was only slightly less than the increases for the
County as a whole.

 Estimates of future growth indicate a moderate yet steady increase in
 population over the next 20 years. SCAG estimates that the population of
 Torrance will top 162,775 by the year 2030, with a growth of over 17,000 new
 persons between 2010 and 2030. The population increase for Torrance between
 1980 and 2010 was 12 percent.

 1.2.2              AGE
 Population age distribution serves as an important indicator of housing needs,
 as housing needs and preferences change as an individuals or households grow
 older. Young families tend to focus more on cost and the ability to become first-
 time homebuyers. Cost and access to services are important to seniors because

they may be on fixed incomes and have mobility limitations. Table H-3 shows
the age distribution of Torrance residents. Currently, middle age (45-64 years)
constitute the largest age group, at 29 percent, followed by the young adults
(25-44 years) group, at 26 percent. Since 1990, the proportion of residents
within and the young adult age groups has been declining, a trend seen
nationwide, and significantly (six percent) over the last ten years.1 The middle-
age group (45-64 years), on the other hand, has increased consistently. This
trend shows that the City’s residents are becoming older in general, as
evidenced by the increasing median age in the City. An aging population
indicates that in the future, demand will be higher for smaller housing units and
housing programs such as housing repair services for seniors.

throughout California. In 2010, Whites were the most prevalent group in the
City at 42 percent, followed by Asian/Pacific Islanders at 35 percent. The
increase of Asians and Hispanics in Torrance since 1990 has been accompanied
by a considerable decrease in the White population.

Ethnic diversity also influences other demographic characteristics such as age,
family and household size, and income. Figure H-1 shows that minority
households, especially Hispanic households, had lower median earnings than
Whites and the Torrance population as a whole.

Age distribution also varies significantly by race and ethnicity (Figure H-2), as
the average age of Hispanic and Black residents in the City tends to be younger
than that of Asian and White residents. The City’s median age, as shown
previously in Table H-3, has increased from 38.7 in 2000 to 41.3 in 2010. On
one hand, the population in general is aging, as the long-established White
population is aging in place. However, the proportion of non-White persons,
most of whom are younger, is increasing. These two factors working together
have kept the median age in the City from rising significantly.

1.3 HOUSEHOLD
CHARACTERISTICS
Household type and size, income level, the presence of persons with special
needs, and other household characteristics may affect access to and demand for
housing and housing programs. This section details the various household
characteristics in Torrance.
1.3.1             HOUSEHOLD TYPE AND SIZE
Household characteristics and types can impact the type of housing needed. For
instance, single-person households often occupy smaller apartment units or
condominiums, such as studio and one-bedroom units. Married couples often
prefer larger single-family homes, particularly if they have children. This
underscores the need to provide a diversity of housing opportunities to provide
households of different ages and types the opportunity to live in Torrance.
The U.S. Census Bureau defines a household as all of the people who occupy a
housing unit. A household is different than a housing unit, as a housing units
are living quarters (homes, apartments, mobile homes, etc.). A household refers
to the group of persons living in a housing unit.
In 2010, there were 56,001 households in the City. As Table H-5 indicates,
Torrance appears to be a stable family-oriented community, with two-thirds of
all households classified as families. Regarding the percentage of family

households, the City (68.6 percent) has a similar proportion compared to the
County (67.7 percent), the State (68.7 percent), and the nation (66.4 percent).
This proportion has remained relatively stable since 1990, with slight decrease
in the proportion of family households in 2000, but an increase in 2010.
However, the proportion of families with children has decreased significantly
since 1990, possibly indicating an aging population where family members have
left to form their own households. This trend parallels the increasing median
age in the City. In 2010, 26 percent of all households were comprised of single
persons; this percentage is similar to 1990 but represents a decrease from
2000.

Household size and composition are often two interrelated factors.
Communities with a large proportion of families with children tend to have a
large average household size. In Torrance, however, the proportion of families
with children has decreased while the average family size has slightly increased
since 1990. The modest increase in family size may be correlated to an increase
in the proportion of families with extended family members sharing the home
and is balanced by the increase in the senior population, who tend to have a
smaller average family size.
Since 1990, renter-occupied households have decreased. Owner-occupied
households increased significantly between 1990 and 2000, and only increased
by a few percentage points between 2000 and 2010.

1.4 INCOME AND
EMPLOYMENT
1.4.1            INCOME PROFILE
Household income is the most important, although not the only factor,
affecting housing opportunity because it determines a household's ability to
purchase or rent housing and balance housing costs with other necessities.
Income levels can vary considerably among households, affecting preferences for
tenure, location, and housing type. While higher income households have more
discretionary income to spend on housing, low- and moderate-income
households have a more limited choice in the housing they can afford.
The median household income in Torrance is $75,885 according to 2011
Census data, significantly higher than the median household income for Los
Angeles County ($56,266). Figure H-3 shows that overall, Torrance has a larger
proportion of residents earning between $75,000 and $200,000 than the
County, and a smaller proportion of residents earning less than $50,000 per
year.

For housing planning and funding purposes, the State Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD) uses five income categories to evaluate
housing need based on the Area Median Income (AMI) for the metropolitan
area:
         Extremely Low-Income Households earn between 0 and 30% of AMI
         Very Low-Income Households earn between 31 and 50% of AMI
         Low-Income Households earn between 51 and 80% of AMI
         Moderate-Income Households earn between 81 and 120% of AMI
         Above Moderate-Income Households earn over 120% of AMI
The CHAS special Census tabulations developed for HUD provide a specific
breakdown of household income adjusted for family size. As shown in Table H-
6, moderate- and above-moderate-income households comprise the largest
share of all households, and the low-income households comprise the second
largest category. According to the 2005-2009 CHAS, more than nine percent
of the City's total households are classified as extremely low income (0-30% of
AMI), more than nine percent are classified as very low income (31-50% of
AMI), and approximately 14 percent were classified as low income (51-80%
AMI). Nearly 68 percent of the City’s households had incomes above 80
percent of the median household income in 2009.

  HHS: Households
Tenure is closely correlated with income, as those households with lower
incomes most usually cannot afford to buy a home. Consistent with this fact,
renters in Torrance earned lower incomes overall, with about 26 percent earning
less than half the median income for the County. There was a difference
between renter and owner households, as the proportion of owners earning
less than half the median income was only 18 percent. Elderly renters are
shown to be in the most precarious financial situation, with more than half
earning less than half of the median income for the County.

  1.4.2              EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
  Located in a strong and diversified employment market, Torrance residents
  benefit from convenient access to jobs and a high demand in occupations that
  serve the City’s residents. In October 2012, Los Angeles County had a a high
  unemployment rate (10.3 percent), slightly higher than the state (9.8 percent).
  2
    High employment has been a result of the recession that affected the entire
  world economy, from late 2007 to 2009. In Torrance, unemployment was only
  6.2 percent. In 2011, the State Employment Development Department
  estimates that Torrance has a labor force of approximately 79,100 persons, or
  nearly two percent of the County’s total labor force (4,924,400).
  Table H-8 shows the type of occupations held by Torrance residents. Between
  2000 and 2010, there was an increase in the proportion of residents in service
  and managerial/professional occupations and a decrease in construction and
  maintenance jobs. This is an important trend, as service occupations have the
  lowest earnings (Table H-9). In 2010, Torrance residents proportionally held
  more managerial/professional jobs than the County (49 percent compared to 35
  percent), and less service occupations (11 percent compared to 18 percent).

1.5 SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
Certain groups have more difficulty finding decent, affordable housing due to
their special circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one's
income earning potential, family characteristics, the presence of physical or
mental disabilities, or age-related health issues. As a result, certain groups
typically earn lower incomes and have higher rates of overpayment for housing,
or overcrowding. A central goal of the Housing Element is to assist persons
with special needs in meeting their housing needs.
1.5.1             ELDERLY
The elderly are a large and rapidly growing segment of the population in
Torrance. Specific housing needs of the elderly include affordable housing,
supportive housing (such as intermediate care facilities), and other housing that
includes a planned service component. In 2010, there were 21,726 senior
persons in Torrance, a moderate increase from 2000 (19,427) and a significant
increase from the 1990 population (15,900). Of the 21,726 seniors, over
11,100 are considered frail elderly (over the age of 74).
Many elderly persons have limited income potential, as they are most often
retired and have fixed incomes (retirement funds and Social Security income).
The elderly population in 2011 had a median income of $46,705 according to
the 2011 American Community Survey, which is considered moderate income
for a one-person household. According to the 2010 Census, there are 12,779

                                                       CHAPTER 6:               Housing Element
elderly households in Torrance. Seventy-seven percent of these households live
in owner-occupied units, and only 23 percent are renters. The 2009 CHAS
report revealed that nearly one-third of renting seniors paid more than 30
percent of their income on housing, experiencing a housing cost burden. While
the majority of seniors are homeowners, the percentage of renter seniors who
overpaid was much higher than the average (36 percent). In 2010, nearly one-
third of the elderly population was disabled. In response to the increasing
housing needs of seniors in the City, Torrance has approved 11 senior housing
projects totaling over 500 new rental and ownership senior units to be
constructed in the near future.3
1.5.2              DISABLED
Both mentally and physically disabled residents face housing access and safety
challenges. Disabled people, in most cases, are of limited incomes, often
receiving Social Security income only, with housing costs taking the majority of
their monthly income. Because people with disabilities spend a higher
percentage of income on housing, overcrowding is frequent as housing
expenses are shared with others, oftentimes live-in caretakers. In addition, the
adults often have the problems of securing and paying for childcare. They may
have the further burden of obtaining an education or training for themselves to
increase their incomes and their ability to find affordable housing. In addition,
disabled persons may face difficulty finding accessible housing (housing that is
made accessible to people with disabilities through the positioning of
appliances and fixtures, the heights of installations and cabinets, layout of unit
to facilitate wheelchair movement, etc.).
California State Code Title 24 requires all multiple-family residential
developments of three or more units, and stacked condominium developments
of four or more units, to be accessible to disabled persons. However, because
Title 24 regulations were not in effect at the time that many of the City’s
housing units were constructed, it is likely that there exists a shortage of
housing units accessible to people with disabilities. This suggests the need to
continue the City’s home improvement program.
Many Torrance residents have personal disabilities that prevent them from
working, restrict their mobility, or make it difficult to care for themselves. In
2000, 16 percent of the population reported a disability. A significant
proportion of the senior population (33 percent) is disabled. American
Community Survey 2010 data indicate that the proportion of Torrance residents
with a disability is 9 percent.

1.5.3 DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED
According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, a
"developmental disability" means a disability that originates before an individual
attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely,
and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual which includes
mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes
disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to
require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental
retardation, but does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely
physical in nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within
a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require
a group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely
affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical
attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities
exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a
child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. The California State
Council on Developmental Disabilities estimates that nationwide 1.8 percent of
the population meet the federal definition of a developmental disability. This
equates to 2,618 persons in the City of Torrance with developmental
disabilities, based on the 2010 Census population.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides
community-based services to approximately 243,000 persons with
developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21
regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based

                                                      CHAPTER 6:          Housing Element
facilities. The Harbor Regional Center (HRC) is one of 21 regional centers in
California that provides point of entry to services for people with developmental
disabilities. HRC is a private, not-for-profit corporation contracting with the
State of California for the provision of services to persons with developmental
disabilities pursuant to the Lanterman Act. According the California
Department of Development Services, in Torrance approximately 1,223 persons
are reported as consumers of the services provided at the local Regional Center.
The largest age groups of Torrance residents being served at the Regional Center
are the 0-14 year group (427 clients) and the 23-54 year group (425 clients).
State data also show that the majority of the clients at the Regional Center live
at home (75%).
Several resources are available to developmentally disabled residents. Easter
Seals Torrance has an adult day program for developmentally disabled adults
and an inclusion program for children. The ARC South Bay provides basic Living
Skills Training for adults with developmental disabilities at two Adult
Development Centers, one in Gardena and one in Hermosa Beach.
1.5.4               FAMILIES
State law identifies two specific family groups as having special housing needs –
large families/households and families with female heads of households. The
reasons for their special need status varies and may include lower income
status, the presence of children, and the need for financial assistance, as well as
the available of suitably sized housing.

CHAPTER 6:           Housing Element
LARGE HOUSEHOLDS
In general, large households (with five or more members) are identified as a
group with special housing needs based on the limited availability of adequately
sized, affordable housing units. Large households are often of lower income,
frequently resulting in the overcrowding of smaller dwelling units and in time,
accelerating unit deterioration.
The 2010 Census reported 5,031 large households with five or more members
in Torrance, of which 61 percent owned a home. These households are usually
families with more than two children or families with extended family members
such as in-laws or grandparents living in the same housing unit. According to
CHAS data, 50 percent of large-family owners and 79 percent of large-family
renters experienced one or more housing problems. Housing problems include
overcrowding, cost burden, and substandard conditions. According to Census
data, there was a six percent increase in the proportion of large households in
the City between 2000 and 2010.
FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance because
of the greater need for day care, health care, and other services. Female-headed
households with children in particular tend to have lower incomes, thus
limiting housing availability for this group. In addition, these households have a
greater need for accessible daycare and other supportive services. The City’s
Parks and Recreation Department offers low-cost after-school and before-school
childcare at many of the elementary and middle schools.
In 2010, 6,148 female-headed households lived in Torrance, representing 11
percent of all households. Female-headed households with children made up six
percent of all households. 2010 data indicate that the proportion of female-
headed households has increased by one percent since 2000, and female-
headed households with children have also increased by one percent since
2000.
1.5.5            HOMELESS PERSONS
Homeless persons often have a very difficult time finding housing once they
have moved from a transitional housing or other assistance program. The 2011
Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count conducted by the Los Angeles Homeless
Services Authority (LAHSA) revealed a population of approximately 51,340
homeless in Los Angeles County on a single night survey, a three percent
decrease from 2009.4 For the City of Torrance, the study identified 88 homeless

persons unsheltered through a street count. A street count includes homeless
persons found outside either residing in a vehicle, tent, or encampment
dwelling. City records indicate that there are few homeless persons or families
in Torrance. However, another sector of homeless that are much less visible
than those in shelters and on the streets is the informal homeless sector. These
people are much harder to enumerate, as they stay with friends and relatives, in
motels and other informal housing arrangements. It is likely that a number of
individuals and families that fall into this category, but estimates are
unavailable.
Homelessness is a regional problem that is most effectively addressed within a
cooperative inter-jurisdictional effort. Torrance works with the South Bay
Homeless Coalition and local social service agencies to investigate resources
available to relieve area-wide homelessness. The City also cooperates with
community service organizations to facilitate homeless assistance programs
and allocating resources for these efforts through the community services
grants program. Torrance’s Housing Office provides referrals and listings of
agencies for persons in need of temporary shelter and transitional housing.

1.5.6              FARMWORKERS
According to the 2010 Census, only 107 Torrance residents have “agriculture,
forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining” occupations. Due to the limited
opportunities for agricultural operations in and around the City and the high
cost of housing in Torrance, it is likely that these persons are not farmworkers

but are instead employed in plant nurseries, landscaping, or gardening
companies. The City of Torrance is mostly urbanized; farming operations and
agricultural uses are limited to a commercial nursery and small strawberry field.
As such, the City has no need for farmworker housing, and affordable housing
needs of those who held the “Farming, Forestry, and Fishing” occupations
would be accommodated under the City’s housing programs, such as the
Section 8 rental assistance program.
1.6 HOUSING PROFILE
This section addresses characteristics of the housing supply in Torrance,
including type, age, condition, costs, and availability.
1.6.1               HOUSING STOCK
Torrance is a built-out city and in recent years has experienced only a modest
growth in its housing stock. The 2010 Census reported 58,377 housing units in
Torrance, representing an increase of approximately six percent since 1990
(Table H-14) and four percent growth since 2000. The level of growth in
Torrance is similar to that experienced in the nearby cities of Carson, Hermosa
beach, and Los Angeles, and closely paralleled the housing growth of the
County of Los Angeles as a whole.

According to the State Department of Finance, the majority of housing units in
Torrance as of May 2012 were single-family homes, comprising approximately
52 percent of all units. Multi-family units comprised over 45 percent of all
homes. The largest growth in the proportion of housing unit type has been for
multi-family units (9.6 percent). Since 2000, the number of single-family units
has increased by 4.4 percent, and the number of mobile homes has decreased
by 4.1 percent.5

1.6.3               TENURE
Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is owned or rented. The changes in the
distribution of owner- versus renter-occupied units and the vacancy rates of the
housing stock between 1990, 2000, and 2010 estimates are presented in Table
H-16. In 2010, and relatively similar to conditions over the past several
decades, 56 percent of the occupied housing units in Torrance were owner-
occupied. Countywide, 48 percent of all housing units were owner-occupied.6
That the City’s tenure distribution has remained at levels seen in 1990 speaks
to the stability of the City’s residential neighborhoods.
1.6.4               VACANCY
The vacancy rate indicates a relationship between supply and demand. A
healthy vacancy rate - one which permits sufficient choice among a variety of
housing units - is considered to be around four percent (as low as 2 percent for
ownership units; 5 to 6 percent for rental units). A limited vacancy rate
increases competition for housing and can result in higher housing costs,
reducing housing opportunities for lower-income households. With a housing
stock comprised of 57 percent single-family units and 44 percent multi-family
units, the weighted optimum vacancy rate should be between 3 and 4 percent.
While in 2010, the vacancy rate could have contributed to a lack of housing
choice for some individuals, estimates from 2010 reveal an overall vacancy rate
that is healthy (4.1 percent).

1.7 HOUSING ISSUES
1.7.1               Housing Condition
The age and condition of housing stock can be an indicator of potential
rehabilitation needs. Commonly, housing over 30 years of age needs some form
of major rehabilitation, such as a new roof, foundation work, plumbing, etc. The
housing stock in Torrance is aging. The age of the City’s housing stock, as
defined by the year the units were built, is shown in Table H-17. As of 2011,
approximately 84 percent of all housing units in the City were built prior to
1979, making many of these close to or over 30 years old. Only about eight
percent of the units in Torrance were built between 1990 and 2011. It should
be noted that older homes are not necessarily indicative of substantial housing
rehabilitation needs in a community. Where household incomes are high,
homeowners generally have the wherewithal to maintain older homes in good
condition. Also, in neighborhoods such as historic downtown Torrance, people
frequently buy homes that are 50 years or older for the express purpose of
rehabilitating historic properties.
The City uses a building code and a land use (zoning) code enforcement
program to help maintain the quality of residential neighborhoods. The
Environmental Section of the Community Development Department is
responsible for the enforcement of City zoning and land use codes, property
maintenance and nuisance codes (both community noise and airport noise
codes), as well as unpermitted buildings. City code enforcement staff estimates
that fewer than 10 units are considered substandard and indicate that the
figure is closer to three units that are considered to be in severe need of
demolition or substantial rehabilitation due to housing conditions. Currently
two of the units are vacated and one is undergoing rehabilitation. The City has
two home rehabilitation programs in place to assist homeowners and property
owners.

1.7.2             OVERCROWDING
In response to a mismatch between household income and housing costs in a
community, some households may not be able to buy or rent housing that
provides a reasonable level of privacy and space. Residents may accept smaller-
sized housing or double up with other families to afford the housing costs. An
overcrowded household is defined as one with more than one person per room,
excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and porches. Severely overcrowded
households are households with more than 1.5 persons per room.
Overcrowding contributes to increases in traffic within a neighborhood,
accelerates deterioration of homes and infrastructure, and results in a shortage
of on-site parking.
Table H-18 displays the prevalence of overcrowding in Torrance. According to
the 2010 Census, four percent of households in Torrance were overcrowded
(2,414 units), a 55 percent decrease from 2000. The incidence of overcrowding
was significantly lower in Torrance than in the County (11 percent). The
percentage of severely overcrowded households in Torrance was one percent
(580 units) in 2010, also lower than that of the County (five percent).
The prevalence of overcrowding varies significantly by income, type, and size of
household. Generally, very low- and low-income households and large families
are disproportionately affected by overcrowding. However, cultural differences
also contribute to overcrowding conditions since some cultures tend to have
larger household sizes. Overcrowding is typically more prevalent among renters
than among owners.           Three percent of renter households experienced
overcrowding in 2010 (1,923 units) compared to only two percent of owner
households (491 units).

1.7.3              HOUSING COSTS
The cost of housing in a community is directly correlated to the number of
housing problems and affordability issues. High housing costs can price low-
income families out of the market, cause extreme cost burdens, or force
households into overcrowded or substandard conditions.
1.7.4              OWNERSHIP HOUSING
The median Torrance home price in 2011 was $445,000. This was 9.2 percent
lower than the median home price in 2010 of $490,000. The median home
price for Los Angeles County at large ($315,000) was much lower than in
Torrance. Home values significantly declined following the sub-prime mortgage
market collapse, with housing in closer to prices to those in 2000.
DataQuick estimated a November 2012 median condominium sales price
ranging from the low $190,000s to the high $460,0007 in Torrance.

 Sales Recorded in the Year 2011
The National Association of Homebuilders compiles and publishes a quarterly
housing affordability index. The index calculates the percentage of homes that
were sold during a three-month period that would be affordable to a family
earning the region’s median income. The index assumes buyers will finance 90
percent of the purchase price with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, and takes into
account prevailing interest rates, property taxes, and insurance costs. During
the third quarter of 2012, the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale metropolitan
area ranked among the least affordable metro areas in the country. According
to the data, only 44 percent of the homes in the metropolitan area are
affordable for the median income. Only the Santa Ana-Anaheim-Irvine, San
Francisco-San Mateo-Redwood City, and New York-White Plains-Wayne
metropolitan areas have a lower affordability rank compared to Los Angeles-
Long Beach-Glendale.
1.7.5                RENTAL HOUSING
According to the 2010 Census, 43.5 percent of Torrance households live in
rental housing. During December 2012, rents in Torrance ranged from $800 to
$1,200 for a studio apartment, $1,000 to $1,375 for a one-bedroom unit,
between $1,425 and $1,800 for a two-bedroom unit, and between $1,475 and
$2,225 for a three-bedroom unit.8 The lower end of these rents generally falls
within the range of HUD-determined fair market rents for the County of Los
Angeles, excluding two-bedroom units.

A survey of homes for rent on Craigslist reveals that the majority of houses for
rent are two- and three-bedroom homes that vary by size and location. Rents
on these units range from $1,150 to $3,500 per month. Because four-bedroom
apartments are rare, many large families may need to rent a single-family home
to avoid overcrowded conditions.

1.7.6                OVERPAYMENT AND
AFFORDABILITY
State and federal standards specify that households spending more than 30
percent of gross annual income on housing experience a housing cost burden.
Housing cost burdens occur when housing costs increase faster than household
income. When a household spends more than 30 percent of its income on
housing costs, it has less disposable income for other necessities such as health
care. In the event of unexpected circumstances such as loss of employment and
health problems, lower-income households with a burdensome housing cost
are more likely to become homeless or double up with other households.
Homeowners with a housing cost burden have the option of selling the homes
and become renters. Renters, on the other hand, are vulnerable and subject to
constant changes in the housing market.
Table H-22 shows the connection between income, household type, and cost
burden. The proportion of households experiencing cost burden declined
significantly as income increased. Overall cost burden was more prevalent
among renter households in all income categories. In particular, very-low-
income large family renters (91 percent) and very low-income elderly renter
households (81 percent) had the highest proportion of cost burden compared

CHAPTER 6:            Housing Element
with the proportion experiencing cost burden citywide (40 percent).
Significantly, a lower proportion of extremely low-income renters experienced
housing cost burden as compared to very low- and low-income renters. This is
likely due to increased subsidies available to those of extremely low income.

  1.7.7           AFFORDABILITY
Affordability is determined by comparing the cost of housing to the income of
local households. Los Angeles County’s high costs of housing impacts
communities far beyond the affordability problem. The lack of affordable
housing contributes to high levels of housing cost burden, overcrowding, and
even homelessness. In assessing housing affordability, the California Health and
Safety Code Section 50052.5 provides the following definition of affordable
housing cost based on the area median income level (AMI) adjusted by family
size and income level:
                                                                    Calculation of

Comparing housing costs and maximum affordable prices for low-income
households shows that low-income households are being priced out of the Los
Angeles County rental and ownership market. Given the median home prices
presented in Table H-19, single-family home ownership is beyond the reach of
low-income households.              For home ownership, some moderate-income
households may be able to afford a condominium but the unit may not be
adequately sized for them. In the rental market, extremely and very low-income
households generally cannot afford the market rents in Torrance. Moderate-
income households may be able to afford one- and two-bedroom units in the
City, but such units are too small for large households.

1.8 AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN
          TORRANCE
1.8.1             PUBLIC HOUSING
The Torrance Housing Authority is a Section 8 only Housing Authority (HA). It
does not own or operate public housing units. In 2012, the Torrance HA
provided Section 8 rental assistance to 605 households. As 2012, there were
approximately 16,875 active applicants on the waiting list, which is now
closed. The HA maintains a residence preference, which gives priority to
households that live or work in the City, and a singles preference, which gives
priority to families, disabled persons, and seniors.
1.8.2             ASSISTED HOUSING
The City uses various funding sources, including Redevelopment Housing Set-
Aside, HUD funding sources, and Section 8 rental assistance to preserve and
increase the supply of affordable housing in Torrance through the acquisition
and/or rehabilitation of renter-occupied units and the rehabilitation of owner-
occupied units. Financial assistance is provided to both non-profit and for-profit
housing developers. Table H-24 presents the inventory of affordable housing
developments in Torrance. In 2012, 10 affordable rental housing projects were
located in Torrance, providing 649 affordable units to lower-income
households.
1.8.3             FEDERALLY FUNDED SENIOR
HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS
Several housing developments are age restricted to provide housing for
Torrance’s senior population. Golden West Towers is a 179-unit senior
affordable housing project that was originally funded with HUD 236 funds and
is now financed through the HUD 542(c) program with a contract through
2025. When the contract expires, the project manager will have the option to
renew. As rental rates and fair market rents in Torrance are comparable for
studios and one-bedroom units (which all of the Golden West Tower units are),
the risk of conversion is lower because there is less incentive to convert to
market rate because the gain will be nominal. Furthermore, HUD offers funding
priority for extending Section 8 assistance to housing for seniors and persons
with disabilities. The City will continue to monitor the status of these at-risk
units. Should a Notice of Intent to opt out of the Section 8 program be filed,

CHAPTER 6:           Housing Element
JCI Gardens, built in 1982 with a federal Section 202 loan, has a 40-year low-
income use restriction. The HUD affordability contract was renewed through
July 2013, and the property remains held by a nonprofit organization that
anticipates annually renewing the contract in the future.
The nonprofit United Cerebral Palsy Foundation developed the 13-unit
Accessible Apartments 2 complex for people with disabilities using Section 202
funding and a 20-year Section 8 contract. The United Cerebral Palsy Foundation
renewed its HUD contract in 2013 and anticipates annually renewing the
contract in the future.
Also two group homes for the elderly or disabled are included in the HUD
Multifamily Assistance and Section 8 Contracts database. Both facilities consist
of a single-family home with a six-bed capacity.
1.8.5             AT-RISK UNITS
Over the next ten years (2014-2024), two federally assisted multifamily
developments and two group homes that altogether provide 114 affordable
units have expiring affordability covenants (Table H-24). Affordability covenants
in Torrance include developments that are financed with redevelopment set
aside funds or federal programs (HUD 202, HUD 811 and HUD 542[c]). Both
JCI Gardens and Accessible Apartments 2 are owned and operated by nonprofit
organizations and as such, are considered to be at low risk of conversion to
market rate. Long-term affordability is fairly secure for these projects as this is
consistent with the nonprofits’ missions to provide affordable housing for the
elderly, disabled, and low-income families. Both property owners indicated that
they renew their HUD contracts annually and plan to do so in the future.
1.8.6             RESERVATION AND
REPLACEMENT OPTIONS
Preservation of at-risk projects can be achieved in a variety of ways, with
adequate funding availability. These include:
        Transfer of ownership to nonprofit developers and housing
         organizations
        Providing rental assistance to renters through other funding sources
        Purchase affordability covenants
        Refinance mortgage revenue bonds
Alternatively, units that are converted to market rate may be replaced with new
assisted multi-family units with specified affordability timeframes.

1.8.7               TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP
Transferring ownership of the affordable units to a nonprofit housing
organization is a viable way to preserve affordable housing for the long term
and increases the number of government resources available to the project. The
feasibility of this option depends on the willingness of the owner to sell,
funding sources to actually buy the property, and the existence of a nonprofit
organization with sufficient administrative capacity to manage the property.
Additionally, projects in which all units are affordable, and not just a portion of
units are affordable, can participate in ownership transfers more simply and are
therefore more likely to be feasible. The following is a list of potential entities
that may be interested in acquiring and managing at-risk properties, several

In Torrance, the estimated market value for the 114 affordable units in the at-
risk projects is evaluated in Table H-25. The current market value for all
affordable at-risk units is estimated to be over $12.9 million. Because most of
the at-risk units are currently owned and maintained by nonprofits, no near-
term changes in ownership are anticipated.

1.8.8             RENTAL ASSISTANCE
State, local, or other funding sources can also be used to provide rental
subsidies to maintain the affordability of at-risk projects. These subsidies can be
structured to mirror the Section 8 program, whereby the subsidy covers the
cost of the unit above what is determined to be affordable for the tenant’s
household income (including a utility allowance) up to the fair market value of
the apartment. Given the mix of unit sizes of the at-risk developments, the total
annual subsidy to maintain the 114 at-risk units is estimated at just over
$886,600.

1.8.9              PURCHASE AFFORDABILITY
COVENANTS
Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk projects is to provide an
incentive package to the owners to maintain the projects as low-income
housing. Incentives could include writing down the interest rate on the
remaining loan balance and/or supplementing the Section 8 subsidy received to
market levels. The feasibility of this option depends on whether the complexes
require rehabilitation or are too highly leveraged. By providing lump-sum
financial incentives or on-going subsidies in rents or reduced mortgage interest
rates to the owner, the City can ensure that some or all of the units remain
affordable.
1.8.10 CONSTRUCTION OF
REPLACEMENT UNITS
The construction of new low-income housing can be a means to replace at-risk
units. The cost of developing new housing depends on a variety of factors
including density, size of units, construction quality and type, location, and
land cost. Assuming a development cost of $200,000 for a multi-family rental
unit, the cost of replacing all 114 affordable at-risk units would be
approximately $22.8 million.

1.9 ESTIMATES OF HOUSING
         NEED
Several factors influence the degree of demand, or "need," for housing in
Torrance. The four major needs categories considered in this element include:
        Housing needs resulting from population growth, both in the City and
         the surrounding region;
        Housing needs resulting from the overcrowding of units;
        Housing needs that result when households pay more than they can
         afford for housing; and
        Housing needs of "special needs groups" such as elderly, large families,
         female-headed households, households with a disabled person,
         farmworkers, and the homeless.

Note:     Data presented in this table is based on special tabulations from sample Census data. The number of households in
each category usually deviates slightly from the 100% count due to the need to extrapolate sample data out to total
households. Interpretations of this data should focus on the proportion of households in need of assistance rather than on
precise numbers.

Specific households in Torrance had disproportionate housing needs. In general,
renter households had a higher level of housing problems (49 percent)
compared to owner households (38 percent). Among the 3,560 elderly renter
households in the City, 65 percent of all elderly renter households experienced
one or more housing problems. Large renter families constituted nine percent of
all households in 2010, but most (79 percent) experienced one or more housing
problems, the highest rate among all other groups. In Torrance, approximately
9.2 percent of households were classified as extremely low income (0-30% of
AMI), close to 9.1 percent were classified as very low income (31-50% of AMI),
and 13.9 percent were classified as low income (51-80% AMI).

1.9.1 PROJECTED HOUSING NEED
California General Plan law requires each city and county to have land zoned to
accommodate its fair share of the regional housing need. This share for the
SCAG region is known as the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). The
California Department of Housing and Community Development determined
that the projected housing need for the Southern California region (including
the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, and
Imperial) is 412,716 new housing units for the 2014-2021 planning period.
SCAG allocated this projected growth to the various cities and unincorporated
county areas within the SCAG region, creating the RHNA. The RHNA is divided
into four income categories: very low, low, moderate, and above moderate. As
determined by SCAG, the City of Torrance’s fair share allocation is 1,450 new
housing units during this planning cycle, with the units distributed among the
four income categories as shown in Table H-29.
To calculate the projected housing needs, the City assumed 50 percent of the
very low-income regional housing need is extremely low-income households.
As a result, from the very low income need of 380 units, the City has a
projected need of 190 units for extremely low-income households. To address
the range of needs, the City will employ a detailed housing strategy including
promoting a variety of housing types.

2. HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
2.1 INTRODUCTION
Governmental, market, infrastructure, and environmental factors may constrain
the provision of adequate and affordable housing in a city. State law requires
that Housing Elements analyze potential and actual governmental and non-
governmental constraints to the production, maintenance and improvement of
housing for all persons of all income levels and disabilities. Should constraints
preclude the achievement of housing goals, State Housing Element law requires
jurisdictions to address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove
governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development
of housing. This section addresses these potential constraints that affect the
supply of housing in Torrance.
2.2 GOVERNMENTAL
          CONSTRAINTS
Local government housing regulations are necessary to assure: (1) that housing
is constructed and maintained in a safe manner, (2) that the density and design
of housing is consistent with community standards, and (3) that adequate
infrastructure to support new housing is provided. Local policies and
regulations can also impact the price and availability of housing and, in
particular, the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site
improvement requirements, fees and exactions, permit processing procedures,
and other factors may constrain the maintenance, development and
improvement of housing.
The City of Torrance has not adopted growth control measures or taken
measures to reduce potential housing development. The City has acted to
preserve existing high-density, multiple-family projects and provided
development opportunities for a variety of housing types. Given the age and
built-out condition of Torrance, the City has implemented an aggressive capital
improvement program to upgrade infrastructure throughout the City.
Consistent with State law (Section 65583) this section addresses five potential
constraints to housing development:
         Land use controls
         Building codes and their enforcement
         Site improvements (on and off-site)

        Housing for people with disabilities
2.2.1            LAND USE CONTROLS
The Land Use Element sets forth the policies which guide development in the
city, and the zoning regulations serve to implement these policies. In Torrance,
51 percent of the land within the General Plan area is designated for residential
use. Additional land may be used for residential purposes in conjunction with
commercial where appropriate. The vast majority of housing in the City is low-
density, single-family housing, (averaging close to seven units per acre) which
occupies approximately 4,000 acres. Implementation of the General Plan Land
Use Plan to 75 percent of the maximum potential is expected to result in 3,100
additional dwelling units which is an average of less than 160 units per year
over a 20-year period. According to the Census, the City’s housing stock has
increased from a 1990 unit count of 54,927 to a total of 58,557 units in 2011.
GENERAL PLAN DESIGNATIONS
The General Plan provides for five residential land use classifications, with
allowable densities ranging from nine units per acre in low density areas to over
44 units per acre in the higher density multiple family designation, as described
below. In addition, one land use category is intended for development of a mix
of low intensity offices and residential units. Two commercial categories allow
residential development in conjunction with office or retail uses.
LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (R-LO)
The Low-Density Residential designation provides for the development of
single-family residences within a density range of up to 9 dwelling units per
acre. Development is characterized generally by detached single-family
dwellings on individual lots forming a cohesive neighborhood.
LOW-MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (R-LM)
The Low-Medium Density Residential designation provides for the development
of small-lot single-family homes, duplexes, attached multi-unit developments,
and mobile home parks within a density range of 9.1 to 18 dwelling units per
acre.
MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (R-MD)
The Medium Density Residential designation allows townhouses and low-rise
multi-unit buildings within a density range of 18.1 to 31 dwelling units per
acre.

MEDIUM-HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (R-MH)
Residential development accommodated in the Medium-High Residential
designation includes low- and medium-rise multi-unit attached developments.
Residential development may occur within a density range of 31.1 to 44
dwelling units per acre. Areas in the City with an R-MH designation are
appropriate for subterranean parking.
HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (R-HI)
The High Density Residential designation accommodates multi-family housing,
and specifically housing development of a more intensive form, including
medium and high-rise apartment buildings with a minimum density of 44.1
dwelling units per acre. The R-HI designation is appropriate for senior housing.
RESIDENTIAL OFFICE (R-OF)
The Residential Office designation permits the location of office and compatible
commercial uses adjacent to residential uses. The designation is intended to
accommodate neighborhoods where businesses and residential uses are
gradually being combined. Residential-Office will provide opportunities for
mixed-use residential and commercial developments as well as live-work
arrangements. Professional offices are the most desirable office use in this
designation. Housing can include low- to medium-rise apartments or
townhouses and condominiums on smaller lots. Developments that integrate
residential and office or commercial on a single site will require approval of a
conditional use permit.

ZONING DISTRICTS
Development standards for housing are established by the Land Use Code and
are not considered excessive. Except within the Hillside Overlay District,
construction of new residences, or structural modifications to existing single-
family residences, are allowed by right. Within the Hillside Overlay District,
there is a design review process that is performed either at an administrative
level or before the Planning Commission, depending on certain criteria. The
overall intent of the design review process is not to preclude new housing
development, but to afford protection of views, light, air corridors, and privacy
and to address hillside construction and safety issues.
Residential development within zoning districts allowing for two-unit and
multi-family residences is also permitted by right with the exception of multiple
owner occupied structures. Within the R-2 zone, (two-family residential
district), development of single-family residences, duplexes, or two detached
HOUSING ELEMENT                                   H-46                   CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN
                                                  CHAPTER 6:            Housing Element
units is allowed without review. Within the Small Lot, Low-Medium Overlay
Zone special development criteria are imposed in the interest of protecting
existing homes in an area of small and narrow lots (typically 5,000 square feet
and 40 feet wide). Despite the small lot sizes, second units may be developed
without review provided the existing home is retained and the units are not
condominium or for sale housing. In order to address the problem of designing
accessible parking on narrow width lots, parking standards are more flexible,
allowing the fourth required parking spaces to be uncovered or in tandem
configuration with Planning Commission review. Because existing homes are
older and relatively small, especially when compared to new homes, they are
comparatively less expensive than homes elsewhere in the City. Second units
built without triggering review also are relatively small and not for sale, again
making available more affordable housing options.
A conditional use permit is required for projects that exceed established
development standards (with a floor-area ratio [FAR] above 0.65 and higher
than two stories for the R-2 zone, and for projects with a FAR above 0.60 and
higher than two stories for the R-3 zone). Multiple owner-occupied residential
structures are subject to approval of a Conditional Use Permit, as are multiple
family residential developments of more than three stories in height (i.e., in
excess of established development standards) or more than 100 units.
Planning Commission review is required of projects in the R-4, Unlimited
Multiple Family Residential District, where a maximum density of 43 units per
acre is allowed; and in the R-5, High Rise Residential District, for which there is
no density limit. Due to the almost built-out nature of the City, a 100-unit
development is not common, and the impacts on long-established
neighborhoods are a concern to the City. As such, the purpose of a permit is
not to discourage new development, but to ensure that it is well designed and
fits into the context of surrounding residential development within the zoning
district, and to ensure adequate public review of and input on all land uses
which could potentially impact the community, as well as to ensure adequate
review. Staff records indicate that most development (including multiple owner-
occupied residential structures and other types of multi-family developments
that exceed development standards) have been approved with close City
coordination with applicants in the pre-application process. This process
ensures that proposed developments fit into the context of surrounding
residential development within the zoning district. As further evidence that this
requirement is not a constraint to development, the majority of residential units
built, approved, or under construction in the City have been multiple -family
developments. Exclusive of overall market decline, demand for residential
development remains high in South Bay in general and in Torrance in particular.
The Downtown Residential Multiple-Family District (R-MF) was created to
implement the Commercial Center General Plan designation and provide for
more housing opportunities, especially multi-family developments, in the
Downtown area. The Residential Multiple Family District was created to allow

CHAPTER 6:           Housing Element
multi-family residential development in the Industrial Redevelopment Project
Area. A conditional use permit is required for all development within these
zones to ensure conformance with these goals.
Other zoning districts allow for originality and flexibility in design. The PD,
Planned Development District, allows for development standards to be tailored
to individual projects of five acres or more as proposed by the developer,
subject to Planning Commission and City Council review. Density is determined
by General Plan designation. A significant amount of new residential
development in recent years has occurred by planned development, including
attached townhouse projects and detached single-family homes. The RTH,
Residential Townhouse District, allows for clustered development at 15 units
per acre on properties with a minimum area of five acres or 12 units per acres
on less than five acres.
The Hawthorne Boulevard Corridor Specific Plan also allows residential
development on select sites along the corridor. Allowable densities vary, with a
maximum density on certain sites of 40+ units per acre. Further discussion is
provided below.
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
The City of Torrance regulates the type, location, density, and scale of
residential development in order to protect and promote the health, safety, and
general welfare of residents, as well as implement the policies of the General
Plan. The City’s Land Use Code establishes restrictions on lot size and area,
yards and setbacks, lot coverage, building height, parking, and minimum unit
size. The development standards summarized in Table H-31 include the most
pertinent development standards of the non-Specific Plan areas in Torrance.
These regulations can have an effect on the ability of property owners to
construct and maintain housing.

PARKING
City parking standards for residential developments are tailored to the vehicle
ownership patterns associated with different residential uses. The Land Use
Code requires parking based on the number of units on the property. Parking
requirements for residential uses are listed in Table H-32. For single family
developments, the Land Use Code requires two parking spaces within an
enclosed garage. Multi-family residential requirements vary based on the
number of bedrooms in each unit, and also require guest parking.

Parking requirements for residential uses are closely associated with the actual
demand for parking generated by the particular development. Multiple-family
units with two or fewer bedrooms require two spaces per unit (1½ in enclosed
garage) and one guest parking space for each five dwelling units or portion
thereof. Multiple-family units with three or more bedrooms require three spaces
per unit (1½ in enclosed garage) and one guest parking space for each five
dwelling units or portion thereof. To offset the additional parking space in the
3+ bedroom developments, the City allows two of the three spaces to be
provided as tandem parking. The guest parking space requirement of one space
per five units for all multiple family developments is very low and comparable to
with other cities in the area.
However, parking space requirements are reduced for uses that have lower
parking needs, such as senior housing and special needs housing. To facilitate
equal access to housing for special needs groups, such as seniors and the
disabled, the land use code provides for a variety of parking space reductions.
Parking requirements are more moderate for senior housing with only one space
required per unit, and one guest space for every five units. Community
residential care facilities require only one space for every three beds. Reduced
parking can also be applied to affordable residential developments through the
density bonus provisions. At the request of the applicant and pursuant to
compliance with State density bonus law, the City can permit an alternative
parking ratio and other parking incentives. The City’s density bonus provisions
provide for the granting of at least one regulatory concession, including but not
limited to, a reduction in setback requirements or reduction in the requirement
of parking spaces. For newer mixed-use developments, the City has allowed the
required guest parking and commercial parking to overlap, instead of requiring
separate parking for each. Several developments in Downtown Torrance
(including affordable units) have no on-site parking or reduced parking.

                                                  CHAPTER 6:          Housing Element
Second units require one space per bedroom in an enclosed garage. This is a
standard requirement for many Southern California cities, consistent with
California Government Code section 65852.2, which allows local jurisdictions
to include a parking requirement for second units that does not exceed one
parking space per unit or per bedroom. The parking standards in Torrance are
directly related to the use of the second unit and are consistent with existing
neighborhood standards applicable to existing dwellings (as called for in section
65852.2). While second units can contribute to the housing stock in the
community, it is important to also ensure the integrity of Torrance’s single-
family residential neighborhoods. Torrance’s second unit ordinance is intended
to allow for the development of second dwelling units where appropriate, while
maintaining and protecting the essential character and integrity of its single-
family residential districts.
While these standards may affect development costs, they are considered
necessary to assure certain quality standards for multiple-family housing.
Because the City offers flexibility in parking such as tandem parking, reduced
parking for senior and special needs housing, parking incentives for affordable
developments in order to reduce housing cost, the City’s parking standards do
not unduly constrain the development or affordability of housing.
OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS
To improve the living environment of residential neighborhoods, communities
typically require housing to have a certain amount of open space, such as yards,
common space, and landscaping. In Torrance, open space is reflected in
setbacks and lot coverage requirements, as well as open space ratios. For
single-family homes in the R-1 and R-2 districts, one third of the lot area must
be reserved for open space.
Zones R-P, R-3, R-R-3, and R-3-3 all require half of one square foot to be set
aside for every one square foot of dwelling developed, but the open space need
not exceed 600 square feet for each dwelling unit. At least 50 percent of this
open space must be provided as usable private open space and must therefore
be directly accessible from the dwelling unit. Front yards and enclosed areas
designated for recreational purposes can contribute to a maximum of 25
percent of the open space requirement.
In the RTH and R-4 zones, a standard amount of open space is required for each
dwelling unit, 1,000 square feet per dwelling unit and 300 square feet per
dwelling unit, respectively. In RTH zones, both common and private open space
must be provided, in proportions to be determined by the applicant. The R-4
zone allows roof decks to contribute up to 1/3 of the required open space, and
enclosed areas for recreation may contribute ¼ of the required space.
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                   H-51                              HOUSING ELEMENT

CHAPTER 6:                Housing Element
The High Rise Residential District, R-5, requires open space based on the
number of stories in the development. For buildings with a small number of
stories, the open space requirement is proportionately higher, starting at 6.0
square feet of open space per 1.0 square foot of floor area. A thirteen story
building is required to have an open space ratio of .40, and a 24 story building
requires .26 square feet of open space for each square foot of floor area.
In the Downtown Residential Multiple-Family District, open space is required
dependent on the size of the dwelling unit. For units less than 900 square feet,
250 square feet of open space are required. For units between 901 and 1449
square feet, 500 square feet of open space are required. For units with a total
living area of more than 1450 square feet, 750 square feet of open space is
required. There is no minimum requirement for private open space.
PROVIDING FOR A VARIETY OF HOUSING TYPES
The Land Use Element and Land Use Code contain the basic standards that
allow for the development of a variety of housing types. Torrance’s land use
code development standards are considered standard for suburban communities
in Los Angeles County and Southern California and do not impede the ability to
develop housing at appropriate densities. Table H-33 lists the allowed location
of specific uses. To better facilitate the understanding of housing types
permitted in zones in the City, a matrix of approved uses in residential zones
will be incorporated into the Land Use Code (Program 5).

MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT
Mixed-use development, specifically the integration of residential and
commercial uses, is a familiar housing concept in Torrance. Since the City’s
HOUSING ELEMENT                                               H-52                      CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN

                                                      CHAPTER 6:       Housing Element
inception, Downtown Torrance has incorporated mixed-use in the traditional
style of residential living area above ground-floor commercial uses. The R-P
zone, or Residential Professional District, allows various combinations of
residential and commercial uses, either integrated on a single property or by
proximity on separate properties.
The General Plan Land Use Policy Map provides opportunity for new mixed-use
development in two designations while preserving neighborhoods where mixing
of uses has already occurred. The General Commercial (C-GEN) designation
encourages commercial and office or residential mixed-use developments along
major corridors by allowing a higher intensity of development (1.0 FAR),
compared with solely commercial uses.11 In neighborhoods where
office/business and residential uses are already gradually being combined, the
Residential-Office (R-OF) land use designation will allow the location of small,
less-intense office uses adjacent to residential uses. Residential-Office housing
can include low- to medium-rise apartments or townhouses and condominiums
on smaller lots. Developments that integrate residential and office uses within
one structure will continue to require some form of discretionary review, such
as a conditional use permit. In the former Downtown Redevelopment Project
Area (DRP), densities are based on unit size. Development with units with
living areas less than 700 square feet in size are allowed a density of 43 units
per acre. Development with units with living areas between 700 and 1,500
square feet and over 1,500 square feet are allowed densities of 27 and 21 units
per acre respectively. Senior Housing is permitted at 58 units per acre. These
density parameters are exclusive of density bonuses allowed under State law.
Based on development trends in Downtown Torrance more recent
developments have averaged densities of about 52 units per acre (Table H-41).
SECOND UNITS
As indicated in the above chart, Torrance permits second units consistent with
State law. The ordinance allows for both attached and detached second
residential units to be constructed in the single family residential and multiple-
family residential zones containing no more than one existing single-family
residence. Additional conditions are standard and do not impede the creation of
second units. These conditions include:
         Minimum unit size: 450 SF for studio, 700 SF for 1-bed, 900 SF for 2-
          bed, and 1200 SF for 3-bed
         Maximum unit size: 30 percent of the existing residence if attached, or
          1200 SF if detached
         Only one second dwelling unit permitted on any one lot
11
   Solely commercial developments will be limited to 0.6 FAR.

         garage takes access from a public alley
        One accessible parking space within a private garage for every bedroom
         contained in the second unit, but no less than one space
MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING
Multi-family housing is permitted by right in most residential zones in Torrance.
Two-family units are permitted in the R-2, R-3, R-R-3, R-3-3, R-4, R-5, RTH,
and R-P zones. Apartment houses are permitted in all residential zones, with
the exception of the R-1 and R-2 zones. In addition, residential uses are
conditionally permitted in the C-1 and C-2 zones, allowing convenient access
to transportation and commercial activities to persons living in the commercial
zones. Larger multi-family structures are allowed in both the R-4 and R-5
zones, permitting buildings up to 50 feet in height in the R-4 zone, and up to
24 stories and an FAR of 3.12 in the R-5 zone.
SENIOR CITIZEN HOUSING
Senior Citizen housing (multi-family housing units that are restricted to
persons 55 years or older and that meet the state and federal requirements for
senior housing) is conditionally permitted in all residential and commercial
zones in the City, with the exception of the R-1 and R-2 zones, which do not
permit multi-family housing. The Torrance Municipal Code permits Senior
citizen housing at a density of 58 dwelling units per acre. The City has
established development standards for senior citizen housing related to
minimum units size and open space requirements. Two hundred square feet of
open space is required for each dwelling unit, which is generally less than the
amount required as a standard residential condition. Further, the City
encourages ancillary uses such as laundry, recreation, central cooking facilities,
and a small pharmacy be provided on site to serve the residents needs
especially those with limited mobility. In order to further facilitate housing for
this special needs group, the City has reduced parking requirements for senior
housing to 1 parking space per dwelling unit.
The Torrance Land Use Code allows for conversion of existing detached single-
family residences into supplemental housing for the elderly, subject to a
conditional use permit. The single family residence to which the supplemental
residence unit is added must be owner occupied, and the residence must be
occupied by no more than two persons, one of whom is related to the owner
occupant of the primary residence, and one of whom must be at least 60 years
old.

RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES
The Land Use Code defines residential care facilities as those facilities that are
licensed by the State to provide 24-hour residential care to persons in need of
personal services, supervision, or assistance essential for sustaining the
activities of daily living or for the protection of the individual, excluding jails
and other facilities. Such facilities may provide nursing, dietary and other
personal services, but not surgery or other primary medical treatments such as
are customarily provided in convalescent facilities or hospitals. This
classification includes retirement homes. Consistent with State law, the City
facilitates the development of residential care facilities by treating licensed
facilities that serve six or fewer persons as regular residential uses and
permitting large residential care facilities serving more than six persons in both
the R-P and R-4 zones. The City has not adopted a spacing requirement for
residential care facilities.
EMERGENCY AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING
Emergency shelters, transitional shelters, and single-room occupancy units are
allowed in the City based on the type and character of development. Emergency
shelters provide short-term shelter for homeless persons. Transitional housing
provides longer term housing (up to two years), coupled with supportive
services such as job training and counseling to individuals and families who are
transitioning to permanent housing.
The Torrance Land Use Code does not currently reference either type of housing
directly. Siting for emergency and transitional housing is based on the character
of development (residential, commercial, etc.), not the population these
developments serve. Consistent with State law, small transitional housing
serving six or fewer people is considered a regular residential use and permitted
in all zones where residential uses are permitted. Transitional housing for more
than seven people and operated as a residential care facility is permitted in both
the R-P and R-4 zones. Transitional housing that functions as a regular multi-
family use (such as apartments) is permitted where multi-family uses are
permitted.
Emergency and transitional housing may also be treated as a hotel or motel use
based on the character of development, and as such are conditionally permitted
in the General Commercial (C-2), Solely Commercial (C-3), and Conditional
Commercial (C-5) zones.
To facilitate the development of emergency housing and comply with State
law12, the City’s Land Use Code will be amended to accommodate emergency

   On October 15, 2007, the State of California Governor signed into law Senate Bill 2
which amends GC Sections 65582, 65583, and 65589.5 of the State Housing Element
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                      H-55                                HOUSING ELEMENT

CHAPTER 6:             Housing Element
shelters (Program 6). Conditions for approval of emergency shelters consistent
with State law will be clearly specified in the Land Use Code. While this
program was originally meant to be implemented during the 2008-2014
planning period, financial limitations precluded the City from initiating a
comprehensive Land Use Code update in which this program would be
addressed. The City recently allocated funding for the update and has initiated
the program, with the work plan to occur in 2013-2014. The City is committed
to addressing State law as it pertains to Senate Bill 2 (SB2) and is working to
complete the SB2 implementing program.
Included in the Housing Plan, Program 6 will facilitate the development of
emergency housing and comply with State law by amending the City’s Land
Use Code to identify a zone in which to permit emergency shelters by right.
Conditions for approval of emergency shelters will be clearly specified in the
Land Use Code, and will be similar to conditions required for similar uses. The
City will evaluate the M-213 zone for inclusion of emergency homeless shelters
by right. The M-2 zone encompasses 2,273 acres and is comprised of a variety
of industrial uses. Specific uses range from refineries to office buildings and
accessory commercial uses. The heaviest industrial uses are related to oil
refinery operations. However, the majority of land zoned for M-2 is outside of
refinery operations. The Torrance Municipal Airport is also located in the M-2
zone. Combined, the refineries and the airport comprise less than half (940
acres) of the M-2 zone. The remaining acreage is defined by lower intensity
industrial uses and accessory commercial uses. This area (exclusive of the
airport and refineries), approximately 1,333 acres, is substantial in size and can
easily accommodate the identified homeless need (88 unsheltered individuals14).
The average lot size in the M-2 zone outside of refinery operations is two to
four acres. There are four identified vacant parcels located in the M-2 zone
ranging in size from one to 23 acres, with an average size of 9.7 acres.
Opportunities for homeless shelter siting also exists in developments that can
accommodate tenants in large, ready-to-occupy spaces that would be
appropriate for reuse as a homeless shelter. The area is well served by major
regional transportation as the City’s industrial areas are adjacent or very near
major regional corridors.
Based on the amount of available industrial land, vacant properties, range of lot
sizes available, and opportunities for adaptive reuse of existing buildings, the
Law. This legislation requires local jurisdictions to strengthen provisions for addressing
the housing needs of the homeless, including the identification of a zone or zones
where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use
permit. This legislation took effect January 1, 2008 and will apply to jurisdictions with
housing elements due June 30, 2008 and after.

zone has sufficient capacity to accommodate the identified homeless need (88
persons) in at least one year-round shelter.
SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY FACILITIES
Single-room occupancy (SRO) buildings house people in single rooms with
tenants often sharing bathrooms and kitchens. SROs are conditionally
permitted as hotels or motels in the General Commercial (C-2), Solely
Commercial (C-3), and Conditional Commercial (C-5) zones of the City. Several
SROs are located within the City including one in Downtown area that is part
of a mixed-use development. The private property owners have undertaken
several rehabilitation projects to preserve and improve existing SRO units.
MANUFACTURED AND MOBILE HOMES
Manufactured housing is permitted by right on all lots which permit single
family houses, pursuant to State law. Mobile homes and mobile home parks
developments (termed trailer court and trailer parks in the Torrance Land Use
Code) are conditionally permitted in the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-R-3, R-4, R-P, C-1
and C-2 zones. In addition, mobile homes developments can be permitted as a
temporary use in the M-1 and M-2 zones.
FARMWORKER HOUSING
As indicated in the Community Needs Assessment there are only 107 Torrance
residents that held “Farming, Forestry, and Fishing” occupations, according to
the 2010 U.S. Census American Community Survey. These persons are most
likely employed in plant nurseries, landscaping, or gardening companies, as City
records indicate that there are no agricultural operations in Torrance. However,
the City does permit agricultural uses, including flower and vegetable gardens,
orchards, the raising of tree crops, berry or bush crops, for the purpose of
propagation, culture, or wholesaling, in many zones including:
         Light Agricultural (A-1)
         Single Family Residential (R-1)
         Two Family Residential (R-2)
         Limited Multiple Family Residential (R-3)
         Three Unit Multiple Family Residential (R-3-3)
         Unlimited Multiple Family Residential (R-4)
         Residential Professional (R-P)
         Residential Townhome (RTH)
In addition, orchards are permitted to locate within the C-1 and C-2 zones.
Very little land in the City is zoned A-1, limited to the Southern California
Edison Easement and a portion of vacant land in the southern hillside region.
For any agricultural uses in the City, the City will comply with the State

CHAPTER 6:             Housing Element
Employee Housing Act (Section 17000 of the Health and Safety Code) that
allows employee/farmworker housing in zones allowing agricultural uses.
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING
In a supportive housing development, housing can be coupled with social
services such as job training, alcohol and drug abuse programs, and case
management for populations in need of assistance, such as the homeless, those
suffering from mental illness or substance abuse problems, and the elderly or
medically frail. A supportive housing development in the form of a residential
care facility serving six of fewer persons is treated as a residential use,
consistent with State law, but is subject to development standards for the
zoning district in which it is located. Similarly, supportive housing that
functions as an apartment would be treated as such in the permitting process.
Large supportive housing developments that function like an apartment are
processed in the same manner as other types of large multi-family
developments. Supportive housing for the mentally disabled, drug and alcohol
rehabilitation facilities, rest homes, convalescent homes, and nursing homes are
all permitted with a conditional use permit.
SPECIFIC PLAN AREA
The Hawthorne Boulevard Corridor Specific Plan, adopted in July 1996 was
developed to guide municipal and private actions within the Hawthorne
Boulevard Corridor to spur development, increase the City’s retail tax base, and
provide for the maintenance and beautification of the City’s major commercial
corridor.
The Specific Plan provides for seven land use sub-districts along Hawthorne
Boulevard: the North Torrance Sub-District (NT), Promenade Sub-District (PR),
Del Amo Business Sub-District One (DA-1), Del Amo Business Sub-District
Two (DA-2), Meadow Park Sub-District (MP), the Hawthorne Boulevard/Pacific
Coast Highway Intersection Area Sub-District (H/PCH), and the Walteria Sub-
District (W). Each of these sub-districts has a list of uses that are permitted by
right and related development standards. Mixed-use developments that
incorporate residential units are conditionally permitted in all sub-districts,
excluding the H/PCH sub-district. In addition, both multi-family residential
development (with a minimum density of 27 units/acre) and senior citizen
housing developments are conditionally permitted in the DA-1 and DA-2
zones.
DENSITY BONUS
Consistent with State law (SB1818), developers in Torrance can receive density
bonuses of 20 to 35 percent, depending on the amount and type of affordable
housing provided, and "concessions", exceptions from normally applicable
zoning and other development standards. The State density bonus provisions

have not been incorporated into the City’s Land Use Code. State density bonus
provisions were applied to a 44-unit affordable, mixed-use, workforce housing
development in Downtown Torrance. The development provides 43 units
affordable to very low and low income households.

Developers may seek a waiver or modification of development standards that
have the effect of precluding the construction of a housing development
meeting the density bonus criteria. The developer must show that the waiver or
modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible.
State density bonus regulations also include incentives and concessions. A
developer can receive an incentive or concession based on the proportion of
affordable units for target groups. Incentives or concessions may include, but
are not limited to, a reduction in setback and square footage requirements and
a reduction in the ratio of vehicular parking spaces that would otherwise be
required that results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost
reductions.
BUILDING CODES AND ENFORCEMENT
The City of Torrance has adopted the California Building Code (CBC), which
establishes standards and requires inspections at various stages of construction
to ensure code compliance. The City’s building code also requires new
residential construction to comply with the federal American Disabilities Act
(ADA) standards, which specifies that a minimum percentage of dwelling units
in new developments must be fully accessible to the physically disabled.
Amendments to the CBC have been related to administrative procedures, fire
safety requirements, and geological standards. While the incorporation of these
measures may raise housing construction costs, these standards are necessary
to provide access to homes for people with disabilities and to ensure a safe
living environment for the community. Further, the CBC is adopted by many
cities throughout California and does not, in general, pose a constraint to
residential development.

CHAPTER 6:            Housing Element
The City uses a building code and a Land Use (zoning) code enforcement
program to help maintain the quality of residential neighborhoods. The
Environmental Section of the Community Development Department is
responsible for the enforcement of City zoning and land use codes, property
maintenance and nuisance codes (both community noise and airport noise
codes) and the Building Division is responsible for the enforcement of
unpermitted buildings. The program allows residents to report conditions in
their neighborhoods. Code enforcement staff will generally respond by making a
site inspection to determine if there is a violation and if there is, notice will be
given to the resident that explains what needs to be done to correct the
violation. While assessing the complaint, the City will also do a cursory
inspection of the immediate area.
The Torrance Municipal Code sets the standards for enforcement, and the
Environmental Section uses education, enforcement, and dispute mediation to
ensure that these standards are maintained. The Code includes property
maintenance, nuisance abatement, and vacant building/lot ordinances (Sections
92.32.1, 92.35.1, and 92.38.1) that establish standards of home and property
maintenance practices and provide a legal basis for enforcement of the
ordinance by code enforcement staff. The ordinances require property owners to
keep their housing units in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition.
The City had two home rehabilitation programs in place to assist homeowners
and property owners. The Low-Interest Home Rehabilitation Loan Program and
the No-Interest Home Rehabilitation Deferred Loan Program were available to
qualified homeowners and owners of rental property to rehabilitate dwelling
units in need of repair. Due to loss of redevelopment funding, these programs
have been suspended for the time being. The City also participates in the Home
Improvement Program administered by the Workforce Investment Network
Partners, which provides home repairs for low-income seniors and disabled
residents. City code enforcement staff works closely to refer residents that may
not be able to complete needed repairs on their own.
ON- AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS
Site improvements are a necessary component of the new development process.
Improvements include the laying of sewer, water, and streets for use by the
community, and these improvements make the development feasible. Most
residential areas in Torrance are served with infrastructure due to the built-out
nature of the City. For new residential development, additions to existing
residences, or residential conversions, the following site improvements are
typically required: resident and guest parking, paved vehicular and pedestrian
circulation areas, private and common open space, landscaping, trash
enclosure, and private storage areas. Required street widths vary depending on
the category of street on which the development is located. Right-of-way
standards are consistent with those established by the General Plan:

      Exterior lighting
      Stormwater drainage facilities
      Fire suppression apparatus and fire exits
      Water pressure apparatus – related to fire safety and water quality
      ADA accessibility requirements
      Service utilities, sidewalk and property lighting – more common for
          larger developments
      Necessary Sewer Improvements – staff experience indicates that this is
          more common for larger developments and due to the infill nature of
          development in Torrance is not as common.
      Necessary street and traffic enhancements– this is more prevalent in
          commercial development and very large residential developments.
      Curb, gutter, sidewalk facilities
      Alley and alley drain reconstruction – applies to developments with
          alleys.
In Torrance, improvements required of new developments are mostly related to
basic site function that allow for use/habitation and address health and safety
considerations. The City provides flexibility in many cases. In cases where site
improvements pose a hardship and or a request is made for a modification, City
staff can work with the applicant to identify alternatives to satisfying the
improvement requirement in the pre-application or plan check process. The City
provides greater flexibility on improvements not directly related to safety and
health issues (fire, basic site necessities such as utility connections).
Developments using the State density bonus provisions may benefit from the
concession/incentive requirements of SB 1818 that require localities to offer up
to three concessions/incentives (including incentive or concession proposed by

either party that results in an “identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost
reductions”15) based on the percentage of targeted units.
FEES AND EXACTIONS
The City of Torrance charges planning and development fees to process and
review permits for residential developments. These application and development
review fees help offset the cost of processing a particular type of case. The City
has designed its fees to recoup City costs associated with review and approval
of proposed projects while not unduly constraining the financial feasibility and
development of market rate and affordable housing. The fees are adjusted
annually based on the Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers Price Index for
the Southern California region. Fees charged in Torrance are, in general,
comparable to those of surrounding communities in Los Angeles County. A
survey of neighboring jurisdictions (Carson, Gardena, and Redondo Beach)
indicates that permit fees in Torrance are slightly higher for General Plan
amendments, zone changes, and variances.
Multiple family developments not requiring any discretionary approval (which
do not exceed established development standards) would not be subject to any
planning fees and would only be subject to applicable building permit, plan
check, and inspection fees which are based on project valuation (approximately
$5,178 in fees for building permit and plan check on a development with a
$400,000 value plus an energy fee and a handicap fee at $1,828 each), in
addition to development impact fees normally associated with residential
construction (effective July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013).

The City also charges a limited number of impact fees to ensure that services
and infrastructure are in place to serve the planned developments. Although
impact fees and requirements for offsite improvements add to the cost of
housing, these fees and requirements are necessary to maintain the quality of
life within a community. Torrance’s impact fees include a dwelling unit fee,
park fees, and school fees. Los Angeles County provides sewer to the City, and
charges a related sewer connection fee. The dwelling unit fees is applied to pay
a portion of the costs identified for public facilities used for transportation
services, the undergrounding of utilities, sewer and storm drain facilities, and
police and fire services. Phase I DIF (Utility Underground, Transportation, Storm
Drain, Sewer) went into effect in 2005. Phase II DIF (Fire, Police) went into
effect in 2007. Single-family residences are exempt from DIF. The fee for multi-
family construction is $2,094.04 per unit (sewer portion is $21.83 per
unit). The fees are intended to provide funds to recoup the cost of providing
infrastructure to the developments, while not unduly constraining the
feasibility of both market-rate and affordable housing.

Fees charged in Torrance are comparable to, and even less than, those of
surrounding communities in Los Angeles County. A 2012 National Impact Fee
Survey surveyed 37 California jurisdictions and estimated an average total
impact fee of $31,014 for single family residences and $18,807 for multi-family
units within the state. The same study included two Los Angeles County
jurisdictions, Lancaster and Long Beach.
The chart below indicates that Torrance’s impact fees are substantially less than
both of these other cities. In Torrance, typical impact fees for multi-family
developments are just under $8,200 per unit. While impact fees and connection
fees contribute to development costs, the fees are necessary to provide sewer
service to the developments, and provide adequate funding to maintain the
City’s parks and schools.
The affordable costs of development fees in the City are an incentive to
development as they are also lower than similar neighboring cities. The City
Council has the discretion to waive a portion or all of the application fees for a
project. The Community Development Director also has some discretion in
waiving building permit fees and development impact fees. Staff records
indicate that the City has deferred developer-responsible improvements to help
with project feasibility.

PROCESSING AND PERMIT PROCEDURES
The development review process is an important tool that helps ensure that
new housing meets all necessary health and safety codes and is supplied with
all necessary utilities and infrastructure. Yet, the development review process
HOUSING ELEMENT                                      H-64                      CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN

can also constrain opportunities for the development of lower income housing,
particularly through the indirect cost of time in the process and the direct cost
in fees.
The Community Development Department is the lead agency in processing
residential development applications, and as appropriate, coordinates the
processing of these applications with other City departments and agencies. The
City uses various development permits to ensure quality housing while
minimizing the costs associated with lengthy reviews, and provides a
procedural guide to facilitate the submittal process.
Development processing times for residential projects vary according to the
complexity of the proposal, but are relatively short and expeditious due to
streamlined procedures. Single-family homes generally are allowed by right and
simply require a building permit. This is true as well for rental duplexes or
multiple-family projects that meet specified development standards. For-sale
multiple-family housing, and two-unit or multiple-family housing that exceed
certain development thresholds require Planning Commission review.
Guidance on projects that require discretionary review is provided through
established development standards and design guidelines in City documents.
For example, developers of projects within the Hawthorne Boulevard Specific
Plan area that trigger discretionary review can refer to the City’s Hawthorne
Boulevard Specific Plan, which includes clearly written and detailed standards
and guidelines.      These standards and guidelines provide developers a
comprehensive template for designing their projects to ensure maximum
compatibility in the design stage, before an application is formally submitted to
the City and subject to further review. Designs of projects within the
parameters of established specific plans, standards and other guidelines, help
ease the review process and reduce processing time.
From submittal to Planning Commission hearing, a subdivision request (Tract
Map or Parcel Map) takes on average 10 to 12 weeks. Other zoning
entitlements required for the project are processed concurrently with the
subdivision request. A project that requires a Variance, Zone Change, or
General Plan Amendment adds about four to six weeks to the process.
Additionally, while Building Permits generally take four to six weeks to process,
applicants have the option to pay an expedited plan check fee which can
significantly reduce processing time.

Processing times may be substantially longer if an environmental impact report
(EIR) is required for a project. However, processing time relative to
environmental review has been reduced substantially in recent years. Prior to
1998, environmental review was conducted in a separate process involving an
Environmental Review Board and separate public hearings and notification.
Decisions by the Board could be appealed to City Council, allowing for several
public hearings only on the environmental issues separate from consideration of
the development issues relative to the project. This process could add two to
three months to the review process, and that is without public controversy. In
the interest of reducing processing times and fees, the Environmental Review
Board was eliminated and its duties transferred to the Planning Commission.
Combined environmental and project review has shortened the review process
on average by two months.
COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT
The Hillside and Local Coastal Overlay Zone in the City of Torrance consists of
104 acres of land, which lie west of Palos Verdes Boulevard, north of the City of
Palos Verdes Estates and Rolling Hills Estates, and south of the City of Redondo
Beach. The Coastal Zone is almost entirely developed with well-established and
well-maintained residential properties, both multi-family and single family
dwellings.
In 2008, the housing stock in the Coastal Zone consisted of 1,076 units. City
building permit records and planning applications indicate that no new units
(SFR or MFR) have been approved for construction in the Coastal Zone since
2008. Two existing single-family units were demolished and rebuilt. The
housing stock includes 170 single family units, 28 planned development units,
152 condominiums, 100 duplex/triplex/quadplex, and 626 apartment units.
There is one vacant residential parcel. The balance of the Coastal Zone
encompasses 13.3 acres of Public Use (beach and parkland) and 3.5 acres of
Commercial Center designated properties.
California Government Code Section 65588(c) requires each periodic revision of
the Housing Element to include the following information relating to housing in
the Coastal Zone: a) the number of new housing units approved for
construction within the coastal zone since January 1, 1982; b) the number of

housing units for persons and families of low or moderate income required to
be provided in new housing developments either within the coastal zone or
within three miles of the coastal zone as a replacement for the conversion or
demolition of existing coastal units occupied by low or moderate income
persons; c) the number of existing residential units occupied by persons and
families of low or moderate income that have been authorized to be demolished
or converted since January 1, 1982 in the coastal zone; and d) the number of
residential units for persons and families of low or moderate income that have
been required for replacement units.
Since 1982, 58 new residential units have been constructed in the Coastal
Zone. Since 2000, 25 units have been constructed/approved, including a 23-
unit mixed-use development project and a two-unit condominium project. The
majority of residential areas in the coastal zone are single family in nature and
very stable (limited development activity). The units involved are not subject to
the replacement requirements. The City has no formal inclusionary housing
policy for the coastal area.
HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Pursuant to State law, Torrance permits state-licensed residential care facilities
serving six or fewer persons in all of its residential zoning districts by right. In
addition, several housing types for persons with disabilities require a CUP that
is no more stringent than those for other conditional uses. For example, large
community care facilities with more than six persons are permitted by right in
the R-4 zone. Large community care facilities are also permitted in the R-P
zone, subject to Planning Commission review.
The City has adopted the 2010 California Building Code. Standards within the
Code include provisions to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities.
These standards are consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act. No
local amendments that would constrain accessibility or increase the cost of
housing for persons with disabilities have been adopted. To accommodate
disabled persons in public facilities, the City defers to Title 24 of the California
Handicap Accessibility Code.
The definition of “family” may limit access to housing for persons with
disabilities when municipalities narrowly define the word, illegally limiting the
development of group homes for persons with disabilities, but not for housing
similar sized and situated families. “Family,” as defined by the Torrance
Municipal Code, is
     a) One person living alone; or
     b) Two or more persons related by blood, adoption or marriage, living and
          cooking together as a single housekeeping unit, exclusive of household
          servants, and one or two additional persons forming part of such single
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                    H-67                                HOUSING ELEMENT

CHAPTER 6:             Housing Element
          housekeeping units who are non-paying guests of such related persons;
          or
     c) Two adults and their dependents living and cooking together as a single
          housekeeping unit; or
     d) Three persons living and cooking together as a single housekeeping unit
          though not related to each other by blood or marriage, exclusive of
          household servants; or
     e) Four or more unrelated persons living and cooking together as a single
          housekeeping unit for which a waiver has been obtained as provided in
          Article 2 of Chapter 4 of this Division (Section 94.2.1. et seq.).
     f) Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit foster homes licensed in
          accordance with Section 31.7.3. of this Code.
While the Land Use Code does differentiate between related and unrelated
persons, both are considered “families” under the definition. Further, the
definition does not specify the maximum number of persons which would
reasonably be considered a family, and therefore does not restrict the ability of
residential care facilities to site in the City of Torrance. However, the City’s
definition of “family” is outdated and may impede development in some
situations. While the City intended for this change to be implemented during
the 2008-2014 planning period, financial limitations precluded the City from
initiating a Land Use Code update in which this change would be addressed.
The City recently allocated funding for the update and will complete the
program in 2013-2014 (Program 12).
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
The Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, requires that cities and counties
provide reasonable accommodation to rules, policies, practices and procedures
where such accommodation may be necessary to afford individuals with
disabilities equal housing opportunities. While fair housing laws intend that all
people have equal access to housing, the law also recognizes that people with
disabilities may need extra tools to achieve equality. Reasonable
accommodation is one of the tools intended to further housing opportunities
for people with disabilities. For developers and providers of housing for people
with disabilities who are often confronted with siting or use restrictions,
reasonable accommodation provides a means of requesting from the local
government flexibility in the application of land use and zoning regulations or,
in some instances, even a waiver of certain restrictions or requirements because
it is necessary to achieve equal access to housing. Cities and counties are
required to consider requests for accommodations related to housing for people
with disabilities and provide the accommodation when it is determined to be
“reasonable” based on fair housing laws and the case law interpreting the
statutes.
State law allows for a statutorily based four-part analysis to be used in
evaluating requests for reasonable accommodation related to land use and
HOUSING ELEMENT                                    H-68                     CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN

zoning matters and can be incorporated into reasonable accommodation
procedures. This analysis gives great weight to furthering the housing needs of
people with disabilities and also considers the impact or effect of providing the
requested accommodation on the City and its overall zoning scheme.
Developers and providers of housing for people with disabilities must be ready
to address each element of the following four-part analysis:
         The housing that is the subject of the request for reasonable
          accommodation is for people with disabilities as defined in federal or
          state fair housing laws;
         The reasonable accommodation requested is necessary to make specific
          housing available to people with disabilities who are protected under
          fair housing laws;
         The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or
          administrative burden on the local government; and
         The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental
          alteration in the local zoning code.
To create a process for making requests for reasonable accommodation to land
use and zoning decisions and procedures regulating the siting, funding,
development and use of housing for people with disabilities the City will create
and adopt a reasonable accommodation procedure and provide information to
residents via their public counters and website (Program 11). While this
program was originally meant to be implemented during the 2008-2014
planning period, financial limitations precluded the City from initiating a
comprehensive Land Use Code update in which this program would be
addressed. The City has allocated funding for the update and will complete the
program in 2013-2014. The City is committed to complying with the Fair
Housing Act and is working to complete the reasonable accommodation
implementing program.
2.2.2              MARKET CONSTRAINTS
Many factors that relate to housing costs are related to the larger housing
market in general. Land costs, construction costs, and labor costs all contribute
to the cost of housing, and can hinder the production of affordable housing.
Additionally, the availability of financing can limit access to homeownership for
some low-income households. Market-related constraints are part of regional
trends related to housing and local jurisdictions seldom have any control over
these.
CONSTRUCTION COSTS
Construction costs for housing can vary significantly, depending on the type of
housing, such as single-family, townhomes, and apartments. However, even
within a particular building type, construction costs vary by unit size and
amenities. Furthermore, neighborhood resistance to some developments
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                     H-69                            HOUSING ELEMENT

CHAPTER 6:             Housing Element
lengthens development time, driving up the holding costs. The difficulty of
developing awkward infill sites can also add to costs. Another factor related to
construction costs is the number of units built at one time. As the number
increase, overall costs generally decrease as builders can benefit from the
economies of scale.
LAND COST
Land is perhaps the major variable cost component in producing new housing.
A very limited amount of vacant land is available in mostly built-out Torrance.
Land costs may vary depending on whether the site is vacant or has an existing
use that must be removed. Similarly, site constraints such as environmental
issues (steep slopes, soil stability, seismic hazards, or flooding) can also be
factored into the cost of land. The cost of land in Torrance and surrounding
cities has risen substantially due to a decrease in the availability of vacant or
otherwise developable land in the South Bay area. The high cost of land is a
contributing factor to the lack of affordable housing in all of Southern California.
LABOR COST
The California Labor Code applies prevailing wage rates to public works projects
exceeding $1,000 in value. Public works projects include construction,
alteration, installation, demolition, or repair work performed under contract and
paid for in whole or in part out of public funds. State law exempts affordable
housing projects from the prevailing wage requirement if they are financially
assisted with only redevelopment housing set-aside funds. However, if other
public funds are involved, which is often the case, prevailing wage rates may
still be triggered. While the cost differential in prevailing and standard wages
varies based on the skill level of the occupation, prevailing wages tend to add to
the overall cost of development. In the case of affordable housing projects,
prevailing wage requirements could effectively reduce the number of affordable
units that can be achieved with public subsidies.
HOME FINANCING
The availability of financing for a home greatly affects a person’s ability to
purchase a home or invest in repairs and improvements. The Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires lending institutions to disclose information on
the disposition of loan applications by income, gender, and race/ethnicity of
applicants.
Table H-39 presents the disposition of home purchase loan applications in
2011 by income of the applicants. The data is for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-
Glendale Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), of which Torrance is a part. The
data includes purchases of 1 to 4 unit homes as well as manufactured homes.
Over 62 percent of the loan applications were received from above moderate-
income households (earning greater than 120 percent of Median Family Income

income households (less than 80 percent MFI) accounted for 19 percent and 15
percent, respectively. (Income data was unavailable for some of the applicants.)
Origination refers to loans approved by the lender and accepted by the
applicant. The overall loan origination rate was over 62 percent, and this rate
decreased as income decreased.

2.2.3              ENVIRONMENTAL
CONSTRAINTS
Torrance has several environmental constraints that affect potential
development. These constraints are due to endangered species and sensitive
habitat, heightened seismic activity, noise levels in excess of City standards,
potential mineral extraction facilities, and other constraints which preclude or
restrict the development of housing. This section briefly outlines these
constraints.
ENDANGERED SPECIES AND SENSITIVE HABITAT
Torrance contains few areas were native habitat hosts endangered or sensitive
species, as most of the City’s open space is developed as programmed urban
parks. Torrance has one significant resource to the natural habitat of Southern
California, the Madrona Marsh, which was established as a permanent
ecological preserve in 1986. The Marsh is a remnant of a natural vernal wetland
sustained by a historic drainage basin that no longer exists. The Marsh covers
approximately eleven acres within a larger open space preserve area; the balance
of the area is sandy upland and wetland, all of which has been designated by
Los Angeles County as a Significant Ecological Area. Vernal marshes are distinct
in that they flood during the rainy season and dry out after the rainy season has
passed. This wetland regime produces a unique ecosystem, and its significance
is evidenced by the diversity of life that resides there. This 42-plus acre site is
home to over 110 species of plants, over 65 families of insects, two amphibian
species, three species of reptiles, about 160 types of birds, and at least four
mammal species. The Marsh, dedicated as an ecological preserve, cannot be
developed for urban uses.

CHAPTER 6:            Housing Element
SEISMIC ACTIVITY
The potential for seismic activity and ground shaking in Torrance depends on
the proximity to the affected fault and the intensity of the seismic event along
the fault. Since Torrance is close to multiple fault zones, movement along any
of the zones has the potential of adversely affecting the City. The highest risks
from earthquake fault zones come from the Palos Verdes fault zone, the Puente
Hills fault, the Newport-Inglewood fault zone, the Elysian Park fault zone, the
Malibu Coast-Santa Monica-Hollywood fault zone, and the Whittier fault zone.
As of 2011, no Aquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones had been designated
within the Torrance city limits. However, if the Palos Verdes fault were ever
zoned as an active fault, then an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone would
include a southern portion of Torrance.
The City has a mandatory retrofit seismic ordinance that was adopted in 1987,
applicable to the most susceptible building type to earthquake damage,
unreinforced masonry. The City used subsidies to bring almost all of the older
buildings into compliance with the City’s mandatory strengthening
requirements.
MINERAL EXTRACTION
According to the State Mining and Geology Board, the majority of land within
Torrance is classified as MRZ-1 (no significant mineral deposits are likely) and
MRZ-3 (significance of mineral deposits cannot be determined). A small strip of
land within the City is designated as MRZ-2, indicating that significant mineral
deposits are present or likely to be present. The area is located south of Pacific
Coast Highway, and roughly east of Hawthorne Boulevard.
The classification system is intended to ensure consideration of statewide or
regionally significant mineral deposits by the City in planning and development
administration. These mineral resource designations are intended to prevent
incompatible land use development on areas determined to have significant
mineral resource deposits.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
The City promotes energy conservation through the implementation of State of
California Title 24 building code energy performance requirements. Title 24
measures require, for example, minimum ceiling, wall, and raised floor
insulation, and minimum heating, ventilating, air conditioning and water
heating equipment efficiencies. The City also recognizes the role of sustainable
building practices in achieving energy efficiency, and is home to one of the
largest and most publicized examples of green building, the Toyota
headquarters building. The City will undertake a phased approach to adopting
green building practices through public education and recognition as the key to
implementing green building design and construction on a wide scale. Multiple

sustainability and energy conservation measures are identified in General Plan
Appendix A: Implementation Programs.
2.2.4             INFRASTRUCTURE
CONSTRAINTS
Another factor adding to the cost of new construction is the provision of
adequate infrastructure: major and local streets; curbs, gutters, and sidewalks;
water and sewer lines; storm drains; and street lighting. All of these
improvements are required to be provided—either as upgrades or new
infrastructure—in conjunction with new development. In most cases, these
improvements are dedicated to the City, which is then responsible for their
maintenance. The cost of these facilities is borne by developers, added to the
cost of new housing units, and eventually passed on to the homebuyer or
property owner. Given the fully urbanized character of Torrance, public
infrastructure and services are available at all the sites included in the inventory.
Potable water is provided to the majority of the City by the Torrance Municipal
Water Department (TMWD), with two smaller areas served by the Rancho
Dominguez and Hermosa-Redondo Districts of the California Water Service
Company (CWS). TMWD forecasts indicate that sufficient existing and
projected water supplies are available to meet the demands of the development
levels projected in the General Plan .
The Public Works Department maintains local sewer and storm drainage
systems. The Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County (LACSD) is the regional
agency responsible for the collection and treatment of wastewater. The nearest
wastewater treatment facility to Torrance is the Joint Water Pollution Control
Plant (JWPCP) in Carson. The design capacity of the JWPCP is greater than the
facility’s current wastewater flows. There is sufficient wastewater treatment
capacity for the increase in wastewater that projected development levels on
the General Plan would generate .
With utility and services system providers coordinating their planning and
construction consistent with General Plan land use policy, future needs,
including the 2014-2021 RHNA, can be met.

3. HOUSING RESOURCES
The resources available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of
housing in Torrance are addressed in this section of the Housing Element. This
section provides an overview of available land resources and residential sites for
future housing development, and evaluates how these resources can work
toward satisfying future housing needs. Also discussed are the financial and
administrative resources available to support affordable housing and energy
conservation opportunities.
3.1 AVAILABILITY OF SITES
          FOR HOUSING
3.1.1             REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
ALLOCATION (RHNA)
State law requires that a community provide an adequate number of sites to
allow for and facilitate production of the regional share of housing. To
determine whether a jurisdiction has sufficient land to accommodate its share
of regional housing needs for all income groups, that jurisdiction must identify
“adequate sites.” Under State law (California Government Code section
65583[c][1]), adequate sites are those with appropriate zoning and
development standards, with services and facilities, needed to facilitate and
encourage the development of a variety of housing for all income levels.
Torrance’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for the 2014-2021
planning period has been determined by SCAG to be 1,450 housing units,
including 380 units for very low-income households, 227 units for low-income
households, 243 units for moderate-income households, and 600 units for
above moderate-income households.

CHAPTER 6:             Housing Element
RESIDENTIAL SITES INVENTORY
The analysis below indicates that the 2014-2021 RHNA can be accommodated
by the Land Use Element Land Use Plan and based on the availability of vacant
and underutilized land.
SITES INVENTORY CONSIDERATIONS
Realistic Densities
For the purpose of this Housing Element, calculations of realistic capacity
assume that properties (excluding developments on Downtown Torrance) will
achieve a density that is 75 percent of the maximum allowed density. This
reduction accounts for applicable land use controls and site requirements and
takes into consideration recent development trends in Torrance. However, this
average density should not be construed as a result of the City’s development
standards. Oftentimes, developers choose not to exhaust available resources to
maximize their development, or the failure to maximize the development is due
to inefficient site plan and architectural design. Finally, achievable density on a
property is often influenced by how much a developer is willing to spend on a
development, which is beyond the discretion of the local agency. In a tight
housing market, achieving maximum density is financially feasible because the
developer is able to recuperate the investment even at high density products
that do not usually command the highest market value.
Densities in Downtown Torrance
The realistic capacity for mixed use development in Downtown Torrance is
based on a density of 31 units per acre. The 31 units per acre density is a
conservative estimate based on historical patterns of residential development in
the Downtown. More recent mixed-use and residential development in the
Downtown area has achieved densities of over 100 units per acre with an
average of 52 units per acre (Table H-41). Based on this substantial
development history in Downtown Torrance, the assumption that new mixed-
use development may occur at densities of at least 31 units per acre represents
a realistic and reasonable assumption.

the commercial component yield a total density of 55 units per acre.
VACANT LAND
State law requires that jurisdictions demonstrate in the housing element that
the land inventory is adequate to accommodate that jurisdiction’s share of the
region’s projected growth. The inventory of vacant residential land in Torrance
totals 30.7 acres. Based on this inventory, it is clear that the City is close to
built out, with limited opportunities for development on vacant land. These
vacant properties, identified in Table H-42, have the potential to yield 159
units, 118 of which can facilitate lower-income housing, as defined by State
law.16

 Note: Potential Dwelling Units do not reflect straight application of maximum density to vacant land. The number of dwelling units
 has been reduced to reflect expected densities and physical site conditions, such as steep slopes. Expected densities are consistent
 with the Land Use Element.
 *Assumes a mixed use development (allowed in the General Commercial designation). CR allows 58 units per acre, C-2 allows R-3
 uses, and R-3 allows up to 27 du/ac; R-4 uses are allowed in the C-3 zone and R-4 allows 31-44 du/ac.
PROJECTED SECOND UNITS
Building permit records from 2008 to 2011 indicate that permits have been
issued for an average of four second units per year. Based on a conservative
extrapolation of this figure, the City conservatively projects that approximately
24 new second units will be developed during the 2014-2021 planning period
(three per year). These units are anticipated to be affordable to low- and
moderate-income persons given their comparable size and rent relative to
efficiency/studio units in Torrance (approximately $500-$1,500 per month). In
Torrance, second units can provide smaller (and less expensive) housing in a
way that disperses new housing throughout the community and blends in well
with existing community character. Second units can be a valuable addition to
Torrance’s housing stock, serving as a resource for seniors aging out of their
homes and for multi-generational accommodations—issues that have been
raised by the community. As indicated in the Constraints section of this
Housing Element, Torrance permits second units consistent with State law. The
ordinance allows for both attached and detached second residential units to be
constructed in the single-family residential zones, as well as multiple-family
residential zones where a lot contains no more than one existing single-family
residence.
RECYCLABLE LAND
In addition to vacant sites, future housing units can be accommodated on
underutilized lots currently developed at less than the maximum permitted
density. Given the scarcity of developable land in Torrance, most residential
construction in the City has involved infill development on underutilized
properties. The sites most suitable for recycling and reuse are located
throughout the City, and are identified in the Land Use Element study areas,
meaning that the City has identified specific locations where a change in use or
intensity is desired (see discussion below). In addition additional sites
throughout the City are included as many of these areas are intended for high
density development yet the sites are developed with single family homes. In
the Downtown area, commercial properties with potential to redevelop to
mixed-use are also identified. These areas offer the opportunity for development
on contiguous sites at the appropriate densities to accommodate lower income
housing. Due to the scarcity of developable vacant land in the City, these
HOUSING ELEMENT                                               H-78                          CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN

properties offer an economic incentive to the property owner to develop at
higher densities. Recycling to higher-intensity uses is very probable given that
the scarcity of developable vacant land in Torrance makes higher-density
development most cost effective in these higher density areas.
The analysis of residentially zoned land reveals that underutilized residential
properties in Torrance have the potential for development of at least 1,386
dwelling units on properties with appropriate densities to facilitate lower-
income housing.
The City acknowledges that small lot development may be more difficult; thus,
the City has included only those smaller properties that have the potential for
sufficient added capacity to make recycling of land economically feasible. Sites
included in the sites inventory under recyclable land have a realistic capacity
(75 percent of maximum density) that is at least a three-fold increase in
capacity.
As further evidence of the recycling potential in the City, since 2006 most units
built or approved have involved recycling of land to achieve additional units. On
residential properties that recycled to more intense residential uses, the average
projects achieved at least twice as many units. This increase in the number of
residential units on limited developable land demonstrates that the City
facilitates and encourages recycling and that there is a demand and market for
recycling of land to higher densities.
Table H-43 presents a summary of residential capacity on underutilized
residential land. A detailed listing of the underutilized properties is included in
Table H-48 and in Figure H-5.
RECYCLABLE LAND: MIXED USE
Because vacant land is scarce, opportunities to enact positive changes through
land use are limited. New mixed use development along major corridors and in
Downtown Torrance offers the opportunity to meet the local housing demand
while encouraging the recycling of older uses and creating tax generation
opportunities. In Torrance, future mixed-use developments will most likely be
located in Downtown Torrance, along major commercial corridors, and at key
activity nodes such as major commercial intersections where development is
compatible with surrounding land uses. Consistent with the General Plan Land
Use Element, mixed-use developments should be located in areas where
services and transportation are most available and do not interfere with
established residential neighborhoods. The sites are chosen with these criteria
in mind. The mixed use sites are highlighted in Figure H-5.
While there has been expressed developer interest on many of the chosen sites,

Former Downtown Redevelopment Project Area
The former Downtown Redevelopment Project Area encompasses 88.5 acres
and contains the original commercial core of the City. Historically, the pattern
of redevelopment in the Downtown area has not been limited to construction
of projects dedicated solely for commercial uses. The Redevelopment Agency
was instrumental in providing funds for new development and property
maintenance and rehabilitation prior to the demise of redevelopment agencies
in 2012. Trends indicate that the Downtown area has been consistently
redeveloped with mixed-use developments which integrate a residential
component. In the Downtown area, mixed-use development has revitalized
older buildings and added to the charm and character of the area. It has been
common practice for projects in Downtown to consist of ground-floor
commercial uses and an above-ground-floor residential use. The General Plan
identifies intensification of uses as a means to revitalizing the area. Currently,
the area is experiencing a renaissance with the development of and
reinvestment in the Downtown commercial area. In early 2013, the City
approved an affordable, mixed-use, workforce housing development consisting
of 44 dwelling units and approximately 3,700 square feet of commercial space
in Downtown Torrance. The development utilized a density bonus and provides
43 units affordable to very low and low income households. The sites in the
former Downtown Redevelopment Project Area are designated Commercial
Center in the General Plan and zoned “Downtown Redevelopment Project
Area”. The Commercial Center General Plan designation is designed to
encourage denser development and facilitate mixed-use. The area of the City
zoned “Downtown Redevelopment Project Area” is characterized by suburban
scale downtown development and vertical mixed-use development.
The City identified a number of properties within Downtown where the
conditions of existing uses are conducive to private redevelopment in the
future. Such conditions include expressed developer interest, City ownership,
large parking areas, older buildings, marginally operating businesses, and
significant capacity for additional units.
GIS analysis, staff knowledge, and field checks were used to identify and refine
the sites selected.
        Downtown Site 1: 7 properties
         encompassing 0.88 acres with
         the capacity to accommodate 27
         units at 31 units/acre density.
         Four of the seven parcels that
         encompass the site are vacant
         with the remaining parcels
         occupied by small, older industrial uses and outdoor storage. The site

          can be easily redeveloped given that very few improvements and few
          structures exist on the properties. Located near the intersection of
          Carson Street and Cabrillo Avenue, the site affords easy access to
          transit lines. The site’s location just two blocks from the heart of
          Downtown makes this an ideal redevelopment opportunity. There has
          been developer interest for residential development on this site but no
          concrete proposals. The City considered acquiring the site for
          development of affordable housing prior to the elimination of the
          redevelopment agency. The property sits just south of a newly
          approved 44-unit affordable, mixed-use, workforce housing
          development.
         Downtown Site 2: This is a
          0.35-acre parcel with the
          capacity to accommodate 11
          units at 31 units/acre
          density. The current use is a
          restaurant parking lot, but
          developer interest indicates
          that this property has the
          potential to be redeveloped
          to a mixed-use development.
          Located at the corner of Torrance Boulevard and Sartori Avenue, the
          property is easily accessible and has high visibility as it is at the
          entrance to Downtown Torrance.
         Downtown Site 3: This site
          consists of two properties
          encompassing 0.53 acres with
          the capacity to accommodate
          17 units at 31 units/acre
          density. The current use on
          both properties is parking lots
          for general parking and bank
          parking. One parcel is owned
          by the City. Due to the built-
          out nature of the City and the scale of development that has occurred
          in the immediate vicinity, this site is underused. A mixed-use
          development that integrated parking would be a much more efficient
          use of the site and given the potential units that can be built, may be a
          financial incentive for the current owners. The site is located on Post
          Avenue between Cravens and Sartori Avenues.

CHAPTER 6:           Housing Element
       Downtown Site 4: This site
        consists of three properties
        encompassing 0.6 acres with
        the capacity to accommodate
        18 units at 31 units/acre
        density. The current use on the
        site is a small office business
        and a large City-owned parking
        lot. Located at the intersection
        of Cravens and Marcelina Avenues, the site is located at an underused
        corner of Downtown (across from Site 6) and stands in contrast to
        more dense development occurring in the area. Redevelopment of the
        site can provide the opportunity for residential combined with
        commercial or office uses and parking areas.
       Downtown Site 5: This site
        consists of three properties
        encompassing 0.42 acres
        with the capacity to
        accommodate 14 units at
        31 units/acre density. The
        current use on the site is
        an empty commercial strip
        center, a large, unimproved
        parking area, and a small
        two-tenant commercial building (half of which is vacant). This site at
        the intersection of Cravens and Marcelina Avenues is mostly empty and
        can easily be redeveloped and intensified. Its size and corner location
        make this site ideal for redevelopment into more intense use mixed-use
        development. Compared to the scale of development that has occurred
        in the immediate vicinity, this site is significantly underutilized.
       Downtown Site 6: This site
        consists of two properties
        encompassing 0.39 acres
        with     the     capacity    to
        accommodate 12 units at 31
        units/acre     density.     The
        current use on the site is a
        small commercial building
        and a large parking lot. The
        site’s low-scale character stands in contrast to more dense
        development that has occurred in this area of Downtown.
        Redevelopment of the site can provide the opportunity for residential
        combined with commercial or office uses and parking areas.

Hawthorne Boulevard Corridor Specific Plan
There are two sites currently located within the Hawthorne Boulevard Corridor
Specific Plan (HBCSP).
         HBCSP Site 1: One site is located at the northeast corner of Del Amo
          Circle Drive and Carson Street. The site is zoned as HBCSP Del Amo-1,
          which has a minimum residential density of 27 units per acre and has
          no maximum density. The Del Amo-1 zone has a maximum floor area
          ratio (FAR) of 1.0; however, maximum FAR may be exceeded for mixed-
          use developments with approval of the Planning Commission. The 5.2-
          acre site is parking lot with limited maintenance and has had a history
          of potential for housing redevelopment projects. The site has received
          significant developer interest, indicating the continual interest and
          economic feasibility of redeveloping the sites with residential uses. A
          realistic density of 84 units per acre is applied to the site based on
          previously submitted applications for this site that ranged from 190
          units (79 units per acre, partial site) to 460 units (89 units per acre, full
          site). Based on this realistic density, the site has the potential to
          accommodate 438 units.
         HBCSP Site 2: The second site is located on the corner of Lomita
          Boulevard and Samuel Street. The 2.45 acre site has the potential for
          development of 74 residential units. This site is zoned as HBCSP
          Meadow Park Sub-district (MP) and allows for residential development
          in a mixed-use project. This site is currently used as an office building
          but has also received past interest in redevelopment as a mixed-use
          project and a senior residential project. A realistic density of 30 units
          per acre is applied to the site based on previously submitted
          applications for this site that proposed between 30-40 units per acre.
Redondo Beach Boulevard
During the General Plan update process, several areas were identified as
transition areas experiencing land use changes, and where properties are
underutilized or undervalued. Redondo Beach Boulevard is one of those areas.
To provide opportunities for more intense commercial development and to
encourage commercial/residential mixed-use development, the General Plan
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                       H-83                                HOUSING ELEMENT

CHAPTER 6:            Housing Element
designates commercial properties General Commercial. Traditional commercial
uses will be limited to a maximum FAR of 0.6, whereas mixed-use
developments may be built up to a 1.0 FAR, consistent with zoning
regulations.
                                       A 14.6-acre site located on Redondo Beach
                                       Boulevard located between Van Ness and
                                       Wilkie Avenues has the potential to yield
                                       237 units in a mixed-use or residential
                                       development. Currently, the site is
                                       occupied by a former drive-in theater and
                                       used as a daily open air swap meet. The
                                       site has no permanent improvements, and
                                       all the structures for the former drive-in
                                       theater are still present. Located at the
northern boundary of the City along a major thoroughfare, the site is easily
accessible to regional transit. The site is surrounded on all sides by residential
development. The realistic capacity for the site is based on an assumption that
due to the location of the site and the demand for commercial along this
thoroughfare, only half the site would develop as residential (in a mixed-use
context). Two of the properties totaling 13.9 acres are designated for General
Commercial and allow mixed use at a density of 44 units per acre. The third
parcel (0.6 acres) is designated for Residential Office and allows for a density of
31 units per acre, also with the assumption that half the site would be
developed for residential use.
Western Avenue
                                             The site on Western Avenue
                                             includes two properties that total
                                             3.5 acres and has the capacity to
                                             accommodate 61 units at 31 units
                                             per acre density. Issues in this area
                                             include the presence of outdated
                                             industrial and commercial properties
                                             and an influx of newer commercial
                                             and residential uses. A transition to
more intense uses and the recycling of aging, poorly maintained industrial uses
is envisioned for this area. The current use on the site is a low-scale plant
nursery operation and an empty industrial/commercial building. Located at the
City’s eastern boundary at the Western Avenue off-ramp to I-405, the site’s
high visibility and accessibility to transit make it ideal for redevelopment that
includes residential uses. Residential uses are currently located adjacent to the
site. Designated General Commercial, the site allows for mixed-use
development at a density of 31 units per acre. The realistic capacity for the site
assumes a mixed-use development that includes a residential component (75
percent) and a commercial component (25 percent). The low-scale nature of the
nursery use stands in contrast to other uses along this corridor. The vacant

industrial building also offers an opportunity for redevelopment and lot
consolidation. Due to the low-scale use of the site at this highly visibility
location, redevelopment to a more intense use presents a significant economic
incentive to the property owner.
RECYCLABLE LAND: ADDITIONAL AREAS
A cluster of sites is located just north of Sepulveda Boulevard and east of
Crenshaw Boulevard along Apple, Santa Fe, and Gramercy Avenues. These sites
were selected for their location in contiguous clusters which provide the
opportunity for lot consolidation and in areas where higher density
designations are encouraging transitioning of single family units to higher
density units. The age of the structures on the sites chosen will encourage
redevelopment as many are over 50 years old. The average age of the sites
chosen is 56 years. The age of the structures on the sites ranges from the early
1940s to the later 50s. Currently developed with single-family units, these
properties are designated for up to 31 units per acre. Combined these clusters
encompass 3.9 acres and have the capacity for 86 units. Due to the scarcity of
developable vacant land in the City, most future development will be on
underutilized residential sites, sites that are built at significantly lower densities
than currently allowed. These properties offer an economic incentive to the
property owner to develop at higher densities.
Apple Avenue
The Apple Avenue sites are located in two clusters of 1.17 acres and 0.4 acres.
The sites were chosen as the current uses are single-family homes along a
street that has exhibited a continual trend of transitioning to higher density,
multi-family uses. Higher density multiple family uses have been developed to
the north and south of the site. On the first cluster, the eight single-family
homes have the potential for development of at least 27 residential units. On
the second cluster of lots, the three single-family homes have the potential for
development of at least 10 units. The age of the structures on the sites in this
area will encourage redevelopment, as they are all over 50 years old. The site is
surrounded on the north and east with high-density residential development.
Given the scarcity of developable land, the high demand for housing in the
South Bay, the potential to increase the number of housing units by more than
three-fold, and the opportunity for densities of at least 31 units per acre, these
are ideal redevelopment opportunities.
CITY OF TORRANCE GENERAL PLAN                     H-85                                 HOUSING ELEMENT
CHAPTER 6:             Housing Element
Santa Fe Avenue
The site is comprised of four lots with a current use of single-family homes. The
lots are designated for development up to 31 units per acre. Given the
opportunity for higher-density development, many lots on the same block have
transitioned to higher density uses. While there are currently four units on
these lots, it has the capacity for a three-fold increase in units (12 units) at
densities that have been established by the State as capable of accommodating
affordable housing. The age of the structures on the sites in this area will
encourage redevelopment as they are between 50 and 57 years old.
Gramercy Avenue
The site is comprised of two clusters, one with eight lots , all with a current use
of single-family homes. The lots are designated for development at 31 units per
acre. Given the opportunity for higher-density development, many lots on the
same block have transitioned to higher-density uses. While there are currently
11 units on these lots, it has the capacity for more than a three-fold increase in
units (37 units) at densities that have been established by the State as capable
of accommodating affordable housing. The age of the structures on the sites in
this area will encourage redevelopment as they are between 48 and 60 years
old.
SCATTERED SITES
A review of the City’s GIS records indicates that there are opportunities for infill
development at scattered sites throughout the City, as presented in Figure H-5.
Recyclable properties are those that are built with significantly fewer units than
allowed by City land use regulations. The properties included in this part of the
underutilized land inventory are properties with potential for more than twice
the number of existing housing units. This approach ensures that the sites have
realistic recycling potential and that there is an economic inventive for recycling
in a city with limited residential development opportunities.
Certain properties among the scattered sites contain existing non-residential
uses that are likely candidates for conversion to residential uses. These
properties are located in areas where the pattern of development has
demonstrated a trend of conversion of existing underutilized and non-
residential uses into multi-family uses. Also, many of these properties contain
parcel sizes and configurations that make these sites conducive for recycling to
multi-family uses:
         Church and Parking lot use, Maricopa Street.: The current use on this
          2.41 acre site is a church, yard, and a parking lot. In 2007 the property
          owner received entitlements for a small portion of the parcel for a
          subdivision into a condominium development but no development has
          occurred as of 2013.        The owners of have expressed interest in
          developing the parcel with the church and parking lot, as it is
          underutilized (70-80 percent of the site is used for parking or turf).
          Combined, the realistic capacity of the entire site can accommodate a

          substantial increase in multi-family dwelling units than is currently
          entitled.
         Credit Union and Parking lot use, Arlington Avenue: This site contains
          the sole commercial use in a neighborhood that is dominantly multi-
          family residential. The site’s surrounding area has demonstrated a
          trend of property conversions, with single-family residential uses being
          replaced with multi-family residential uses.
         Office, church and parking lot use, 182nd Street: This site is located
          next to multi-family residential development and is in an area for which
          development trends have been the conversion of non-residential uses
          into residential use, and of recycling underutilized sites into denser
          uses.
         Masonic Temple and Parking lot use, 2326 Cabrillo Avenue: The site is
          located in a predominantly multi-family residential neighborhood,
          where conversion and/or recycling into multi-family developments have
          historically occurred. The combination of old structure age and parcel
          size presents ideal conditions for conversion to multi-family residential
          use.
In addition, the age of the structures on the scattered sites chosen will
encourage redevelopment as many are over 50 years old. These structures dated
from the mid-1940s to the early 1960s. The scattered sites identified have the
potential for development of 391 units at densities that can facilitate lower-
income housing, as defined by State law. Most sites under this category are
contiguous to other underutilized sites ensuring the highest potential for lot
consolidation. The City will encourage lot consolidation by offering assistance
to interested developers.

* Sites in the Downtown area are expected to be developed at approximately 31 units per acre based on previous residential
development that has occurred as shown in Table H-41 and are zoned “Downtown Redevelopment Project Area”. This zone is intended
to implement the Commercial Center General Plan designation which is intended to encourage denser development and facilitate
mixed-use.

  Lot Consolidation Potential
  Due to the City’s built-out residential environment and the City’s heritage as a
  small-lot residential community, large stand-alone sites are very limited.
  Acknowledging this fact, most sites on the residential sites inventory are
  contiguous with other parcels and provide the opportunity for lot
  consolidation. Of the sites identified, almost all provide the potential for lot
  consolidation into larger parcels; the sites inventory table identifies lot
  consolidation potential. By identifying lot consolidation opportunities, the City
  increases the potential for larger lot development. Furthermore, the average size
  of potential sites increases from less than one-half acre as stand-alone sites to
  1.33 acres as consolidated sites. Also, densities in excess of 30 units per acre
  are allowed on a majority of the identified sites. These higher densities provide a
  strong impetus for development that maximizes the use of scarce land and
  takes advantage of economies of scale. In effect, the higher densities offered by
  the City incentivize lot consolidation.
  The City of Torrance encourages the consolidation of property as a means of
  maximizing development and redevelopment potential. This provision is
  intended to make full use of limited land resources and promote larger
  residential developments that can facilitate a wide range of housing types and

affordability levels. The City works with developers to encourage lot
consolidation, especially consolidation of smaller sized lots and for multiple-
family residential projects where larger lot sizes can improve the quality of the
development product and amenities on the site.
Environmental Constraints
The ability to accommodate the RHNA overall and by individual income
categories is not constrained by any environmental conditions. The sites
inventory analysis reflects land use designations and densities established in
the Land Use Element. Thus, any environmental constraints that would lower
the potential yield (e.g., steep slopes) have already been accounted for. Any
additional constraints that would occur on a more detailed site review basis
would be addressed as part of the individual project review process. In the
vacant land inventory, capacity on 24.6 acres of land in the R-1/A-1 zones
(which allows 9 units per acre) is estimated at only 19 units, reflecting the
topographically constrained nature of the site. The remaining sites in the
inventory are infill development sites and have no known environmental
constraints. Downtown Site 5 was a gas station in the 1950s. Underground
storage tanks on the site were removed in 2013, and while there are no known
remaining environmental constraints on the site, any further environmental
remediation would be identified as part of the individual project review process.
COMPARISON OF SITES INVENTORY AND RHNA
Identified properties in the sites inventory have the combined capacity to
accommodate 1,108 income-targeted housing units on vacant and
underutilized residential (Table H-44) and meet the RHNA for the 2008-2014
planning period.

CHAPTER 6:            Housing Element
FINANCIAL RESOURCES
Torrance has access to a variety of funding sources for affordable housing
activities. These include programs from local, state, federal, and private
resources. This section describes some of most significant housing funding
sources currently used in Torrance, including HUD Section 8 funds.
LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS
The Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC or Tax Credit) program provides
each state with a tax credit of $1.25 per person that can be allocated towards
funding housing that meets program guidelines. These tax credits are then used
to leverage private capital into new construction or acquisition and
rehabilitation of affordable housing. The approval process to receive LIHTCs is
very competitive in California. The Harmony Court Apartments in Torrance were
developed with LIHTCs in 1996.
HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER PROGRAM
The Torrance Housing Authority administers the Housing Choice Voucher
Program (formerly the Section 8 Rental Assistance Program) that extends rental
subsidies to very low-income households. The subsidy represents the difference
between the excess of 30 percent of the recipient’s monthly income and the
federally approved fair market rents. In 2012, the Torrance HA provided rental
assistance to 605 households. As 2012, there were approximately 16,875
active applicants on the waiting list, which is now closed.
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMEMNT
GRANTS
The City of Torrance receives just under $275,000 of federal funding for the
CDBG program through the Los Angeles Urban County program. The City
hopes to fund the Home Improvement Program in the future as redevelopment
funds for the program are no longer available.
ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
Agencies with administrative capacity to implement programs contained in the
Housing Element include the City of Torrance, other public agencies, and local
and national non-profit private developers.
CITY OF TORRANCE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

Element. The Community Development Director is responsible for the
management of all City building and planning activities including building
permits, environmental, redevelopment, engineering permits and records, GIS,
mapping and survey information, and housing activities. Responsibilities of the
Community Development Department include:
         Advanced Planning
         Building Permits & On-Line Permitting
         Construction Plan Check and Inspections
         Development Review
         Engineering Permits
         Engineering Records
         Environmental
         Housing Programs (including Section 8)
         Redevelopment
         Survey Information
         Traffic Engineering
         Transportation Planning
The Community Development Department is also responsible for tracking the
number and affordability of new housing units that will be built during this
planning period and administering the Housing Choice Voucher Program. The
Environmental Division is responsible for responding to code violations for
substandard housing issues.
SUCCESSOR AGENCY TO THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY OF
THE CITY OF TORRANCE
The elimination of redevelopment agencies in the State of California prompted
the creation of the Successor Housing Agency to the Redevelopment Agency of
the City of Torrance and an Oversight Board to perform the City‘s housing
functions, administer Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule (ROPS),
liquidate the Redevelopment Agency’s (RDA) assets, and pay off debts. The loss
of redevelopment funding may significantly impair the production of affordable
housing in the future unless the City can identify an alternate funding source.
3.1.2              OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY
CONSERVATION
Energy-related housing costs can directly impact the affordability of housing.
While state building code standards contain mandatory energy efficiency
requirements for new development, the City and utility providers are also
important resources to encourage and facilitate energy conservation and to help
residents minimize energy-related expenses.
Policies addressing climate change and energy conservation are integrated
throughout the Torrance General Plan. The primary avenues to address climate

CHAPTER 6:            Housing Element
change in Torrance are through lowering of transportation emissions (through
better use of transit and walkable residential and commercial environments) and
encouraging energy conservation and efficiency (through energy efficient
appliance, green building, and sustainable water policies). The City of Torrance
has taken steps to address climate change impacts collaboratively through
agreements with other local governments. Torrance has joined the Cities for
Climate Protection (CCP) Campaign, a program administered by the
International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI).
Specific programs in the Torrance General Plan include increased education for
residents and businesses about the global warming effects of their
transportation and land use decisions. The City will also conduct a greenhouse
gas emissions inventory for the City of Torrance and adopt a climate action
plan, with appropriate measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the
City. Through the General Plan, the Community Resources Element in
particular, the City will also encourage energy conservation in development
projects as a means of reducing global warming effects and encouraging
sustainable development. Programs related to development include:
        Establishing guidelines for developers that promote energy-efficient
         design features such as site orientation and the use of energy-
         conserving lighting fixtures to prevent excessive energy consumption.
        Developing incentive programs to promote Leadership in Energy and
         Environmental Design (LEED) Standards developed by the U.S. Green
         Building Council, and encourage projects to achieve LEED certification.
        Educating residents about the importance and availability of solar
         energy as an alternative fuel source for space heating and cooling,
         water heating and generating electricity
        Promoting the incorporation of green building standards that exceed
         State Title 24 building construction standards and Energy Star
         conservation standards into future public and private development and
         major renovation projects.
The City promotes energy conservation through the implementation of State of
California Title 24 building code energy performance requirements. Title 24
measures require, for example, minimum ceiling, wall, and raised floor
insulation, and minimum heating, ventilating, air conditioning and water
heating equipment efficiencies. The City also recognizes the role of sustainable
building practices in achieving energy efficiency. To further energy conservation
and sustainable development, the City will continue to implement strong waste
diversion and recycling programs to increase public awareness of sustainable
practices and reduce pressures on regional landfills. Green building will be
promoted, with the City taking a leadership role in demonstrating the benefits
of sustainable design and construction.

Southern California Edison (SCE) offers a variety of energy conservation services
as part of its Customer Assistance Programs (CAP). The Energy Assistance
Fund helps income-qualified residential customers facing financial hardship
manage their electricity bills during the months of February and March. These
services are designed to help low-income households, senior citizens,
permanently disabled, and non-English speaking customers control their energy
use. The 2007 Residential Multifamily Energy Efficiency Rebate Program offers
property owners and managers incentives on a broad list of energy efficiency
improvements in lighting, HVAC, insulation, and window categories. These
improvements are to be used to retrofit existing multi-family properties of two
or more units.
Additionally, the Southern California Gas Company offers various rebate
programs for energy-efficient appliances and makes available to residents energy
efficient kits at no cost. The Gas Company also offers no-cost weatherization
and furnace repair or replacement services for qualified limited-income
customers. The Comprehensive Mobile Home Program provides qualifying
mobile home customers with no-cost energy conservation evaluations,
installations of low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators, and gas energy
efficiency improvements, such as duct test and seal of HVAC systems. The
Designed for Comfort program provides energy efficiency design assistance,
training, and incentives for housing authorities, owners of multi-family
affordable and supportive housing projects (which offer homes to persons with
special needs).

          community’s housing goals and objectives; and
         The progress in implementation of the housing element.
These results should be quantified where possible (e.g., rehabilitation results),
but may be qualitative where necessary (e.g., mitigation of governmental
constraints). Past accomplishments are compared with what was projected or
planned as part of the earlier Housing Element. The evaluation helps a
jurisdiction identify the extent to which adopted programs have been successful
in achieving stated objectives and addressing local needs, and how such
programs continue to be relevant in addressing current and future housing
needs. The evaluation provides the basis for recommended modifications to
policies and programs in the updated element, and provides meaningful
guidance for establishing new objectives.
This section summarizes Torrance’s accomplishments toward implementing the
2008-2014 Housing Element. A program-by-program review is presented in
Table H-45. Table H-46 summarizes the quantified objectives contained in the
City’s 2008 Housing Element and evaluates the progress toward fulfilling these
objectives.

The City recognizes that it had limited resources to address the varied
affordable housing needs in the community. As part of the 2008-2014
Housing Element, the City established a set of quantified objectives for housing
construction, rehabilitation, and preservation. The Quantified Objectives for
the 2008-2014 Housing Element included:
        Facilitating the construction of 1,063 new housing units, representing
         the City’s remaining RHNA of 468 units for very low-income

The 2008 Housing Element demonstrated that the City had adequate zoning
and sites to meet its RHNA of 1,828 units. Pursuant to State law, each
jurisdiction in California is responsible for a share of the region’s housing
growth needs. For the 2008-2014 Housing Element cycle, the City of Torrance
was assigned a RHNA of 1,828 units. The RHNA for the 2008‐2014 Housing
Element cycle in the SCAG region used January 1, 2006 as the baseline for
projecting housing needs. As such, housing units constructed, permitted,
approved, or affordable housing units preserved from January 1, 2006 to 2008
were credited toward the RHNA. The City’s remaining RHNA was 1,063 units.
The City maintained adequate sites within existing land use policy to facilitate
the development of additional housing units. However, development interest in
the City did not create all of the projected RHNA units. Based upon a review of
Building Department records, from adoption of the Element in 2010 through
2012, 37 percent of the construction objective was met.
The 2008 rehabilitation goals fell short. The loan programs were suspended due
to the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency. The City met its conservation
goals, as all 112 units at-risk of conversion to market rate housing remained
affordable.

5. HOUSING PLAN
This Housing Plan sets forth the City’s overall housing objectives in the form of
Objectives, Policies, and Programs.
While most General Plan element programs are located in Appendix A,
programs for the Housing Element are contained within the Element. This
format will facilitate the periodic update of the Housing Element, as required by
State Law. This Plan identifies objectives, policies, and programs that guide
housing policy for the City for 2014-2021. The objectives, policies, and
programs are consistent with the direction of the other General Plan elements,
specifically the Land Use Element.
The Housing Element objectives, policies, and programs aim to:
         Provide adequate sites to meet the 2008-2014 RHNA
         Assist in the development of housing to meet the needs of lower
          income households
         Address and where appropriate, and legally possible, remove
          governmental constraints to housing development
         Conserve, preserve, and improve the condition of the existing affordable
          housing stock
         Promote equal housing opportunity
These objectives are required by and delineated in State Law (California Code
Section 65583 [c][1]).
5.1 HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
Meeting the housing needs of all residents of the community requires the
identification of adequate sites for all types of housing.
OBJECTIVE H.1:                  Enhance housing opportunities for all Torrance residents
                                Provide a range of different housing types and unit sizes for
Policy H.1.1:
                                varying income ranges and lifestyles.
                                Encourage the provision for housing which meets the needs of
Policy H.1.2:
                                seniors and the disabled.
                                Continue to implement the Senior Citizen Housing Development
Policy H.1.3:
                                Standards.
                                Continue to monitor and assess the special housing needs of
Policy H.1.4:                   senior citizens, in collaboration with the Torrance Commission
                                on Aging.

PROGRAM 1: ADEQUATE SITES
The City of Torrance has a RHNA of 1,450 units for the 2014-2021 RHNA
period. The residential sites inventory consists of 31 acres of vacant and 49
acres of underutilized land with capacity to yield at least 1,647 new units.
These sites can accommodate the City’s RHNA for all income levels through
year 2021. The City will maintain an inventory of available sites for residential
development and provide it to prospective residential developers upon request.
Actions:
     Continue to provide appropriate land use designations and maintain an
        inventory of suitable sites for residential development.
     Provide technical assistance and information on available City-owned
        parcels for lower-income developments to private or non-profit housing
        providers.
     Encourage and facilitate lot consolidation as a means of maximizing
        development and redevelopment potential. As funding permits, use lot
        consolidation incentives to help achieve full use of limited land
        resources, and promote larger residential developments that can
        facilitate a wide range of housing types and affordability levels. Lot
        consolidation incentives may include but are not limited to:
             o    Financial assistance: At the discretion of the City and
                  contingent upon available funding as determined by the City of
                  Torrance, fee assistance and other financial incentives may be
                  made available to encourage lot consolidation activities.
             o    Technical assistance: Assisting applicants with development
                  counseling on the lot consolidation process. Provide literature
                  to applicants or interested developers regarding the lot
                  consolidation process and list assistance available, if any, from
                  the City for lot consolidation activities.
             o    Conduct periodic, informal surveys with local developers to
                  monitor the success of lot consolidation efforts. Revise or
                  develop new lot consolidation incentives as appropriate.
Timeframe:                Implementation and annual reporting throughout the
                          planning period; developer incentives and technical
                          assistance to occur on a case-by-case basis and in pre-
                          application conferences. Evaluation and monitoring of

5.2 HOUSING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF
ALL INCOME LEVELS
Torrance encourages the development of housing units affordable to all
segments of the population. The Redevelopment Agency facilitates the
production of affordable for-sale and rental housing through the provision of
both financial and regulatory incentives.
                                Assist in the provision of adequate housing to meet the needs of
OBJECTIVE H.2:                  the community.

Policy H.2.1:                   cost of housing and increase the opportunity for
                                homeownership.
                                Work with large employers to facilitate the development of

Policy H.2.4:                   Continue the Housing Choice Voucher program.
PROGRAM 2: MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT
Mixed-use development can be an important tool in adding needed housing
opportunities. The City’s General Plan provides for opportunities for housing
integrated with commercial uses. The Commercial Center, General Commercial,
and Residential-Office General Plan designations allows multi-family residential
units as part of a mixed use project, or as separate projects integrated into the
larger commercial center site plan via pedestrian or transit connections.
Actions:
      Continue to allow residential development either as a component of a
          mixed-use development or as a separate development in appropriate
          areas designated as Commercial Center in the Land Use Element.
      Continue to allow mixed-use residential and commercial uses in the
          City’s designated commercial areas.
      Allow mixed-use residential and office uses in appropriate Residential-
          Office areas.
      Provide incentives such as reduced parking or technical development
          assistance to promote new development.
Timeframe:                Implementation and annual reporting throughout the
                          planning period; developer incentives and technical
                          assistance to occur on a case-by-case basis and in pre-
                          application conferences.

PROGRAM 3: AFFORDABLE HOUSING
DEVELOPMENT
For-profit and non-profit developers can play a significant role in providing
affordable housing in Torrance. The City provides land, regulatory incentives,
and in limited cases, financial assistance to developers to complete both
ownership and rental housing for extremely low-income, lower-income, and
special needs households such as lower-income renters, seniors, and persons
with disabilities, including developmental. On a case-by-case basis, the City
will assess the incentives needed to facilitate the development of affordable
housing.
Actions:
      Continue to provide regulatory incentives to private developers to
         increase the supply of affordable housing, including reduced parking
         where feasible and appropriate. Offer local non-profit developers and
         agencies technical assistance and information on City funding sources
      Encourage the development of rental projects that meet the needs of
         lower-income renters, seniors, and persons with disabilities, including
         developmental.
      Encourage use of the Density Bonus provisions through technical
         assistance and information dissemination.
      Alert housing developers with known interest in developing within the
         City when opportunities are available (e.g. sites, partnerships).
      Continue to conduct pre-application conferences with developers
         interested in building affordable housing.
Timeframe:                Implementation and annual reporting throughout the
                          planning period; developer incentives: meet with
                          developers at least once a year with technical
                          assistance and information dissemination as well as in
                          pre-application conferences and on a case-by-case

PROGRAM 4: RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
The Housing Choice Voucher Program extends rental subsidies to very low-
income households, as well as elderly and disabled persons. The subsidy
represents the difference between 30 percent of the monthly income and the
allowable rent determined by program guidelines. Vouchers permit tenants to
locate their own housing and rent units beyond the federally determined fair
market rent in an area. In 2012, the Torrance HA provided Section 8 rental

assistance to 605 households. As 2012, there were approximately 16,875
active applicants on the waiting list, which is now closed.
The Torrance Senior Citizen Rental Assistance Program provides rental
assistance to residents at the Coleman Court and Ocean Terrace developments.
As of February 2013, 11 households were receiving assistance. While the
program is still active, due to the elimination of the redevelopment agency, the
City is evaluating available funding for this program.
Actions:
      Support efforts to maintain, and possibly to increase, the current
          number of Housing Choice Vouchers, and direct eligible households to
          the program
      Provide information and referrals to landlords regarding participation in
          the Housing Choice Voucher Program
      Continue to provide rental assistance to senior households at the
          Coleman Court and Ocean Terrace developments as feasible based on
          financial resources.
Timeframe:                 Implementation and annual reporting throughout the
                           planning period; program information for landlords to
                           be posted on the City’s Section 8 website within a year
                           from Housing Element adoption.

5.3 REMOVAL OF GOVERNMENTAL
CONSTRAINTS
Factors that pose constraints to the provision of housing include the costs of
developing both ownership and rental housing, which are ultimately passed to
the consumers; the availability and cost of mortgage and rehabilitation
financing; and restrictive zoning or other development regulations. These
factors tend to disproportionately impact lower- and moderate-income
households due to their limited resources for absorbing the costs. The City of
Torrance will, where legally possible, remove governmental constraints affecting
the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
                                Mitigate potential governmental constraints to housing
OBJECTIVE H.3:                  production and affordability.

PROGRAM 5: LAND USE CODE HOUSING TYPES
To better facilitate the understanding of housing types permitted in zones in
the City, a matrix of approved uses in residential zones will be incorporated into
the Land Use Code. The table will reflect the permitted and conditionally
permitted residential uses as permitted in practice in the City.
Action:
      Amend the Land Use Code to accurately reflect the residential uses
          that are permitted and conditionally permitted in all zones.
Timeframe:                 Concurrent with the comprehensive Land Use Code

limited housing options. Housing types appropriate for these groups include
emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and single-room
occupancy (SRO) units. Special needs persons may also find housing
opportunities in residential care facilities and group homes.
To facilitate the development of emergency housing and comply with State law,
the City’s Land Use Code will be amended to identify a zone to permit
emergency shelters by right. The City will evaluate the M-2 industrial district for
inclusion of emergency homeless shelters by right. As part of the Governmental
Constraints analysis, the following revisions to the Torrance Land Use Code, as
required by State law, are identified as appropriate to better facilitate the
provision of a variety of housing types:
Actions:
      Amend the Land Use Code to facilitate housing opportunities for
          extremely low-income persons by addressing provisions for transitional
          housing, supportive housing, SRO housing, and emergency shelters.

                                                     CHAPTER 6:           Housing Element
          Transitional housing and supportive housing shall be considered a
          residential use of property, and shall be subject only to those
          restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in
          the same zone.
         Evaluate provisions regarding development of residential care facilities
          and licensed and unlicensed group homes in the City to ensure that
          specific conditions and restrictions do not unduly constrain
          development. If substantial constraints are identified, revise the Land
          Use Code accordingly.
         Amend the Land Use Code to provide for emergency homeless shelters
          as a permitted use in at least one zone (M-2 zone), and develop
          objective standards to regulate emergency shelters without
          discretionary review as provided for in SB2. The City will develop
          additional written, objective standards for emergency shelters to
          regulate the following, as permitted in SB 2. In addition to the
          following development standards allowed by SB2, the Land Use code
          will apply the same development and management standards that
          apply to other uses within the identified zone:
                The maximum number of beds/persons permitted to be served
                   nightly;
                Off-street parking based on demonstrated need, but not to
                   exceed parking requirements for other residential or commercial
                   uses in the same zone;
                The size/location of exterior and interior onsite waiting and
                   client intake areas;
                The provision of onsite management;
                The proximity of other emergency shelters, provided that
                   emergency shelters are not required to be more than 300 feet
                   apart;
                The length of stay;
                Lighting; and
                Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in
                   operation.

PROGRAM 7: WATER AND SEWER SERVICE
PROVIDERS
In accordance with Government Code Section 65589.7 as revised in 2005,
immediately following City Council adoption, the City must deliver to all public
agencies or private entities that provide water or sewer services to properties
within Torrance a copy of the 2014-2021 Housing Element.

Responsible Agency:        Community Development Department
Funding Sources:           General Fund
PROGRAM 8: MULTI-FAMILY PROVISIONS
City zoning regulations require one and one-half parking spaces per unit to be
in an enclosed garage; other required spaces may be uncovered. These
requirements have not posed any apparent constraint to housing development,
as no developers have asked for a variance from the requirements. Many
developers have indicated that owners and tenants prefer enclosed parking due
to the added safety for both the vehicles parked and the people getting in and
out of their cars. Also, covered parking allows for a more efficient use of
property and can yield higher densities.
City zoning regulations also require approval of a Conditional Use Permit for
multi-family housing developments of more than 100 units. Due to the almost
built-out nature of the City, a 100-unit development is not common. The City
has established this procedure to ensure limited impacts of new large-scale
development on existing long-established neighborhoods. The Conditional Use
Permit process ensures that new large-scale projects are well-designed and fit
into the context of surrounding residential development with adequate public
review. The City works closely with applicants in the pre-approval process to
limit review times and ensure sensitivity to neighborhood context. These
requirements have not posed any apparent constraint to housing development,
as demand for residential development remains high in the City.
To ensure that these provisions do not result in a constraint to development in
the future, the City will monitor conditions, and will make biannual
assessments to identify whether these regulations affect development decisions
in the future, and will revise regulations as appropriate in response to the
findings.
Action:
        Conduct periodic, informal surveys with the developers of multi-family
         residential projects to identify whether any modifications to
         development standards, and parking and Conditional Use Permit
         requirements in particular, pose any constraint on development, and
         will revise as appropriate. 
        As part of the comprehensive Land Use Code update, multi-family
         zoning regulations will be evaluated and updated as necessary.

5.4 CONSERVE, PRESERVE, AND
IMPROVE THE HOUSING STOCK
Preserving the existing housing stock in Torrance is a high City priority.
Continued maintenance of the existing housing stock ensures high-quality
neighborhoods. Housing activities that help achieve these goals include
rehabilitation of single- and multi-family housing units and preservation of
assisted housing units that may be at risk of converting to market-rate housing.
                               Maintain and improve the quality of existing housing and
OBJECTIVE H.4:                 residential neighborhoods in Torrance.
                               Encourage the maintenance and enhancement of the existing
Policy H.4.1:
                               housing stock.
                               Promote increased awareness among property owners and
Policy H.4.2:
                               residents of the importance of property maintenance.
                               Support preservation of existing affordable low-income housing
Policy H.4.3:
                               that is considered at risk of converting to market level rents.
                               Encourage the rehabilitation of residential properties by
Policy H.4.4:
                               homeowners and property owners
PROGRAM 9: HOME REHABILITATION AND
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS
The Home Improvement Program administered by the Workforce Investment
Network Partners provides home repairs for low-income seniors and disabled
residents. The repairs are completed by persons in need of employment who
have been trained. Most participants are Torrance youths who face barriers to
employment. The Home Improvement Program assists in the City’s housing
preservation objectives and in the enhancement if employment opportunities.
The number of home improvement projects anticipated is approximately 900 for
the planning period.
Actions:
      Provide home improvement assistance though the Home Improvement
          Program. Assist in 75 home improvement projects annually.

PROGRAM 10: PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE
RENTAL HOUSING
Over the next ten years (2014-2024), two assisted developments and two
group homes that provide 114 affordable units have expiring affordability
covenants. Both JCI Gardens and Accessible Apartments 2 are owned and
operated by nonprofit organizations and as such, are considered to be at low
risk of conversion to market rate. Long-term affordability is fairly secure for
these projects, as this is consistent with the nonprofits’ missions to provide
affordable housing for the elderly, disabled, and low-income families. Both
property owners indicated that they renew their HUD contracts annually and
plan to do so in the future. As such, no changes in ownership are anticipated.
Actions:
      Support in the preservation of 114 affordable units at risk of converting
         to market rents by:
                Consulting annually with property owners of affordable
                 housing in the City to gauge the likelihood of conversion of
                 affordable units and discuss opportunities for the preservation
                 of affordable housing units at risk of converting to market
                 rents.
                Offering technical assistance to affordable housing owners with
                 at-risk units such as providing information on transfer of
                 ownership opportunities and funding opportunities (federal,
                 state, or local).
                If any property owners of affordable developments indicate
                 plans to convert to market rate, the City will contact qualified
                 entities to inform them of opportunities to acquire and
                 continue affordability of at-risk units and will work with
                 residents to provide tenant education in regards to affordable
                 housing options, including the potential availability and
                 priority for Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers.
     Timeframe:                    Annual consultation initiating in 2014; within
                                   60 days of notice of intent to convert at-risk
                                   units to market rate rents, the City will work
                                   with potential purchasers using HCD’s current
                                   list       of         Qualified        Entities

5.5 PROMOTE EQUAL HOUSING
OPPORTUNITY
To fully meet the community’s housing needs, the City must assure that
housing is accessible to all residents, regardless of race, religion, family status,
age, or physical disability.
OBJECTIVE H.5:                  Promote equal housing opportunity for all residents.
                                Continue to enforce fair housing laws prohibiting discrimination
                                in the building, financing, selling, or renting of housing on the
Policy H.5.1:                   basis of race, ethnicity, ancestry, national origin, religion, sex,
                                disability, age, marital status, familial status, source of income,
                                sexual orientation, or any other arbitrary factor.
PROGRAM 11: REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
The Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, requires that cities and counties
provide reasonable accommodation to rules, policies, practices, and procedures
where such accommodation may be necessary to afford individuals with
disabilities equal housing opportunities. While fair housing laws intend for all
people have equal access to housing, the law also recognizes that people with
disabilities may need extra tools to achieve equality. Reasonable
accommodation is one of the tools intended to further housing opportunities
for people with disabilities. Reasonable accommodation provides a means of
requesting from the local government flexibility in the application of land use
and zoning regulations or, in some instances, even a waiver of certain
restrictions or requirements because it is necessary to achieve equal access to
housing. Cities and counties are required to consider requests for
accommodations related to housing for people with disabilities and provide the
accommodation when it is determined to be “reasonable” based on fair housing
laws and case law interpreting the statutes.
Actions:
      Create a process for making requests for reasonable accommodation to
          land use and zoning decisions and procedures regulating the siting,
          funding, development and use of housing for people with disabilities.
      Provide information to residents on reasonable accommodation
          procedures via public counters and the City website.

PROGRAM 12: LAND USE CODE DEFINITIONS
The definition of “family” may limit access to housing for persons with
disabilities when municipalities narrowly define the word, illegally limiting the
development of group homes for persons with disabilities, but not for housing
similar sized and situated families. The definition of family in Torrance is not
discriminatory. However, the City’s definition of “family” is old and may impede
development in some situations. As such, the City will amend its Land Use
Code to revise the definition of family to be flexible for a variety of household
types, consistent with State and federal laws.
Action:
     Amend the Torrance Land Use Code to revise the definition of family.

PROGRAM 13: ENFORCE FAIR HOUSING LAWS
To assist in education and understanding of fair housing rights and protections,
the Housing Office provides information packets about fair housing laws to all
participants of the rental assistance programs. The City will continue to
distribute information on fair housing and refer fair housing questions and
housing discrimination claims to the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (www.hud.gov).
Actions:
     Continue to abide by and enforce fair housing laws.
     Continue to provide information to help increase awareness of fair
          housing protections
     Provide referral and assistance to people who claim to be victims of
          housing discrimination.
     Advertise the availability of fair housing services through flyers at
          public counters. Posting of available fair housing services will also be
          made available on the City’s website and other community locations.
Timeframe:                 Implementation and annual reporting throughout the
                           planning period. Website and public counter posting of
                           fair housing resources to occur within one year of

Project Title: 2014-2021 General Plan Housing Element
Description: The City is in the process of updating the General Plan Housing Element. The
Housing Element is one of the seven State-mandated elements of the General Plan. The
General Plan is a long-range planning document that sets forth policy for the growth and
improvement of the City. The Housing Element provides an assessment of the existing and
projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community. The Element identifies
sites that have the capacity to accommodate new development of various housing types. Also,
the Element presents goals, policies, and implementation programs for the preservation,
improvement, and development of housing.
Objective: The community workshop is a forum for City staff to receive input from the Planning
Commission, residents, and other stakeholders regarding the content of the updated Housing
Element. These comments will be considered for integration into the Housing Element.
Subsequent to review by the Planning Commission, the 2014-2021 Housing Element will be
submitted to the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for a 60-day
review period. During this time, the Element will remain available for review by the public. The
draft Housing Element will be posted on the Community Development Department website
(http://www.torranceca.gov/111.htm), at City Hall, and Torrance Main Library and Branch
Libraries beginning April 22, 2013. For those persons unable to attend the community
