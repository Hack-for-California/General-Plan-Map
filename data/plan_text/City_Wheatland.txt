GENERAL PLAN SUMMARY
 INTRODUCTION                            This General Plan sets out a long-term vision for the physical evolution
                                         of Wheatland and outlines policies, standards, and programs to guide
                                         day-to-day decisions concerning Wheatland’s development through
                                         the year 2025. Designed to meet State planning requirements, the
                                         General Plan consists of two documents: this General Plan Policy
                                         Document and a General Plan Background Report. This Policy
                                         Document is divided into two main parts. Part I is this General Plan
                                         Summary, which provides background about the General Plan and
                                         reviews the plan’s guiding principles and major themes and proposals.
                                          The lengthier and more detailed Part II of the Policy Document
                                         presents the City of Wheatland’s formal statements of General Plan
                                         policy in the form of goals, policies, standards, and implementation
                                         programs, expressed in both text and diagrams. Throughout this
                                         document, a symbol denotes more information is available to the left
                                         in the shaded text boxes.
PURPOSE AND                              Every city and county in California must adopt a general plan. A
                                         general plan is a legal document that serves as a community’s
NATURE OF THE                            constitution for land use and development. The plan must be
GENERAL PLAN                             comprehensive and long-term, outlining proposals for the physical
                                         development of the county or city, and any land outside its boundaries
                                         which in the planning agency’s judgment bears relation to its planning
                                         (Government Code Section 65300 et seq.)            The plan must be
                                         comprehensive in covering all territory within the adopting jurisdic-
                                         tion and it must be comprehensive in addressing all physical aspects of
                                         the community’s development. While State law does not define long-
                                         term, most general plans look 15 to 25 years into the future.
                                         Wheatland’s General Plan uses a time frame of 2025.
                                         State law specifically requires that the general plan address seven
                                         topics or elements.       These are land use, circulation, housing,
                                         conservation, open space, noise, and safety. The general plan may also
                                         address other topics the community feels are relevant to its
                                         development. For each topic addressed, the plan must analyze the
                                         significance of the issue in the community, set forth policy in text and
                                         diagrams, and outline specific programs for implementing these
                                         policies. The format and structure of the general plan is left to local
                                         discretion, but regardless of the format or issues addressed, all
                                         substantive parts of the plan must be consistent with one another.

                                                                                           GENERAL PLAN SUMMARY
                                        Preparing, adopting, and maintaining a general plan serves several
                                        important purposes:
                                                 Provides citizens with information about their community and
                                                 with opportunities to participate in setting goals and determin-
                                                 ing policies and standards for the community’s development;
                                                 Provides local decision makers and the community with a
                                                 forum for resolving conflicts among competing interests and
                                                 values;
                                                  Expands the capacity of local government to analyze local and
                                                  regional conditions and needs in order to respond effectively
                                                  to the problems and opportunities facing the community;
                                                 Fosters coordination of community development and environ-

IMPLEMENTING THE                         Carrying out the plan following its adoption requires a multitude of
                                         individual actions and ongoing programs involving virtually every
GENERAL PLAN                             City department and many other public agencies and private
                                         organizations. The legal authority for these various actions and
                                         programs rests on two essential powers of local government: corporate
                                         and police powers. Using their corporate power, local governments
                                         collect money through bonds, fees, assessments, and taxes, and spend
                                         it to provide services and facilities such as police and fire protection,
                                         streets, water systems, sewage disposal facilities, drainage facilities,
                                         and parks. Using their police power, local governments regulate the
                                         use of property through zoning, subdivision, and building regulations
                                         in order to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The
                                         general plan provides the formal and legal framework for the exercise
                                         of these powers by local officials.
                                         To ensure that the policies and proposals of the general plan are
                                         systematically implemented, State law since the early 1970s has
                                         increasingly insisted that the actions and decisions of each local
                                         government concerning both its own projects and the private projects

                                                                                          GENERAL PLAN SUMMARY
                                         it approves are consistent with its adopted general plan. The courts
                                         have supported and furthered this trend through their interpretations
                                         of State law. Generally, zoning must be consistent with the general
                                         plan. Local government approval of subdivisions must be consistent
                                         with the general plan. Local public works projects must be consistent
                                         with the general plan. The same is true for development agreements,
                                         redevelopment plans, specific plans, and many other plans and actions
                                         of cities and counties.
REVISING AND                             The general plan is a long-term document typically with a planning
                                         horizon of 15 to 25 years. To achieve its purposes, the plan must be
AMENDING THE                             sufficiently flexible to adjust to changing conditions and at the same
GENERAL PLAN                             time specific in guiding day-to-day land use and development
                                         decisions. Over the years, conditions and community needs change
                                         and new opportunities arise; the plan needs to keep up with these
                                         changes. Every year the Planning Commission should review the
                                         plan’s implementation programs to assess the City’s progress in
                                         carrying out the plan. Every five to seven years, the plan should be
                                         thoroughly reviewed and updated as necessary.
                                         From time to time, the City will entertain proposals for specific
                                         amendments to the plan. The City will initiate some of these proposals
                                         itself, but most will be initiated by property owners and developers.
                                         State law limits general plan amendments to four times per year, but
                                         each amendment can include multiple changes. Like the adoption of
                                         the general plan itself, general plan amendments are subject to
                                         environmental review, public notice, and hearing requirements and
                                         must not create inconsistencies with the rest of the plan.
REGIONAL SETTING                         Wheatland is located in Northern California’s Central Valley along
                                         State Route 65 (SR 65) in Yuba County. The city is located
AND PLANNING                             approximately one mile north of the Bear River and the tri county
AREA                                     boundary of Sutter, Placer, and Yuba Counties. Marysville (the county
                                         seat) and Yuba City, which are both about twelve miles to the north of
                                         Wheatland, are the closest cities of significant size. Sacramento is
                                         approximately forty miles to the south and Beale Air Force Base is
                                         located eight miles to the northeast. Wheatland is also the gateway
                                         city to Camp Far West, a recreation area of regional significance.
                                         Located within a primarily agricultural region, Wheatland is
                                         completely surrounded by agricultural lands.            Figure 1 shows
                                         Wheatland’s location within the county, region, and the State.
PLANNING AREA AND                        The Planning Area for the Wheatland General Plan covers
                                         approximately 4,650 acres and is bounded on the north by Dairy Road

                                         of land in which information has been collected for the General Plan
                                         Update. Figure 2 shows the boundaries of the Planning Area and

WHEATLAND’S                              The General Plan’s Study Area lies within the territory once claimed
                                         by the Valley Nisenan (or Southern Maidu) which are a Penutian-
HISTORICAL                               speaking central California group. Their traditional homelands once
DEVELOPMENT                              included the lower drainages of the American, Yuba, and Bear Rivers,
                                         and the lower reaches of the Feather River.
                                         Few villages occupied the valley plain between the Sacramento River
                                         and the foothills. Although both the valley and foothill people hunted
                                         and gathered there, the resource focus was along the edges of rich
                                         ecotones, either the rivers and the valley floor, or the valley floor and
                                         the foothills. The plains surrounding Wheatland fall in between these
                                         two rich ecotones, and consist of exposed terrain. It is not likely that
                                         Native Americans would have spent an appreciable amount of time in
                                         the Wheatland area, instead they would have resided in villages along
                                         the Yuba River to the north and the hills to the east.
Early European                           Early European settlement in the Wheatland area came with
                                         expeditions led by Gabriel Moraga in 1808 and Luis Arguello in 1821,
Settlement                               both of whom crossed portions of present day Yuba County.
                                         Throughout the 1820s and 1830s, Yuba County was visited by trappers
                                         from the Hudson’s Bay Company and American Fur Company, who
                                         exploited beaver and other fur resources.
                                         In 1822 California came under Mexican rule when Mexico became
                                         independent of Spain. As British and Americans were allowed to
                                         become Mexican citizens, they acquired large tracts of land granted to
                                         them by Mexico and initially dominated the business and commercial
                                         affairs of the region. John Sutter established land holdings that
                                         included much of what is now Yuba County. Sutter owned more than
                                         Mexican law permitted; therefore, he sublet parts of his estate to other
                                         settlers. In 1844, a Mexican who had been in the employ of Sutter, Don
                                         Pablo Guttierez, obtained a grant of five leagues on the north side of
                                         Bear River, now known as the Johnson Grant. The land grant, dated
                                         December 22, 1844, was first known as Rancho de Pablo, for Pablo
                                         Guttierez, the grantee. Wheatland falls within the center of this land
                                         grant.
                                         By 1849 there were a number of settlements along Bear River
                                         established by people engaged in mining, the livestock trade, trading
                                         post, sawmills, hotels, cutting hay, and raising cattle. Johnson’s Ranch
                                         provided a way station for teams engaging in hauling freight from
                                         Sacramento to the northern mines. It also became a stopping place for
                                         trappers, explorers, and travelers.

The Donner Party in                      In the 1840s Johnson’s Ranch was well known as the first settlement
                                         reached by the overland immigrants after crossing the Sierra and is
Wheatland                                considered to be the end of the Emigrant Trail. Here immigrants
                                         rested and obtained supplies, and it was even the base for survivors of
                                         the infamous Donner Party after they were rescued in 1847.
1849 Gold Rush                           During the gold rush of 1849, placer gold was recovered from creeks
                                         and streams near Wheatland. The gold rush helped to quickly
                                         populate the region with prospectors, entrepreneurs, and others
                                         seeking easy fortunes.
                                         During this time the first building were erected in Wheatland. These
                                         included a general store, saloon, blacksmith shop, hotel, and a few
                                         residences in the first year. It was not until 1871-72 that the sale of
                                         individual lots boomed.
Incorporation                            At the time of Wheatland’s incorporation in 1874, the population was
                                         900, of which 300 were Chinese. Most Chinese came to work on the
                                         railroad and service industries (laundries, restaurants, etc.) and later
                                         were employed as hop workers. A thriving Chinatown existed from
                                         the 1860s through the early 20th century, when anti-Chinese sentiment
                                         forced its relocation several times. The center of the Chinese burial
                                         rite was a ceremonial pyre near the Wheatland Cemetery where final
                                         meals were cooked for the deceased. The Chinese were buried nearby
                                         until they could be shipped back to China for final internment.
                                         Another significant event in Wheatland’s history was the inauguration
                                         of Mayor Edward P. Duplex in 1888. Mayor Duplex was the first
                                         African-American man to be elected mayor of a western United States
                                         city. His barbershop still stands today on Main Street in downtown.
Hop Farm Riots                           Hop raising on a small scale was carried on in Yuba County around
                                         the 1860s, and D.P. Durst planted the first hops in the Wheatland area
                                         in 1874. This ranch was the largest privately owned hops field in the
                                         world and Wheatland soon became known as the “Hop Center.”
                                         Migrant workers throughout the region were drawn to Durst’s ranch.
                                         The Durst hop ranch was also the scene of one of the first labor
                                         disturbances in California history. In 1913, violence erupted at a
                                         meeting organized by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) to
                                         protest low pay and intolerable living conditions of the hops pickers.
                                         The California State militia had to be called in to break up the riot,
                                         only after the sheriff, the district attorney, and two workers were
                                         killed. The organizers of the strike were later convicted of murder and
                                         sentenced to life imprisonment.
                                         In the wake of this tragedy, Governor Hiram Johnson created a
                                         commission to investigate the condition of migratory farm laborers,

                                                                                         GENERAL PLAN SUMMARY
                                         and some reform legislation was passed. However, no substantive
                                         improvements occurred and the influence of the IWW in the Central
                                         Valley waned. By 1925, Wheatland, then with a population of about
                                         450, was listed as the second largest hops producer, employing 4,000
                                         during harvest seasons. Later in the 1920s, frequent slumps in the
                                         hops commodity led the landowners and growers to turn to fruit and
                                         vegetables with marked success. Fruit and nut orchards soon replaced
                                         hops in importance. Four abandoned hop kilns at the E. Clemons
                                         Horst Ranch and the Damon Estate are reminders of an exciting period
                                         in Wheatland history.
Beale Air Force Base                     In 1942 the U.S. government selected 86,000 acres of land in Yuba and
                                         Nevada Counties for the establishment of an Army base, Camp Beale,
                                         seven miles east of Wheatland. With the formation of Camp Beale, the
                                         small communities of Erle, Waldo, and Spenceville declined. Camp
                                         Beale was used as a training base for armored and infantry divisions,
                                         as a personnel replacement depot, and as a German prisoner of war
                                         camp. Following World War II, the camp was declared surplus, and
                                         70 percent of the buildings were removed. Today, the base’s primary
                                         mission is to house the 9th Reconnaissance Wing, a branch of the Air
                                         Force that maintains U2 and Global Hawk spy planes. Many of the
                                         bases personnel and their families rely on support services in
                                         Wheatland.
Recent History                           Wheatland’s first subdivision was built in 1953 when Charles Nichols
                                         developed his property bordering the northeastern part of the city.
                                         Ten homes were built in the first project that led to the first housing
                                         development within the city. Wheatland’s rate of commercial and
                                         residential development has been slow relative to the growth rates of
                                         nearby areas such as Marysville/Yuba City and particularly south
                                         Placer County. Over 78 percent of the city’s housing was built prior to
                                         1960 and only 14 percent has been built since 1975.
EARLIER PLANNING                         The City first adopted a General Plan in August 1971, and later
                                         updated the plan in 1981. The 1981 update planned physical and
EFFORTS IN                               economic growth to the year 2000, and assumed a built out of the city
WHEATLAND                                limits with a population of 5,000 peopled by 2000. The plan also
                                         assumed significant traffic impacts to SR 65 by the year 2000. In
                                         retrospect, the plan accurately projected the conditions of the city in
                                         2000, although Wheatland’s actual population was about half (2,500).
                                         Since 1981 various elements of the Plan have been updated, including
                                         the Land Use Element and the Transportation and Circulation Element
                                         in 1986, and the Housing Element in 2005.
HOW THIS GENERAL                         The City of Wheatland initiated its General Plan Update in 2004 in
                                         response to regional and local population projections, two major

                                                                                           GENERAL PLAN SUMMARY
                                         capacity, and Dry Creek and Bear River flooding potential. The City
                                         retained planning consultants Mintier & Associates in February 2004
                                         to assist the City in its comprehensive update effort. The planning
                                         effort coordinated the General Plan update with five ongoing technical
                                         studies (Circulation and Fee Study, Housing Element Update,
                                         Wastewater Treatment Facilities Master Plan, Fire Protection Master
                                         Plan, and Fee Study) in order to analyze development constraints and
                                         opportunities for the community. The technical studies were primarily
                                         initiated in response to two development proposals, Heritage Oaks
                                         Estates and Jones Ranch, which needed further analysis before they
                                         could be approved.
                                         Through numerous Planning Commission and City Council study
  MORE INFO...                           sessions, the City developed five guiding principles for the General
Wheatland’s Steering                     Plan as well as exploring four growth alternatives. Following
Committee is comprised of                development of these principles and consideration of several of the
the City Council and                     major issues to be addressed in the new General Plan, the Steering
Planning Commission.                     Committee approved a Preferred Land Use Alternative on April 4,
                                         2005.
                                         Through the winter of 2004 and summer of 2005, the City held over 20
                                         meetings and workshops to review information developed as part of
                                         the General Plan Update.
                                         The policy direction provided by the General Plan Update Steering
                                         Committee through workshops and meetings laid the foundation for
                                         development of new policies and modification of existing policies for

ORGANIZATION OF                          The Wheatland General Plan consists of two documents: the
                                         Background Report and the Policy Document. The Background

                                         Wheatland, and provides the formal supporting documentation for
                                         general plan policies. The Background Report addresses the following
                                         seven subject areas:

                                         Part I is a summary of the General Plan, describing the nature and
                                         purpose of the plan, highlighting the guiding principles of the plan,
                                         and outlining the plan’s main proposals. It does not constitute formal
                                         general plan policy, but is rather a guide to understanding and
                                         interpreting Part II of the Policy Document.

                                         Part II contains explicit statements of goals, policies, standards,
                                         implementation programs, and quantified objectives that constitute
                                         the formal policy of the City of Wheatland for land use, development,
                                         and environmental quality. Part II is divided into the following
                                         chapters:
                                               Chapter 1:     Land Use and Community Character
                                               Chapter 2:     Transportation and Circulation

                                               Chapter 10:    Administration and Implementation
                                         Each chapter includes several goal statements relating to different sub-
                                         issues or different aspects of the topic addressed in the chapter. For
                                         each goal statement there are several policies that amplify the goal
                                         statement. Implementation programs are listed at the end of each
                                         policy section and describe briefly the proposed action, the City
                                         agencies or departments with primary responsibility for carrying out
                                         the program, and the time frame for accomplishing the program.
                                         Chapter 1 (Land Use and Community Character) contains the Land
                                         Use Diagram, describes the designations appearing on the Diagram,
                                         and outlines the standards of population density and building
                                         intensity for these land use designations. Chapter 2 (Transportation
                                         and Circulation) contains the Circulation Diagram and a description of
                                         the roadway classification system. Chapter 4 (Housing) also includes
                                         a statement of quantified housing objectives required by State law as
                                         part of the housing element.
                                         The following definitions describe the nature of the statements of
                                         goals, policies, standards, implementation programs, and quantified
                                         objectives as they are used in this document:
                                              Goal: The ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is
                                              general in nature and immeasurable.
                                              Policy: A specific statement in text or diagram guiding action and
                                              implying clear commitment.
                                              Standard: A specific, often quantified guideline, incorporated in a
                                              policy or implementation program, defining the relationship
                                              between two or more variables. Standards can often translate
                                              directly into regulatory controls.
                                              Implementation Program: An action, procedures, program, or

WHEATLAND                                The following discussions briefly describe growth projections, physical
                                         constraints, and the issues that provide the context for preparation and
GENERAL PLAN                             adoption of this General Plan.
CONTEXT
REGIONAL GROWTH                          Wheatland’s location just 40 miles north of Sacramento places it within
                                         one of the fastest growing regions in the state. Located on SR 65
PRESSURES                                between Marysville/Yuba City and Lincoln, Wheatland is subject to
                                         major growth pressures. This General Plan projects Wheatland’s
                                         population to increase from 3,000 in 2004 to 30,100 in 2025, while
                                         employment is projected to increase from 500 to 11,080 during the
                                         same time period. Wheatland has statutory obligations to try to meet
                                         its projected fair share of regional housing needs. This General Plan
                                         creates the capacity to accommodate projected growth through 2025,
                                         and also sets policies and standards to ensure orderly and high-quality
                                         development along with provision of needed public facilities and
                                         services.
PHYSICAL                                 The City has successfully phased growth and physical expansion over
                                         the years, leaving only a limited amount of land in 2005 for residential
CONSTRAINTS                              infill development. To accommodate projected growth over the long
                                         term, Wheatland must annex additional land outside of the city limits,
                                         continue infill development where land is avaliable, and encourage the
                                         re-use of underutilized lands. As discussed below, several physical
                                         constraints limit the ability of the city to expand.

                                                                                            GENERAL PLAN SUMMARY
                                         Floodplains
                                         Wheatland is surrounded by watercourses that periodically flood,
                                         mainly Dry Creek to the north and the Bear River to the south. Areas
                                         subject to 100- to 500-year flood events include the western part of the
                                         Study Area encompassing undeveloped land along Wheatland Road.
                                         Wastewater Treatment Facilities and Capacities
                                         The City’s existing (2006) wastewater collection and treatment system
                                         can only accommodate growth within the city limits. The domestic
                                         wastewater treatment plant is located south of the city, adjacent to the
                                         Bear River levee. As part of the General Plan Update, a study was
                                         prepared that analyzed the possibility of increasing the capacity of the
                                         existing wastewater treatment plant, or constructing a new plant to
                                         meet current and future needs. The City’s domestic wastewater
                                         treatment plant, however, represents a major City investment and the
                                         General Plan provides options and recommendations for its eventual
                                         relocation within the time frame of this General Plan (2025). Issues of
                                         compatibility of development adjacent to the treatment plant also limit
                                         the type and configuration of development that might be appropriate.
COMMUNITY FORM AND                       Wheatland has a strong historic heritage, which is reflected in the
                                         stock of historic buildings in the city’s Downtown. Wheatland’s
CHARACTER                                agricultural setting is largely responsible for the community’s distinct
                                         identity and plays an important economic role in Wheatland.
                                         Role of Downtown
                                         Wheatland’s Downtown is an important symbol of the city’s small-
                                         town atmosphere and historic heritage. Maintaining the Downtown as
                                         the center of government, specialty retail, entertainment, and culture is
                                         important to preserving Wheatland’s small-town atmosphere as the
                                         city grows. A centralized Downtown also helps knit the community
                                         together as a place where everyone in the community gathers.
                                         Maintaining Downtown’s central location and accessibility in the
                                         larger city is important to achieving this goal. Providing for expansion
                                         of the district’s girded street pattern to the east reinforces Downtown’s
                                         centralized location and accessibility.
                                         Residential Neighborhoods
                                         To ensure that Wheatland maintains its small-town feeling and quality
                                         of life, the General Plan seeks to preserve existing neighborhoods, and
                                         to promote development of new neighborhoods that incorporate the
                                         best qualities of existing neighborhoods. While new neighborhoods
                                         should reflect a mix of housing types and sizes, similar to the existing
                                         city, the General Plan also provides for more employment center and
                                         commercial/retail growth.
Wheatland General Plan Policy Document, Part I               10                                            July 11, 2006

                                                                                         GENERAL PLAN SUMMARY
                                         Integration of Schools and Parks with Residential Neighborhoods
                                         The City wants to create elementary school and neighborhood park
                                         nodes within or adjacent to low-density residential neighborhoods.
                                         These nodes will be evenly distributed in new neighborhoods and will
                                         be within walking distance (typically ¼ of a mile) from housing.
                                         Desire for Economic Development
                                         The City wants to maintain a healthy balance of jobs and housing to
                                         reduce the need for commuting outside of Wheatland and to attract
                                         commercial and industrial uses to improve Wheatland’s economy.
                                         The General Plan promotes development of a diverse employment
                                         base through the employment land use designation. This designation
                                         allows for uses such as business parks, research and development
                                         facilities, biotechnology, and other light industry. The Plan also
                                         capitalizes on Wheatland’s location near Beale Air Force Base and
                                         along the major transportation corridor of SR 65.
                                         Public Facilities and Services
                                         The provision and maintenance of public facilities and services,
                                         including water, sewer, storm drainage, law enforcement, fire
                                         protection, parks and recreational facilities, schools, and other civic
                                         services are important to the quality of life of Wheatland residents.
                                         The General Plan addresses these services by setting service level
                                         standards that the City should strive to maintain, and by establishing
                                         the framework for financing the development and ongoing
                                         maintenance of these services.
                                         Pedestrian, Bicycle, and Transit Opportunities
                                         Promoting opportunities for pedestrian, bicycle, and bus travel is an
                                         important feature of the General Plan. Designing new development to
                                         encourage bicycling, walking, and bus use reduces the use of
                                         automobiles, with associated advantages of reducing air pollution and
                                         traffic congestion, and allowing people without cars to travel easily
                                         throughout the community. These development patterns also bring
                                         people out of their homes, creating friendlier neighborhoods, an
                                         important feature of Wheatland’s small-town feeling.
GUIDING                                  The General Plan sets the framework for future growth and develop-
                                         ment within which Wheatland can expand while still maintaining the
PRINCIPLES OF THE                        small-town feeling and quality of life that are so important to
GENERAL PLAN                             Wheatland residents. The major theme of the General Plan is to retain
                                         and build upon Wheatland’s small-town and neighborhood qualities
                                         while achieving an economically-healthy and self-sufficient
                                         community.

                                         implementation programs which constitute the formal substance of the
                                         plan.
ORDERLY                                       1. Balance development on both sides of existing SR 65 and the
                                                 railroad tracks.
DEVELOPMENT
                                         The General Plan provides for urban development and expansion of
                                         associated services on a logical and incremental basis to accommodate
                                         projected population and employment growth through the year 2025.
                                         To facilitate this growth while retaining the community qualities so
                                         valued in Wheatland, the General Plan calls for a balance of
                                         development on either side of SR 65 /the Union Pacific railroad tracks.
                                         The General Plan encourages infill development and adaptive reuse of
                                         underutilized and vacant buildings within the existing downtown
                                         area. The General Plan also designates land for new commercial and
                                         industrial development to meet projected growth. Commercial
                                         development is concentrated in downtown along Front Street, and in
                                         various nodes throughout the city. New employment development is
                                         located along the existing SR 65 and railroad tracks and the proposed
                                         eastern SR 65 bypass (approximately Jasper Lane).
DOWNTOWN                                      2. Reinforce downtown as the traditional and cultural core of
                                                  the city, but not as the central commercial district.
REVITALIZATION
                                         With an impressive stock of historic buildings that tie the community
                                         to its past, Downtown is the center of community activity and a
                                         primary source of Wheatland’s identity. The General Plan seeks to
                                         preserve Downtown’s central location and its function as a center for
                                         community activities by encouraging the City’s revitalization efforts
                                         and considering the effects of other land use decisions on Downtown
                                         vitality. The Plan also directs that the traditional street grid and block
                                         pattern be extended to the east and south, and that a new community
                                         center and park be built adjacent to the hop kilns.
RESIDENTIAL                                   3. Emphasize neighborhood–oriented growth to retain small
                                                  town feel.
NEIGHBORHOODS
                                         The General Plan seeks to maintain Wheatland’s quality of life by
                                         preserving and enhancing the best qualities of its existing
                                         neighborhoods and promoting the development of new
                                         neighborhoods with similar qualities. At the same time, the Plan seeks
                                         to foster healthy and attractive commercial and industrial sectors. The
                                         General Plan seeks to preserve Wheatland’s unique identity by
                                         promoting          walkable      residential    neighborhoods,          with
                                         commercial/elementary school/park nodes surrounded by housing.

                                                                                        GENERAL PLAN SUMMARY
ECONOMIC GROWTH                               4. Create a strong local employment base.
                                         The General Plan seeks to capitalize on Wheatland’s location and
                                         assets by supporting and assisting business development that meets
                                         local and regional needs. To this end, the Plan designates sufficient
                                         land to accommodate projected demand and provides for services
                                         sufficient to meet employment and commercial needs. The Plan also
                                         includes provisions for housing to meet the needs of new workers.
                                         The Plan seeks to diversify Wheatland’s economic base by promoting
                                         more primary-wage-earner jobs through business and office parks;
                                         high-tech, bio-tech and research and development industries to
                                         support Beale Air Force Base; and tourism.
STATE ROUTE 65 BYPASS                         5. Plan the city to accommodate eventual development of a SR 65
                                                 bypass.
                                         The General Plan establishes a recommended location for the eastern
                                         bypass of SR 65. Adjacent to the bypass will be local and regional
                                         employment and commercial uses, capitalizing on regional
                                         commuters.
SUMMARY OF                               As indicated earlier, the formal policy content of the General Plan is
                                         contained in Part II of this Policy Document. Part II is divided into ten
MAJOR GENERAL                            chapters, each of which deals with a broad topic and several sub-issues
PLAN PROPOSALS                           related to the main topic. The following is a chapter-by-chapter
                                         summary of the major proposals set forth in the Wheatland General
                                         Plan, including references to show how the goals, policies,
                                         implementation programs, and diagrams in each chapter relate to the
                                         major themes described above.
CHAPTER 1:                               This part is the most familiar of all of the policy chapters in the
                                         General Plan. It contains the Land Use Diagram that prescribes uses
LAND USE AND                             for all of the General Plan Area, describes standards for each of the
COMMUNITY                                land use designations shown on the Land Use Diagram, and defines a
CHARACTER                                series of goals, policies, and programs designed to guide decisions
                                         concerning land use, development, and environmental protection in
                                         Wheatland.

Land Use Diagram                         The Land Use Diagram includes 10 land use designations falling
                                         within 5 major categories, as shown in the following chart:

                                         It is important that the users of this Policy Document understand that
                                         the goals, policies, standards and programs described in Part II are as
                                         important, if not more so, than the Land Use Diagram in representing
                                         the City’s land use and development policy. Accordingly, any
                                         development proposals or review thereof must consider this Policy
                                         Document as a whole, rather than focusing solely on the Land Use
                                         Diagram or on particular policies and programs.
                                         Following are summaries of the General Plan’s key land use proposals
                                         according to each of the major designation categories that appear on
                                         the Land Use Diagram.
Residential Land Use                     The four residential designations that appear on the Land Use
                                         Diagram combine with a set of residential and neighborhood
                                         development policies to create a strong foundation for preservation
                                         and maintenance of Wheatland’s existing healthy residential
                                         neighborhoods, improvement of other residential areas, and
                                         establishment of new residential development that follows principles
                                         that will create vital neighborhoods.
Low!Density Residential
                                         Residential policies of the plan emphasize two main themes. First,
                                         preservation and enhancement of the city’s existing neighborhoods is
                                         promoted through maintenance and rehabilitation efforts and through
                                         continued infill development that maintains the character of existing
                                         neighborhoods. Second, new residential development is to occur in
                                         distinct neighborhoods that incorporate a range of support services
                                         essential to day-to-day living, including parks, schools, and
                                         neighborhood shopping opportunities, and that encourage walking
Low!Medium Density Residential
                                         and bicycling use.
                                         Existing residential areas are designated with a mix of designations.
                                         Low-Density Residential is the primary residential category reflecting
                                         typical single family housing. Low-Medium-Density Residential
                                         covers areas developed with single family homes at a slightly higher
                                         density. Medium-Density Residential is found in various pockets

                                                                                         GENERAL PLAN SUMMARY
                                         throughout the community and includes attached and detached
                                         housing at higher densities. High-Density Residential is located near
                                         employment centers and neighborhood nodes to provide attached
                                         housing for a combination of rental and ownership opportunities

Commercial Land Use                      The Commercial designation allows for a mix of commercial uses. The
                                         Plan envisions expansion of regional commercial services adjacent to
and Development                          the proposed SR 65 bypass, the Downtown, and the northeastern
                                         portion of the Planning Area.
                                         The Mixed-Use designation covers infill areas in Downtown. These
                                         areas requite a mix of housing and commercial uses on the same
                                         site/building and encourage housing at increased densities within the
                                         Downtown area.
                                         In addition, the plan promotes continued infill development and reuse
                                         of vacant and underutilized commercial centers.
Employment Land Use                      The Employment designation is applied primarily in areas of the city
                                         that have adequate access to existing SR 65, the proposed SR 65
and Development                          bypass, and the ring-road. This land use will implement the City’s
                                         desire to attract primary-wage-earner jobs, such as high technology
                                         and biotechnology uses. The plan also includes a chapter promoting
                                         economic development in Wheatland.

                                                                                          GENERAL PLAN SUMMARY
Public and Open Space                    Public uses represent an important element in the overall fabric of a
                                         community. Accordingly, this Policy Document provides a framework
Land Use                                 for development of such public uses as government offices and
                                         facilities, schools, and parks and recreation facilities. Recognizing the
                                         status of governmental services, this Policy Document supports the
                                         maintenance of a vital public presence in Downtown. In addition, this
                                         Policy Document includes land use policies and programs that
                                         recognize and reinforce the essential role that public uses (i.e., parks
                                         and schools) play in the development and maintenance of healthy
                                         neighborhoods.
Urban Reserve                            The General Plan designates the area east of Japer Lane and west of
                                         Grasshopper Slough as Urban Reserve, indicating that the City will
                                         study this area and consider it for future development.                 No
                                         development can occur within the Urban Reserve area without a
                                         General Plan amendment.
CHAPTER 2:                               The General Plan addresses several transportation issues that are
                                         critical to the continued development of Wheatland. The Circulation
TRANSPORTATION                           Diagram depicts the proposed circulation system to support
AND CIRCULATION                          development under the Land Use Diagram. This circulation system is
                                         represented on the diagram as a set of roadway classifications that
                                         have been developed to guide Wheatland’s long-range planning and
                                         programming. Roadways are systematically classified based on the
                                         linkages they provide and their function, both of which reflect their
                                         importance to the land use pattern, traveler, and general welfare.
                                         New roadways required to serve new development include an eastern
                                         bypass for SR 65, an arterial “ring-road” that will connect the city west
                                         to east, and provide access across the existing SR 65 and the railroad
                                         tracks. In addition, several arterial and collector streets would be
                                         extended from the north to south to serve the new area of planned
                                         residential development.
                                         In addition to addressing future roadway plans and improvements,
                                         Chapter 3 of Part II of this Policy Document contains goals, policies,
                                         and programs related to the following issues:
                                                         Street and Roadway System
                                                         Regional Coordination
                                                         Residential Streets
                                                         Automobile Parking
                                                         Transit Facilities and Services

                                         The overall emphasis of the policies and programs under these
                                         headings is the establishment and maintenance of a well-rounded
                                         transportation network that includes fully-connected and intersecting
                                         streets, pedestrian paths, and bike paths.
CHAPTER 3:                               This chapter addresses the economic development issues. Key issues
                                         include the maintenance and enhancement of the quality of life in

DEVELOPMENT                              industries and businesses in the community; encouraging the
                                         development of new industries and businesses in the community
                                         thereby creating new jobs for Wheatland residents; and preserving and
                                         enhancing the rich historic character of the community.
                                         Redevelopment and public and private partnerships will be important
                                         in stimulating these activities.
                                         This chapter contains goals, policies and implementation programs
                                         that provide the framework for economic development for the city of
                                         Wheatland. The goals and policies of this section are organized
                                         topically according to the following categories, each of which relates to
                                         a particular economic development focus:
                                                         Business Attraction and Formation
                                                         Downtown Economic Development
                                                         Tourism
CHAPTER 4:                               This chapter includes goals, policies, and programs for the general
                                         provision of housing in Wheatland and quantified objectives for the
HOUSING                                  development of housing for the years 2005 through 2008.
                                         The chapter includes four primary housing goals as follows:
                                        1.     Provide for the City’s regional share of new housing for all
                                               income groups.
                                        2.     Improve/conserve the supply of existing housing.
                                        3.     Meet the special housing needs of homeless persons, seniors, large
                                               families, disabled persons, and farmworkers.
                                        4.     Ensure equal housing opportunity
                                         The policies and programs encourage the construction of housing to:
                                         meet the city’s projected housing needs for very low-, low-, and
                                         moderate-income households; provide for decent housing for all
                                         income levels, emergency shelters, and housing for other groups with
                                         special needs; provide for a balance of residents and jobs; preserve
                                         existing residential neighborhoods; and ensure safe, sanitary housing.

                                                                                           GENERAL PLAN SUMMARY
                                         Policies also encourage the conservation and rehabilitation of existing
                                         dwelling units as well as for the development of new housing.
                                         This chapter addresses the City’s housing production targets through
                                         the time frame of the element, which are the City’s quantified
                                         objectives pursuant to State housing law.
CHAPTER 5:                               An important result of comprehensive planning should be the
                                         assurance that all facilities and services needed to adequately serve
PUBLIC FACILITIES                        development will be provided in a timely fashion. While the
AND SERVICES                             development of detailed plans for facilities and services is beyond the
                                         purview of the General Plan, the General Plan does establish a
                                         framework for guiding planning decisions related to facility
                                         development and service provision. The general emphasis of the
                                         policies and programs in Chapter 4 of Part II is on ensuring the
                                         provision and maintenance of adequate services, while discouraging
                                         unnecessary, wasteful, or inefficient extension of existing systems or
                                         development of new facilities. Specifically, this Policy Document
                                         contains goals, policies, and programs related to the following facilities
                                         and services:
                                                    General Public Facilities and Services
                                                    Public Facilities and Services Funding
                                                    Water Supply and Delivery
                                                    Wastewater Collection, Treatment, Disposal, and Reuse
                                                    Stormwater Drainage
                                                    Solid Waste Collection and Disposal
                                                    Law Enforcement
                                                    Fire Protection
                                                    Gas and Electric Services
                                                    Information Technology
                                         The policies and programs articulated under these headings will
                                         ensure that current and future residents of and businesses in
                                         Wheatland are served by a well-rounded, efficient, and
                                         environmentally-sound system of public facilities and services.
CHAPTER 6:                               The diversity and quality of life in Wheatland is reflected in its
                                         recreational, educational, and other community services. The City
RECREATIONAL,                            develops and maintains public parks, but this meets only part of the
EDUCATIONAL, AND                         community’s need for recreation. The need for park facilities and
COMMUNITY SERVICES                       recreation services span all age and income groups. The General Plan
                                         sets the framework for an expanded park and open space trail system
                                         with facilities to provide opportunities for a wide variety of
                                         recreational activities.
                                         City decisions concerning growth and development affect school and
                                         child care facilities, and the City has an important role to play in the
                                         siting and planning of these facilities. The General Plan also promotes

                                                                                            GENERAL PLAN SUMMARY
                                         the creation of a civic center with library services and arts and cultural
                                         activities.
                                         The goals, policies, and programs in Chapter 5 of Part II of this Policy
                                         Document articulate the City of Wheatland’s commitment to ensuring
                                         high quality recreational and educational opportunities for Wheatland
                                         residents and visitors, and promote a high quality of life for all
                                         segments of Wheatland’s population. The policy content of the section
                                         is divided into the following eight topics:
                                                •    Parks and Recreation Development Framework
                                                •    Civic Center
                                                •    Senior Center
                                                •    Education
                                                •    School Siting and Financing
                                                •    Child Care Supply and Quality
                                                •    Libraries

CHAPTER 7:                               Wheatland has a rich historic heritage, and contains many significant
                                         historic buildings, districts, events, and artifacts which reflect its past.
HISTORIC                                 These are symbols of Wheatland’s unique heritage and identity.
PRESERVATION
                                         The General Plan sets the framework for comprehensive efforts to
                                         foster historic preservation in Downtown Wheatland through a
                                         systematic program, community education, and coordination within
                                         the City and with other historic preservation groups.
                                         The goals and policies of this chapter are organized topically according
                                         to the following categories:
                                                     •  Historic Preservation - General
                                                     •  Economic Incentives for Historic Preservation
                                                     •  Historic Preservation Education and Awareness
                                                     •  Archaeological Resources
CHAPTER 8:                               Wheatland’s environmental resources (water, vegetation, wildlife, and
                                         open space) contribute to the city’s economy and are important
ENVIRONMENTAL                            elements in the quality of life of Wheatland’s residents. These natural
RESOURCES                                resources exist in limited quality and are at risk of destruction or
                                         degradation through continued urban development. The General Plan
                                         seeks to balance the need for growth with the need for conservation
                                         and enhancement of the area’s natural resources, frequently in
                                         cooperation with other agencies. This chapter addresses the following
                                         issues:
                                                     •   Water Resources
                                                     •   Fish and Wildlife Habitat

                                           The following definitions describe the nature of the statements of
                                           goals, policies, standards, implementation programs, and
                                           quantified objectives as they are used in this document:
                                           Goal: The ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is
                                                general in nature and immeasurable.
                                           Policy: A specific statement in text or diagram guiding action and
                                                implying clear commitment.
                                           Standard: A specific, often quantified guideline, incorporated in a
                                                policy or implementation program, defining the relationship
                                                between two or more variables. Standards can often translate
                                                directly into regulatory controls.
                                           Implementation Program: An action, procedures, program, or
                                                technique that carries out general plan policy. Implementation
                                                programs also specify primary responsibility for carrying out
                                                the action and a time frame for its accomplishment.
                                           Quantified Objective (Housing Element only): The number of
                                                housing units that the City expects to be constructed and the
                                                number of households the City expects will be assisted through
                                                housing programs and based on general market conditions
                                                during the time frame of the Housing Element (Chapter 4).
GUIDING PRINCIPLES                         The following five guiding principles provide the foundation for

                                                  railroad tracks.
                                          2.      Reinforce Downtown as the traditional and cultural core of
                                                  the city, but not as the central commercial district.
                                          3.      Emphasize neighborhood–oriented growth to retain small

CHAPTER 1
LAND USE AND COMMUNITY CHARACTER
This chapter outlines proposed patterns of land use and policies and standards for future
development and redevelopment. This chapter is divided into two major sections. The first section
includes the Land Use Diagram and the related land use classification system and standards. The
second section contains goals, policies, and implementation programs related to existing and future
land use and development.
LAND USE DIAGRAM The most familiar part of any general plan is the land use diagram
AND STANDARDS                        showing the types and locations of existing and future
                                     development the plan envisions. To appreciate and use the various
                                     designations shown on the diagram, the reader must first
                                     understand the purpose of each designation and the uses and
                                     standards associated with the designation. The following sections
                                     describe the standards and outline the allowable uses for each of
                                     the designations shown on the City of Wheatland’s General Plan
                                     Land Use Diagram.
GENERAL PLAN AREA                    The General Plan Area includes all land designated for or to be
                                     considered for future development as part of Wheatland. This
                                     boundary is the same as the City’s Sphere of Influence, and
                                     includes areas designated for urban reserve. Figure 2 shows the
                                     boundary of the General Plan Area and Figure 3 is the General Plan
                                     Land Use Diagram.
DEVELOPMENT                          The Land Use Diagram shows ten land use designations. These are
STANDARDS                            defined in the following subsection. State law mandates that
                                     general plans include standards of population density and building
                                     intensity for all of the territory covered by the plan. To satisfy this
                                     requirement, the General Plan includes such standards for each of
                                     the land use designations appearing on the Land Use Diagram.
                                     These standards are stated differently for residential and non-
                                     residential development. Following are explanations of how these
                                     standards operate.
                                     RESIDENTIAL USES
                                      Standards of population density for residential uses can be derived
                                      by multiplying the maximum allowable number of dwelling units
                                      per gross acre by the average number of persons per dwelling unit

The overall focus of this section is on setting standards and policies for future development and
redevelopment in Wheatland, focusing on high-quality, orderly growth to achieve a balance in
residential, commercial, and employment development. Development should occur consistent with
the City’s ability to assimilate growth and maintain the small-town feeling and quality of life in
Wheatland.
CITYWIDE GROWTH                      Located along SR 65 in the northern part of the Sacramento
AND DEVELOPMENT                      metropolitan area, many forces are encouraging new residential
                                     and employment development in Wheatland. The General Plan
                                     projects population growth from approximately 3,178 in 2004 to
                                     30,100 by 2025. During the same period, the Plan projects
                                     employment to increase from 500 (2003) to 11,080 (2025) based on
                                     projected population growth. The General Plan designates land to
                                     accommodate projected growth through 2025 and to achieve a
                                     balance of residential and employment opportunities.

                                     environmental needs, while preserving Wheatland’s small town
                                     character, and historic significance.

RESIDENTIAL                          Wheatland’s character is largely determined by the quality of its
DEVELOPMENT                          neighborhoods. The city’s neighborhoods reflect a mix of housing
                                     types, sizes, and architectural styles. To provide for projected
                                     population growth and associated economic development, the
                                     General Plan designates additional residential land to
                                     accommodate projected residential demand through 2025 in a mix
                                     of housing types and densities. Policies of the Plan address the
                                     overall quality and style of the new residential development. Infill,
                                     reuse, and intensification within developed areas is encouraged, as
                                     long as it reflects the character of the surrounding neighborhood
                                     and does not result in significant negative effects. Policy section
                                     1.C addresses the development of new residential neighborhoods
                                     and Section 1.D addresses conservation of existing neighborhoods.

URBAN RESERVE                          The Land Use Diagram designates the area east of Jasper Lane,
                                       portions of the Study Area between the county line and the Bear
                                       River, and a small area north of Dry Creek, as Urban Reserve.
                                       This indicates that the City will study this area and may consider
                                       it for future development. Policies of this section call for the City
                                       to study the implications of future development of the Urban
                                       Reserve area to determine if this area is feasible and appropriate
                                       for future development.

                                                permitted without a General Plan amendment. No General
                                                Plan amendment will be considered without an analysis
                                                that includes the factors listed in Policy 1.H.2.
                                       1.H.2. The City shall, when deemed necessary, consider the
                                                appropriateness of development of Urban Reserve lands
                                                based upon the following factors:
                                                a. Possible location and mix of land uses.

AGRICULTURE                            Wheatland’s agricultural surroundings play a central role in its
                                       history and character of the community. The continued growth of
                                       Wheatland will inevitably convert agricultural land to urban uses.
                                       Policies of the plan, however, seek to maintain agricultural uses as
                                       long as possible and to protect adjacent agricultural lands from
                                       the negative effects of urban development.

                                                lands to avoid adverse effects on agricultural operations.
                                       1.I.2. The City shall support the local agricultural economy by
                                                encouraging the location of agricultural support industries
                                                in the city, establishing and promoting marketing of local

                                                needs of agricultural labor.
                                       1.I.3. The City shall promote good neighbor policy between

CHAPTER 2
TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION
A city is both defined and constrained by the network of highways, roads, and railroads that move its
residents and goods through and in and out of the city. While Wheatland is not a large city, mobility
through the city is hindered by congestion on SR 65 and the Union Pacific railroad tracks. The
General Plan provides for the development of new roads, overpasses, and the widening and
improvement of existing roadways to serve new development. It also promotes alternative forms of
transportation to reduce air pollution, reduce the need for costly roadway improvements, and
facilitate the travel of those who cannot or do not wish to use automobiles for all their trips.
This chapter addresses various transportation issues, including automobile travel and parking,
transit, non-motorized transportation (e.g., bicycle and pedestrian travel), and freight movement
(truck and rail). It is divided into two major sections. The first, Circulation Diagram and Standards,
describes the Circulation Diagram and the roadway classification system and standards. The second
section includes the goals, policies, and implementation programs related to the various forms of
transportation.

                                      provide for effective and efficient traffic movement is the Circulation
                                      Diagram and its associated standards.
CIRCULATION DIAGRAM                   The Circulation Diagram (Figure 4) depicts the proposed circulation
                                      system to support development under the Land Use Diagram. This
                                      circulation system is represented on the diagram as a set of roadway
                                      classifications that have been developed to guide Wheatland’s long-
                                      range planning and programming. Roadways are systematically
                                      classified based on the linkages they provide and their function, both
                                      of which reflect their importance to the land use pattern, traveler,
                                      and general welfare.
                                      New major roadways required to serve new development include an
                                      eastern bypass to SR 65 and an arterial ring-road that will encompass
                                      the existing city limits. This new roadway would include grade
                                      separated crossings of SR 65 in the absence of relocating SR 65 and

                                      portion of the ring-road to the southern portion, and also will link
                                      the ring-road with the Downtown. In addition, several collector

                                     development on all sides of the city.
                                     Relocation of SR 65 and the Union Pacific railroad tracks to the east
                                     of the existing Downtown, parallel to Jasper Lane, could dramatically
                                     change the circulation and development characteristics of central
                                     Wheatland. Relocation of these two important elements of the city’s
                                     circulation system continues to be evaluated.
ROADWAY                              Roadways serve two functions that tend to conflict from a design
CLASSIFICATIONS                      standpoint: provide mobility and provide property access. High and
                                     constant speeds are desirable for mobility, while low speeds are more
                                     desirable for property access. A functional classification system
                                     provides for specialization in meeting the access and mobility
                                     requirements of the development permitted under the General Plan.
                                     Local streets emphasize property access; arterials emphasize high
                                     mobility for through-traffic; and collectors attempt to achieve a
                                     balance between both functions.
                                     Figure 2-1, the Circulation Diagram, presents the official functional
                                     classification of existing and proposed streets, roadways, and
                                     highways in Wheatland.             The hierarchy of the functional
                                     classifications in the city consists of principal arterials, minor
                                     arterials, collectors, and local roads and streets as described below.
                                     The Circulation Diagram depicts the arterial and collector roadway
                                     system in Wheatland. All other roadways not identified on the
                                     Circulation Diagram are classified as local streets.
                                     Arterials are new roadways that emphasize mobility with limited
                                     access. These include freeways, expressways, and those arterials that
                                     are specifically designed to provide a high level of mobility with
                                     limited access to adjoining properties.
                                     Transitioning Arterials are existing arterials that interconnect with
                                     and augment the new arterial system while providing a somewhat
                                     lower level of travel mobility due to less stringent access limitations.
                                     Collectors provide a balanced function of land access and mobility
                                     within residential neighborhoods and commercial and industrial
                                     areas.
                                     Local Roads and Streets have a primary function to provide direct
                                     access to abutting lands and connections to the higher order
                                     functional classifications.
                                     Table 2-1 lists the City’s standards for the right-of-way required for
                                     local, collector, and arterial streets. Note that these standards apply
                                     only to City streets; State highways are not subject to local standards.

                                                                        TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION, Chapter 2
                                            below the LOS specified above. Where physical mitigation is
                                            infeasible, the City shall consider developing programs that
                                            enhance alternative access or otherwise minimize travel
                                            demand.
                                  2.A.4. The City shall assure that new development effectively links
                                            both sides of SR 65 and the railroad tracks at the north and
                                            south ends of town.
                                  2.A.5. The City shall strive to meet the level of service standards
                                            through a balanced transportation system that provides
                                            alternatives to the automobile and by promoting pedestrian,
                                            bicycle, and transit connections between employment areas
                                            and major residential and commercial areas.
                                  2.A.6. The City shall require an analysis of the effects of traffic from
                                            proposed major development projects. Each such project
                                            shall construct or fund improvements necessary to mitigate
                                            the effects of traffic from the project. Such improvements
                                            may include a fair share of improvements that provide
                                            benefits to others.
                                  2.A.7. The City shall proactively pursue financing in a timely
                                            manner for all components of the transportation system,
                                            including securing right of way, particularly an eastern
                                            alignment of the SR 65 bypass, to achieve and maintain
                                            adopted level of service standards.
                                  2.A.8. The City shall assess fees on new development sufficient to
                                            cover the fair share portion of that development's impacts on
                                            the local and regional transportation system.
                                  2.A.9. The City shall limit private access along arterial streets
                                            wherever possible.

                                            within its jurisdiction provide for the efficient flow of traffic.
                                            Therefore, the following shall be undertaken:
                                                  Minimize the number of intersections along arterials.
                                                  Reduce curb cuts along arterials through the use of
                                                  common access easements, backup lots, and other
                                                  design measures.
                                                  Provide grade separations at all major railroad
                                                  crossings with arterials, except for an at-grade crossing

REGIONAL                            The reduction of regional traffic congestion in Downtown
COORDINATION                        Wheatland is important to the quality of life and small-town
                                    character of Wheatland. At the same time, SR 65 provides needed
                                    regional connections which facilitate economic development. The
                                    General Plan calls for improvements to the regional transportation
                                    system, most notably an eastern bypass to SR 65. The General Plan
                                    also calls for exploration of the potential for relocation of the Union
                                    Pacific railroad tracks parallel to the SR 65 bypass to further reduce
                                    traffic congestion and reduce impediments to orderly development
                                    of Wheatland.

                                    systems, and to promote the financing and construction of a bypass
                                    to SR 65.
                                    POLICIES
                                    2.B.1. The City shall complete a study of the eastern SR 65 bypass
                                              alignment to reduce the use of Wheatland streets by regional
                                              through traffic, and shall provide corridor protection for the
                                              selected route.
                                    2.B.2. The City shall proactively pursue the relocation of the Union
                                              Pacific railroad tracks to parallel the relocated SR 65 eastern

                                              funding options for SR 65.
                                    2.B.5. The City shall ensure that Plan Lines for future roadways on
                                              the fringe of the city are prepared in coordination with the

                                                                        TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION, Chapter 2
AUTOMOBILE                            The General Plan requires that new development provide for
PARKING                               adequate and appropriately-located parking. Parking requirements
                                      are implemented primarily through the City’s Zoning Ordinance.
                                      GOAL 2.D
                                      To provide a sufficient amount of convenient, available, accessible,
                                      safe, and attractive parking to serve existing and new development
                                      throughout the city as needed.
Parking                               POLICIES
                                      2.D.1. The City shall require provision of adequate off-street
                                                parking in conjunction with new development. The
                                                adequacy and appropriateness of parking requirements in
                                                the Zoning Ordinance shall be periodically reevaluated.
                                      2.D.2. The City shall require that parking lots be designed for
                                                maximum pedestrian safety and convenience, motorist
                                                convenience and safety, and handicapped access.
                                      2.D.3. The City shall continue to implement Zoning Ordinance
                                                parking standards that establish minimum and maximum
                                                number of spaces for parking lots.
                                      2.D.4. The City shall require new parking lots to be designed to
                                                minimize visual impacts on public roadways and
                                                neighboring areas.
                                      2.D.5. The City shall allow shared parking where different adjacent
                                                uses generate peak parking demand at different times.
TRANSIT                               The availability of a good transit system provides alternatives to
FACILITIES AND                        automobile use, and is especially important for those who cannot or
                                      do not drive. As Wheatland grows, the potential for transit use and
SERVICES
                                      the need for transit will increase. Policies of the General Plan
                                      support the enhancement of the existing transit system, especially in
                                      connection with new development.
                                      GOAL 2.E
                                      To promote a safe and efficient transit system to reduce congestion,
                                      improve the environment, and provide viable non-automotive
                                      means of transportation in and through Wheatland.

                                              responsive to growth patterns and existing and future transit
                                              demand.
                                    2.E.2. The City shall consider the transit needs of senior, disabled,
                                              minority, low-income, and transit-dependent persons in
                                              making decisions regarding transit services and in
                                              compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
                                    2.E.3. The City shall consider families’ needs in transportation
                                              planning efforts and shall promote safe and convenient
                                              methods of transportation between school, home, retail
                                              shopping, and child care.
                                    2.E.4. The City shall encourage the creation of rail transit to link
                                              Wheatland with Marysville/Yuba City and the Sacramento
                                              Area.
                                    2.E.5. The City shall work with Yuba-Sutter Transit to locate bus
                                              turnouts and shelters throughout the city.
NON-                                Non-motorized transportation includes pedestrian and bicycle
MOTORIZED                           travel. Making it easier for Wheatland residents and workers to
                                    bike or walk not only reduces automobile trips, with benefits for air

                                    quality, but it also promotes greater community interaction, one of
                                    the small-town qualities the General Plan seeks to preserve and
                                    enhance. Non-motorized transportation also reduces the demand
                                    for street and road widening and maintenance and also reduces the
                                    demand for parking areas and related land required for
                                    development.
                                    Policies of the General Plan seek to establish a comprehensive bike
                                    system and design new development to foster walking and
                                    bicycling.
                                    GOAL 2.F
                                    To provide a safe, comprehensive, and integrated system of facilities
                                    for non-motorized transportation for both transportation and
                                    recreation.

CHAPTER 3
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Business activity is part of the city’s fabric, providing a source of jobs and livelihood, and also
providing for the wants and needs of residents and visitors. It is crucial that economic development
be balanced with adequate housing for city resident workers and that it contributes to the character
and quality of life in Wheatland. The city’s economic health affects its quality of life as well as its
ability to achieve the wide range of goals identified in the General Plan.
This chapter addresses economic development for the city of Wheatland. A key issue includes the
maintenance and enhancement of the quality of the life in Wheatland by encouraging the
development of new industries and businesses. Businesses locate and expand in a community for a
variety of reasons, including location, available work force, adequacy of infrastructure and resources,
availability of land, incentives, and quality of life in the community. Wheatland has many
advantages for economic development, including its location along SR 65, and its proximity to the
Yuba-Sutter, Roseville-Rocklin-Lincoln, and Sacramento metropolitan areas. The city is also uniquely
located near Beale Air Force Base and the Camp Far West Reservoir Recreational Area. The city also

                                      tourists and, therefore, positively affect sales tax revenues.

                                      groups should be encouraged to create a regional draw of
                                      individuals to the community. Recreational entertainment and
                                      cultural facilities and activities for youth should also be
                                      encouraged to provide this service to the youth of the Wheatland
                                      community as well as to encourage tourism.

CHAPTER 4
HOUSING
The Housing Element is a comprehensive assessment of current and projected housing needs for all
economic segments of the community. It sets forth local housing policies and programs to implement
those policies. The element is different than other elements in the General Plan Policy Document
because it requires coordination, review, and approval by the State of California’s Department of
Housing and Community Development.
The Housing Element consists of two documents: The Background Report and the Policy Document.
The Background Report is designed to meet housing element requirements to provide information
and analysis to support the goals, policies, programs, and quantified objectives in the Housing
Element Policy Document. The Public Review Draft Housing Element Background Report dated July
1, 2004, was made available for public review on July 2, 2004. Comments on the Background Report
were submitted to the City by August 12, 2004. After comments were submitted to the City, the City
Council adopted the Housing Element on May 6, 2005. The following chapter is the City of
Wheatland’s adopted Housing Element Policy Document.
HOUSING ELEMENT                      The Policy Document includes the following five sections:
SECTIONS
                                     Section I: Goals, Policies, and Implementation Programs
                                     This Housing Element Policy Document includes four goal
                                     statements. Under each goal statement, the element sets out
                                     policies that amplify the goal statement. Implementation programs
                                     are listed at the end of each sub-section and describe briefly the
                                     proposed action, the Time Frame for accomplishing the program,
                                     and funding source where it can be identified.
                                     The following are definitions of terminology used in the Housing
                                     Element Policy Document:
                                     Goal: The ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is
                                     general in nature and immeasurable.
                                     Policy: A specific statement in text or diagram guiding action and
                                     implying clear commitment.
                                     Standard: A specific, often quantified guideline, incorporated in a
                                     policy or implementation program, defining the relationship
                                     between two or more variables. Standards can often translate
                                     directly into regulatory controls.

                                                                                               HOUSING, Chapter 4
                                     Implementation Program: An action, procedures, program, or
                                     technique that carries out general plan policy. Implementation
                                     programs also specify primary responsibility for carrying out the
                                     action and a time frame for its accomplishment.
                                     Quantified Objective: The number of housing units that the City
                                     expects to be constructed and the number of households the City
                                     expects will be assisted through housing programs and based on
                                     general market conditions during the time frame of the Housing
                                     Element.
                                     In this document, the term “affordable housing” means housing
                                     affordable to very low-, low-, or moderate-income households.

                                     This section describes the available site capacity in Wheatland to
                                     meet housing needs. It estimates developable land available for
                                     residential uses in Wheatland, and the holding capacity for
                                     housing units based on this inventory.
                                     Section III: Quantified Objectives
                                     This section summarizes the quantified objectives for housing
                                     construction, conservation, and rehabilitation for the Housing
                                     Element planning period.
                                     Section IV: Public Participation
                                     This section describes the opportunities the City provided for
                                     public participation during the preparation of the updated
                                     Housing Element.
                                     Section V: Consistency with the General Plan
                                     This section describes the internal coordination between the
                                     updated Housing Element and the other elements of the updated
                                     General Plan.

                                                      could be met by housing affordable to moderate-

SECTION II:                          The following section provides an analysis of the land available for
ADEQUATE SITES                       residential development and compares this to Wheatland’s
                                     assigned need for new housing. This includes both sites that are
                                     available within incorporated City of Wheatland boundaries and in
                                     unincorporated areas that will be annexed within the Housing
                                     Element planning period. The Housing Element Background
                                     Report provides a full discussion of this issue. The key information
                                     from the Background Report is summarized and presented here.
                                     The inventory of vacant land includes potential development sites
                                     that were in the discussion or approval stages at the time of the
                                     inventory. Additionally, the capacity for second units on existing
                                     or new single-family lots was not calculated.
                                     Table 4.1 below (identical to Table 27 in the Background Report)
                                     provides a summary of residential holding capacity in Wheatland
                                     compared to Wheatland’s assigned housing need. The figures for
                                     the total Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP) allocation, units
                                     built, and net allocation to be met are from Table 20 in the
                                     Background Report. The figures for holding capacity on vacant
                                     land are from Tables 25 and 26 of the Background Report. As
                                     shown in Table 4.1, Wheatland has a total residential capacity of
                                     units in excess of its net allocation to be met (total need of 702 units
                                     compared to the holding capacity of 1,796 units).
                                     Because the capacity for housing production exceeds Wheatland’s
                                     net need for new housing during the Housing Element planning
                                     period, a primary objective for the City over the Housing Element
                                     planning period will be to provide adequate sites to accommodate
                                     the housing needs of very low–, low-, and moderate-income
                                     households. The California Department of Housing and
                                     Community Development (HCD) assumes, in general, that the
                                     higher the density, the more affordable the housing. It is HCD’s
                                     position that local jurisdictions can facilitate and encourage
                                     affordable housing development by allowing development at
                                     higher densities, which helps to reduce per unit land costs.
                                     As shown in Table 4.1, after taking into account building permits
                                     issued from January 1, 2000, through April 30, 2004, Wheatland has
                                     a net allocation to be met of 436 moderate-income and below units.
                                     Wheatland has a capacity for 368 moderate-income and below
                                     units, for a deficit in capacity of 68 units, including 65 very low-
                                     and low-income units and 3 moderate-income units. The 368 unit
                                     capacity for moderate-income and below units could be increased,

                                                                                                          HOUSING, Chapter 4
                                        with application of the maximum 25 percent density bonus, to 460
                                        units; however, density bonuses are not reflected in the table.
                                        Because of the 68-unit deficit in capacity for moderate-income and
                                        below units, Wheatland needs to identify additional site(s) or
                                        increase densities on currently identified sites to meet the
                                        remaining identified need for affordable units. In order to provide
                                        the potential for the 68 net remaining housing unit allocation for
                                        very low-, low-, and moderate-income units, 3.78 additional acres
                                        of vacant High Density Residential-designated land, would have to
                                        be made available (assuming development densities at 18 units per
                                        acre).

                                     unincorporated “island” between the new junior high & senior
                                     high schools to meet the Implementation Program 1 goal and
                                     Wheatland’s remaining RHND for the Housing Element planning
                                     period.
                                     As shown in Table 25 of the Background Report, Almond Estates is
                                     a 47 acre site with a LDR land use designation and R-1 zoning. It is
                                     currently planned for a total of 205 single-family units, which is
                                     equivalent to a total site density of 4.36 units per acre. As stated in
                                     the table, the site is constrained somewhat by drainage and access,
                                     but the constraints do not rule out development within the
                                     Housing Element planning period.
                                     As shown in Table 26 of the Background Report, the “Island” has a
                                     total site area of 31 acres and is currently projected to have a
                                     capacity of 50 single-family units in addition to the 8 existing units.
                                     Just as the other unincorporated land that is planned to be
                                     annexed, developers of this property will be required to extend
                                     infrastructure or fund service and facility expansion (in particular,
                                     the wastewater treatment plant does not have the capacity for a
                                     large amount of development beyond build-out of the existing city
                                     limits).

SECTION IV:                           This Housing Element reflects input from a wide variety of sources.
PUBLIC                                 The primary mechanism to gather public input for the Housing
                                      Element was a series of forums, workshops, and hearings.
PARTICIPATION
                                      The following meetings were held for the Housing Element
                                      Update. These were workshops conducted to elicit comments from
                                      the public regarding housing needs and programs and to help the
                                      City identify its housing needs and to identify an effective package
                                      of regulatory, incentive, and financing programs to meet

                                                City Council/Planning Commission meeting and
                                                Stakeholders Workshop
                                        •       August 5, 2004:
                                                City Council/Planning Commission meeting and
                                                Stakeholders Workshop
                                     All of these meetings were formally noticed by posting public
                                     notice 14 days before each workshop, and 160 notices or
                                     announcements were sent out to individuals and organizations.
                                     These included public officials, non-profit and for-profit housing
                                     developers, housing advocates, and the California Department of
                                     Housing and Community Development (HCD). Numerous citizens
                                     and other interested individuals attended and provided comment
                                     on issues related to the Housing Element.
                                     In addition, the research conducted as part of the Housing Element
                                     preparation process involved interviews with staff from the City of
                                     Wheatland and a variety of social service agencies and other
                                     interested organizations that serve the Wheatland community.
                                     On August 5, 2004, the City Council and Planning Commission
                                     approved sending the draft Housing Element for review by HCD.
                                     On August 31, 2004, the City of Wheatland Draft Housing Element
                                     was submitted to HCD. HCD had 60 days to review the draft and
                                     submit comments to the City. The official HCD comment letter was
                                     released on October 29, 2004. This Housing Element document
                                     addresses HCD’s comments.
                                     On December 14, 2004, the City of Wheatland determined that the
                                     Housing Element update project will not have a significant effect
                                     on the environment, and that the City will adopt a Negative
                                     Declaration pursuant to CEQA. The comment period for this notice
                                     of intent to adopt a negative declaration ran until January 13, 2005.
                                     As required by State law, the Planning Commission and the City
                                     Council will each hold one adoption hearing before the final
                                     Housing Element is approved. Each public hearing will be
                                     advertised by posting in three locations in Wheatland, the local
                                     newspaper, and to individuals and organizations on the General
                                     Plan Update (GPU) notification list.
                                     After the City approves the final Housing Element, the City will
                                     submit it to HCD for State certification, which will take 90 days.

                                                                                              HOUSING, Chapter 4
SECTION V:                           This section discusses the coordination of this Housing Element
CONSISTENCY WITH                     with other elements of the Wheatland General Plan. Housing
                                     element law requires the California Department of Housing and
THE GENERAL PLAN
                                     Community Development (HCD) to review local housing elements
                                     for compliance with State law and to report its written findings to
                                     the local government. The Housing Element must be consistent
                                     with all other parts of the Wheatland General Plan (California
                                     Government Code, Section 65302).
                                     Housing Element policies and programs were developed subject to
                                     the constraints of the policies and programs contained in the other
                                     General Plan elements. Of all the other General Plan elements, the
                                     Housing Element is most closely related to the Land Use Element
                                     in the General Plan because the Land Use Element specifies the
                                     lands within the City that may be utilized for housing
                                     development.
                                     Areas available for residential development along with the range of
                                     allowable densities and direction on appropriate housing types are
                                     designated through the Land Use Diagram and the land use
                                     definitions in the Land Use Element, thereby laying the foundation
                                     for all other goals, policies, and programs related to the provision
                                     of housing. The Land Use Element also provides further detail in
                                     the implementation of housing policies. The Housing Element
                                     update was conducted concurrently with the rest of the General
                                     Plan update for Wheatland in 2004-2006.
                                     Other elements in the General Plan also discuss policy directions
                                     for residential development. For example, the Circulation Element
                                     will identify new streets and these streets will be designed to
                                     accommodate new residential developments The Noise Element
                                     will ensure new residential neighborhoods will not be exposed to
                                     intrusive sound. The Safety Element will ensure the location of
                                     new residential neighborhoods will not be exposed to geologic
                                     hazards or surface hazards (wildfires).
                                     These policies and programs have been taken into consideration in
                                     the preparation of the Housing Element update. Any future
                                     amendments to the General Plan will maintain consistency with
                                     policies and programs in the Housing Element.

CHAPTER 5
PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES
City development is dependent on a complicated network of public facilities and services. Each type
of facility or service has a unique set of opportunities and constraints and must adapt to growth and
change differently. This chapter focuses on water, sewer collection and treatment, flood protection,
storm drainage, solid waste collection and disposal, fire protection, law enforcement, and other
utilities such as gas, electricity, and communications.
Transportation facilities are discussed separately in Chapter 2, and parks and schools are addressed
in Chapter 6.
GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
This chapter contains goals, policies, and implementation programs that establish the framework for
the provision of public facilities and services to meet the demands generated by existing and future
development in Wheatland. The goals and policies of this section are organized topically according to
the following categories, each of which relates to a particular type of facility or service.
             General Public Facilities and Services
             Public Facilities and Services Funding
             Water Supply and Delivery
             Wastewater Collection, Treatment, Disposal, and Reuse
             Stormwater Drainage
             Solid Waste Collection and Disposal
             Law Enforcement
             Fire Protection
             Gas and Electric Services
             Information Technology
GENERAL PUBLIC                            Urban development requires a wide range of publicly-provided
FACILITIES AND                            services, such as water, sewer, storm drainage, and garbage
                                          collection. The City of Wheatland directly provides or contracts for
SERVICES
                                          most of these services. The General Plan provides guidance for the
                                          logical and efficient extension of these services as new development
                                          occurs. The City will provide for the development of major public
                                          facilities through its Infrastructure Financing Plan, which identifies
                                          capital improvement projects to accommodate growth projected
                                          under the General Plan consistent with applicable State and Federal
                                          law.

                                                                                  PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES, Chapter 5
                                       New development is generally responsible for providing for the
                                       extensions of the services it requires. The policies in this section also
                                       seek to identify funding methods for new facilities and services as
                                       new development occurs, and to consider how the ongoing
                                       maintenance and operations of these facilities will be funded to
                                       ensure that operational levels do not decline.
                                       GOAL 5.A
                                       To ensure the timely development of public facilities and services,
                                       the maintenance of specified service levels for public facilities, and
                                       that adopted facility and service standards are achieved and
                                       maintained through the use of equitable funding methods.
                                       POLICIES
                                       5.A.1. Where new development requires the construction of new
                                                public facilities, new development shall fund its fair share of
                                                the construction of those facilities.
                                       5.A.2. The City shall ensure through the development review
                                                process that adequate public facilities and services are
                                                available to serve new development. The City shall not
                                                approve new development where existing facilities are
                                                inadequate unless the following conditions are met:
                                                  a. The applicant can demonstrate that all necessary public
                                                       facilities will be installed or adequately financed
                                                       (through fees or other means); and
                                                  b. The facility improvements are consistent with applicable
                                                       master or facility plans adopted by the City.
                                       5.A.3. The City shall require development proposals to include
                                                plans for development and financing of public facilities and
                                                services.
                                       5.A.4. The City shall prepare and annually review public facility
                                                master plans, and every five years update the plans to ensure
                                                compliance with appropriate State and Federal laws, use of
                                                modern and cost-effective technologies, and compatibility
                                                with current land use policy.
                                       5.A.5. Through fiscal revenues generated by new development, the
                                                City shall expand, as needed, general government services
                                                (e.g., City administrative services) in connection with new
                                                development.

                                       5.A.6. The City shall prepare and annually review the Infrastructure
                                                Financing Plan (IFP) and every five years update the IFP to
                                                ensure the implementation and adequacy of the plan.
                                       5.A.7. The City shall continue to use developer fees, the City's
                                                public facilities fees, and other methods (i.e., grant funding
                                                and assessment districts) to finance public facility design,
                                                construction, operation, and maintenance.
                                       5.A.8. The City shall ensure through the development review
                                                process that public facilities and infrastructure are designed
                                                and constructed to meet ultimate capacity needs, pursuant to
                                                a master plan, to avoid the need for future replacement to
                                                achieve upsizing.
                                       5.A.9. The City shall ensure through the development review
                                                process that public facilities and infrastructure are designed
                                                to meet ultimate capacity needs, pursuant to a master plan, to
                                                avoid the need for future replacement to achieve upsizing.
                                                For facilities subject to incremental sizing, the initial design
                                                shall include adequate land area and any other elements not
                                                easily expanded in the future.
                                       5.A.10. The City shall require that new development pay its fair
                                                share of the cost of providing new public services and/or the
                                                costs of upgrading of all existing facilities it uses, based on
                                                the demand for these facilities attributable to the new
                                                development.
                                       5.A.11. The City shall seek broad-based funding sources for public
                                                facilities and services that benefit current and future residents
                                                of the city.
                                       5.A.12. The City shall require preparation of a fiscal impact analysis
                                                for all specific plans or significant general plan land use
                                                amendments. The analysis will examine the fiscal impacts on
                                                the City and other service providers that result from
                                                large-scale development. The fiscal analysis shall project a
                                                positive fiscal impact from new development or include
                                                mechanisms to fund projected fiscal deficits.

WATER SUPPLY AND                        Wheatland relies on groundwater for its municipal water supply, as
DELIVERY                                do most of the surrounding agricultural operations. The General
                                        Plan seeks to ensure a safe and adequate water supply for existing
                                        and future development. Policies of the plan also promote water

                                         commercial, and industrial development will hasten the rate at
                                         which the landfill is filled. Policies in this section seek to reduce the
                                         amount of waste produced through source reduction, reuse, and
                                         recycling, and to ensure safe disposal of waste. The goal of this plan
                                         is to reduce the total amount of waste generated and disposed of
                                         through source reduction, recycling and composting, and safe
                                         transformation and land disposal of solid wastes. State law enacted
                                         in 1989 requires that a minimum of 25 percent of the total wastes
                                         generated are diverted from landfills by 2006 and a minimum of 50
                                         percent are diverted by the year 2010.

FIRE PROTECTION                          Fire protection is a critical component of public safety. Wheatland
                                         currently has a volunteer fire department that provides fire
                                         protection to the city. The Plumas Brophy Fire Protection District
                                         provides fire protection to the region surrounding Wheatland. Fire
                                         protection depends on several factors: personnel and equipment,
                                         available water supply and pressure, response time, and reducing
                                         potential fire hazards. Buildings can also be constructed with fire
                                         resistant materials, smoke alarms, or sprinkler systems to reduce fire
                                         hazards.

CHAPTER 6
RECREATIONAL, EDUCATIONAL, AND
COMMUNITY SERVICES
The City provides and maintains public park facilities and services for all age and income groups.
The General Plan sets the framework for an expanded park system with physical recreational facilities
to provide the opportunity for a variety of recreational activities. City decisions concerning growth
and development affect schools, child care, and senior citizen facilities. Even when the City is not
directly responsible for their development and operation, the City plays an important role in the
siting and planning of these facilities. The General Plan also promotes the creation/expansion of a
Civic Center, library services, and arts and cultural activities.
GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
This chapter contains goals, policies, and implementation programs that establish the framework for
the provision of recreational, educational, and community services for Wheatland residents and
visitors. The goals and policies of this chapter are organized topically according to the following

SCHOOL SITING                        Growth in Wheatland will necessitate the development of additional
AND FINANCING                        public, private, and parochial schools. Funding for new public

                                                Routes to Schools” grants. These grants will provide safe

CHILD CARE SUPPLY                    Many of Wheatland’s families include a single working parent or
AND QUALITY                          two working parents. These families need help with child care.
                                     Child care takes many forms, from friends and relatives, unlicensed
                                     babysitters, to licensed family day care homes and child care
                                     centers. As Wheatland continues to grow, demand for child care
                                     will increase. The availability and affordability of high-quality child
                                     care is an important factor in the quality of life for many Wheatland
                                     residents.

                                     accessible to everyone, including books, magazines, reference
                                     materials, multilingual materials, and Internet access. The policies
                                     of this section seek to promote and help establish the library’s vital
                                     role in the community and provide for its development as growth
                                     increases the demand for library services.
                                     GOAL 6.G
                                     To ensure that library facilities are available to all current and future
                                     Wheatland residents, in order to carry out the Yuba County
                                     Library’s mission to inform, to enhance the quality of life, and to
                                     foster lifelong learning.

preservation efforts in Wheatland through a systematic program, community education, and
coordination within the City and with historic preservation groups.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL                          Far less is known about the Wheatland area prior to European
RESOURCES                               settlement, and evidence of early native peoples who occupied
                                        the area is scarce. Any artifact or information is, therefore,
                                        valuable. Policies in this section seek to identify and preserve
                                        any archaeological resources that might be disturbed by
                                        development activity.

CHAPTER 8
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES
Wheatland’s environmental resources (water, air, vegetation, wildlife, and open space) contribute to
the city’s economy and are important elements in the quality of life of Wheatland’s residents. These
natural resources exist in limited quantity and are at risk of destruction or degradation through
continued urban development. The General Plan seeks to balance the need for growth with the need
for the conservation and enhancement of the area’s natural resources, frequently in cooperation with
other agencies.
GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
This chapter contains goals, policies, and implementation programs that establish the framework for
the protection of valuable environmental resources in the Wheatland area. The goals and policies are
organized topically according to the following categories, each of which relates to a key objective for
protection of Wheatland’s environmental resources.
            Water Resources
            Fish and Wildlife Habitat
            Vegetation
            Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
            Air Quality–General
            Air Quality–Transportation
            Energy Conservation
WATER                              The availability, quantity, and quality of water is vital to natural
RESOURCES                          processes and human activities.         Water is essential to the
                                   development of housing, commerce, industry, and agriculture, to
                                   recreation, and to the maintenance of high quality fish and wildlife
                                   habitats.
                                   The Bear River, Dry Creek, and Grasshopper Sloughs are all located
                                   within the General Plan Area boundary, and the Feather River is
                                   within five miles of the city. A groundwater aquifer underlies
                                   Wheatland and serves as the City’s municipal water supply. Most of
                                   these resources are regional in nature and require a cooperative
                                   effort to ensure protection of water quality in these bodies. Policies
                                   in this section seek to protect these resources and maintain the
                                   highest quality for human and natural use. Water supplies are also
                                   discussed in Chapter 5 under “Water Supply and Delivery.”

GENERAL                           which the air quality does not meet some state and federal health
                                  standards, particularly for ozone and small particulates (PM10).
                                  While emission control requirements on motor vehicles and industrial
                                  operations have substantially reduced air pollution from these
                                  sources, increased development and the associated increase in
                                  emissions from automobiles threatens to offset these gains. The
                                  Feather River Air Quality Management District monitors and
                                  regulates air quality in the Wheatland area and regulates air pollution

CHAPTER 9
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Planning for urban growth and development requires consideration of a wide range of public safety
issues. Safety hazards may be naturally-induced, such as seismic and geologic, flood, and wildland
fire hazards; some hazards may be the result of natural hazards which are exacerbated by human
activity and alteration of the natural environment, such as dam failure, urban fire, and development
in sensitive areas such as floodplains and areas subject to erosion and landsliding; and some hazards
are manmade, including aircraft crash hazards, hazardous materials, and crime. In addition to safety
issues related to hazardous conditions, the planning process should account for other issues related to
community health and safety, including crime and noise exposure.
Many of the health and safety risks associated with development can be avoided through locational
decisions made at the planning stages of development, while others may be lessened through the use
of mitigation measures in the planning and land use regulation process. This chapter outlines the
City’s strategy for ensuring the maintenance of a healthy and safe physical environment in
Wheatland.
GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
This chapter contains goals, policies, programs, and standards intended to protect Wheatland
residents, businesses, and visitors from the harmful effects of natural and man-made hazards. This

                                  secure flood insurance. The FEMA-mapped 100-year floodplain
                                  within the Planning Area includes portions of the General Plan Study
                                  Area. The policies of this section seek to protect development from
                                  damage, and to require new development within the floodplain to be
                                  designed to avoid flood damage.

FIRE HAZARDS                      Structural and wildland fire hazards can threaten life and property in
                                  Wheatland. Wildland fires resulting from either natural or manmade
                                  causes occur in forest, brush, or grasslands, so the threat is minimal in
                                  Wheatland, although vacant lots and fallow agricultural areas with
                                  weeds can be fire hazards. Structural fires usually result from
                                  manmade causes and can spread easily. Structural fire hazards are
                                  greatest in those structures built before building and fire codes were
                                  established.
                                  The policies of this section seek to ensure that new development is
                                  constructed to minimize potential fire hazards and to provide public
                                  education concerning fire prevention. The “Fire Protection” section in
                                  Chapter 5 addresses the service levels and maintenance of the City’s
                                  Fire Department.
                                  GOAL 9.D
                                  To minimize the risk of loss of life, injury, and damage to property
                                  and watershed resources resulting from fires.

                                            and promoting awareness of home fire prevention measures.
                                  9.D.5. The City shall enforce building and fire codes and City
                                            ordinances in regard to fire and fire protection.
                                  9.D.6. The City shall continue to improve fire protection services,

                                            possible.
                                  9.D.7. The City shall require and maintain adequate street widths,
                                            clearances around structures, and turning radii to provide for
                                            fire and safety protection and access.
                                  9.D.8. The City shall maintain water supply requirements for fire
                                            fighting needs in accordance with the Insurance Services

                                  9.E.1. The City shall work with Beale Air Force Base to ensure that
                                            new development does not create safety hazards such as lights
                                            from direct or reflective sources, smoke, electrical interference,
                                            hazardous chemicals, or fuel storage in violation of adopted
                                            safety standards.
                                  9.E.2. The City shall ensure that development within the Beale Air
                                            Force Base approach and departure zones comply with Part 87
                                            of the Federal Aviation Administration Regulations (objects
                                            affecting navigable airspace).
HAZARDOUS                         Wheatland may now or in the future include industries and activities
MATERIALS                         that involve the transport, storage, or use of toxic or hazardous
                                  chemicals, posing potential safety hazards in the event of
                                  unintentional exposure, leak, fire, or accident.              Some of the
                                  byproducts of industrial processes in Wheatland are hazardous
                                  materials, which need proper disposal. Residents and businesses in
                                  Wheatland also generate household hazardous wastes such as waste
                                  oil, paint, and solvents. Policies in this section ,therefore,focus on safe
                                  disposal, use, storage, and transport of hazardous materials, as well as
                                  proper siting between hazardous waste storage and use and sensitive
                                  land uses such as homes and schools.

NOISE                                  A feature of Wheatland’s small-town character and quality of life is its
                                       relatively quiet atmosphere. Noise results from many sources,
                                       including road traffic, railroad operations, aircraft, and industrial
                                       activities. Exposure to excessive noise has often been cited as a health
                                       problem, not so much in terms of actual physiological damage such as
                                       hearing impairment, but more in terms of general well-being and
                                       contributing to undue stress and annoyance. The policies of this
                                       section set noise standards and include policies to protect noise-
                                       sensitive uses from excessive noise.           Noise-sensitive uses in
Noise generating uses can include rail Wheatland include residential areas, motels, medical facilities,
roads and industrial sites.            nursing homes, churches, meeting halls, offices, schools, playgrounds,
                                       and parks.
                                       New development must be designed so as not to result in excessive
                                       noise on adjacent properties, and development of new noise-sensitive
                                       uses in areas projected to have high noise levels must be constructed
                                       so as to reduce interior noise levels.

                                  9.G.1. The City shall prohibit development of new noise-sensitive
                                             uses where the noise level due to non-transportation noise

                                             development, unless effective noise mitigation measures have
                                             been incorporated in the development design to achieve the
                                             standards set out in Table 9-1.
                                  9.G.2. The City shall require that noise created by new

                                    These noise level standards do not apply to residential units established in conjunction
                                    with industrial or commercial uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings).
                                    *For the purposes of compliance with the provisions of this section, the City defines
                                    transportation noise sources as traffic on public roadways, railroad line operations, and
                                    aircraft in flight. Control of noise from these sources is preempted by Federal and State
                                    regulations. Other noise sources are presumed to be subject to local regulations. Non-
                                    transportation noise sources may include industrial operations, outdoor recreation
                                    facilities, HVAC units, and loading docks.
                                  9.G.3. Where proposed non-residential land uses are likely to

                                        1 Where the location of outdoor activity areas is unknown, the exterior noise level
                                        standard shall be applied to the property line of the receiving land use. For
                                        residential uses with front yards facing the identified noise source, an exterior
                                        noise level criterion of 65 dB Ldn shall be applied at the building facade, in addition
                                        to a 60 dB Ldn criterion at the outdoor activity area.
                                        2 As determined for a typical worst-case hour during periods of use.
                                        3 Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 60 dB
                                        Ldn/CNEL or less using a practical application of the best-available noise reduction
                                        measures, an exterior noise level of up to 65 dB Ldn/CNEL may be allowed
                                        provided that available exterior noise level reduction measures have been
                                        implemented and interior noise levels are in compliance with this table.
                                  9.G.6. New roadway improvement projects will be needed to
                                             accommodate development permitted according to the Land
                                             Use Diagram. Where existing noise-sensitive uses may be
                                             exposed to increased noise levels due to increased roadway
                                             capacity and increases in travel speeds associated with
                                             roadway improvements, the City will apply the following
                                             criteria to determine the significance of increases in noise
                                             related to roadway improvement projects:
                                             a. Where existing traffic noise levels are less than 60 dB Ldn at
                                                  the outdoor activity areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +5 dB
                                                  Ldn increase in noise levels due to a roadway improvement
                                                  project will be considered significant; and
                                             b. Where existing traffic noise levels range between 60 and 65
                                                  dB Ldn at the outdoor activity areas of noise-sensitive uses,
                                                  a +3 dB Ldn increase in noise levels due to a roadway
                                                  improvement project will be considered significant; and

                                            c. Where existing traffic noise levels are greater than 65 dB
                                                 Ldn at the outdoor activity areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +
                                                 1.5 dB Ldn increase in noise levels due to a roadway
                                                 improvement project will be considered significant.
                                  9.G.7. An increase of 3 dB Ldn or greater due to additional traffic
                                            volumes is considered a potentially significant impact.

                                  To protect the economic base of the city by preventing incompatible
                                  land uses from encroaching upon existing or planned noise-
                                  producing uses.
                                  9.H.1. Where noise-sensitive land uses are proposed in areas exposed
                                            to existing or projected exterior noise levels exceeding the
                                            levels set out in Table 9-2 or the performance standards of
                                            Table 9-1, an acoustical analysis shall be required as part of the
                                            environmental review process so that noise mitigation may be
                                            included in the project design.
                                  9.H.2. Where noise mitigation measures are required to achieve the
                                            standards of Tables 9-1 and 9-2, the emphasis in such mea-
                                            sures shall be placed upon site planning and project design.
                                            The use of noise barriers shall be considered as a means of
                                            achieving the noise standards only after all other practical
                                            design-related noise mitigation measures have been integrated
                                            into the project.
                                  9.H.3. The City shall support the Right-to-Farm Ordinance, especially
                                            as it relates to noise emanating from the agricultural
                                            operations adjacent to urban uses.
                                  9.H.4. The City shall work with the Sacramento Area Council of
                                            Governments (SACOG) to ensure that City’s noise policies and
                                            contours are consistent with the Beale Air Force Base Land Use

CHAPTER 10
ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
The effectiveness of the General Plan ultimately depends on how it is implemented and maintained
over time. State law requires that most actions of local government affecting the physical
environment be consistent with the general plan, and sets out guidelines for the plan’s monitoring,
updating, and amendment.
GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
This chapter contains goals, policies, and programs to ensure that the City of Wheatland maintains a
high level of attention to the General Plan by providing for regular review and updating of the Policy
Document and Background Report and ensuring that other City regulations and ordinances are
consistent with the General Plan.

Fault                         A fault is a fracture in the Earth’s crust that is accompanied by displacement
                              between the two sides of the fault. An active fault is defined as a fault that
                              has moved in the last 10,000 to 12,000 years (Holocene time). A potentially
                              active fault is one that has been active in the past 1.6 million years
                              (Quaternary period). A sufficiently active fault is one that shows evidence
                              that Holocene displacement occurred on one or more of its segments or
                              branches (Hart, 1997).

                              land area, an FAR of 1.00 will allow 10,000 square feet of gross square feet of
                              building floor area to be built, regardless of the number of stories in the
                              building (e.g., 5,000 square feet per floor on two floors or 10,000 square feet
                              on one floor). On the same lot, an FAR of 0.50 would allow 5,000 square feet
                              of floor area and an FAR of 0.25 would allow 2,500 square feet.
Frequency                     How often an event will occur expressed by the return period or by
                              exceedance probability.
General Plan Area             The land within the city limits and that land outside which in the City’s

                              increase in mortality or an increase in serious, irreversible, or incapacitating,
                              illness; or (2) pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health
                              or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported or
                              disposed of (CCR, Title 22, Division 4.5, Chapter 10, Article 2, Section
                              66260.10).

Hazardous Wastes              Similarly, hazardous wastes are defined as materials that no longer have
                              practical use, such as substances that have been discarded, discharged,
                              spilled, contaminated, or are being stored prior to proper disposal.
                              According to Title 22 of the CCR, hazardous materials and hazardous wastes
                              are classified according to four properties: toxic, ignitable, corrosive, and
                              reactive (CCR, Title 22, Chapter 11, Article 3).

Implementation                An action, procedure, program, or technique that carries out general plan
Program                       policy. Implementation programs also specify primary responsibility for
                              carrying out the action and a time frame for its accomplishment.
Important Farmlands           Collective term for farmlands designated as Prime, Unique, or as Farmlands

                              flood protection must meet FEMA standards.
Level of Protection
                              The amount of protection that a drainage or flood control measure provides.
Liquefaction
                              Liquefaction in soils and sediments occurs during some earthquake events,
                              when material is transformed from a solid state to a liquid state because of
                              increases in pressure in the pores (the spaces between soil particles).
                              Earthquake"induced liquefaction most often occurs in low"lying areas with
                              soils or sediments composed of unconsolidated, saturated, clay"free sands
                              and silts, but it can also occur in dry, granular soils or saturated soils with
                              some clay content.

Level of Service               A scale that measures the amount of traffic that can be accommodated on a
(traffic)                      roadway segment or at an intersection. Traffic levels of service range from A
                               to F, with A representing the highest level of service, as follows:
                               Level of Service A: Indicates a relatively free flow of traffic, with little or no limitation on
                               vehicle movement or speed.
                               Level of Service B: Describes a steady flow of traffic, with only slight delays in vehicle
                               movement and speed. All queues clear in a single signal cycle.
                               Level of Service C: Denotes a reasonably steady, high"volume flow of traffic, with some
                               limitations on movement and speed, and occasional backups on critical approaches.
                               Level of Service D: Denotes the level where traffic nears an unstable flow. Intersections still
                               function, but short queues develop and cars may have to wait through one cycle during short
                               peaks.
                               Level of Service E: Describes traffic characterized by slow movement and frequent (although
                               momentary) stoppages. This type of congestion is considered severe, but is not uncommon at
                               peak traffic hours, with frequent stopping, long"standing queues, and blocked intersections.
                               Level of Service F: Describes unsatisfactory stop"and"go traffic characterized by !traffic jams!
                               and stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at signalized intersections usually have to wait
                               through one or more signal changes, and !upstream! intersections may be blocked by the
                               long queues.
Local Agency                   A statutorily"required commission in Yolo County that reviews and
Formation                      evaluates all proposals for formation of special districts, incorporation of
Commission                     cities, annexation to special districts or cities, consolidation of districts, and
(LAFCO)                        merger of districts with cities.
Major Projects                 The Capital Improvement Program adopted by a city that schedules physical
Financing Plan                 improvements, usually for a minimum of five years in the future, to fit the
(MPFP)                         projected fiscal capability of the jurisdiction. The program generally should
                               be reviewed annually for consistency with the general plan.
Magnitude                      Earthquake magnitude is measured by the Richter scale, indicated as a series
                               of Arabic numbers with no theoretical maximum magnitude. The greater the
                               energy released from the fault rupture, the higher the magnitude of the
                               earthquake. Magnitude increases logarithmically in the Richter scale; thus,
                               an earthquake of magnitude 7.0 is thirty times stronger than one of
                               magnitude 6.0. Earthquake energy is most intense at the point of fault
                               slippage, the epicenter, which occurs because the energy radiates from that
                               point in a circular wave pattern. The farther an area is from an earthquake’s
                               epicenter, the less likely it is that groundshaking will occur.
Net Acreage                    The developable area of a lot or parcel, excluding streets and rights of way.

Noise Sensitive Uses          Land uses that involve activities where excessive noise levels could cause
                              adverse health effects or disrupt the activity. Noise sensitive uses include
                              residential uses, theaters, auditoriums, music halls, meeting halls, churches,
                              hospitals, nursing homes, and other similar uses.
Open Space                    Open space is any parcel, area, or waterway that is essentially unimproved
                              and devoted to an open space use. Under Section 65560 of the California
                              State Government Code, open space land is broadly defined as land
                              designated for preservation of natural resources (i.e., lakeshore and
                              watershed lands); managed production of resources (i.e., lands for
                              agriculture, forestry, recharge of ground water basins); outdoor recreation
                              (i.e., parks, scenic highway corridors, and areas with outstanding scenic,
                              historic and cultural values); and public health and safety (i.e., flood plains,
                              unstable soil areas).
Ozone                         Ozone is a pungent, colorless toxic gas created in the atmosphere rather than
                              emitted directly into the air. Ozone is produced in complex atmospheric
                              reactions involving oxides of nitrogen and reactive organic gases with
                              ultraviolet energy from the sun. Motor vehicles are the major sources of
                              ozone precursors.
Policy                        A specific statement in text or diagram"guiding action and implying a clear
                              commitment.
Primary Treatment             Treatment of wastewater prior to other forms of treatment and involving
                              settling and removal of suspended solids.
Principal Dwelling            A single"family detached dwelling that generally is established first and is
                              the largest dwelling on a lot.
Priority One Calls            Emergency calls which require immediate dispatch response. Priority one
                              calls are emergency calls where there is a reason to believe that an
                              immediate threat to life exists.
Retention                     Longer"term storage with no outlet provided. Retained water would
                              infiltrate into the soil or evaporate.
Riparian habitat              Riparian lands are comprised of the vegetative and wildlife areas adjacent to
                              perennial and intermittent streams. Riparian areas are delineated by the
                              existence of plant species normally found near freshwater.
Sanitary Sewer                Pipes, pump stations, manholes, and other facilities that convey untreated
                              wastewater from the various sources around the City to the Stockton
                              Regional Wastewater Control Facility.
Secondary Treatment           Treatment of wastewater that typically follows primary treatment and
                              involves biological processes and settling tanks to remove organic material.

Sensitive Natural             A sensitive natural community is a biological community that is regionally
Community                     rare, provides important habitat opportunities for wildlife, are structurally
                              complex, or are in other ways of special concern to local, State, or Federal
                              agencies. The CDFG tracks sensitive natural communities in the CNDDB
                              and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) identifies the
                              elimination or substantial degradation of such communities as a significant
                              impact.
Service Area                  The area for which a purveyor is responsible for distributing water supplies.
Slough                        A tributary to a river.
Specific plan                 A State"authorized legal tool adopted by cities and counties for detailed
                              design and implementation of a defined portion of the area covered by a
                              general plan and/or area plan. A specific plan may include all detailed
                              regulations, conditions, programs, and/or proposed legislation that may be
                              necessary or convenient for the systematic implementation of any general
                              plan element(s).

Special-Status                Special"status species are those plants and animals that, because of their
Species                       recognized rarity or vulnerability to habitat loss or population decline, are
                              recognized by Federal, State, or other agencies. Some of these species receive
                              specific protection that is defined by Federal or State endangered species
                              legislation. Others have been designated as !sensitive! on the basis of
                              adopted policies and expertise of State resource agencies or organizations
                              with acknowledged expertise, or policies adopted by local governmental
                              agencies such as counties, cities, and special districts to meet local
                              conservation objectives. These species are referred to collectively as !special
                              status species! in this report, following a convention that has developed in
                              practice but has no official sanction. The various categories encompassed by

                                     or of special concern (CDFG);
                                     Fully protected animals, as defined by the State of California (California Fish and
                                     Game Code Section 3511, 4700, and 5050);
                                     Species that meet the definition of threatened, endangered, or rare under California
                                     Environmental Quality Act (CEQA Guidelines Section 15380);
                                     Plants listed as rare or endangered under the California Native Plant Protection Act
                                     (California Fish and Game Code Section 1900 et seq.); and

                                     endangered (List 1A and List 2 status plants in Skinner and Pavlik 1994).
Soil Quality                  The capacity of a specific kind of soil to function, within natural or managed
                              ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or
                              enhance water and air quality, and support human health and habitation.
Sphere of Influence           The probable ultimate physical boundaries and service area of a local agency
(SOI)                         (city or district) as determined by the Local Agency Formation Commission
                              (LAFCO) of the County.
Standard                      A specific, often"quantified guideline incorporated in a policy or

Stormwater                    A document submitted to the Regional Water Quality Control Board. The
Management Plan               SWMP describes how the City will reduce the discharge of pollutants in
(SWMP)                        stormwater to the maximum extent practical and effectively limit non"
                              stormwater discharges into the City’s storm drain systems.
Surface water                 Water on the earth#s surface, as distinguished from subterranean water;
                              typically found flowing in natural or man"made water courses such as
                              rivers, streams, or canals, or contained in lakes or storage reservoirs.
Tertiary Treatment            Treatment of wastewater that follows secondary treatment and involves
                              filtration processes to remove fine suspended and colloidal material,
                              providing a more advanced level of treatment than secondary treatment
                              alone.
Urban                         Areas generally characterized by moderate and higher density residential
                              development (e.g., 3 or more dwelling units per acre), commercial
                              development, and industrial development.
Vernal pools                  Basins that form in soils over an impervious rock or clay layer that collect
                              surface runoff from winter storms and gradually dry out by evaporation as
                              the weather becomes warmer in the spring. Vernal pools support diverse
                              and unique plant and wildlife species specifically adapted to these
                              conditions. This habitat supports a number of threatened and endangered
                              species.
Wastewater                    Sewage (either treated or untreated) from residential, commercial, industrial,
                              and institutional sources.
Wastewater                    The totality of the pipes, pump stations, manholes, and other facilities that
Collection System             convey untreated wastewater from the various sources within the Planning
                              Area.
Water Quality                 The chemical purity of the water measured in terms of a variety of
                              constituents or parameters (e.g., turbidity, metals concentration, organics
                              concentration, and salinity).
Watershed                     Similar to a groundwater basin, a watershed is the area or region from which
                              surface water flows to a particular water body.

Wetlands                     Wetlands are ecologically complex habitats that support a variety of both
                             plant and animal life. In a jurisdictional sense, the Federal government
                             defines wetlands in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act as “areas that are
                             inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and
                             duration sufficient to support (and do support, under normal circumstances)
                             a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil
                             conditions” (33 CFR 328.3[b] and 40 CFR 230.3).
                             Under normal circumstances, the Federal definition of wetlands requires that
                             three wetland identification parameters be present: wetland hydrology,
                             hydric soils, and hydrophytic vegetation. Examples of wetlands include
                             freshwater marsh, seasonal wetlands, and vernal pool complexes that have a
                             hydrologic link to other waters of the U.S. (see definition below for other
                             waters of the U.S.). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is the
                             responsible agency for regulating wetlands under Section 404 of the Clean
                             Water Act, while the EPA has overall responsibility for the Act. CDFG does
                             not have jurisdiction over wetlands unless they are subject to jurisdiction
                             under Streambed Alteration Agreements (affecting the bed, channel, or bank
                             of a waterway) or they support State"listed endangered species.
