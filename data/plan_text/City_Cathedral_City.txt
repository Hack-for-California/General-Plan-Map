                                                                             General Plan/Introduction
INTRODUCTION
The City of Cathedral City General Plan has been prepared in compliance with California law,
which requires that all cities and counties adopt a General Plan. The General Plan is the primary
land use tool use by the City in assisting in the development and redevelopment of the City. This
General Plan includes the goals, policies and programs which the City will utilize in making land
use decisions in the future. In addition, each Element includes diagrams, historic and current data
and information, and projections for the future.
BACKGROUND
The City of Cathedral City is located in the Coachella Valley, in eastern Riverside County. The
City is bordered on the west by the City of Palm Springs, and on the east by the City of Rancho
Mirage. The City currently includes 22.5 square miles of land, extending from the Santa Rosa
Mountains on the south, to Edom Hill on the north.
Public Participation
The General Plan was developed through a series of public meetings over a period of several
years. This public participation process culminated in several public workshops held by the
Planning Commission and City Council, meeting jointly, in 2001 and 2002. The input provided
by residents at these meetings was incorporated into the General. Following the required public
comment period, public hearings were held by both the Planning Commission and City Council,
to receive further input from the public on the contents of this document.
General Plan Format
The City of Cathedral City General Plan includes two documents: This General Plan and the
General Plan Environmental Impact Report. These documents together are the framework for
land use decisions in the City, including residential density, commercial and industrial intensity,
and open space and park areas. The General Plan includes summaries of background information
which is provided in greater detail in the Environmental Impact Report.
Each Element includes one or more goals, and the policies and programs necessary to reach that
goal. The goal is the most general statement in the policy-making process. The policies provide
decision-makers with direction as they consider development in the City. Finally, the programs
provide implementation mechanisms for the policies, including funding priorities, major
development standards, and staffing responsibilities. The programs also include mechanisms to
allow the City to respond to changes in market and environmental conditions as time passes.
The General Plan also includes maps and graphics which illustrate and support policies and
programs, and as such are integral to the General Plan document.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                                     Introduction

                               ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
This chapter of the General Plan addresses the administration of the General Plan. Key discussions in this element
include the format and content of the General Plan, the various chapters and elements, determining consistency with
the General Plan, amending the General Plan, and other means of implementing the Plan. Other components and
aspects of the General Plan are also discussed in the Administration and Implementation Element, including
environmental resource and hazard maps, design concepts and procedural matters.

ADMINISTRATION ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Administration Element is to provide direction and guidance in implementing
the Comprehensive General Plan. This element also serves as background on the information set
forth in the General Plan, its organization, the Plan's function and its relationship to other
regulatory documents, including the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the
Subdivision Map Act, and the City Zoning Ordinance. General Plan review and amendment
procedures are also described in the Administration Element. It describes the various means by
which the General Plan is implemented, including Element-specific implementation strategies,
incorporated throughout the General Plan. This element also sets forth a goal, policies and
programs intended to effectively administer the General Plan.
BACKGROUND
The Administration Element facilitates the review and regulation of land use and development
on public and private lands. It also provides the framework by which the appropriateness of
municipal actions are determined, including a review of applicable policies and standards for
consistency with the General Plan. California Government Code (Section 65300) requires
incorporated communities and counties to prepare and adopt a comprehensive, long-term
General Plan. The General Plan regulates the physical development of lands under the
jurisdiction of, or having an influence upon, the community, including the City’s legally
recognized Sphere-of-Influence. The General Plan and its various elements are required to
function as an integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies (Government
Code Section 65300.5).
Conditions and circumstances unique to the community must also be accommodated and
therefore the General Plan may take different forms, while meeting its minimum requirements
(Government Code Section 65300.7). A General Plan must be designed to be responsive to the
variations in community size and density, fiscal and administrative capabilities, land use and
development issues, and the needs of each community's residents (Government Code Sections
65300.9, 65302). The Administration Element provides for the periodic review and amendment
of the General Plan, establishing formal procedures to ensure that the Plan is maintained and kept
current with changing conditions, and that it continues to reflect the goals of the community.
General Plan Organization and Format
The Cathedral City General Plan is organized into five major chapters: Administration,
Community Development and Design, Municipal Facilities and Services, Environmental
Resources and Environmental Hazards. Grouped within each chapter are the various related
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                             Administration Element

                                                                     General Plan/Administration Element
General Plan Elements, providing background information and related issues, goals and specific
policies.
The General Plan is a policy document supported by the associated Program Environmental
Impact Report (EIR). Together, these documents provide detailed information on the City and its
aspects. The Cathedral City General Plan is implemented by policies and programs set forth in
each element, reflecting the character, vision and aspirations of the community.
Goals, Policies and Programs
The goals of each element of the General Plan are broad statements reflecting the City’s values,
character, aims and aspirations. They address the quality of life issues important to the
community, and the current and planned physical development of the City. The General Plan
goals also address the preservation of important environmental and cultural assets of the
community.
The purpose of policies is to further the goals of the General Plan and establish specific
performance requirements for each element. Programs accompanying the policies provide
quantitative and qualitative targets, cite agencies most likely to carry out the program, and
propose schedules for program implementation and review.
Exhibits, Maps and Graphics
The General Plan, and its supporting documentation provides official exhibits, maps and
graphics to describe physical conditions, delineate land use and circulation patterns, define open
space and recreation facilities, and other areas requiring special consideration or study.
Environmental resources of importance and uniqueness, as well as environmental hazard areas,
are also mapped, as well as public and quasi-public facilities. These official maps carry equal
authority to the goals and policies of the General Plan.
The Elements of the General Plan
The California General Plan Guidelines cite Government Code Section 65302, which establishes
seven (7) mandatory elements of the General Plan: Land Use, Circulation, Housing,
Conservation, Open Space, Safety, and Noise. The State General Plan Guidelines also provide
flexibility to jurisdictions in developing their General Plans. In this regard, some of the required
elements may be addressed in combination with others, such as Open Space and Conservation.
Consistent with State Guidelines, all of the mandated elements are found within the Cathedral
City General Plan, which integrates the mandatory and discretionary elements into five (5) major
chapters. They are organized to reflect compliance with State requirements that the General Plan
be internally consistent, comprising an integrated and compatible statement of policies for the
City. Each element of the General Plan has equal legal authority.
Community Development and Design Chapter
This chapter has the most direct effect on the character and quality of life of the community
through the definition and distribution of land uses, the intensity of various types of
development, densities and types of housing, roadway and circulation plans, provision and
distribution of parks and recreational facilities, architectural and community design guidelines,

Providing basic utility infrastructure and public services are among the principal concerns of
local government. So, to, are the provision of police and fire protection, and access to
educational and health services. Providing emergency services is also an essential role of local
government. The goals and policies in each element are meant to assure an adequate level of
services and facilities commensurate with the level of development anticipated in the City. The
Public Facilities and Services chapter of the General Plan includes the following elements:
                                  Public Services and Facilities

Environmental Hazards Chapter
The hazards of the physical environment, including man-made hazardous conditions and toxic
materials, are addressed in this chapter of the General Plan. Goals and policies are set forth in
each element, which identify specific hazards and means of assuring the protection of public
health, safety and welfare. Hazards of particular concern to the City are given special attention in
this chapter. The Environmental Hazards chapter of the General Plan includes the following
elements:
                                      Environmental Hazards

                                *      Flooding and Hydrology Element
Administering The General Plan
Serving as the foundation upon which all land use and related decisions are based, the General
Plan is often called the “constitution” of the City. In conjunction with its Program EIR, the
General Plan is a comprehensive information and planning guide established by State law to
provide a framework for making informed decisions about the future of the community. The
community’s land use, circulation, environmental, economic and social goals and policies as
they relate to land use and development are documented and addressed in the general Plan.
The Plan and supporting environmental documentation identify concerns and issues important to
the community, analyze them, and establish goals, policies, and program implementation
measures, which resolve identified issues and promote a community vision. They also provide
the basis for a rational nexus to support development, mitigation measures and exactions. Special
studies and performance programs are also integral parts of the goals, policies, programs and
measures which assure effective implementation of the General Plan.
Determining Consistency with the General Plan
Development proposals, whether developer or City initiated, must be analyzed and tested for
consistency with the goals, policies, and programs in every applicable element of the General
Plan. On an on-going basis, the City must assure and maintain consistency of adopted Specific
Plans and the City Zoning Ordinance with the General Plan. This test of General Plan

                                                                    General Plan/Administration Element
compliance is also a required criteria for determining significant impacts under the provisions of
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
Interpreting the General Plan
Whenever uncertainty exists regarding the location of boundaries of any land use category,
proposed public facility symbol, circulation alignment, or other symbol or line found on the
official maps, the following procedures will be used to resolve such uncertainty. Boundaries
shown in the General Plan and on official maps as approximately following the limits of any
municipal corporation are to be construed as following these limits. Boundaries shown as
following or approximately following section lines, half or quarter section lines shall be
construed as following such lines.
Whenever boundaries are shown following or approximately following the centerline of streams,
creeks, rivers, or other continuously or intermittently flowing streams or creeks, these boundaries
are to be construed as following the channel centerline of these water courses taken at mean low
water, and, in the event of natural change in the location of such streams or other water courses,
the zone boundary is to be construed as moving with the channel centerline.
In instances where a land use category applied to a parcel is not mapped to include an adjacent
street or alley, the category shall be considered to extend to the centerline of the right of way.
Boundaries shown as separated from, parallel, or approximately parallel to any of the features
listed above shall be construed to be parallel to such features and at such distances therefrom as
are shown on the map. Symbols that indicate appropriate locations for proposed public facilities
are not property specific. They indicate only the general area within which a specific facility
should be established.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Review of Consistency
The Guidelines of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA Guidelines) require that an
initial study include "an examination of whether the project is compatible with existing zoning
and plans." The CEQA Guidelines further stipulate that, "A project will normally have a
significant effect on the environment if it will conflict with adopted environmental plans and
goals of the community where it is located." If a determination is made by the Planning
Commission or the City Council that the proposed action is inconsistent with the General Plan,
no further action shall be taken without the completion and processing of an EIR or other
detailed analysis, which would support a finding of overriding consideration.
Determining Zoning Consistency
California State law also mandates that the City’s Zoning Ordinance be consistent with the
General Plan. In the event that the Zoning Ordinance becomes inconsistent with the General Plan
by reason of a General Plan Amendment, the Zoning Ordinance must be amended within a
reasonable time so that it is made consistent with the General Plan, as amended. The Zoning
Ordinance cannot be amended if it causes an inconsistency with the General Plan.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                            Administration Element

Amendments To The General Plan
The General Plan can and should be viewed as a dynamic and multi-faceted document, defining
and addressing the changing needs of the community. General Plan issues require on-going
assessment and an understanding of existing and projected community needs. Short-term
programs and policies should be reviewed annually to reflect compatibility with budgetary
priorities, and to assure that the General Plan is kept current with changing conditions and
circumstances. Long-term programs must also be given forward planning consideration to assure
timely funding and development of critical infrastructure and public services and facilities.
Annual Review
California Government Code requires that the planning agency "render an annual report to the
legislative body (City Council) on the status of the Plan and the progress in its implementation"
(Section 65400(b)). State law further requires that the Housing Element be reviewed and updated
at least once every five (5) years.
Mandatory elements of the General Plan may be amended up to four (4) times in each calendar
year. The City Council or any citizen may initiate a General Plan Amendment. It is left to the
discretion of the local jurisdiction to establish an amendment schedule to be published one year
in advance.
Application Procedures To Amend The General Plan
The General Plan or any portion thereof may be amended by filing an application and the
appropriate fees are filed with the City Planning Department. An amendment to the General Plan
constitutes a project under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and therefore is
evaluated for its environmental effects and consistency with other elements of the General Plan.
Final approval of General Plan amendments is the responsibility of the City Council.
Exemptions Applicable To General Plan Amendments
The State Legislature has recognized that occasions arise which require the local jurisdiction to
have some flexibility in amending the General Plan. As set forth in the California Government
Code, the following are exempt from the General Plan amendment schedule.
(1) Amendments requested and determined necessary for the development of a residential
project, of which at least twenty-five percent (25%) of its units will be available to persons of
low or moderate income (Sections 65361(b) and 65358(d)).
(2) Any amendment necessary to comply with a court decision in a case involving the legal
adequacy of the General Plan (Sections 65361 and 65358 (d) (1)).
Community Plans, Area Plans, Specific Plans and Precise Plans
The State General Plan Guidelines recognize three types of sub-plans, including the Community
Plan, Area Plan and Specific Plan. Community and Area Plans focus on a particular region or

                                                                   General Plan/Administration Element
community within the overall General Plan area and must be consistent with the overall General
Plan. This type of plan is adopted as an amendment to the General Plan in conformance with
Government Code Section 65350 et. seq. The “community” or “area” plan includes refined
policies and programs implemented by ordinances and other discretionary action, such as zoning.
Specific Plans and Precise Plans can consist of both policies and programs, as well as
development regulations (see Government Code Section 65450 et. seq.). This type of plan is
most commonly used to master plan large and/or mixed use developments, which require a
specific or precise analysis of land use planning, design and regulation. Specific Plans and
Precise Plans contain text, exhibits, and diagrams indicating the distribution, location, and
intensity of proposed land uses and the necessary public and private urban support systems,
including streets, utilities and drainage facilities.
Specific and Precise Plans also define the standards and criteria by which development and,
where applicable, open space conservation will proceed on the property. These Plans also
provide implementation measures and financing necessary to carry out the project. They must be
consistent with all facets of the General Plan and in turn, zoning, subdivision, and public works
projects must be consistent with an existing Specific Plan (Government Code Section 65455).
Specific Plans are prepared, adopted and amended in the same manner as a General Plan, may be
adopted by resolution or ordinance, and may be amended as often as deemed necessary by the
City Council.
Precise Plans are prepared, adopted and amended as per the Precise Plan of Design (PPD)
Ordinance by resolution or ordinance, and may be amended as often as deemed necessary by the
City Council.
Planning Capital Facilities
One of the statutory responsibilities of California incorporated towns, cities and counties is to
“annually review the capital improvement program of the city or county and the local public
works projects of other local agencies for their consistency with the General Plan.” Also,
pursuant to Government Code Section 65401, all departments within the City and all other local
government agencies must submit a list of proposed projects to the City. The City is required to
review these projects for conformity with the General Plan.
General Plan Implementation
Local jurisdictions must continuously and consistently implement the General Plan once it has
been adopted in conformance with Government Code Section 65103(c). The Cathedral City
General Plan relies on element programs and strategies, as well as the related mitigation
measures and programs set forth in the General Plan Program EIR, to serve as implementation
measures. The City Zoning Ordinance is also essential in implementing the goals and policies of
the Plan. Community, Area, Specific and Precise Plans provide detailed implementation
programs for distinct or complex portions of the General Plan area.
The Zoning Ordinance and General Plan Implementation
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                           Administration Element
Amended June 24, 2009                                                                              II-7

                                                                                    City of Cathedral City
                                                                      General Plan/Administration Element
The primary tool for implementing the General Plan is the Zoning Ordinance, which constitutes
an exercise of police powers granted to the City by the State. It regulates land use by distinct
development zones, or districts, and permitted uses. These are set forth in the form of text, maps,
diagrams and other materials, which describe the distribution and intensity of land uses into such
categories as residential, commercial, industrial and open space. Minimum development
standards are established through written regulations for each of the land use districts that are
consistent with the General Plan. Permitting processes set forth in the Zoning Ordinance,
including Conditional Use Permits, Variances, Design Reviews and other land use permitting
also implement the General Plan. The implementation of the General Plan is further regulated by
Government Code Sections 65800 et. seq.
The Subdivision Ordinance and the General Plan
The subdivision ordinance, like the Zoning Ordinance, is also an exercise of police powers and a
principal instrument for implementing the General Plan. Establishing state-wide uniformity in
local subdivision procedures, the State Subdivision Map Act (Government Code Sections 66410
et seq.) leaves the standards for regulating the design and improvement of subdivision to local
government. The broadest authority for regulating subdivisions lies in Government Code
Sections 66473.5, 66474, 66474.60, and 66474.61, requiring findings that, among other things,
the subdivision is consistent with the City General Plan and any applicable Specific Plan.
Development Agreements
Government Code Section 65865 et seq. provides for the adoption of development agreements
between a project proponent and the City. Development agreements provide developers with
additional assurances that development approvals will not be nullified by some future local
policy or regulation change. In turn, the development agreement may require the developer to
meet certain conditions or performance criteria which become part of the agreement.
Development agreements can be a useful means of meeting General Plan goals and policies,
while removing some of the uncertainties faced by developers. Agreements generally remain in
effect for several years, the term typically being set forth in the agreement.
As set forth in Government Code Section 65866, the City, unless otherwise provided by the
development agreement, is not prevented from applying new rules, regulations, and policies
which do not conflict with those rules, regulations, and policies applicable to that property.
Neither is the City prevented from denying or conditionally approving any subsequent
development project application on the basis of existing or new rules, regulations or policies.
City Commissions and Committees
State law also empowers the City to establish advisory commissions or committees, which may
be comprised of public officials as well as private individuals, to review and make
recommendations on policies or programs facilitating implementation of the General Plan. These
commissions typically address such issue areas as parks and recreation, trails, libraries, public

The City Council may establish commissions or committees to address specific and focused
issues, or to provide recommendations on an on-going basis. The Council may perpetuate or
dissolve these commissions or committees as it sees fit.
SUMMARY

LAND USE ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Land Use Element defines the various land use categories assigned to lands within the City
and its Sphere-of-Influence. The element also crystallizes technical discussions and analyses
from other General Plan elements and the Plan’s Program EIR, and provides appropriate goals,
policies and programs to help direct further development and ultimate buildout of the
community. The Land Use Element is the broadest and most far-reaching of all General Plan
elements and, in conjunction with General Plan EIR, serves as the foundation for land use policy
development.
BACKGROUND
California Government Code Section 65300 requires cities and counties to prepare and adopt “a
comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development” of the community. The
General Plan must also designate lands for housing, business, industry, open space, as well as
other uses deemed appropriate by the City (Government Code Sections 65302(a). The Element
also incorporates designations reflecting physical development and land use, consistent with
Government Code Section 65303. It incorporates mapping of the General Plan land use
distributions and provides statements relating to standards of development, intensity and
population density. Policies and programs associated with each of the major land use categories
are set forth in the Land Use Element and reflect the compatible and integrally planned
distribution of land uses reflected in the Plan.
On December 23, 2007, approximately 1,400 acres of land north of Interstate 10 were annexed
into the City (“2007 Annexed Area”). State law requires that the City pre-zone property to be
annexed and denies the City the ability to rezone any property within newly-annexed area for
two (2) years after annexation. On July 8, 2009, the City adopted the North City Specific Plan,
establishing land uses and development standards, among other things, for North City, which
includes the 2007 Annexed Area. Therefore, the Land Use Categories established by the pre-
zoning of the 2007 Annexed Area will remain unchanged until December 23, 2009, at which
time they will become consistent with the North City Specific Plan land use designations.
LAND USE CATEGORIES
The Land Use Element and the official General Plan Land Use Map describe and designate the
distribution of land uses by type, location, intensity and/or extent of use. Uses to be considered
are diverse and include: residential, commercial, industrial, mixed-use, open space, recreation,
public buildings and facilities, and other categories of public and private land uses.
Prior to the adoption of the Cathedral City General Plan comprehensive update, the City utilized
the land use designations and assignments adopted in the 1987 Plan. A comprehensive

assessment of existing land uses and their distribution was conducted using field surveys, aerial
photo analysis and a computer-based geographic information system (GIS).
Table III-1 provides a summary description of the City’s proposed General Plan land use

Residential
(HR) Hillside Reserve (0-1 du/20 ac)       This designation provides for development densities
                                           of one dwelling unit per 20 acres. Development
                                           could be precluded on these lands due to
                                           topographic, hydrologic, aesthetic or other
                                           constraints. In such cases, development rights could
                                           be preserved by density transfer or similar
                                           mechanism.
(RE) Estate Residential (0-2 du/ac)        The residential estate designation provides for
                                           larger lot subdivisions with single-family residential
                                           development. This designation is envisioned for
                                           rural areas, as well as lands which may also be
                                           constrained by topography or other natural
                                           restrictions. This type of development may also
                                           incorporate a “greenbelt” buffer to help define the
                                           City’s urban boundary.
(RL) Low Density Residential (2-4.5 du/ac) The Low Density Residential designation provides
                                           for single-family residential development on
                                           individual lots typically ranging from about 7,500 to
                                           20,000 square feet. These lands serve to buffer more
                                           dense residential development from estate
                                           residential uses and may be appropriate in areas
                                           with some site constraints.
(RR) Resort Residential (3-6.5 du/ac)      This low density designation is intended to
                                           accommodate single-family and attached residential
                                           development in a master planned resort setting. On-
                                           site amenities typically include golf courses, tennis
                                           and swimming facilities, as well as tourist/resort-
                                           serving commercial uses. This designation also
                                           allows hotels/motels and ancillary visitor and
                                           tourist-serving commercial uses.

                                                                  General Plan/Land Use Element
(RM) Medium Density Res. (4.5-10 du/ac) This designation provides for moderately low to
                                        medium density subdivisions and Planned Unit
                                        Developments (PUDs). It serves to transition
                                        between lower and more moderate (medium)
                                        residential densities. Product types typically range
                                        from single-family to multi-family development,
                                        with much of existing development being duplex
                                        units on 8,000 square foot lots.
(RH) High Density Res. (11-20 du/ac)    This designation allows for the greatest diversity
                                        and highest density of residential development,
                                        providing for a full range of multi-family dwellings,
                                        including apartments and condominiums. It is also
                                        suitable for planned communities and affordable
                                        and senior housing, where smaller units and higher
                                        densities may be appropriate. Multi-family
                                        development provides for PUDs comprised of a
                                        varying range of residential types and on-site
                                        amenities. These lands are typically located in close
                                        proximity to neighborhood commercial uses,
                                        thereby maximizing pedestrian access to these
                                        essential services. Mobile home parks or
                                        subdivisions with PUD-type development may also
                                        be allowed.
(PUD) Planned Unit Developments         While not a land use designation, Planned Unit
                                        Developments (PUDs) consolidate areas for
                                        structures, common open space and recreation
                                        areas, and integrate access onto private internal
                                        roadways. PUDs permit the transfer of densities
                                        from open space/recreation areas provided within
                                        the development, thus consolidating open space.
                                        The purpose of the PUD is to promote planned
                                        residential development and amenities beyond those
                                        typically     provided       within       conventional
                                        subdivisions, to achieve greater flexibility in design,
                                        varying ranges of densities, and to encourage well
                                        planned neighborhoods through creative and
                                        imaginative planning. The PUD also allows an
                                        appropriate mix of housing types, which are unique
                                        in their physical characteristics to warrant special
                                        methods of residential development. A full range of
                                        residential development is permitted, consistent
                                        with the underlying land use designation.

                             employment centers and should facilitate
                             pedestrian, bicycle and public transit access to the
                             greatest extent practical.

                                      traffic, vibration, or other nuisances.
                                      Examples include the manufacturing of durable
                                      goods, such as appliances, furniture, fabricated
                                      metal products, and light electrical and
                                      transportation equipment. These uses may also have
                                      a potential for greater dependence on outdoor
                                      storage. Proponents will be required to mitigate any
                                      adverse impacts to acceptable or insignificant
                                      levels, demonstrate conformance with all
                                      community environmental standards, and be
                                      compatible with existing and planned land uses.

Specific Plans
Specific Plans are to be used as development tools for projects or locations which have special
development needs, including the Downtown and other master planned areas. Specific Plans are
to be applied to projects which propose a mix of uses, or projects which have either
environmental or geophysical issues associated with the property.
Specific Plans will provide detailed design guidelines and analyses of the projects to which they
apply, including the distribution, location, and intensity of proposed land uses. They also
examine the required level of public facilities and services and their availability, and they should
help establish the economic viability of proposed developments. Standards and requirements for
Specific Plans may be included within the Specific Plan document or in the Zoning Ordinance.
Precise Plans
Precise Plans are also development tools which further refine Specific Plans for large multi-
phased, multi-use and complex projects. Precise Plans add additional detail with respect to
private development, public facilities and services and their availability, phasing and design
guidelines.

RESIDENTIAL LAND USES BACKGROUND
Cathedral City is arguably one of the most balanced communities in the Coachella Valley. Since
its incorporation in the early 1980s, the City has evolved to provide residents with a wide range
of residential opportunities, including neighborhood and resort single-family development,
residential mixed with compatible commercial uses, and quality high-density affordable and
senior housing. According to various sources of housing and population data, in 1990 the City
had approximately 15,229 housing units, of which about 56% were single family (attached and
detached), 24% were multi-family, and 20% were mobile homes.
By the Year 2000, the City had a total of 17,916 dwelling units. Over this ten-year period, the
housing mix changed modestly, with about 60% single family (attached and detached), 24%
multi-family, and 16% mobile homes. The percentage of the City’s housing stock in single
family units increased by about 4%, mobile homes as a percentage of the total decreased by
about 4%, and multi-family units stayed about the same. New single family residential in the
northeastern portion of the City had the greatest effect on the overall housing mix over this 10-
year period.
In 1990, the City’s population was approximately 30,085, and the City had an average household
size of 2.75 persons. By 2000, the City population had risen to 42,647 (a 42% increase over
1990) and the average household size had risen to 3.03 persons.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                                 Land Use Element
Amended June 24, 2009                                                                             III-15

                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                                        General Plan/Land Use Element
The City’s 2000 average household size is comparable to that of the Riverside County average of
2.98 persons per household, but is substantially larger than that of neighboring Palm Springs
(2.05) and Rancho Mirage (1.92).
The General Plan provides for a wide range of residential unit types and densities, ranging up to
forty-five (45) dwelling units per acre within seven basic residential land use categories,
including Hillside Reserve (1 du/20 ac), High Density (11-20 du/ac) and Mixed-Use (7-45
du/ac). Upon buildout of the General Plan planning area, the City could have a total of up to
39,982 dwelling units and a permanent population of up to 121,145. This projected population
assumes current (2000) household densities and a 25% reduction in acreage for streets and
parkways in each category.
The City and all other jurisdictions in California are required by law to assure the provision and
availability of decent housing and a suitable living environment for all economic segments of the
community, with special attention to very low, low and moderate income groups. The elderly,
those paying too much for rent/mortgages and those living in overcrowded conditions are
identified special groups that require special attention when providing for the community’s
housing needs. Each of these groups has found acceptable housing opportunities in Cathedral
City. For additional information addressing these and other related issues associated with
community housing stock, please refer to the Housing Element.

COMMERCIAL LAND USE BACKGROUND
Since its incorporation, Cathedral City has emerged as a significant player in commercial activity
and retail development. As an essential part of the City’s mix of land uses and the local
economic base, commercial lands and development generate important tax revenues and
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                               Land Use Element
Amended June 24, 2009                                                                           III-18

                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                                        General Plan/Land Use Element
employment opportunities. The City’s success is due in part to its central location and excellent
access from major intra-regional arterial roadways. Increasing household incomes, both in
Cathedral City and surrounding communities, are also enhancing the City’s retail environment
and creating new or expanded commercial markets in such areas as entertainment retailing,
dining, and specialty and niche shopping.
With the development of additional neighborhood and community-scale commercial centers, the
City has significantly strengthened its commercial position in the growing Coachella Valley
market. This growth has included such “big box” retailers as Sam’s Club and Wal-Mart, which
have also supported a wide range of smaller, service commercial outlets. The City’s very
successful Auto Mall on East Palm Canyon has become an important economic engine that
provides substantial retail sales tax revenues, but has also given support to a wide range of auto-
related service commercial ventures in the City.
The latest block in building the City’s commercial and economic foundation has been the
implementation of the Downtown Precise Plan, which is revitalizing the downtown core area
along the East Palm Canyon Drive corridor. New development stimulated by the civic center
complex, IMAX Theater and Mary Pickford Theaters are providing the foundation for growth in
local-serving and tourist commercial development, as well as mixed use residential and hotel
projects. The City’s growth in taxable sales, from about $399 million in 1995 to almost $610
million in 1999, is testament to the effective effort the City continues to make in building an
economically vital community.
COMMERCIAL GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Goal
A balanced mix of commercial lands and services serving neighborhood, community, regional
and visitor needs of all sectors of the community, which are appropriately distributed to take

INDUSTRIAL LAND USE BACKGROUND
Industrial development in the City is currently (2002) limited, and opportunities for expansion of
industrial land uses are defined by substantial existing development and limited opportunities for
properly sited industrial uses. The Land Use Element and map address the need for additional
industrial lands by taking advantage of existing physical constraints and opportunities, including
the proximity of the US Interstate-10/Union Pacific Railroad transportation corridor. Additional
lands assigned industrial uses include those adjoining the Edom Hill Landfill and other lands
north of I-10. The Plan also designates lands located north of I-10 for business park
development.
The Land Use Element provides two industrial categories, a general “Industrial” designation and
a “Business Park” designation. As discussed above, the Industrial land use category provides for
a wide range of uses that are expected to be readily permissible with the caveat that they do not
generate meaningful environmental impacts and operate entirely in enclosed buildings. The
designation also provides for “discretionary” types of uses, the suitability of which will be
determined on a case-by-case basis. A subcategory of “Industrial” is “Industrial – Edom Hill”,
which encourages alternative energy projects and associated manufacturing and other uses that
may require minimal permanent structures.
The Business Park designation is meant to provide for a wide variety of mutually compatible
uses, ranging from light industrial to professional office development. Land uses under this
designation are expected to be compatible with neighboring residential and commercial uses.
Other potentially appropriate office uses include administrative, corporate, institutional, legal,
medical, financial, insurance, real estate, and government uses. Limited and primarily business-
park-serving commercial, including restaurants, printing and copying services, are also expected
to be compatible within this environment.
INDUSTRIAL GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Goal
A mix of business park and industrial uses and lands that are clean and non-polluting, can be
developed in a manner compatible with non-industrial uses, and which enhance the mix of
employment opportunities in the community and broaden the economic base of the City.
Policy 1
Protect and enhance the broadly-based business park nature of industrial development in the
Perez Road corridor and other industrial areas of the City by preventing the development of
particularly sensitive or otherwise incompatible land uses in the vicinity.
Policy 2
Recognize and preserve appropriate lands north of Interstate-10 for future business park and
industrial development by precluding land uses that are inconsistent or incompatible with
physical constraints of the area, and which may create land use compatibility issues with
business park/industrial development.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                                 Land Use Element

MUNICIPAL FACILITIES AND SERVICES BACKGROUND
The provision of adequate levels of public facilities and services is one of the principal concerns
of local government. Land uses for public facilities and services include such governmental
functions as the Civic Center, fire and police stations, and the City’s corporate yard. Other public
and quasi-public services and facilities include those associated with schools and libraries,
hospitals and other medical facilities, and utility infrastructure. (Also please see the Public
Facilities and Services Element).
The level of public services and facilities needed to support residential, commercial, mixed-use
and industrial development, and community needs in general, is directly related to the intensity
of development and the socio-economic structure of the community. The planned logical
extension of the City’s urbanizing areas cannot occur without the careful and timely planning for
and coordination of the extension of public services and facilities.
The viability and nurturing of the development environment, and the economic life and future of
the City, are directly tied to the level and cost of services and facilities, the types and intensity of
land use, and the level of demand generated for public services and facilities. The economic
health of the City is also dependent upon a balance between service costs and revenues generated
by current and future development.
While the extension of many urban services and facilities is provided by various public agencies
and regulated private companies, some of these service providers are not under the City’s
regulatory jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the City has the essential responsibility to cooperate with
the appropriate agencies, public districts and private companies, to facilitate the timely
availability of services, but to also assure that premature and inappropriate land uses are not
encouraged.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                                    Land Use Element

OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION BACKGROUND
The City and the Coachella valley are host to a wide variety of open space and conservation
lands and resources, which are important assets for all of the valley’s communities. The open
space and conservation spaces in the City are important areas of aesthetic, recreational and
natural resource value, which also give the community its essential character.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                                  Land Use Element

Open space and conservation areas within the City and planning area include rugged and
imposing elevated terrain of the foothills and mountains, major drainages and waterways, and
lands serving as utility corridors.
These lands are also designated for the preservation of natural resources (plant and animal
communities), washes and their banks, mineral deposits, parks and recreation facilities, multi-use
trails, and areas where the presence of hazardous conditions limits or precludes development.
Parks and Public Open Space lands include special, important or valuable natural resources,
which warrant protection. Open Space-Private designations may be assigned to private open
space areas which are preserved for this use. Open Space–Other lands define a variety of open
spaces and special resource areas, or those that may pose threats or hazards to development, and
Open Space-Watercourse lands delineate floodways, including natural and man-made floodway
and drainage channels.
OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Goal 1
Environmental resources that are protected through the establishment and preservation of open
space areas, which also protect residents and property from environmental hazards while
providing recreational opportunities and enhancing the beauty and attraction of the community.
Goal 2

that contribute to the overall quality of life for its citizens and visitors, while preserving scenic
resources of the desert and mountains.
Policy 1
The General Plan and supporting documents shall provide comprehensive descriptions and
mapping of open space and conservation areas that are valued for their community-wide asset
value, including the Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan area, and/or are identified as
areas constituting environmental hazards such as flood plains, high voltage electric transmission
corridors, earthquake fault zones and blowsand hazard areas.
Policy 2
All development proposals shall be reviewed for the degree or extent to which they encroach
upon sensitive resource areas or may subject people and/or improvements to damage from
environmental hazards. Mitigation measures shall be promulgated, to the extent practical, to
avoid significant impacts and determine the feasibility of development proposals.
Policy 3
The City shall explore and exploit all legitimate and appropriate opportunities to secure and
protect valuable open space and conservation lands for the benefit of the entire community.

                      CIRCULATION ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide goals, policies, programs and standards
which correlate the City’s transportation system with the types, intensities and locations of land
uses within the City. It addresses those segments of the local transportation system that interface
with and serve as extensions of the regional system connecting Cathedral City with the broader
Coachella Valley and other communities in Southern California. The Circulation Element also
serves as the blueprint for future land use policy decisions and social and economic development
efforts.
BACKGROUND
The Circulation Element is an infrastructure plan that provides connectivity between the various
existing and planned land uses of the City and addresses the dynamic access issues associated
with the mix of residential, employment, commercial and institutional uses in the community. In
addition to its effects on the physical, social and economic environment of the City, the
Circulation Element also has a direct relationship with the Housing, Open Space, Noise and Air
Quality elements. Being integrally tied to the Land Use Element, the Circulation Element is
predictably influenced by the types, intensities and distribution of land uses within the
community and surrounding area. Local and regional air quality issues are closely related to the
efficiency of the local and regional transportation system. As the population in Cathedral City
and the Coachella Valley continues to grow, vehicle miles will increase, and travel speeds will
be reduced, resulting in higher emissions per mile traveled. The policies and programs
established by the Circulation Element can play an important role in maintaining and enhancing
                                                     the flow of traffic and preserving air quality
                                                     in the community.

INDICATORS OF ROADWAY EFFICIENCY
The efficient movement of vehicular traffic on local and regional roadways is critical to the
normal day-to-day functioning of a community. Obstructions in traffic flow can have serious
consequences, including economic loss due to delays in transporting goods, increased
psychological stress for the traveling public, and increased risk for motor vehicle accidents. The
efficiency of a particular roadway can be determined by assessing the roadway’s capacity, level-
of-service, and average daily traffic volume, each of which is described below.
Level-of-Service
Roadway capacity is defined as the number of vehicles that may pass over a section of roadway
in a given time period under prevailing conditions. Roadway capacity is most restricted by
intersection design and operation.
The capacity of a roadway and the degree to which that capacity is being utilized is typically
described as the roadway’s “Level-of-Service” (LOS). Level-of-Service is a qualitative measure
of the efficiency of traffic flow and is defined by alphabetical connotations, ranging from “A”
through “F,” that characterize roadway operating conditions.

LOS A represents an optimum or free-flowing condition, and LOS F indicates extremely slow
speeds and system failure. Levels-of-Service are represented as volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios,
or vehicle demand divided by roadway capacity. V/C ratios smaller than 1.00 imply better
operational characteristics and levels-of-service. V/C ratios that exceed 1.00 imply worse
operating conditions and LOS F, where traffic demand exceeds roadway capacity. The table
below defines the various LOS classifications.

Level of
Service                                      Quality of Traffic Flow
A            Primarily free-flow operations at average travel speeds usually about 90 percent of
             the free-flow speed for the arterial classification. Vehicles are completely unimpeded
             in their ability to maneuver within the traffic stream. Stopped delay at signalised
             intersections is minimal.
B            Reasonably unimpeded operations at average travel speeds usually about 70% of the
             free-flow speed of the arterial classification. Ability to maneuver within the traffic
             stream is only slightly restricted. Stopped delays are not bothersome, and drivers
             generally are not subject to appreciable tension.
C            Traffic operations are stable. However, mid-block maneuverability may be more
             restricted than in LOS B. Longer queues, adverse signal coordination, or both may
             contribute to lower average travel speeds of about 50% of the average free-flow speed
             for the arterial classification. Motorists will experience some appreciable tension
             while driving.
D            Borders on a range where small increases in flow may cause substantial increases in
             approach delay and decreases in arterial speed. LOS D may be due to adverse signal
             progression, inappropriate signal timing, high volumes, or some combination of these
             factors. Average travel speeds are about 40% of the free-flow speed. For planning
             purposes, this level-of-serve is the lowest that is considered acceptable.
E            Characterized by significant approach delays and average travel speeds of one-third
             or less of the free-flow speed. Typically caused by some combination of adverse
             progression, high signal density (more than two signalised intersections per mile),
             high volumes, extensive queuing, delays at critical intersections, and/or inappropriate
             signal timing.
F            Arterial flow at extremely slow speeds, below one-third to one-fourth of the free-flow
             speed. Intersection congestion is likely at critical signalised intersections, with high
             approach delays and extensive queuing. Adverse progression is frequently a
             contributor to this condition.

Traffic engineers and transportation planners are involved in on-going efforts to strike a balance
between providing ideal roadway operating conditions and controlling the costs of infrastructure
and right-of-way needed to assure those conditions. For General Plan purposes, the upper level
of LOS D is assumed to be the “acceptable” level-of-service for a given roadway in the City.
While the vast majority of roadways in the planning area are expected to operate at acceptable
levels-of-service at General Plan buildout, several segments may operate at LOS E or F unless
special design and/or control measures are implemented to mitigate traffic impacts in these areas.
Typically, capacity can be increased by adding travel or turning lanes, constructing raised
medians, and/or restricting vehicle access to a roadway. By reducing the number of vehicle
conflict points, traffic flow on a roadway can be substantially improved, avoiding the loss of
capacity caused by disruptions to traffic flow resulting from vehicles entering or leaving the
roadway (see Section III-B, General Plan Program EIR for more information about mitigating
traffic impacts).
Average Daily Traffic Volumes
Average Daily Trips (ADT) is the total number of vehicles that travel a defined segment of
roadway over a twenty-four hour period. ADT is a useful benchmark number for determining
various roadway configurations and design aspects. The peak hour ADT, which is the highest
volume of traffic to pass over a segment of roadway during an hour period, is also a useful
means of determining a roadway's capacity and level-of-service. Traffic counts at intersections
can provide an even more detailed picture of existing and future operating conditions at
intersections.
Roadways are generally classified in a hierarchical manner, according to the number of vehicle
lanes provided. Table III-5, below, lists the various roadway types/cross-sections found in the
planning area and the maximum daily traffic volumes each type of roadway can accommodate at
various levels-of-service. For example, for a Major Highway to operate at LOS C, it should
accommodate no more than 24,000 vehicle trips per day. These roadway capacities are “rule-of-
thumb” estimates, which may vary depending upon site-specific factors, such as the number and
configurations of intersections, roadway grades, sight distance, percentage of truck and bus
traffic, and degree of access control.

CURRENT CONDITIONS
The City of Cathedral City and the communities of the Coachella Valley located south of US
Interstate-10 have grown into a continuous and interconnected suburban development pattern,
tied together by state and interstate highways and a network of arterial roadways. This
interconnection has been further supported by the Mid-Valley Parkway, which provides an
additional intercity link between local communities and economic markets. A variety of physical
influences and constraints, including the geography of the City and valley, the constrained
development pattern between U.S. Interstate-10 and the Santa Rosa Mountains, and the existing
roadway network, affect traffic flows and the impacts of development on local roadways. The
existing roadway network is further described in the General Plan EIR and its special traffic
study.
Major Regional Roadways
Two regional routes provide primary access to the City: East Palm Canyon Drive (formerly State
Highway 111) and U.S. Interstate-10. US Interstate-10 connects the Los Angeles region with
Arizona and other cities and states to the east. East Palm Canyon Drive is designated as State
Highway 111 at its junction with Interstate-10 several miles west of Palm Springs. As it enters
Palm Springs, Highway 111 proceeds east along Vista Chino, then south along Gene Autry Trail,
where it intersects and becomes East Palm Canyon Drive and proceeds east through Cathedral
City.

                                                                       General Plan/Circulation Element
East of Cathedral City, East Palm Canyon Drive is once again designated as “Highway 111,” and
it continues southeast to Brawley in the Imperial Valley. The Mid-Valley Parkway is an
additional intra-regional arterial that extends from the Palm Springs International Airport
entrance on Ramon Road, southeast to Cook Street. Each of these regional facilities is briefly
described below.
U.S. Interstate-10
I-10 provides essential inter-city and inter-regional access and is a critical part of the local road
network, moving people and goods into and out of the Valley. Where it passes through Cathedral
City, U.S. Interstate-10 is built as an eight-lane divided freeway, which is accessed from a
diamond-shaped interchange at Date Palm Drive and a similar interchange at Palm Drive/Gene
Autry Trail. Additional City access to I-10 is available through the Ramon Road interchange to
the east. The General Plan proposes and plans for the future construction of an additional
interchange at the northerly extension of Da Vall Drive, approximately one mile east of the I-
10/Date Palm Drive interchange, and at Landau Boulevard, approximately one mile west of the
I-10-Date Palm Drive interchange.
East Palm Canyon Drive
East Palm Canyon Drive follows the approximate route of the Old Bradshaw Trail (see the
Archaeological and Cultural Resources Element), which runs along the toe of the Santa Rosa
Mountains and the Whitewater River. This roadway again becomes the state-classified Highway
111 at the City’s easterly boundary with Rancho Mirage. Its classification notwithstanding, East
Palm Canyon Drive is an important intra-regional connector serving local cities. Over the past
several years, some through-traffic appears to have moved north to I-10 in response to
congestion along this roadway.
East Palm Canyon Drive is an integral part of the Downtown Redevelopment Project and has
been improved to enhance traffic flow and better serve the adjoining commercial and
institutional land uses. Completed improvements extend from Cathedral Canyon Drive eastward
to Date Palm Drive and include two through-lanes in each direction, raised and landscaped
median islands, and parallel service or frontage roads that provide bus service parking and side-
street access outside the main flow of traffic.
Mid-Valley Parkway
The Mid-Valley Parkway was originally conceived as an east-west, inter-city arterial that would
serve as a high capacity linkage between Palm Springs and the various communities of the
Coachella Valley, and as an alternate route to Highway 111/East Palm Canyon Drive. It was
envisioned as a six-lane, high-speed, restricted access roadway, which would be located mid-way
between Highway 111 and Interstate-10 and provide access to regional transportation hubs,
including the Palm Springs International Airport.
Unfortunately, cost constraints and problems securing adequate right-of-way in adjoining cities
have reduced the size of this arterial to four lanes, divided. Today, the parkway follows a
circuitous route from Palm Springs to Rancho Mirage and provides only marginally better
performance than other regional arterials.

The Mid-Valley Parkway’s westerly terminus is Highway 111 in the San Gorgonio Pass, and its
easterly terminus is Cook Street in Palm Desert. In Cathedral City, the Mid-Valley Parkway
extends east-west along Dinah Shore Drive. The addition of a bridge over the Whitewater River
has reduced some of the traffic volume on nearby Ramon Road, however, development along
much of this roadway limits its capacity through the City. It is unclear whether the Mid-Valley
Parkway constitutes a meaningful change or addition to arterial facilities in the area, however,
funding is available from CVAG to assist in completing its design, development and
construction. The Transportation Uniform Mitigation Fee (TUMF) program has helped to pay for
this facility and a wide range of other arterial roadways in the Coachella Valley.
Major Local Roadways
The City has facilitated the construction and maintenance of a variety of other major roadways of
local importance, including Gerald Ford Drive, Ramon Road, Vista Chino, Date Palm Drive,
Varner Road and Cathedral Canyon Drive. These roadways have been built along a north-
south/east-west grid that interconnects with major arterials passing through adjacent
jurisdictions. The convenience they provide in traversing through the City is of significant
importance to residents and businesses alike.
A variety of traffic data was collected to evaluate existing traffic conditions in the planning area,
including traffic counts and estimations from the City of Cathedral City, Coachella Valley
Association of Governments (CVAG), CalTrans, and special site-specific traffic studies
conducted for development projects in the planning area. The following table describes existing
capacities, average traffic volumes, and levels-of-service for roadways in the General Plan
planning area. Existing Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes are displayed graphically on
Exhibit III-2, and street cross-sections are illustrated on Exhibit III-4.

GENERAL PLAN TRANSPORTATION MODEL
A computer-generated transportation model was developed to evaluate existing roadway
operating conditions in the General Plan planning area and to forecast projected impacts
associated with General Plan buildout and regional growth. The model utilized geographic
information system (GIS) mapping of the entire planning area and was based upon the Coachella
Valley Area Transportation Study (CVATS) model, which was developed by the Southern
California Association of Governments, in conjunction with the Coachella Valley Association of
Governments (CVAG) and the Riverside County Transportation Commission (RCTC). The
CVATS model provides a level of analysis appropriate for sub-regional and regional analysis,
and is currently used by most agencies in the Coachella Valley for the development of long-
range transportation plans. However, the model does not evaluate impacts to local streets, nor
does it provide analysis of turning movements at intersections.
Using procedures similar to those used to develop the 2010 version of the CVATS model, the
General Plan modeling process consisted of mapping the new General Plan land use allocations
and overlaying them with a variety of socio-economic data and the existing and planned roadway
network of the planning area. Attributes and characteristics of the model were refined to better
replicate local land use conditions and travel characteristics, and to produce accurate and
reasonable traffic forecasts for buildout of the General Plan planning area. Additional
transportation network and zone details were developed for this effort.
CVATS-Based Zone System
Utilizing the CVATS model as a guide, the City was subdivided into a system of traffic analysis
zones (TAZs). The City’s 1998 land use patterns were used to determine where CVATS TAZs
needed to be further subdivided, making provisions for approved but as yet completed master
planned communities. New General Plan land use allocations were evaluated, and based on this
distribution of land uses, traffic volumes were generated and distributed along the roadways
within each TAZ.
This process resulted in a forecast of future traffic volumes that are expected to occur at General
Plan buildout, and it approximated how traffic is expected to enter and utilize the local roadway
system. The results provide important information about the ability of the current roadway
system to maintain acceptable traffic flows in the future. (Please see the technical appendices of
General Plan EIR for an illustration of TAZ boundaries and a breakdown of the various land uses
within each TAZ).
Trip Generation
The total number of vehicle trips produced in or attracted to a particular geographic area is
directly related to its land use and demographic characteristics. Land use data, as designated by
existing land use patterns and the General Plan Land Use Element, served as the basis for
determining the number of vehicle trips generated within each TAZ.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                                Circulation Element
Amended June 24, 2009                                                                              III-42

                                                                                  City of Cathedral City
                                                                       General Plan/Circulation Element
The CVATS model was used to determine the average number of daily trips for each land use,
and this data was modified for City-specific application. The General Plan transportation model
then estimated the number of peak season vehicle trips expected to be produced on an average
weekday within each TAZ.
Trip Distribution and Traffic Assignment
The next step in the modeling process was to directionally distribute the vehicle trips produced in
or attracted to each TAZ and assign them to specific streets. The transportation analysis uses a
“gravity distribution model,” which assumes that the distribution of vehicle trips is proportional
to the “attractiveness” of the land use and the distance (or travel time) from the point of trip
production. Each type of trip or trip purpose has its own specific travel characteristics.
The model then assigned vehicle trips to specific route paths based upon the interchanges of
traffic between TAZs identified in the trip distribution process. The result is a forecast of daily
traffic volumes at General Plan buildout, with the assignment of vehicle trips to specific
roadways within the planning area. As with other aspects of the General Plan modeling effort,
traffic assignments have been adapted from procedures used in the CVATS model.
GENERAL PLAN BUILDOUT
Trip Generation
The number of trips generated at buildout of the planning area is based on the land use types and
intensities assigned by the General Plan Land Use Plan. The transportation model estimates the
average number of peak season vehicle trips that will be produced on a weekday for each TAZ,
and gives special consideration to seasonal peak trips to address the increased travel demand that
occurs when visitors and seasonal residents utilize the City roadway network. Based on the land
use types and intensities established by the Land Use Plan, buildout of the General Plan planning
area is expected to generate a total of approximately 992,862 daily two-way trips.
Levels-of-Service
Buildout of the General Plan is expected to provide LOS D or better operations on a daily basis
for most (81%) roadway segments in the planning area. However, thirteen segments (15%) are
expected to operate at LOS E, and four (4%) are expected to operate at LOS F. Typically,
impacts to roadway links that are projected to operate at LOS E on a daily basis can be
adequately mitigated by providing additional turning lanes at intersections. Where roadway links
are projected to operate at LOS F, the construction of additional through lanes is usually required
to adequately reduce delays or provide alternative parallel routes.
The preservation of adequate right-of-way at major intersections is critical to improving
conditions on roadways projected to function at LOS E and F, in order to allow space for future
intersection improvements. Areas where future impacts remain unacceptable will require more
detailed and focused analysis to alleviate anticipated impacts. These areas are addressed in
subsequent sections of this element.
Anticipated average daily traffic (ADT) volumes and levels-of-service (LOS) for major roadway

Roadway Classifications
To adequately serve projected traffic volumes at General Plan buildout, a roadway classification
system has been developed for the planning area. Each major roadway within the study area has
been assigned a specific design classification, based on existing and projected traffic demands
generated by buildout of the General Plan. Anticipated future traffic volumes and overall
community design goals set forth in the General Plan have been used to establish the need for
and appropriateness of each roadway classification. The classification plan is illustrated in
Exhibit III-6. Each classification corresponds with the street cross-sections illustrated previously
in this element. Certain refinements may be required when securing right-of-way and
constructing improvements at specific locations.
The roadway classification plan includes several improvements to the City’s circulation system,
including: 1) a new interchange at Interstate-10 and DaVall Drive, which is expected to divert a
significant amount of traffic from Date Palm Drive and Gene Autry Trail/Palm Drive onto
DaVall Drive, 2) the construction of a grade separated crossing of the Union Pacific Railroad
along DaVall Drive to maximize safety and minimize traffic delays, 3) the
extension/improvement of DaVall Drive, between 30th Avenue and Varner Road, as an arterial
highway to better serve future development and reduce future traffic volumes at the I-10/Date
Palm Drive interchange, 4) the addition of D Street as a collector between Cathedral Canyon
Drive and East Palm Canyon Drive, 5) the designation of Special Study Zones along Date Palm
Drive and DaVall Drive, in the vicinity of Interstate-10, where capacity augmentation may be
required, 6) reconstruction of the Interstate-10 and Date Palm Drive interchange, widening the
Date Palm Drive bridge to six lanes and reconstructing on- and off-ramps to maximize safety and
minimize traffic delays, 7) reconstruction of the Interstate-10 and Palm Drive interchange,
widening the Palm Drive bridge to six lanes and reconstructing on- and off-ramps to maximize
safety and minimize traffic delays, and 8) Extension of Landau Boulevard between Rio Vista
Drive and Valley Center Boulevard and an interchange with Interstate-10.
Intersection Enhancements
While the General Plan analysis focuses on the capacity and operation of roadway segments, the
most influential controlling factors of the roadway system are found at intersections.
Intersections are generally the most critical and constrained locations within the local street
network and the ultimate arbiters of capacity. Detailed analysis and recommendations regarding
intersection improvements are generally outside the realm of General Plan analysis. Major
arterial intersections should be evaluated and prioritized for detailed analysis and future
development planning and enhancement to assure that these system components facilitate the
safe and efficient movement of traffic.

ISSUES OF SPECIAL CONCERN
There are several areas of special concern above and beyond those of increased traffic and future
capacity needs, including the adequacy of planned roadway improvements in adjoining
jurisdictions, the need for additional rights-of-way for future improvements, the adequacy of
facilities for pedestrians and bicycles, and other issues. Each of these areas is briefly discussed
below. Special Study Zones are assigned along several roadway segments to address the need for
additional capacity augmentation features in the future.
Areas of Potential System Failure
The General Plan is the result of an extensive effort to provide a balance of land uses and public
services that enhance the City’s residential and employment opportunities, and commercial and
institutional services, while also assuring a high quality of life for City residents. Despite these
efforts, physical and political circumstances beyond the City’s control still result in a few areas
where the future transportation system may prove inadequate to meet projected demand. These
areas, where levels-of-service are generally projected to reach LOS E or LOS F, are briefly
discussed below.
Segments Projected to Operate at LOS E at Buildout: As described in Table III-7, above, thirteen
roadway segments in the planning area are projected to operate at LOS E upon General Plan
buildout, including the following:
    • Da Vall Drive, south of Interstate-10 (V/C ratio = 0.84)
    • Da Vall Drive, south of Gerald Ford Drive (V/C ratio = 0.82)
    • Valley Center Boulevard, west of Date Palm Drive (V/C ratio = 0.85)
    • Vista Chino, west of Date Palm Drive (V/C ratio = 0.93)
    • Ramon Road, west of Date Palm Drive (V/C ratio = 0.85)
    • Dinah Shore Drive, west of Cathedral Canyon Drive (V/C ratio = 0.91)
    • Dinah Shore Drive, west of Date Palm Drive (V/C ratio = 0.82)
    • Dinah Shore Drive, west of Da Vall Drive (V/C ratio = 0.84)
    • East Palm Canyon Drive, west of Perez Road (V/C ratio = 0.88)
    • East Palm Canyon Drive, east of Cathedral Canyon Drive (V/C ratio = 0.94)
    • East Palm Canyon Drive, west of Date Palm Drive (V/C ratio = 0.96)
Although the delays associated with LOS E exceed desirable levels for design purposes, these
roadways will still operate within their physical capacity. The amount of delay experienced by a
motorist is primarily determined by turning movements at intersections. Typically, roadway
segments, which are projected to operate at LOS E on a daily basis, can be adequately mitigated
by providing additional turning lanes at intersections. The preservation of sufficient right-of-way
along these segments is critical to the future construction of such improvements. Any mitigation
should be based on a detailed analysis of the operation of intersections nearest these roadway
segments.
Segments Projected to Operate at LOS F at Buildout: The following four roadway links are
projected to operate at LOS F at buildout of the General Plan:
    •    Ramon Road, west of Landau Boulevard (V/C ratio = 1.00)
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                                Circulation Element
Amended June 24, 2009                                                                              III-51

                                                                                  City of Cathedral City
                                                                       General Plan/Circulation Element
    •   Date Palm Drive, north of Vista Chino (V/C ratio = 1.35)
    •   East Palm Canyon Drive, east of Date Palm Drive (V/C ratio = 1.09)
Where roadway links are projected to operate at LOS F, the construction of additional through
lanes and/or approach lanes is usually required to adequately reduce delays or provide alternative
parallel routes. The preservation of sufficient right-of-way along these segments and at nearby
intersections is critical to allow physical space for future improvements.
Interstate-10 Interchanges
A significant portion of buildout traffic in the planning area will utilize Interstate-10. The
existing I-10 interchanges providing direct access to the City are located at Date Palm Drive, and
at Palm Drive. Buildout traffic projections are nearly twice the master planned roadway capacity
for Date Palm Drive. To accommodate future traffic volumes in this vicinity, a second freeway
interchange is proposed at the extension of Da Vall Drive. Such an interchange would effectively
reduce future traffic volumes on Date Palm Drive. However, between Vista Chino and Valley
Center Boulevard, Date Palm and Da Vall Drives are still expected to operate at LOS E or F on a
daily basis. Additional capacity enhancements, such as the Landau overpass and the
improvements to the Palm Drive/Gene Autry Drive interchange, will be necessary to assure
acceptable levels-of-service at these gateways to Cathedral City. Therefore, Date Palm and Da
Vall Drives, from Vista Chino to Valley Center Boulevard, are designated “Special Study
Zones.” Such a designation is intended to insure that the roadway segments are designed and
improved to provide additional capacity in the future. Specific design and development
enhancements should be able to improve both the V/C ratio and LOS and help relieve projected
congestion on these roadway segments.
East Palm Canyon Drive
The buildout traffic projections suggest that capacity constraints may occur on East Palm
Canyon Drive, east of Cathedral Canyon Drive to the city limits. However, the 1998 traffic
impact analysis prepared for the Downtown Precise Plan includes a detailed peak hour
evaluation that demonstrates that the intersections would operate at acceptable levels-of-service.
While the assumptions used for the Precise Plan study were not identical to those used for this
General Plan traffic analysis, they were quite similar, and future daily traffic projections were
consistent for both projects. Access along East Palm Canyon Drive at the easterly city limit is
physically constrained by the Whitewater River and Santa Rosa Mountains. Should delays along
East Palm Canyon Drive become excessive in the future, the Mid-Valley Parkway can function
as a parallel bypass by carrying traffic around the Downtown area.
Ramon Road
The General Plan traffic analysis assumes Ramon Road ultimately would be improved to a six-
lane arterial highway. However, the buildout data indicate that, west of Landau Boulevard,
Ramon Road is projected to carry future daily traffic volumes that exceed the capacity of a six-
lane cross section.
Additionally, the existing four-lane bridge over the Whitewater River Stormwater Channel may
not be improved beyond six lanes in the foreseeable future, given the high costs of widening the
bridge. Ramon Road’s status as a Congestion Management Plan (CMP) roadway means that
intersections along Ramon Road must operate at a minimum LOS E, and that future

                                                                         General Plan/Circulation Element
improvements can be funded by Transportation Uniform Mitigation Fees (TUMF). It is critical
that adequate right-of-way at major intersections along Ramon Road be preserved, to the greatest
extent possible, to accommodate future intersection improvements.
Mid-Valley Parkway
Due to right-of-way constraints along the Mid-Valley Parkway and the capacity constraints of its
four-lane bridge across the Whitewater River Stormwater Channel, the General Plan traffic
analysis assumes the parkway will be a four-lane facility throughout Cathedral City. Relatively
moderate projected traffic volumes further suggest that the roadway may not need to be
improved to a six-lane highway, as was originally proposed along certain segments. Compared to
buildout of the previous General Plan, buildout of this General Plan will actually reduce travel
demands along the parkway in Cathedral City by 7,300 vehicles per day, thereby providing
additional capacity along the parkway to accommodate through traffic from Ramon Road and
East Palm Canyon Drive. However, if the parkway remains four lanes, three of the five links
through Cathedral City are projected to operate at LOS E on a daily basis.
Pedestrian Circulation
The General Plan and associated documents support planning which allows and enhances access
to commercial services and places of employment and recreation without the essential use of
motorized vehicles. In this regard, pedestrian and other non-motorized circulation is encouraged
in the City wherever possible. Master planning the provision of sidewalks, bike lanes and off-
street trails is especially important along major roadways in the community. Development that
occurred prior to the City’s incorporation includes areas where sidewalks are non-existent or
discontinuous, limiting their usefulness as safe alternatives to vehicle travel. When considering
future development, pedestrian and bicycle accommodation and safety should be given emphasis
equal to that currently given to automobile access. While off-street trails are addressed in greater
detail in the Parks and Recreation Element of the General Plan, the City should take advantage of
the Coachella Valley Association of Governments’ non-motorized transit planning, and the effort
of trails groups Valley-wide currently under way, to plan for future trails.
Securing Future Right-of-Way
As cited above, development permitted prior to City incorporation did not always result in
secured right-of-way adequate to meet future roadway and/or intersection needs. The City has
generally been able to secure right-of-way from new development that has been needed to
provide full-width mid-block roadway improvements, and additional right-of-way along major
arterials designated as scenic corridors has also been secured.
Given the substantial traffic volumes projected at buildout of the General Plan, there will be an
equally substantial need for expanded intersection improvements throughout the City. This
circumstance will require that additional right-of-way be secured to provide for additional
turning and through lanes. The greatest demand for additional right-of-way will be at future
critical intersections, where dual left turn lanes and dedicated right turn lanes will be needed.
The City should initiate a detailed roadway and intersection analysis, as well as a prioritizing
process to secure additional right-of-way where needed.
Parking and Access Facilities

Issues associated with adequate parking and access have been most prominent along East Palm
Canyon Drive and other locations where older development exists. Many of these parking and
access issues have been addressed with the development and implementation of the Downtown
Precise Plan. Similar planning efforts are addressing these types of issues along Ramon Road.
However, access issues still exist along such major roadways as Cathedral Canyon Drive, where
extensive multi-family development and numerous driveways result in conflicting turning
movements and associated hazards.
These lessons show that it is essential that new development, as well as projects undergoing
redevelopment, be required to provide adequate on-site parking to meet demand and that parking
lot ingress and egress be more thoughtfully controlled. Consolidation of parking lot entrances
should be encouraged to minimize disruptions to traffic flow and facilitate the preservation of
capacity, while still assuring vehicular and pedestrian safety.
Public Transportation
Created in 1977, the SunLine Transit Agency provides public transit service within the City and
the Coachella Valley, carrying about 3 million passengers per year in a service area of more than
360 square miles. The SunLine fleet consists of buses powered by compressed natural gas
(CNG) and equipped with wheelchair lifts and bike racks. Five routes currently (2002) service
the City: Lines 14, 23, 30, 31 and 111.
Line 30 provides service on Date Palm Drive and west on Ramon Road. Line 23 provides service
to several Cathedral City schools and the Cathedral City Boys and Girls Club, as well as portions
of Palm Springs. Line 14 provides indirect service to Cathedral City by connecting Desert Hot
Springs and Palm Springs along Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino.
Line 31 is a Thousand Palms to Cathedral City route, which extends west along Ramon Road,
south along Cathedral Canyon Drive, and east along Dinah Shore Drive. It loops along a portion
of Plumley Road, Landau Boulevard, Date Palm Drive, and back to Ramon Road.
Line 111 provides service along East Palm Canyon Drive and passes through the “downtown”
redevelopment area. SunLine is required to have bus stops that comply with the federal
Americans Disability Act (ADA). The company also provides “Sun Dial” service, which consists
of a fleet of small buses that offer curb-to curb service from home to destination. The service is
wheelchair accessible and must be requested at least 72-hours in advance.
Transportation Demand Management
The urbanization of the Coachella Valley is expected to continue in the decades to come, and
with continued growth, transportation demand and systems management will be necessary to
preserve and increase available roadway capacity. Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
requires the development and implementation of policies, plans and programs that result in the
use of a wider range of transportation alternatives, including public transit and bicycles.
While an emphasis on alternative travel modes, such as carpooling, van pooling and mass transit
will help, TDM can also include employee flex-time work schedules that reduce peak hour travel
and associated traffic congestion. In response to state mandates, the Riverside County
Transportation Commission (RCTC) prepared a regional Congestion Management Program,

which required Cathedral City and other cities to prepare TDM ordinances or risk the loss of
federal transportation funds. The City has adopted a TDM ordinance.
Railroad Facilities
Rail freight service through the Coachella Valley is provided by the Union Pacific Railroad
(UPRR), with freight transfer facilities located in Indio and Coachella. In addition, Amtrak
service is available to Palm Springs and Indio on Union Pacific’s line. These facilities carry
between 30 and 40 trains per day, most of which are freight. Union Pacific is planning to add a
full second track parallel to the existing one by 2003, and is projecting an associated 50%-70%
increase in rail traffic.
The rail lines are designated as Centralized Track Control (CTC) facilities and include extensive
electronic switching and communication facilities. Construction of drill spurs is possible to serve
adjoining passenger or industrial uses and can range from $55,000 to $60,000 (1997). These
costs do not include special engineering requirements associated with potential engineering
constraints.
Palm Springs International Airport
Primary air transportation for Cathedral City and the Coachella Valley is provided by the Palm
Springs International Airport, which is classified in the National Plan of Integrated Airport
Systems (NPIAS) as a long-haul commercial service airport.
This airport is capable of supporting non-stop commercial service to destinations over 1,500
miles away and is classified as a small hub air passenger airport, based upon the percentage of
national airline enplanements it supports. Since 1972, airport services have increased from
143,809 passenger enplanements to 486,644 in 1994. In 1998, the number of enplanements
reached 629,473, and deplanements totaled 628,068. For all of 1998, the number of passengers
arriving and departing the airport totaled 1,256,541.
Major destination cities include San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle and New York. Major carriers
include Alaska, American, Skywest/United Express, and others. Commercial traffic is clearly
seasonal, with the peak season being the January-February-March period and the slowest period
occurring during the summer months. Commercial and passenger operations are expected to
continue to grow. The number of passenger enplanements is projected to reach approximately
809,256 by the year 2015. However, considering the tremendous growth the airport has
experienced in recent years, this projection appears to be very conservative.
Major Utility Corridors
Major corridors and easements for the transport of natural gas, electricity, communications,
domestic water and sewerage, and storm drainage are also important components of the
Circulation Element. Generally, the need for utility corridors is met through the provision of
easements in or adjacent to City streets and along common lot lines.
Major electricity, natural gas and petroleum product transmission corridors have been established
prior to incorporation of the City and are generally located north of Interstate-10. Future land use
planning, including the development of subdivisions and the processing of development
applications, will require coordination among the City, developers, utility companies, and other

service providers to assure the availability and provision of easements and rights-of-way for the
extension of roads, utility lines, and public services (also see Public Utilities Element).
Bicycle Facilities
As discussed above, the City currently (2002) has only a partially integrated system of sidewalks,
bicycle lanes, and multi-use trails within roadway designs and rights-of-way. While the General
Plan does not include an adopted master plan for trails and bikepaths for non-motorized vehicles,
proposed facilities are set forth in the CVAG “Non Motorized Transportation Plan (2001),” and
currently being updated, which may serve as the basis for further master planning of these
facilities in the City. Carefully planned alternative transportation corridors (sidewalks, bike
lanes, and multi-purpose trails) will enhance and give greater opportunity to the use of
alternative modes of transportation and will help the community meet its goal of implementing
the Ahwahnee Principles.
Future bike routes should be planned to provide safe routes for intra-City bicycle traffic and
should be clearly marked and striped. Where possible, they should be designed as one-way bike
routes, which flow in the same direction as adjacent automobile traffic. Combination
sidewalks/bikeways require an eight-foot width. These multi-use trails will also serve as links to
recreational facilities throughout the community.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
As a whole, the General Plan policy document, transportation technical report, Program EIR, and
Community Profile provide direction for the future planning of the City’s roadway and
circulation system. Areas of special concern have been identified and are further addressed in the
General Plan Program EIR and traffic impact report. The above cited “Special Study Zones” and
other areas of future focused analysis should be initiated as soon as is reasonably possible.
In addition to focused studies, the City should also continue to monitor and review land use
trends and changes in traffic volumes and patterns. Periodic adjustments to planning and
program implementation should be made by utilizing roadway improvement and maintenance
management programs, regularly monitoring traffic on major roadways, and conducting ongoing
inventories of current traffic and circulation patterns. Formal traffic monitoring should be
conducted, at a minimum, once every two years.
The City should also pursue on-going coordination with State, regional and local agencies, which
have shared jurisdiction over the state highways in the community. Through the implementation
of this Element and involvement with regional, state and federal regulators, the City will
progressively alleviate current problems and avoid future system inadequacies.

HOUSING ELEMENT
The Housing Element addresses the housing characteristics and needs of the City, including, but
not limited to, a description of existing housing types, condition of existing units, overcrowding,
overpayment, homelessness, and the demand for affordable housing in the area. It also offers
programs and recommendations for addressing housing needs within the City.
California Government Code requires that every City and County prepare a Housing Element as
part of its General Plan. In addition, State law contains specific requirements for the preparation
and content of Housing Elements. According to Article 10.6, Section 65580, the Legislature has
found that:
        (1) The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early attainment
             of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family is a
             priority of the highest order.
        (2) The early attainment of this goal requires the cooperative participation of
             government and the private sector in an effort to expand housing opportunities and
             accommodate the housing needs of Californians of all economic levels.
        (3) The provision of housing affordable to low and moderate income households
             requires the cooperation of all levels of government.
        (4) Local and state governments have a responsibility to use the powers vested in them
             to facilitate the improvement and development of housing to make adequate
             provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community.
        (5) The legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility, each local
             government also has the responsibility to consider economic, environmental, and
             fiscal factors and community goals set forth in the General Plan and to cooperate
             with other local governments, and the state, in addressing regional housing needs.
             Section 65581 of the Government Code states that the intent of the Legislature in
             enacting these requirements is:
             (a) To assure that local governments recognize their responsibilities in contributing to the
                    attainment of the State housing goal.
             (b)    To assure that cities and counties prepare and implement housing elements
                    which, along with federal and State programs, will move toward attainment of
                    the State housing goal.
             (c)    To recognize that each locality is best capable of determining what efforts are
                    required by it to contribute to the attainment of the State housing goal as well
                    as regional housing needs.
             (d)    To ensure that each local government cooperates with other local governments
                    to address regional housing needs.
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                                    Housing Element

Government Code Section 65583 outlines the required content of all housing elements,
including identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs, and a statement of
goals, policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled programs for the preservation,
improvement, and development of housing. Specific requirements include the following:
        (1) An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints
            relevant to the meeting of these needs. The analysis should include population and
            employment trends; documentation of household characteristics; inventory of land
            suitable for residential development; governmental and other constraints to new
            housing development; analysis of any special housing needs and an assessment of
            existing affordable housing developments.
        (2) A program which sets forth a five-year schedule of actions the local government is
            undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the
            objectives of the housing element in order to meet the housing needs of all economic
            segments of the community.
PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT EVALUATION
For purposes of this Housing Element, the term “previous planning period” is defined as the
period from 1998 through 2005.
The previous Housing Element (1998-2005) established policies and programs to encourage a
balanced range of housing, available to all income levels and household compositions, in
quantities sufficient to meet the needs of the area by:
 • adding 865 units to the housing stock at prices that are affordable to very low, low, and moderate-
            income households.
 • encouraging a variety of residential development that promotes the availability of housing to all
            segments of the community, recognizing such factors as: age, income, family size, single-
            person households, and mobility.
The City’s ability to meet the objectives of the policies and programs set forth during the previous
planning period is assessed below.
Policy 1.1               Ensure that the quality of dwelling units in existing neighborhoods is
                         improved, conserved, rehabilitated and maintained.
Program 1.A              Maintain the Community Home Improvement Program (CHIP),

                         Sewer Hook-up Assistance Redevelopment Program (SHARP), allowing
                         grants and loan assistance programs for qualifying very low, low, and
                         moderate income households in order to encourage the rehabilitation of
                         existing housing units.
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                                    Housing Element

Assessment:            The Redevelopment Agency Housing Division, has successfully provided
                       annual budget allocations to fund this program. The effectiveness of this
                       program is apparent since 1,200 households were assisted in part by
                       nearly $1.5 million from CHIP, approximately $600,000 from ADFAP,
                       and nearly $520,000 from SHARP. In addition, the DRHP assisted 37
                       households with a total of approximately $650,000. The CHIP, ADFAP,
                       and SHARP programs will be continued through the 2014 planning cycle.
Program 1.B            All City codes, including the Uniform Building Code, will be enforced in
                       the City so that existing units are maintained in good repair.
Assessment:            The City of Cathedral Community Development Department, and Fire
                       Department ensure that the Uniform Building Code and applicable City
                       building codes are followed. This program is ongoing and will continue
                       through the 2006-2014 planning cycle.
Program 1.C            Develop a rehabilitation and neighborhood revitalization plan for that
                       area north of Dinah Shore Drive, generally west of Date Palm Drive,
                       known as the Whitewater neighborhood, which targets short, medium,
                       and long range plans for the rehabilitation of existing duplexes, and the
                       development of quality single and multi family housing.
Assessment:             Although the Whitewater neighborhood was initially targeted for this
                       program, the City directed funds and efforts to the Dream Homes
                       neighborhood. The Dream Homes Revitalization Program (DHRP) was
                       initiated in 2003 and was funded by the RDA ($1.2 million) and a
                       $500,000 HELP loan from HCD. The program involved participation
                       from homeowners, residents, the RDA, County Economic Development
                       Agency, City Police, City Code Enforcement, School District, and non-
                       profit organizations including Inland Congregations United for Change
                       (ICUC).
                       To date, the City has facilitated a number of improvements through the
                       DHRP. Major renovations to correct substandard housing and code
                       violation where made to 35 lower income single family homes. New
                       streets, and water and sewer lines were provided in the neighborhood,
                       which benefited 520 homes and businesses. Improvements in the
                       neighborhood also created 33 vacant single family lots. In addition, the
                       City approved a 94 unit affordable family housing complex, and a
                       community center with child-care, after-school programs, and a
                       neighborhood police outreach office designed and funded via the DHRP.
                       Finally, the DHRP has been successful in increasing neighborhood
                       involvement in meetings, and has generally improved the reputation and
                       appearance of the Dream Homes neighborhood.
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                              Housing Element
                                                                                                 III-63
                                                                               City of Cathedral City
                                                                       General Plan/Housing Element
                       Similar efforts are underway for other neighborhoods in need, including
                       the originally targeted Whitewater neighborhood. The RDA purchased a
                       cluster of 27 vacant lots for the future development of a 5.85 acre park
                       within the Whitewater neighborhood, and the City constructed nuisance-
                       water drainage and retention facilities. The City is currently (2008)
                       beginning to work toward future construction of new streets and sewers
                       within the Whitewater neighborhood which, upon completion, will serve
                       approximately 600 existing rental units, homes, and vacant single-family
                       lots.
                       Due to the success of the DHRP, the City expanded this program to be a
                       citywide program and $800,000 was added to the budget for fiscal years
                       2007-2008 and 2008-2009. This program will be continued and modified
                       accordingly to represent a citywide effort.
Program 1.D            Identify existing neighborhoods with substandard infrastructure,
                       including partially paved roads, substandard water lines, flooding
                       problems, absence of sewer service and lack of street lighting, quantify
                       the need for improvements and identify funding sources.
Assessment:            Neighborhoods, including the 35th Avenue, Dream Homes, and Cove
                       areas, were identified as having substandard infrastructure. Several
                       bonds were issued for sewer and street improvements within these
                       neighborhoods over the past several years that have resulted in
                       infrastructure installation.
                       Assessment Bonds in the amount of $6 million were issued, and $4.5
                       million in grants were procured for streets and sewer improvements in
                       the Dream Homes neighborhood. Five hundred homes were assisted and
                       the project was completed in 2007.
                       In 2004, $7.5 million in Assessment Bonds and other funds was used for
                       the streets and sewer project in the 35th Avenue neighborhood. This
                       project was completed in 2006 and assisted 400 homes.
                       In 2005, nearly $39 million was procured for the streets and sewer
                       project in the Cove neighborhood, which contains 1500 homes. In 2008,
                       the project in the Cove was half completed and will be ongoing.
Program 1.E            The Code Enforcement Department shall continue its Target Areas
                       program in existing neighborhoods, to maintain and upgrade living
                       conditions in those neighborhoods with serious endemic problems
                       (Downtown, Cove, Whitewater, and Dream Homes).
Assessment:            Code enforcement is a continuing program that is ongoing throughout
                       the City. This is being accomplished through the utilization of the RDA
                       Housing Division and Code Enforcement Department programs, by
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                            Housing Element
                                                                                               III-64
                                                                                City of Cathedral City
                                                                        General Plan/Housing Element
                       providing financial assistance to low-income homeowners. In the 1998-
                       2006 planning period, this included assistance to 40 homes in the Dream
                       Homes, South Panorama, and Whitewater neighborhoods. The City
                       authorized $630,000 to establish graffiti abatement/prevention programs
                       for the 2006-2014 planning cycle and another $600,000 for the
                       implementation of these programs.
Policy 2.1             Ensure that sufficient residentially designated lands and appropriate
                       zoning exist to meet the City’s future housing needs.
Program 2.A            Maintain the inventory of all land suitable for residential development in
                       the Land Use Element.
Assessment:            A number of new affordable units were constructed during the previous
                       planning period, which fulfilled the requirements of the RHNA. This was
                       made possible, in part, to the sufficient lands available for development.
                       The Planning Department has compiled a land inventory for additional
                       potential residential development. This process is ongoing and will
                       require further investigation and inventory in order to establish a
                       representative list of available lands within the City. Please also see the
                       Land Inventory provided in this Housing Element.
Program 2.B            Maintain land use and zoning designations in the General Plan and
                       zoning maps, respectively, that allow for diversity of housing types and
                       densities.
Assessment:            As demonstrated throughout this evaluation, the number of affordable
                       units built in Cathedral City in the last planning period exceeded the
                       RHNA allocation. As such, there were appropriately zoned lands
                       sufficient for construction of these units. The City has also conducted an
                       inventory based on zoning designations of land for the 2006-2014
                       planning period as part of the preparation of the Housing Element
                       update, data collected is presented in Table III-15:Inventory of Available
                       Vacant Land.
Program 2.C            Maintain a Planned Unit Development (PUD) permit ordinance which
                       shall allow flexibility in development standards to encourage housing
                       construction while preserving natural resources.
Assessment:            A PUD permit ordinance has been maintained and does allow flexibility
                       in design standards to encourage innovative housing development. The
                       Canyon Vista project, which provides 81 affordable housing units, was
                       entitled through the PUD process in the previous planning period.
Program 2.D            Specific Plans with residential components, PUDs and Tentative Tract
                       Maps shall provide for affordable housing within the project, or shall
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                             Housing Element
                                                                                                III-65

                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                                         General Plan/Housing Element
                       contribute an in-lieu fee toward the provision of off-site affordable
                       housing. The standards shall be included in the City’s Zoning Ordinance.
Assessment:            This objective has not been fulfilled. An inclusionary ordinance was
                       proposed and submitted to the City Council, but was not adopted.
Program 2.E            Encourage infill development and the remodeling or addition to existing
                       homes wherever possible, to lower the costs of extending infrastructure,
                       through the use of incentives such as Community Home Improvement
                       Program grants.
Assessment:            The RDA has been working to encourage development of infill lots within
                       the City. The City assembled ten (10) oddly-shaped parcels in the Dream
                       Homes neighborhood, which are being reconfigured to support as many
                       as 33 affordable units. In addition, 25 single family lots have been
                       assembled throughout the City and are being investigated to determine
                       the best use for infill development. This program will continue to
                       encourage infill development where feasible.
Program 2.F            Ensure that in-fill development occurs in areas with adequate
                       infrastructure, including streets and water and sewer lines, to support
                       build-out of the neighborhood.
Assessment:            As part of the approval process for infill development, the Planning
                       Department reviews the project site for available infrastructure and
                       determines if the existing infrastructure is adequate to serve the proposed
                       infill development. Generally, however, with the addition of sanitary
                       sewers to several existing neighborhoods, as described above, all
                       services are available within the core of the City.
Program 2.G            Develop innovative housing solutions for very low and low income
                       households and the elderly.
Assessment:            The Planning Division and Redevelopment Agency staff have worked
                       together to meet this objective. Programs were initiated in the previous
                       planning cycle which generated 830 new low and very low income units,
                       or 480 more units than identified in those income categories under RHNA
                       (please see Table III-1, RHNA Needs 1998-2005 and Total Units Built,
                       below). The Redevelopment Agency’s requirement to meet the State
                       inclusionary and replacement housing mandates helped to establish
                       effective programs and assure development of affordable housing for
                       seniors.
Policy 3.1             Provide a sufficient variety of housing types to meet the housing needs of
                       all residents, regardless of race, religion, sex, marital status, ancestry,
                       sexual orientation, national origin or color.
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                              Housing Element
                                                                                                 III-66

                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                                         General Plan/Housing Element
Program 3.A            Projects which restrict 25% or more of their units to very low or low
                       income households for 30 years shall qualify for a density bonus of 25%,
                       pursuant to State law, over the underlying zoning designation.
Assessment:            In accordance with State law, which holds that a minimum term of 30 to
                       55 years shall be granted to projects that restrict 25% or more of their
                       units shall qualify for a density bonus, the City will continue to offer this
                       incentive.
Program 3.B            Maintain the City’s database of affordable housing projects and units, and
                       the Housing Replacement Plan, and develop action plans should these
                       units be converted or destroyed.
Assessment:            The City has successfully established a database of affordable housing
                       projects that is maintained by the Office of Housing Assistance. The list is
                       updated annually as new affordable housing projects are approved. A
                       plan of action, in the event that affordable housing projects are converted
                       or destroyed, has been established. All destroyed affordable units are
                       required to be replaced on a bedroom to bedroom basis by the RDA.
                       There is no action plan for rent-restricted units and none were lost
                       during the previous planning cycle.
                       This program is ongoing. The City will study an action plan to save or
                       replace the 72 affordability-restricted units located in the Ocotillo Place
                       apartments, which are at risk of conversion (please see At Risk Unit
                       Analysis, below).
Program 3.C            Work with private organizations -- including the Coachella Valley
                       Housing Coalition, Shelter From the Storm, the Senior Center, Desert
                       AIDS Project, Foundation for the Retarded or Braille Institute -- in
                       assisting whenever possible in the housing of handicapped residents or
                       those with special housing needs in the City.
Assessment:            The City requires that all affordable housing projects provide access for
                       handicapped persons. In the previous planning cycle, 28 HOPWA units
                       and 8 disability units were successfully developed through the Coachella
                       Valley Housing Coalition Special Needs Apartments in Casa San Miguel.
Program 3.D            The City shall enact an Ordinance which enables the City Council to
                       waive or subsidize application and building permit fees for very low, low
                       or special needs projects.
Assessment:            Although the City has not approved an ordinance that enables the City
                       Council to waive building permit fees for very low, low, or special needs
                       projects, the Redevelopment Agency has subsidized a number of permit
                       fees for such projects using gap financing. The need for the ordinance
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                              Housing Element
                                                                                                 III-67

                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                                         General Plan/Housing Element
                       appears to have waned since the RDA has the ability to fund fees. This
                       program will not be carried forward to the 2006-2014 planning period.
Program 3.E            Continue to enforce the provisions of the Federal Fair Housing Act. All
                       complaints regarding discrimination in housing will be referred to the
                       Riverside County Office of Fair Housing. Information on the Fair
                       Housing Act, as well as methods of responding to complaints shall be
                       made available at City Hall and at the Library.
Assessment:            In the previous planning cycle, all complaints regarding discrimination
                       in housing where referred to the Riverside County Office of Fair
                       Housing. In addition, methods of filing a complaint where made available
                       at City Hall and the Library. This program was successful and will
                       continue to be utilized.
Program 3.F            Maintain provisions for the development of homeless shelters and
                       transitional housing as a conditional use in the Zoning Ordinance.
Assessment:            Provisions for the development of homeless shelters and transitional
                       housing require a conditional use permit as specified in the Zoning
                       Ordinance. Although this program was successfully established in the
                       previous planning cycle, new laws (Senate Bill 2) require that homeless
                       shelters and transitional housing be subject to similar regulation as
                       residential zones and should not require conditional use permits. This is
                       further discussed in this document.
Program 3.G            Work with the Coachella Valley Association of Governments toward a
                       regional solution for homelessness.
Assessment:            The Coachella Valley Association of Governments (CVAG) has
                       established a Homelessness Committee that is charged with establishing
                       a Strategic Plan for combating homelessness in the Coachella Valley.
                       The plan proposes the development of regional homeless shelters,
                       transitional housing, and service center. It will require the cooperation
                       and assistance of Cathedral City. The City has reviewed the plan and is
                       working with CVAG to initiate the service center. Plans for the
                       conversion of an existing structure in North Palm Springs have been
                       reviewed by the City, and the center, to include 225 beds, is scheduled to
                       open in 2009.
Policy 4.1             In order to leverage local investment, promote and facilitate the use of
                       State and federal monies for the development and rehabilitation of
                       affordable housing in the community.
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                              Housing Element
                                                                                                 III-68
                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                                         General Plan/Housing Element
Program 4.A            The City shall encourage and assist a self-help housing fund by non-profit
                       organizations for single family, infill development through the
                       Redevelopment Agency.
Assessment:            The City, in conjunction with Habitat for Humanity, CVHC, and Building
                       Horizons self-help programs, was able to construct 6 homes during the
                       previous planning cycle.
Program 4.B            The City shall continue to process requests for information on zoning,
                       financial assistance programs, or required supporting documentation for
                       State and federal grant or loan applications within 30 days of receipt.
                       When conditional use permits or development review is required prior to
                       application submittal, the City shall fast-track such applications to ensure
                       that submittals are not delayed, assuming a timely submittal by the
                       developer.
Assessment:            Although the City has been unable to fast-track applications for State and
                       federal grants and loans, it is the intent of the City to initiate a similar
                       program in the near future for RDA-subsidized housing projects that
                       need to meet application deadlines for federal, state, county, or local
                       funding assistance. In addition, the City’s standard processing schedule
                       is generally equal to or faster than most other cities in the Coachella
                       Valley.
Program 4.C            Continue to distribute the City’s information for developers and low
                       income households which detail the programs available to both parties for
                       assistance in the development and rehabilitation of low income housing.
Assessment:            The City has distributed and made available to both developers and low
                       income households information regarding programs which offer financial
                       assistance for the development and/or rehabilitation of low income
                       housing. The RDA Housing Division provides personal assistance to
                       developers who seek information related to programs for financial
                       assistance, and they distribute information to low-income households via
                       neighborhood meetings, media outlets, churches, senior centers, and by
                       word of mouth. This program was effective and will continue into the next
                       planning cycle.
Program 4.D            Should the City be notified of intent to sell any at-risk affordable housing
                       developments, all possible funding sources, including CDBG and RDA
                       housing set-aside funds will be considered to facilitate purchase of such a
                       project. All non-profit organizations which have expressed an interest in
                       purchasing such projects, including the Riverside County Economic
                       Development Agency Housing Authority and other non-profit groups will
                       be notified immediately of any such properties for sale.
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                              Housing Element
                                                                                                 III-69

                                                                                City of Cathedral City
                                                                        General Plan/Housing Element
Assessment:            In the previous planning cycle, there was one owner occupied affordable
                       housing unit (32804 Monte Vista) that was purchased by the RDA on
                       December 31, 2002. No other units lost affordability covenants or were
                       subjected to foreclosure.
                       This program will continue to be utilized in the 2006-2014 planning
                       period, and in the event that an affordable housing project is posted for
                       sale, the City will continue to consider purchasing the project and notify
                       interested non-profit organizations.
Program 4.E            Identify and maintain a database of infill lots throughout the community
                       which would be appropriate for the development of affordable housing,
                       including self-help ownership housing. Promote these parcels in the
                       development community, through brochures, potential streamlined
                       processing incentives, and other means.
Assessment:            The Community Development Department and the Office of Housing
                       Assistance were unable to implement this program during the previous
                       planning period. However, the City does maintain an unofficial listing of
                       vacant sites with multi-family potential and intends to establish an
                       inventory, including maps of infill opportunities for the 2006-2014
                       planning period.
Policy 5.1             Promote and preserve mobile home parks for their value as low and
                       moderate income housing opportunities.
Program 5.A            Any conversion of existing mobile home parks to permanent housing will
                       continue to be regulated by ordinance to ensure that an appropriate
                       relocation plan for park residents is developed and implemented.
Assessment:            The City has established a relocation plan for mobile home park
                       residents in the event that a mobile home park is converted to permanent
                       housing. Although no mobile home parks were converted to permanent
                       housing in the previous planning period, Desert Hills Mobile Home Park
                       was closed utilizing the Relocation Plan and Housing Replacement Plan,
                       which was adopted and implemented by the RDA.
Program 5.B            Maintain a mobile home rent control ordinance which protects all mobile
                       home residents who do not have long-term lease agreements.
Assessment:            The Office of Housing Assistance has maintained rent control for eligible
                       units. The City estimates that approximately 700 mobile home units are
                       eligible for rent control.
Policy 6.1             Continue to redevelop the Downtown with a mix of higher density
                       housing.
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                             Housing Element
                                                                                                III-70
                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                                        General Plan/Housing Element
Program 6.A            The Redevelopment Agency will continue to pursue prototype higher
                       density housing in the Downtown area, to further the concepts of mixed
                       use, urban core presented in the Downtown Precise Plan.
Assessment:            Although the downtown Precise Plan is no longer being treated as a
                       Specific Plan, but rather as design guidelines, the Redevelopment Agency
                       is continuing to monitor high density housing downtown, including Tierra
                       del Sol and Cathedral Towne Villas, which now provide 136 new units of
                       very low and moderate housing in the Downtown area.
Policy 7.1             The City shall encourage crime-free housing programs for all projects
                       constructed in the City.
Program 7.A            All projects shall be reviewed by the Police and Fire Departments to
                       ensure that adequate security and ‘defensible space’ is provided.
Assessment:            As part of the approval process, all projects are reviewed by the Planning
                       Division, and the Police and Fire Departments to ensure that adequate
                       security and defensible space are established within the project design.
                       This program has been successful, and will continue to be implemented.
Program 7.B            The Redevelopment Agency shall consider establishing a policy for
                       Crime-Free Housing, and on-site management of any project for which
                       the Agency provides funds or assists in any way.
Assessment:            RDA policy requires that a RDA assisted project operate under the
                       principles of Crime-Free Housing. This involves lower tolerances for
                       criminal or anti-social behavior and more comprehensive criminal
                       background checks. New projects are now required to pay a Community
                       Facilities District (CFD) fee which will help fund the Crime-Free
                       Housing program.
Policy 8.1             Ensure that new and rehabilitated housing is efficient in its use of energy
                       and natural resources.
Program 8.A            Ensure that new development and rehabilitation efforts, whenever
                       possible, maximize energy efficiency through architectural and landscape
                       design and the use of renewable resources and conservation. Set aside
                       funds shall be considered for projects which provide high levels of energy
                       conservation for affordable housing.
Assessment:            This program is being implemented by DHRP and CHIP programs, and
                       in affordable multi-family projects. All new affordable multi-family
                       housing projects are required to use green construction principles.
                       Designs must meet or exceed building code energy efficiency standards,
                       and are required to incorporate water-efficient landscaping and provide
                       recycling receptacles into their trash collection facilities. In addition, the
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                              Housing Element
                                                                                                 III-71

                                                                                  City of Cathedral City
                                                                          General Plan/Housing Element
                       RDA and the Building Department, in conjunction with Hacker
                       Engineering, have developed a “Diaphragm Re-roofing System,” which
                       establishes a standard pre-approved and pre-designed energy efficient
                       roof remodel procedure for qualified homes, including homes built
                       during the 1960’s that lack insulation or an attic.
Policy 9               Encourage the development of appropriate unit sizes in affordable multi-
                       family rental projects and granny flats on single family lots in order to
                       alleviate overcrowding.
Program 9.A            Encourage multi-family rental and owner-occupied projects which
                       include three and four bedroom units as a portion of the overall
                       development. Larger units shall be encouraged through direct RDA
                       participation or through bond financing for affordable housing through
                       the County Housing Authority or other appropriate means.
Assessment:            The Planning Division and Redevelopment Agency have encouraged
                       appropriately sized rental units, from studios to large family units.
                       Creekside, Dream Homes, and Cathedral Family projects offer family-
                       sized units, while Tierra del Sol and Cathedral Towne Villas offer one-
                       bedroom and studio units.
Policy 10.1            Facilitate the development and preservation of senior housing through
                       incentives and assistance programs.
Program 10.A           Maintain the Senior Home Repair Program to encourage maintenance and
                       rehabilitation of existing housing units for the elderly.
Assessment:            Local assistance is provided to seniors through CHIP and DHRP
                       programs that offer home repair assistance, and by working with the
                       County to utilize county programs for seniors. Administration of the SHR
                       assistance program has been transferred from the City to the County
                       Office on Aging.
Program 10.B           In older neighborhoods where low and very low income seniors are a
                       significant portion of the residents, consider the assignment of bond
                       proceeds for the improvement of streets, water and flood control
                       improvements to bring these facilities into compliance with current
                       standards.
Assessment:            To meet the objectives of the program, three (3) bond issues were
                       accomplished, which offer extra financial assistance to lower-income

                       with SunLine Transit regarding the provision of service to the project.
Assessment:            The Redevelopment Agency has, and will continue to coordinate with the
                       SunLine Transit to ensure that high density affordable housing is located
                       in close proximity to a public transit route. In addition, the Park David
                       project, located at the northeast corner of Vista Chino and Landau,

DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
Housing needs for Cathedral City are based on a comprehensive assessment of current and
projected housing needs for all segments of the community and all economic groups. Rising
costs and increasing competition for available physical and financial resources make it difficult
for some families, especially lower income and special needs families, to find affordable
housing. This section of the Housing Element presents the demographic background necessary
for the comprehensive analysis of the City’s housing needs.

Overcrowding
The recession of the early to mid 1990’s caused a number of families and households to
consolidate in order to pool their resources. In 1990, the average household size for the City was
2.75 persons per occupied housing unit. Since 1990, the number of persons per household has
risen nearly every year. The 2000 census estimates indicate that the average household size in
Cathedral City is 3.03 persons.
The 2000 Census estimated the number of households with overcrowding by persons per room.
Overcrowding is defined by the Census Bureau as more than 1.01 persons per room. In Cathedral
City in 2000, there were 1,322 owner occupied households that were considered to be
overcrowded. For renter occupied units, there were 1,228 households that were overcrowded in
the same time period. These data are shown below:

HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
Housing Prices
The median cost of a newly constructed single family home in Cathedral City was $420,000 in
2007. The median price for existing homes for resale in 2007 was generally between $350,000
and $400,000. 1 Although Cathedral City has been considered affordable to a large segment of the
lower and moderate income populations in the past, recent trends indicate that this is no longer
the case. See Table III-13 below.

Housing in Cathedral City compared to the rest of the County is moderately priced, as illustrated
by the housing costs for both single family owner occupied units and rental units. In 2006, the
median annual household income for Cathedral City was approximately $50,650. Using the
allowable monthly payment for housing of 30% of gross household income, the median income
family can afford a monthly housing payment of $1,270. The median mortgage (Principal,
Interest, Taxes, and Insurance [PITI]) 2 estimated at $1,853 per month, makes ownership for
median income families unaffordable. Table III-13 demonstrates that the City’s housing is
affordable to renters, but is unaffordable to median income homeowners.

Inventory of Lands for Housing
There is a substantial amount of vacant land within the City available for affordable residential
development. Table III-15 illustrates lands available in the multiple family land use designations,
as well as City-owned single family lots proposed for self-help housing. This includes the Resort
Residential zone, has been calculated at a density of 7 units per acre, consistent with historical
development patterns and zoning regulations; the R-2 zone, which allows 10 units per acre; the
R-3 zone, which allows 20 units per acre; and the Downtown Residential Neighborhood and
Mixed Use Commercial zones, which both allow an average of 27 units per acre.
The following listing demonstrates the typical densities at which projects in the City have been
approved.
Crossley/Ramon Road Project: Zoned R-2, this project consists of 29.68, entitled for 294 units,
or a density of 10 units per acre.
34260 Corregidor Project: This 4.5 acre property is zoned R-2, and is approved for 13 units per
acre, and a total of 60 units.

density of 22 units per acre.
Melrose Drive Project: This 0.39 acre site, although small, was approved for 5 units, or a density
of 13 units per acre.
A Street/Buddy Rogers Project: This DRN zoned, 2.48 acre parcel was approved for 75 units, or
a density of 30 units per acre.
Mary Pickford Project: This MXC site, which consists of 1.31 acres, was approved for 61 units,
at a density of 47 units per acre.
In addition, the City has traditionally developed affordable housing projects in the R-2, DRN and
MXC zone. Table III-14 below illustrates the existing affordable housing projects. As shown in
the Table, the assumptions for density used in Table III-15 are conservative, and likely to
represent an under-counting of the densities at which the available sites will build out.

Finally, assumptions for density in the DRN and MXC zone are feasible because the zones allow
both residential and commercial uses, with no requirement for ground floor commercial
development; require a minimum building height of 20 feet, and a maximum building height of
55 feet, allowing 5 story development; have no setback requirements; and have reduced parking
requirements. Therefore, even when accounting for surface parking and open space
requirements, a density of well over 30 units can be achieved in either zone.
Developers of affordable housing in the City and Coachella Valley, including Palm Desert
Development and the Coachella Valley Housing Coalition, have stated that densities for their
projects are calculated at 14 to 18 units per acre, in order to provide the quality of projects which
they strive for. Two projects for which the Redevelopment Agency is currently planning, the
Dream Homes project (Assessor’s Parcel #677-410-009 in Table III-15) and the Cathedral
Family project (Assessor’s Parcel #673-140-010 to -013 & 017 in Table III-15), are planned for
13 units per acre in the R-2 zone. The Dream Homes project will cost $335,165 per unit, and the

                                                                         General Plan/Housing Element
Cathedral Family project will cost $253,570 per unit. Both projects, as described below, are
funded through a variety of programs, and have been demonstrated to be feasible. The
development of affordable units at a density of less than 15 units per acre is therefore feasible in
Cathedral City.
As stated below, land cost in Cathedral City ranges from $50,000 to $70,000 per acre. At a
density of 10 units per acre, this equates to $5,000 to $7,000 per unit. The affordable housing
community estimates that construction costs for affordable housing units are approximately
$250,000 to $325,000. When added to land cost, this represents a total cost per unit of $255,000
to $337,000 per unit. Projects in this cost range can be funded, when including HOME funds, tax
credit funds or other programs, and built in the range of 14 to 16 units per acre. Most
importantly, the affordable housing community has indicated that projects above this range are
not marketable, insofar as more dense projects cannot be built and include the amenities and
common areas which make a project a liveable community for the families who are looking for
rental units. The Coachella Valley Housing Coalition and Palm Desert Development, which
attended the City’s workshops, clearly stated that they will not plan projects at densities over 16
units per acre, since the higher densities do not allow them to create communities which they can
lease, because they cannot provide the services and amenities which create a healthy living
environment.
Small lots included in the inventory in the Downtown area are adjacent to each other, and could
benefit from lot consolidation. A program has been added to encourage lot consolidation.

Finally, as shown in Table III-15, there is current capacity for 1,912 units. The City has a RHNA
allocation of 1,324 units for low, very low and extremely low income units. The City has
constructed 75 of these units already in the planning period (see “Restricted Housing Projects,”
below). Therefore, the City has a remaining need of 1,249 units, an inventory of 1,283 possible
units in Agency owned lands, DRN, MXC, R-3 and R-2 zoned lands shown in Table III-15, and
a conservative capacity for 1,912 units, or capacity for more units than it has allocated. In order
to assure that sufficient lands are available for the planning period, a program has been added
which requires the re-zoning to R-3 of either Assessor’s Parcel 677-050-017, which consists of
14.69 acres and could generate 294 units; or Assessor’s Parcel 677-050-018, which consists of
18.12 acres, and could generate 362 units (Program 1.A.7).
City Owned Duplex Lots
The Redevelopment Agency owns five parcels zoned for duplex development, which it plans to
sell for the development of income-restricted duplexes. These parcels are: AP Nos. 675-271-
036, 675-271-037, 675-271-040, 675-271-041, and 675-271-042.
City Owned Single Family Lots
The Redevelopment Agency also owns individual lots in the R-1 zone, which it plans to develop
as infill affordable housing. These parcels include oversized lots which are currently being
subdivided, as noted below, and will yield a total of 52 affordable housing units. The parcels are:
AP Nos. 670-197-005, 670-242-005, 675-302-015, 675-362-012, 677-291-007 (currently being
subdivided into 5 lots), 677-291-018 (currently being subdivided into 5 lots), 677-373-008
(currently being subdivided into 6 lots), 677-381-006, 677-382-005 (currently being subdivided

Single Family Residential Potential
In addition to the lands listed in Table III-15, there are an additional 800.62 acres of R-1 zoned
vacant lands in the City which can accommodate single family residential development for the
Above Moderate land use category during the planning period. At the maximum allowable
density for the R-1 zone, this could yield approximately 4,804 units.
North City Specific Plan
Cathedral City recently (2007) annexed over 1,300 acres into the City’s limits north of Interstate
10. A specific plan, known as the North City Specific Plan, was adopted in 2009. The specific
plan includes not only the lands recently annexed, but lands which have been in the City’s
corporate limits, and totals 5,000 acres. The Plan estimates the maximum residential buildout
potential to be approximately 16,000 dwelling units.
As proposed, the North City Specific Plan will provide for a wide range of residential
opportunities, such as a diversity of residential densities, including but not limited to residential

estates (RE) at 2 units to the acre and Mixed Use - Urban (MU-U), which allows up to 45 units
to the acre.
It should be noted that development is currently constrained by the limited availability of
infrastructure in this area. The City is working to extend and expand the availability and capacity
of service systems to facilitate development of this important new area. It can be expected that
the North City Specific Plan area will begin to develop in this planning period, but that its
greatest development activity will occur toward the end of this time frame. As demonstrated in
Table III-15, above, however, the City has adequate development sites available for affordable
housing in the existing core of the City, and the North City area will not be required to meet its
housing needs.

Age of Housing Stock
The age of housing is an important characteristic of the housing stock, indicating the relative
condition of housing units. Most homes have a useful life of approximately twenty to thirty
years. After that time, the need for maintenance and rehabilitation becomes critical if the
dwelling unit is to remain safe and sanitary.
According to the 2000 Census and the City’s 2007 inventory of housing units built, 85% of the
City’s housing was built after 1970, while 15% of the houses were built prior to 1970, as
demonstrated in the Table below.

Generally, the oldest homes, built before 1940, were built in the Downtown area. Homes built
between 1940 and 1949 occur in the Cove. Homes built from 1950 to 1959 occur in the
Downtown, Cove and Outpost neighborhoods; and homes built from 1960 to 1969 occur in the
Dream Homes, Outpost, and Cove neighborhoods. From 1970 to the present, the distribution of
construction has been more widespread throughout the City, and represents both the construction
of in-fill lots in existing subdivisions, as well as new tracts constructed north of Ramon Road.
Demolished Units
Although many of the City’s older units have been well maintained and comply with current
standards, some fell into disrepair, were uninhabitable, and have been demolished. In the
previous planning cycle (1998-2005), the City demolished a total of 162 dwelling units. In
Cathedral City, the Redevelopment Agency is responsible for replacing any units “bedroom for
bedroom” that are removed through redevelopment activities. Of the 162 units that were

removed, the RDA was responsible for demolishing 127 units that had a total of 193 bedrooms,
all of which were subsequently replaced during the 1998-2006 planning period. The City will
continue to replace affordable units removed, as described in the Housing Replacement Plan and
Redevelopment Agency Implementation Plan.
The City’s Code Compliance Division cited 52 residences in 2008 for property abatement
violations, indicating that this number of units can be assumed to have required rehabilitation in
that year. The Redevelopment Agency has assisted 40 homeowners in the rehabilitation of units
during the previous planning period.
Types of Housing Stock
Since the 2000 Census, 3,765 housing units have been built in the City, as demonstrated in Table
III-17, below. Although 79% of these units have been single family dwellings, the City has also
produced 616 apartment units, and 178 multi family units during this time period.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS
Self-Help Housing
The Coachella Valley Housing Coalition, Building Horizons, private developers, and Habitat for
Humanity have completed 60 new single-family homes for very low and low income buyers in
the City of Cathedral City. The “down-payment’ is earned through “sweat equity,” which is
defined as the recipients’ participation in the construction of the home. Loans that are below the
market interest rates are available for such buyers.
Mobile Home Parks
The Census Bureau estimates that 2,521 mobile homes were located in Cathedral City in 2000.
The Department of Finance further estimates that in 2007, there were 2,849 mobile homes, RV’s,
or trailers in the City. According to the 2008 operating permits for Mobile Home Parks, there are
2,147 mobile home spaces and 223 resort vehicle spaces, for a total of 2,370 mobile home and
RV spaces. Traditionally, mobile home parks have provided an affordable housing opportunity,
particularly for senior citizens. In Cathedral City, 770 spaces within the existing mobile home
parks are under the potential purview of the City’s rent control ordinance.
The City allows mobile homes and manufactures housing in parks or subdivisions, and also on
residential lots in the R-1 and R-2 zones, subject to Building Code requirements.
City Programs
The City’s Redevelopment Agency provides grants and loans for major rehabilitation and new
construction to low income families, and has established the following programs to assist eligible
residents.
Community Home Improvement Program (CHIP)
CHIP is available for qualified low income homeowners. For 2008, the program can grant up to
$10,000 per home for repair or improvements including the installation of handicapped ramps or
fixtures, repair or replacement of roof, windows, doors, HVAC systems, and other qualified
improvements. Assistance is repaid with 3% simple interest if the home is sold prior to
expiration of the 45-year affordability covenant.
Dream Homes Revitalization Program (DHRP)
Although this program was initiated for the Dream Homes neighborhood and named
accordingly, the DHRP offers grants of up to $45 or $60,000 for major home repair and
renovation of owner-occupied homes throughout the City. This program is available to low and
moderate income homeowners Citywide. If the home is sold or vacated prior to expiration of the
45 year affordability covenant, the assistance is repaid plus a share of the increased equity.
Sewer Hook-Up Assistance Redevelopment Program (SHARP)
This program is available to pay up to $3,000 of the hook-up fees for low or moderate income
households whose septic system fails. The City’s current maximum is $4,210 in the Cove
neighborhood. The program can also pay up to 100% of the cost of labor and materials for
abandoning the septic and connecting to sewer. Repayment at the time of a future sale is without
interest.

Assessment District Financial Assistance Program (ADFAP)
Low-income homeowners can be reimbursed up to 100% of the sewer and street improvement
assessment portion of their annual tax bill, to be repaid without interest when the home is sold or
transferred.
County Programs
As a participating city, Cathedral City’s RDA Office of Housing Assistance cooperates with
numerous County programs to provide rental assistance and to encourage the construction of
new affordable housing. The programs discussed below are available to qualified Cathedral City
residents.
Section 8 Housing Assistance
Housing assistance is offered to low-income families who wish to live in privately owned multi-
family developments that have been rehabilitated or upgraded. Once eligibility is confirmed, the
family is given a choice of available sites from which to choose. They are expected to pay
between 30% and 40% of their income.
The Riverside County Housing Authority provides HUD Section 8 rental assistance to lower
income renters within the City. In 2008, the Authority subsidized 368 units in the City, although
the total number of vouchers and certificates fluctuates regularly.
EDA Senior Home Repair Program
Lower income homeowners or mobile homeowners of 62 years of age or older can qualify for
grants of up to $6,000 to improve or repair their property. Funds can be used for minor repairs
and/or one time major repairs. To be eligible for this program, recipients must own their own
home and meet the requirement of the low-income category.
Fair Housing Programs
The City has an agreement with the County of Riverside to provide anti-discrimination, landlord-
tenant mediation, fair housing training and technical assistance, enforcement of housing rights,
administrative hearings, home buyer workshops, lead-based paint programs, and other housing
related services for Cathedral City residents. Services are designed to implement fair housing
policies and procedures and to provide information concerning fair housing rights and minority
rights under existing fair housing laws, which include providing housing opportunities for all
persons regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, disability,
ancestry, marital status, or any other arbitrary factors.
Home Rehabilitation Program
The County program allows loans of up to $20,000 for home improvements for qualifying lower
income home owners.

First Time Homebuyer Program
This program offers qualified first time home buyers financial assistance for a downpayment and
closing costs on a newly purchased home. Assistance is provided to lower income persons. The
amount of assistance offered depends on the buyer’s qualifications and the price of the home.
Generally, assistance for a downpayment is less than 20% of the cost of the home, and assistance
for closing costs is up to 6% of the purchase price, or $10,000. Currently (March 2008), the
County does not have funds to support this program, but additional fund have been made
available from federal NSP funded programs and from Mortgage Credit Certificates in 2009.
RIVERSIDE COUNTY INCOME LIMITS
The 2007 median income calculated for Riverside County for a family of four is $59,200. This is
used to calculate moderate (120% of median) low (80% of median), very low (50% of median),
and extremely low (30% of median) incomes for use in State and federally subsidized housing
programs. The 2007 income limits were used for consistency since the majority of available data
provided in this document was for 2007 or earlier. The median household income is updated
annually by the State, and current data is used by the City and private parties in calculating
income requirements for prospective owners or tenants.

FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS- RHNA
Each incorporated city is required to analyze existing and projected housing needs and develop
an implementation program to describe how the City will attain its housing goals. In addition, the
projected housing need must include a locality’s fair share of regional housing needs. The
regional housing determination must be made by the appropriate council of governments, but
may be revised by the local government if the revision can be supported by available data and
accepted planning methodologies. In 2007, the Southern California Association of Governments
approved the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) for the 2006 through 2014 planning
period. The City of Cathedral City’s allocation under RHNA is depicted below.

Quantified Objectives
As mentioned above, a number of housing units in the City are of older construction, and require
either rehabilitation or conservation in order to be maintained as viable dwelling units. As such,
the City has implemented programs to provide funding and assistance in the rehabilitation of
housing units. Areas of particular concern continue to include the areas on the edge of the
Downtown, the Whitewater neighborhood, the neighborhood north of Dinah Shore Drive, and
west of Date Palm Drive and the Dream Homes neighborhood.

The City’s rehabilitation and conservation objectives will be funded through the implementation
of Redevelopment Agency funding programs, as discussed below.
Redevelopment Agency Funding
The Redevelopment Agency has estimated that housing set-aside funds will total approximately
$5 million annually for the foreseeable future. The Agency has allocated $10.5 million through
fiscal year 2009 for two new construction projects, which are expected to generate approximately
160 units. In addition, the Agency has allocated $500,000 annually to acquire affordability
covenants or rehabilitated owner occupied homes with the DHRP through fiscal year 2009. The
City Council also allocated $800,000 for the Neighborhood Revitalization Program separate
from the Implementation Plan for the period from 2007 through 2009. Finally, the RDA
Implementation Plan provides that Housing Funds can be allocated to the purchase of affordable
convents on existing properties or affordable units at risk of expiration.
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                                    Housing Element
                                                                                                        III-95

                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                                         General Plan/Housing Element
Affordable Units at Risk
Tables III-20 and III-21 identify affordable housing units within the City. The tables indicate that
280 rental units in the Mountain View Apartment complex could be released from their restricted
status before 2015. In 1994 financing for this project was changed from the FmHA loan (515) to
a USDA Rural Development Loan which allows for affordability controls through 2034.
However, after 2014 the loan could be pre-paid, which could remove the affordability control.
Should the project elect to pre-pay its loan, a number of organizations, including the Coachella
Valley Housing Coalition, the City’s Redevelopment Agency, the Riverside County Housing
Authority, or several private sector developers who currently operate affordable housing projects
in the City, would be contacted and encouraged to participate in the project’s preservation as
affordable housing. Based on the City’s most recently obtained pro-formas for affordable
housing projects, construction costs for replacement of these units would be between $240,000
and $325,000 per unit. Purchasing existing affordable units in the area currently is approximately
$100,000 to $130,000 per unit. Therefore, the preservation of these units is important to the
City’s affordable housing inventory.

POTENTIAL CONSTRAINTS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING
Governmental Constraints
This section of the Housing Element examines the potential governmental constraints imposed
by the City in the form of zoning, fees, and other restrictions, and determines whether these are
constraints to the provision of housing.
Development Standards
The City’s Zoning Ordinance regulates a wide range of development standards, including
building height, lot size, and setbacks. The requirements of the City’s Zoning Ordinance
are listed in the Table below.
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                             Housing Element

*Parking represents total parking requirement. The City has no requirement for additional guest parking.
**Density in the DRN and MXC zones is based on parcel size. For lots of 10,000 to 20,999 square feet, a density of
20 units is permitted; for lots of 21,000 to 41,999 square feet, a density of 27 units is allowed; and for lots of more
than 42,000 square feet, a density of 36 units is allowed.
The standards described above are consistent with, or more liberal than many other Coachella
Valley cities, and do not pose a constraint to the development of housing.
Fees and Processing Times
The City’s Planning and Building Division fee schedules have been established as
enterprise funds, to recapture the City’s cost of processing the applications. The time spent
on each application is tracked, and deposits returned to the developer if the time is not
spent on the application. As such, fees imposed by the City are reasonable and do not
represent a significant impact on the cost of construction. Fees for plan check and building
permits are based upon the valuation of the structure, as is consistent in most communities
in California. Development impact fees are listed in Table III-24, and represent a total cost
of about $4.50 per square foot excluding school and utility fees.

A typical multi-family unit will be charged about $3,000 in City-specific impact fees, not
including TUMF, Multi-Species or similar regionally applicable fees. The City’s impact fees are
considerably less than surrounding jurisdictions’, and do not represent a constraint to
development.
The City requires design review for all multi-family projects, which can be processed
concurrently with any other permit which might be required. In the Mixed Use Commercial
Zone, multiple family residential projects require a conditional use permit, which is processed
concurrent with the design review process. Design Review is a simple analysis which assures
that the project’s design meets the requirements of the zone in which it occurs. If public notice is
required, advertising and mailings are made 10 days prior to a public hearing. The findings
needed for approval of either a design review or a conditional use permit pertain to the project’s
consistency with the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance; public health and safety; and the site’s
physical ability to accommodate the project. The average processing time for a typical
application is 3 to 4 months, which is generally less than many Valley cities, and does not
represent a constraint. Individual single family homes do not require design review approval, and
are checked by the Planning Division as part of the usual building plan checking process.

The site plan is circulated to the Fire Department, Police Department, Engineering Department
and others for comment on the technical requirements of the proposal. The Police Department
reviews all multi-family projects in accordance with Crime-Free Housing principles. The
provision of adequate security assures a livable community by employing neighborhood watch,
clear sight distances and similar techniques to assure a safe environment. The requirements do
not represent a constraint on the construction of affordable housing, as they do not have a
financial impact on projects.
Code Enforcement
The City’s Code Enforcement efforts are operated through its Fire Department. A land owner is
generally warned three times of a violation, prior to the initiation of a citation and associated
court action.
The Department makes every effort to give as much time as possible to a violator to correct the
problem. Depending on the severity of the offense, a warning will be accompanied with a
deadline of 10 to 30 days for rectification.
The City’s Code Enforcement Division also actively participates in assisting low income
households in improving their properties through the CHIP and DHRP programs and the
Redevelopment Agency.
Non-Governmental Constraints
This section addresses the potential constraints not generated by governmental entities, including
land costs, construction costs, financing costs, speculation, availability of infrastructure, and
physical constraints.
Construction Costs
Construction costs have increased in recent years, due to the growth pressures experienced
throughout California. In the period from 2006 through 2008, these costs have receded, as
building activity has slowed, and competitive bidding has forced a retrenching of cost estimates.
The City has traditionally been somewhat lower in the cost of new home construction when
compared to other Valley cities. In recent years, homes have cost between $150 and $250 per
square foot to construct, depending on amenities and finishes.
Building costs do not appear to be unduly increased through local building codes. However, state
regulations with respect to energy conservation, though perhaps cost effective in the long run,
may add to initial construction costs.
Building codes regulate new construction and substantial rehabilitation. They are designed to
ensure that adequate standards are met to protect against fire, collapse, unsanitary conditions, and
safety hazards. The City has adopted the Uniform Building Code, which is typical of all local
jurisdictions in California.
Land Costs
Land costs include the costs of raw land, site improvements, and all costs associated with
obtaining government approvals. Fully-developed, ready-to-build single family lots are currently

                                                                                                 III-101

                                                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                                                                      General Plan/Housing Element
available at prices ranging from $50,000 to $70,000, depending on the size and location. The
median cost of a newly-constructed home in Cathedral City in 2007 was $420,000. 4 The median
price for existing homes for resale, are generally between $250,000 and $400,000.
It should be noted that foreclosures (2008) and bank repossessions of houses from defaulted
loans have made available lower priced houses. Foreclosures are further discussed below.
Financing Costs
Financing costs impact both the purchase price of the unit and the home buyer’s ability to
purchase. Interest rates fluctuate in response to national factors. In October 2007, interest rates
were relatively low (6.43% to 6.71%), but they can change significantly and have a substantial
impact on the affordability of housing. Financing for both construction and long term mortgages
is generally available subject to normal underwriting standards. In 2008 the economic conditions
have resulted in lending restrictions, making it difficult for some people to obtain the necessary
credit in order to qualify for loans. Financing costs in Cathedral City are equivalent to those in
other communities throughout California.
Foreclosures
There are a number of mortgage deficient areas in the City. It is estimated that 1,100 homes are
in the foreclosure process in Cathedral City currently (2008). The 2007 mortgage crisis has
caused significant foreclosures throughout the Valley. This condition has the potential to affect
neighborhoods, as foreclosed properties are not generally maintained, and can affect surrounding
property values. Conversely, they can present an opportunity for stable households, insofar as
foreclosures are often priced below market rates, and can represent an affordable alternative for a
moderate income household.
Infrastructure
The City’s development patterns have resulted in the construction of major arterials and
infrastructure throughout the City. As previously mentioned, the exception is the newly annexed
North City area that will require extension and expansion of infrastructure to facilitate
development.
The City requires, as do all communities in California, that a developer be responsible for all on-
site improvements, and meet the standards established in the City’s Zoning Ordinance. Off-site
improvements, should they be required, are also the responsibility of the developer. If a public
street is required, the developer will be responsible for a half width improvement, including curb,
gutter and sidewalk, as is typical in most communities. Since most of the city’s major streets
have been improved to their ultimate right-of-way, development of residential projects will
generally only require the improvement of local or collector streets.
Pursuant to SB 1087, the Desert Water Agency and the Coachella Valley Water District shall be
provided the adopted Housing Element, and will be required to establish specific procedures to
grant priority service to affordable projects. As most water and sewer services are installed in
most neighborhoods in the City, including newly installed sanitary sewer systems in the Cove,
35th Avenue, and Dream Homes neighborhoods, the City’s water and sewer providers will not be

constrained in providing services in most areas of the City. Portions of the developed Whitewater
neighborhood are the only area of the developed City not currently served by the sewer system,
but do operate on septic tanks. Both Desert Water Agency and the Coachella Valley Water
District have approved Urban Water Management Plans, which were developed based on the
City’s General Plan build out, which state that both water providers have sufficient supplies
available to meet the City’s build out demands.
Physical Constraints
Most of the area south of I-10 poses few physical constraints to development. The land is flat,
urbanized, and the soils are suitable for urban uses. Areas north of the freeway are subject to
physical constraints such as steep slopes, lack of infrastructure and flooding. High wind
conditions in the northern portion of the City make it difficult to maintain wood fences and the
cost of block walls increases the cost of housing. Environmental constraints and physical
constraints to development are further addressed in the Environmental Resources and the
Environmental Hazards Element of the General Plan.

Energy Conservation
Title 24 of the California Building Code requires energy efficiency in all new construction of
housing though design features, insulation, and active solar devices. The City applies the
requirements of Title 24 to new housing developments, as is typical of most communities in
California. The City also encourages the implementation of energy conservation measures
through design, including shade structures for eastern and western exposures, and the provision
for shade trees and reduction in asphalt areas to protect against solar heating during summer
months.
The City has taken proactive measures to reduce energy consumption and is currently training a
staff member to become LEED certified. The City is also working on green building programs
for affordable housing projects, although no established protocols have yet been developed. The
Redevelopment Agency requires that all affordable housing proposals requesting assistance
include green construction techniques and materials in their development plans.
The City will continue to balance the cost associated with green building with the long term
savings to the residents, to assure that green construction is employed wherever possible.
Pressures in the marketplace from renters and buyers will also control the market for this type of
residential product in the future.
Water Conservation
Cathedral City is served by two water agencies: the Coachella Valley Water District (CVWD)
and Desert Water Agency (DWA). Both offer incentives for the conservation of water.
Landscaping in the desert environment, especially turf, can demand a large quantity of water.
In order to regulate unnecessary water consumption, the City and the water agencies have
established water-efficient guidelines, incentives, and landscaping ordinances. Reducing water
use on landscaping can be accomplished through the use of xeriscape landscaping, which utilizes
drought resistant plant species, and features that require no water. Reduced water consumption
can also be accomplished through the use of water efficient appliances, faucets, and irrigation
systems. Although certain water-efficient appliances and technologies may result in slightly
higher initial costs, they are not expected to represent a significant constraint to affordable
housing. In fact, many water-efficient appliances and watering techniques may actually reduce
monthly bills since less water is used.
SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
This Section addresses those households or segments of the population that may have
identifiable special housing needs because of occupation, income, health, or physical challenges.
Farm Workers
According to ESRI 2006 data, less than 0.2% of workers in the City of Cathedral City are
employed in the category of agriculture, forestry and fisheries. This is consistent with the 2000
Census figure of 57 Cathedral City residents or 0.3 percent of the population whose occupation is
categorized as Farming, Fishing, and Forestry.
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                            Housing Element

                                                                                City of Cathedral City
                                                                        General Plan/Housing Element
Although the farm worker population in Cathedral City is minimal, landscape personnel,
gardeners, golf course maintenance, and tourist industry service workers represent a segment of
the population that may require special housing needs.
Farm worker households generally fall into low and very low income categories. However, as
with all special needs, the City provides the opportunity for farm worker households to obtain
rental subsidies, and also provides incentives for developers to maintain affordable units which
are available to all segments of the community.
Homeless Persons
The number of homeless persons is difficult to quantify since they are mobile and transient, often
crossing from one city or county into another. The mild winter climate in the Coachella Valley
may attract the homeless in those months. Hot summer temperatures encourage the homeless to
seek daytime shelter in air conditioned places such as libraries, malls, and other buildings open
to the public.
Primary reasons for homelessness in the Coachella Valley include sudden job loss, illness and
lack of medical insurance, family break-ups such as divorce, and seasonal job layoffs or
reduction in hours.
According to the 2007 County of Riverside Homeless Count, approximately 99 homeless
persons may be present in the City of Cathedral City.
There are a number of programs and opportunities directed at providing housing and services for
homeless persons. These assistance programs offer a range of social services from counseling,
assistance with utilities, emergency food, rent and mortgage assistance for the first month, and
the distribution of bus passes. Catholic Charities, a non-profit organization, is the primary
provider of services to the homeless in the Coachella Valley. Jewish Family Services provides
assistance to homeless families by helping them find housing and employment opportunities.
The Coachella Valley Services and Overnight Shelter (SOS) provides food and housing to 16
homeless persons per night.
Catholic Charities work with homeless shelters and affordable residential units in the
Coachella Valley to place low-income homeless or transient persons in permanent
affordable housing units. Catholic Charities and the Housing Authority of the County of
Riverside operate Nightingale Manor, a 14-unit emergency shelter for homeless families.
The shelter is located in Palm Springs, but serves families from the entire Coachella Valley
region. In addition, Shelter from the Storm, a women’s shelter, provides temporary
housing throughout the Valley for abused women and their children including a facility in
Cathedral City.
Episcopal Community Services (ECS) offers programs and housing for homeless persons in
the Coachella Valley. In 1999 the RDA transferred a two 3-bedroom units to ECS for use
through the Navajo Trails programs. Navajo Trails serves 31 homeless adults diagnosed
with HIV/AIDS. The program offers long-term transitional housing for up to 2 years, and
provides residents with access to supportive services including counseling. In 2008, the
program will change to provide longer term housing and services through the Desert Vista

Program.
Other groups of homeless individuals, which may not be served by the above mentioned
facilities include the mentally ill, those with chemical dependencies, and those who voluntarily
choose a transient lifestyle. These individuals may be served by the Coachella Valley Rescue
Mission in Indio, or by the Emergency Cold Weather Shelter, located at the National Guard
Armory in Indio. However, these facilities provide only emergency shelter and do not deal with
the causes of homelessness.
The Desert AIDS Project (DAP) and 38 units within the City’s Casa San Miguel serve disabled
persons and persons who are at risk of homelessness.
SB 2 Requirements and CVAG Solution to Homelessness
Senate Bill 2, Chapter 633 acknowledges homelessness as a statewide problem with damaging
social and economic consequences. The Bill requires jurisdictions to plan for services to address
the special needs and circumstances of homeless persons. Homelessness affects people of both
genders and all races and ages, with some of the main causes being mental illness, substance
abuse, prison release, and lack of affordable housing.
In accordance with SB 2, and as a result of Riverside County’s 10 Year Plan to End
Homelessness, the Coachella Valley Association of Governments (CVAG) has proposed the
development of a Multi Service Center. The Homelessness Committee of CVAG and the city of
Cathedral City are working in partnership to address homelessness in Cathedral City.
Under the broader recommendations developed as part of the County of Riverside’s 10 Year Plan
to End Homelessness, the Homelessness Committee has prepared a Strategic Plan to End
Homelessness. The Plan was initiated in July 2007 and is scheduled to conclude in July 2010.
The Plan focuses on the development of a Multi Service Centre (MSC) at McClain Road in north
Palm Springs. The facility is intended to meet the needs of homeless people in the western
portion of the Coachella Valley. The objective of the MSC is to provide comprehensive support
services to promote progress towards permanent housing and self-sufficiency. The MSC will be
designed to provide one-stop access to resources for individuals and families experiencing
homelessness or at-risk of becoming homeless. In addition to providing 125 beds, a wide array of
supportive services will also be available, including basic amenities such as showering/personal
care and laundry, transportation, childcare, medical care, mental health services, integrated case
management, and social services. The shelter is not structured to assign beds to each
participating jurisdiction.
The City’s Zoning Ordinance allows transitional and supportive housing, including homeless
shelters, in the R-3 and RH zones, subject to a conditional use permit. In compliance with SB2, a
program has been included in this Element requiring that the City allow transitional and
supportive housing and homeless shelters in the Light Industrial zone, as a permitted use
requiring only design review. Site plan review is a technical review of site plan and building
conformance with the Zoning Ordinance, and does not involve a discretionary permit. This
program also requires that the City add a definition of Single Room Occupancy facilities to its
Zoning Ordinance, and allow them, with approval of a conditional use permit, as are multi-

                                                                          General Plan/Housing Element
family units, in the Mixed Use Commercial zone. There are 513 acres of Industrial vacant land in
the City, which could accommodate shelters or transitional and supportive housing.
Elderly Persons
The 2000 Census showed 12.2% of Cathedral City’s population as being 65 or older,
representing a total of 5,203 persons. According to Cathedral City and data collected by ESRI,
12.1%, or approximately 6,394 persons were 65 or older in 2006. These figures are slightly
greater than the County’s 2006 data which shows that 11.2% of the population is 65 years of age
of greater. The slightly higher proportion of elderly residents in Cathedral City is likely to
continue, with the Coachella Valley’s reputation as a retirement area and the City’s relatively
lower housing costs.
Affordability can be an issue of special concern to the elderly, who are often on fixed retirement
incomes. In addition, the elderly may require assistance with housekeeping, maintenance, and
repairs. Special design features that may be needed include elimination of barriers such as steps
and the provision of appropriate recreational, social, and transportation services and amenities.
As the elderly become less independent and require more care, a continuum of housing options
becomes important, ranging from independent unassisted living, to congregate or board care
facilities which provide meals, maid service, and social opportunities, to nursing care facilities
which provide complete medical care.
The 2000 Census indicates that 4,013 households in Cathedral City receive Social Security. The
mean income for these households was $11,869, well below the very low income category.
Census data also show 2,085 households received retirement income. The mean income of these
households was $18,224.
As discussed above, the City has a number of projects and programs available for the senior
population. A total of 1,028 units of rental housing are currently restricted to low and very low
income senior households. All but one of the City's mobile home parks are restricted to ages 55
or older. Also available to seniors and disabled persons are free smoke alarms and fire
inspections provided courtesy of the Fire Department and the Office of Housing Assistance.
Disabled Persons
According to the 2000 Census, approximately 9,339 people or 23.8% of Cathedral City’s
population have some sort of disability. Census 2000 defines persons as disable when certain
physical (sensory), mental, or emotional conditions last more than 6 months making it difficult to
carry out certain activities.
The City has affordable housing units that are specifically designed for disabled persons. These
are located at the Casa San Miguel complex, Tierra Del Sol, and Mountain View Apartments,
which accept both senior and disabled residents. Casa San Miguel offers 27 units of HOPWA,
and Tierra Del Sol includes 7 units that are designed for sight, hearing, or mobility impaired
persons. In addition, all 75 units at the Tierra Del Sol complex are designed to be adaptable for
all types of physical disabilities. The Desert AIDs Project and Working Wonders also provide
counseling and assistance to persons with AIDs.
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                              Housing Element
                                                                                                 III-107

                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                                         General Plan/Housing Element
The City adheres to State guidelines regarding handicapped access, and promotes the use of
principals of architectural design which aid the disabled. The Americans with Disabilities Act
requires all new multi-family construction to include a percentage of units be accessible to
disabled persons. The City of Cathedral City monitors and requires compliance with these
standards as part of the building permit review, issuance, and inspection process.
The City imposes no special requirements or prohibitions on the development of housing for
disabled persons, beyond the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. There is no
concentration restriction for residential care homes. State and federal law does not permit the
City to regulate group homes of 6 or fewer residents. Group homes of 7 or more residents are
permitted, with approval of a conditional use permit in the R-2, R-3, RM and R-H zones.
Single Parent Families and Female Headed Households
Single parent families and female headed households generally have lower incomes, high rates of
poverty, and overcrowded living conditions. Typically this special needs group has low home
ownership rates and spends a large portion of its income on housing. The head of household is
generally younger than the median age for head of household, except for seniors on Social
Security.
The 2000 Census indicated there were 1,641 families with children under 18 years of age in
Cathedral City that are female headed households. Of these, 333 or 20.3% are below the poverty
level.
Primary housing needs for these single-parent households include affordability and units of
appropriate size for the age and gender mix of children. Proximity to schools and other services
and amenities is also important for this special needs group.
Large Families
The 2000 Census indicated there were 1,694 owner occupied and 1,145 renter occupied
households in Cathedral City with five or more members, accounting for a total of 2,839
households, or nearly 42% of all households. Some of these households result from to the
consolidation of multiple families, which have shared housing to reduce housing costs. If
consolidated families could obtain affordable housing, fewer large family units would be needed.
Large families have a special need for three, four, or more bedroom units. Units of this size,
affordable to low and moderate income households, are limited. Based on the 2000 Census figure
that nearly 42% of Cathedral City households are large families, additional affordable residences
that offer 3 or more bedrooms should be proposed and constructed during the 2006-2014
planning period.
The workshops held in preparation for this Housing Element update indicate that the need for
larger units has been reduced in the Coachella Valley as a whole in recent years. Organizations
such as the Coachella Valley Housing Coalition, which actively constructs affordable housing
projects throughout the Valley, have found that units of 4 bedrooms are less in demand than they
have been in the past. They attribute this change, in part, to the “americanization” of Latino and
Asian households, which had in the past tended toward multi-generational housing opportunities.
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                             Housing Element
                                                                                                III-108

                                                                                  City of Cathedral City
                                                                          General Plan/Housing Element
As these families’ cultural basis changes, the need for a larger unit in which two or three
generations resides appears to be diminishing.
Public Participation
As part of the preparation of this Housing Element, the City conducted City Council study
sessions, public workshops, and Planning Commission and City Council hearings to review the
goals, policies and programs included in this element.
The public participation program included two community workshops prior to the initiation of
the update, to receive input into the issues affecting housing in the City. The workshops were
fully advertised, and special flyers were distributed to stakeholders in the City and the Valley as
a whole. Over forty interested persons and organizations were contacted as part of the outreach
program. Input from the workshops was used to develop policies and programs, and direct the
City in its planning for housing in the 2006 through 2014 planning period.
Adopted November 18, 2009                                                              Housing Element

PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
PURPOSE
Abundant parkland and recreational facilities in the City and its vicinity are key elements to the
quality of life enjoyed by the residents. Parklands and related spaces not only provide
recreational opportunities for residents and visitors, but also help to develop and enhance the
City's character and image. Parks and recreational areas are people-centered places that work to
invigorate the physical, mental and spiritual health of the community's residents. They create
focal points for neighborhoods and communities to gather, creating a sense of place and
significance within the City. The purpose of this Element is to recognize the importance of parks
and recreational areas, and to guide their expansion and improvement throughout the City. This
Element also includes a section on bikeways and trails, an essential component of the park and
recreation system within the City, and an additional amenity for its residents. The development
of a cohesive system of bikeways and trails can enhance the quality of life and add to
recreational opportunities. The goals, policies and programs set forth in this element help to plan
for and provide sufficient parkland and recreational space that reflects and is responsive to the
needs of the City.
BACKGROUND
The Parks and Recreation Element is directly related to the Land Use and Open Space and
Conservation Elements in the designation and preservation of recreational open space areas. It is
also related to the Community Image and Urban Design Element in its integration of pedestrian
access and recreational areas. Parks and recreational facilities also play an important role in
attracting new residents and tourists, a key to economic growth, and provide a direct link to the
Economic Development Element. It is also related to the Noise and Circulation Element in its
use of natural buffers, trails and open space to enhance the natural resources of the community.
Government Code Section 65560 requires that the General Plan include discussion of areas
particularly suited for parks and recreational purposes, including areas with links between major
recreation and open space reservations, trails, and scenic highways. Section 65561 states that the
preservation of park land is necessary not only for the maintenance of the economy of the state,
but also for the assurance of the continued availability of land for the enjoyment of scenic beauty
and recreation. Government Code Sections 66477 and 66479 enable local governments to require
park site dedications, or fees in lieu of dedication, as conditions of subdivision and parcel map
approval, if the recreational facilities are consistent with the General Plan. Trail designations are
also required as part of Section 5076 of the Public Resources Code.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                         Parks and Recreation Element

PARKS
Parks are public spaces that serve a variety of functions in a community. While parklands are
generally provided for recreational opportunities, they can transcend simple recreational uses.
They provide a pleasing contrast to an urban environment, by breaking up the monotony of high-
density office, commercial and residential areas. They offer a place for social and cultural
activities, enriching and promoting the community's sense of place. Parks provide for the
physical and mental development of the City's youth, through the organization of team sports and
competitions. Parks are also utilized to display public art and special landscaping designs, which
help to improve the community's physical attributes.
Park design should incorporate such elements as diverse activities and uses, access and linkage,
comfort and image, and sociability. A park with a wide range of amenities and activities can
attract a broader range of people and make a more dynamic and interesting setting. While
recreational amenities are a key component, it is important to also provide for other uses,
including, but not limited to cultural and social activities. A park should also be easy to see and
easy to get to. If a park is easily accessible and linked to main areas within a community, then it
will be used more frequently. Comfort and image is another element that a park's design should
consider. The details within the park should welcome people and include design amenities that
offer shade, a comfortable place to sit, and a pleasant and attractive environment. Lastly, a park
should be a sociable place where people can go to observe the passing scene, meet friends and
have fun with a wide range of people. Above all, parks should function as people places that
bring residents together.
Service Providers
Parks and recreation services within the City of Cathedral City are provided by the Cathedral
City Parks and Recreation Division. The Division provides guidance in the operations of the
City's park facilities and recreational programs. The Division operates a variety of recreational
programs, including after school camp programs, off track programs and special events. In
addition, the Division provides active recreation programs, including karate, dance, physical
fitness and crafts instruction through contract instructors.
While schools are not recreation providers, they can help to provide park facilities for public use
in a community. Joint-use facilities enable the public to utilize a school’s existing space and
equipment for passive and active recreation. Palm Springs Unified School District currently
(2001) provides for one joint-use park facility within the City (this facility is further discussed
below). School facilities are a good resource to use in helping to meet the recreational demands
of the community, and joint use agreements should be pursued in more school locations
throughout the City.
Park Classifications
Mini Parks, Pocket Parks and Plazas
Mini parks, pocket parks, and plazas are less than three acres in size, and are typically used for
limited, isolated or unique purposes. Facilities vary depending on the location and function of the
park, but generally they are not designed for structured or organized play. In addition to the

traditional residential setting, mini parks, pocket parks and plazas may be situated in office,
business or commercial centers, and utilized as a space for rest, relaxation and socializing. This
use of space can also contribute significantly to community design by adding aesthetic appeal
with public art and landscape design, and by providing greenbelts in urban areas.
Mini parks or pocket parks can often be located in high-density residential development, taking
the form of grassy areas or children's play lots. Because of their small size and specialized or
limited activity areas, mini parks, pocket parks and plazas do not count towards meeting the
active recreational needs of a community. However, they make good use of a small space, and
offer various benefits to the community. Mini parks, pocket parks and plazas contribute to a
well-rounded community park system, and should be encouraged as opportunities arise.
Neighborhood Parks
Neighborhood parks remain the basic unit of the park
system. They are devoted primarily to a small portion of
the City, serving the recreational and social needs of a
neighborhood. Neighborhood parks are designed for
active and passive recreation, and are generally located
within walking and bicycle distance of residences. Park
facilities are usually oriented toward the recreational
needs of children, but may also include volleyball
courts, half-size basketball courts and picnic and play
areas that serve all age groups. Restrooms or off-street
parking are usually provided.                                              Century Park
                                              The size of neighborhood parks is dependent on the
                                              available land and its relationship to neighborhood
                                              residences, but is generally five to ten acres, serving
                                              an area within a 1.5 mile radius. Neighborhood parks
                                              are an important feature within a community, and
                                              should be designed to provide for a wide range of
                                              leisure and recreational activities. In particular, they
                                              should serve as a focal point within a neighborhood,
                                              attracting nearby residents and visitors for social
                                              activity, special events and to help develop a sense of
                                              community. It is also important to locate
                                              neighborhood parks on quieter local streets, to
                                              facilitate access and improve safety.
             Panorama Park
Community Parks
Community parks serve all ages, and may include facilities for low-intensity or passive
recreational opportunities, lighted fields, tennis and sports courts, swimming pools and areas or
buildings for community festivals and civic events, as well as for organized indoor sport and
athletic competitions. Generally, restrooms and off-street parking are provided. While
community parks serve larger areas of the City than do neighborhood parks, they often also

fulfill a neighborhood function. Community parks are usually 20 acres or larger, and designed to
serve an area within a 5 mile radius.
School Parks
This classification consists of parks or playgrounds built adjacent to but separate from
educational facilities that may serve either a neighborhood or a larger area. Parks on school
grounds are usually equivalent to neighborhood parks (as described above), but may also include
sports fields for soccer or baseball. Establishing a joint-use agreement with the school district
will help the City meet its demand for parklands.
Regional Parks
Regional parks are usually at least 50 acres in size and serve the entire City or region. While
regional parks can provide for varying intensities of recreational activity, a portion of the park is
generally maintained in a natural setting for passive recreation use or preservation of the
environment. Facilities within regional parks are similar to those in community parks, often on a
larger scale, or including active or organized recreational activities which would not fit in a
community park.
Existing Park Facilities
There are currently five parks within the City and its planning area, all of which are classified as
neighborhood parks. The following Table lists each park, its classification, size and ownership
status, and the amenities it offers.

The Cathedral City Parks and Recreation Division also operates a community center that offers a
variety of recreational and educational opportunities to the City’s residents. The center includes
rooms for classes, a pool table and other games, a fully equipped kitchen, bathroom facilities and
a gated patio area. The Center offers an off track program for children 6-12 years of age,
Monday through Friday. The off track program offers a structured environment for activities
such as arts and crafts, sports, games, field trips and movies. The Center also offers an after-
school camp that features similar activities. The Community Center also holds a variety of
classes for adults, as well as rented space for parties or gatherings. The City is also home to the
Cathedral City Boys and Girls Club, which provides after school and other programs for children
in the community. The Club is located on Whispering Palms Trail. Finally, the opening of the
Town Square and Fountain of Life has resulted in recreational opportunities of many kinds,
including a water play area at the fountain, and a number of special events on the square.
Although private recreational facilities should not be relied upon to meet the City's recreational
needs, they do make up a significant portion of recreational opportunities throughout the Valley.
Big League Dreams Sports Park is located within the City, adjacent to Cathedral City High
School. The sports park complex features facilities for a variety of team sports and activities. It
includes five softball/baseball fields, and facilities for basketball, roller hockey, soccer, flag
football, and volleyball, as well as a restaurant, multi-purpose fields, batting cages, a sporting
goods store and instructional schools. During the week, the park hosts league games for local
athletes of all ages, and on the weekend hosts tournaments with teams from around the world. In
addition, Big League Dreams hosts televised celebrity sports events, corporate gatherings and
picnics, instructional camps and clinics, fantasy camps, 10K runs, car shows, sports memorabilia
shows, concerts and church outings. Other commercial recreational activities in the City include
the Boomers facility, which provides miniature golf, bumper cars and arcade games for children
and adults.
Golf courses also contribute significantly to the recreational opportunities of the Valley. While
the majority of golf courses are associated with resort residential development in the City, they
are used frequently by residents and visitors throughout the Valley. The City is home to the
Cimarron, Cathedral Canyon Country Club, Date Palm Country Club, Outdoor Resorts and
Desert Princess golf courses, which all are accessible to the public. It is also important to note
that golf courses are an integral part of the City's and region's economy.

Parks Planning
A fundamental component to parks planning is to assess the needs of community. A local needs
analysis should take into account the particular demographic characteristics of Cathedral City
residents and visitors, and should be adjusted for any opportunities or limitations that exist or
may occur in the future. The main objective is to identify areas where parks are needed and to
develop definitive standards and policies for meeting the desired conditions. Quimby Act
standards are frequently used to determine the adequacy of parkland provided in a community.
The Quimby Act (Government Code Section 66477), a section within the Subdivision Map Act,
allows local governments to adopt an ordinance to require the dedication of land or payment of
fees for park and recreational purposes. However, before such a condition can be validly attached
to the approval of a map the following criteria must be met:
•       The ordinance must be in effect for a period of thirty days before filing tentative or parcel
        map
•       The ordinance must include definitive standards for determining the proportion of the
        subdivision to be dedicated or the amount of the fee to be paid. The dedication or
        payment shall not exceed a proportionate amount necessary to provide three acres of park
        per 1,000 subdivision residents.
•       The land or fees are to be used only for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating
        existing park or recreational facilities to serve the subdivision.
•       The city must have a general plan or specific plan containing policies and standards for
        park and recreational facilities in accordance with definite principles and standards.
•       The city shall develop a schedule specifying how, when and where it will use the land or
        fees to develop park and recreational facilities.
•       Only the payment of fees may be required for subdivisions containing fifty parcels or
        fewer.
Based on the City’s current population, which the 2000 census estimates at 42,647, and using the
Quimby Act recommendation of three acres per thousand population, the City currently needs a
total of 128 acres of parks, and has 28 acres. At buildout utilizing this recommended standard,
with a total population of 93,345, the City will need 280 acres of parkland.
As a guide for implementation of the Plan's park proposals, specific standards are established for
distribution, size and service radii for neighborhood, community and mini parks (See Table III-
32). The City does not currently (2001) have an established standard, but instead relies on
individual development agreements with developers as projects are proposed in the City.

Land Acquisition and Funding Mechanisms
In addition to the Quimby Act, there is legislation to help cities acquire and preserve areas for
recreational use. Although funding for the acquisition of additional parkland can be difficult for
many cities, there are statewide programs to help facilitate parkland financing. The following
discussion provides a summary of these options.
• Park In Lieu Fees-stem from the Quimby Act. It includes dedication of land for parks, or where
a subdivision is small, a fee in lieu of dedicating land. The limitations to this type of financing
are that infill projects such as condos and apartments are exempt and the fee applies primarily to
parkland and land improvements in new neighborhoods.
• Development Impact Fees-apply only to new development and may only be assessed for new
capital costs related to the new development where a defined beneficiary relationship to cost can
be established. Within these limitations, Park Facility fees may be established for all land uses
under the premise that residents, workers, shoppers and tourists use City Parks.
• Development Agreements- are contracts between the City and a developer that outline in detail
the responsibilities of each party, resulting in a commitment to the developer of vested rights to
subdivide and develop. With development agreements, the developer is assured the right to
develop in exchange for negotiated exactions, which can include parks or park fees.
The above funding mechanisms are private development project-specific and stem directly from
project development. Other funding sources stem from individual proposed public projects, they
include:
• Mello Roos Districts
• Benefit Assessment Districts
• General Obligation Bonds
• Special Tax Revenues & Redevelopment Agency Financing.

TRAILS, BIKEWAYS AND WALKING PATHS
Bikeways, trails and pathways are an important                        Class I Bicycle-Way
recreational and community resource. A                                       Option A
complete network of bikeways and pedestrian
pathways within an urban environment helps to
reduce the reliance on cars, and contribute to a
healthier city. By situating bikeways and
pedestrian pathways in central locations,
communities can create an entire network of
alternative transportation, enabling residents and
visitors to walk or bike to any destination.
Biking and pedestrian access helps to promote a
sense of community by encouraging people to interact and enjoy the amenities within the City.
             Class I Bicycle-Way                    Hiking trails provide access to areas within a
                    Option B                        natural setting, and an escape from the noise and
                                                    stress of the urban environment. Hiking allows
                                                    people to take pleasure in, and gain appreciation
                                                    for, an area's natural resources and open space
                                                    lands. It also provides a rejuvenating and
                                                    energizing experience           that    is     mentally,
                                                    emotionally, physically and spiritually rewarding.
                                                    A local trails system creates a recreational setting
                                                    that offers many benefits to the community.
Bikeways
Bicycle facilities are identified in I, II or III classifications. The Class I bikeway is a bicycle path
that is completely separated from a roadway or highway, and is often in the form of a combined
pedestrian and bicycle pathway.
           Class II Bicycle-Way
                                                      Class II bikeways are signed and striped bicycle
                                                      lanes within the paved section of the street. Class
                                                      II bicycle ways provide a restricted right-of-way,
                                                      with through travel by motorists or pedestrians

Class III bikeways are designated but unmarked
bike routes that are located on the street amidst
vehicular traffic.

Currently, the only bikeways in the City are the portion of a regional Class I route that is located
in the Whitewater River and the Class II bikeway along Palm Drive. A modified Class I bike trail
is scheduled for construction on the south side of Dinah Shore, from the western to the eastern
City limits. A Class II bikeway is scheduled for completion in the fall of 2001 on 30th Avenue,
from the western to the eastern City limits. Several bikeways and multi-use trails are planned for
North City. They include: a Class I bikeway parallel and just north of Interstate-10, from the
western to the eastern City limits; a Class I bikeway parallel to and just east of Palm Drive, from
the planned east-west Class I bikeway just described to Varner Road; a Class II bikeway along
Valley Center Boulevard from the western to the eastern City limits; a Class II bikeway along
Varner Road from the western to the eastern City limits; a Class II bikeway on Date Palm Drive
from Interstate 10 to Varner Road; a Class II bikeway along Landau Boulevard over Interstate 10
to Valley Center Boulevard; and a Class II bikeway along Mountain View Road from Varner
Road to the northern City limits. Development of Class I and II bikeways along major streets
within the City should be a top priority for meeting the recreational needs of the City. Planning
for these facilities will help to create a more livable and healthy community.
Hiking Trails
The Valley is surrounded by a complex regional trail system which occurs primarily in the San
Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains. Trails beginning on the Valley floor connect to mountain
trails which can lead the hiker to Idyllwild, the top of the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, and
beyond. The discussion below includes trails located in and around the City and its planning
area.
The Art Smith Trail is a 16-mile long trail that extends from Palm Canyon's trails to the Palm
Desert’s portion of the Santa Rosa Mountains. This is a strenuous hike with a 1,200-foot
elevation gain. The trail traverses the entire ridgeline of the Santa Rosa Mountains, which
exhibits abundant plant and animal life. The Art Smith Trail accommodates hiking, mountain
biking and equestrian use.
The Murray Hill Trail is located in the eastern portion of Palm Springs, and is accessed behind
the 1905 Elks Lodge on Elks Trail. The trail is a strenuous, 10-mile hike that climbs 2,100 feet to
the top of Murray Hill. This trail also offers links to other hikes around Murray Hill, including
the Clara Burgess and Wildhorse Trails, and access to the Eagle Canyon Oasis. The peak of
Murray Hill offers views of Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Palm Canyon and the San Jacinto
Mountains.
The Araby Trail, also called the "trail to the stars", climbs above the Bob Hope Estate and the
home of the late Steve McQueen. The trail is accessed off of Rimcrest/Southridge Road in Palm
Springs. It is a moderate, 6-mile hike, with an 800-foot elevation gain. The trail also connects
with the Berns/Garstin/Henderson Trails and many other smaller trails found in the foothills. The
Earl Henderson Trail and Shannon Trail Loop are two hiking trails that are located on the
ridges and plateaus surrounding Murray Hill, east of Palm Canyon. The trails offer scenic views
of south Palm Springs and the San Jacinto Mountains. The Earl Henderson Trail is an easy 4
mile hike, with an elevation gain of 400 feet. The Shannon Trail Loop is a moderate hike that is
7 miles long, and gains 1,000 feet in elevation. Both trails can be accessed from Araby Drive in
Palm Springs.

Canyon Trail is a hiking and equestrian 2 mile trail which can be accessed from Garstin,
Shannon or Araby trails, west of Cathedral City.
On the north side of the City, trail opportunities are more limited. The Long Canyon Trail,
however, is accessed from a trailhead north of Long Canyon Road, north of the planning area.
The trail extends into Joshua Tree National Park, and although strenuous, can serve as access to
the facilities and trails within the park. There is a proposed hiking trail adjacent to and parallel
to the Edison right-of-way and a multi-use trail proposed in the setback area along Interstate 10.
Developers in North City are encouraged to design projects that would include trails that would
tie in with the already-planned trails as found in the North City Specific Plan.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Currently, parks are few in number, and developed acreage falls far below the recommended
standard. One of the City's primary goals for the future should be to establish standards, and
identify and develop parklands. Parks and recreational facilities have many important functions
in the community. Creating a more diverse system of parks that enhances existing facilities, and
plans for and designs new parks for the growing population, will assure the City meets the needs
of the community and works to improve the quality of life for its residents.
The City should also focus on creating bikeways and pedestrian pathways along the City's
arterial streets. An extensive biking and pedestrian network will provide a much needed
recreational facility for the City and for the region. The network should be linked to important
locations within the community to decrease the dependence on vehicles and to create a more
livable and healthy City.
GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Goal 1
Establish a diversified, high quality public park system that provides recreation opportunities at a
variety of scales for all residents.
Goal 2
An accessible, safe park system that provides spaces that encourage public gathering and
participation.
Goal 3
A comprehensive bikeway and walking path system which connects homes to work places,
commercial venues and recreational facilities, as well as other cities in the Valley.
Policy 1
The City will utilize the Quimby Act to provide at least three (3.0) acres of community and
neighborhood parkland per 1,000 population.

COMMUNITY IMAGE AND URBAN DESIGN
ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Community Image and Urban Design Element is intended to establish general principles and
mechanisms that help define and guide patterns of development in the City of Cathedral City.
The goals, policies, and programs identified in this element also help to assure that new
development is consistent with the existing built and natural environments. The design of the
community and its physical development should reflect the essential values of the residents. For
Cathedral City residents, these values include the preservation of valuable natural resources and
the desert environment, the preservation of the City’s low density residential character and
creation of high-density mixed-use neighborhoods, where appropriate.
BACKGROUND
The Community Image and Urban Design Element is directly related to the Land Use,
Circulation, and Open Space Elements. Attitudes toward land use, traffic systems, community
safety, and environmental resources shape the physical development of the community and help
define its character. With major local, state, and interstate roadways passing through the City,
and the associated dependence on automobile travel, sustaining Cathedral City’s identity and
quality of life depends on maintaining continuity, uniqueness, and a “sense of place.” Building
and site designs that reflect the natural and historic features of the City and the Coachella Valley
provide continuity of design throughout the valley.
Clearly recognized by California law is the need for and the appropriateness of community
design standards and development criteria within the community. Most relevant is Government
Code Section 65302, which states that “the General Plan shall consist of a statement of
development polices and shall include a diagram of diagrams and text setting forth objectives,
principles, standards and plan proposals,” Government Code section 65302(a) addresses
standards that affect population density and building intensity. Also applicable are Government
Code Sections 66477 and 66470, which set forth local empowerment for preservation of open
space lands.
Other legislation reinforces the adoption of community design standards, including the 1990
California Legislature enactment of Assemble Bill 325, the Water Conservation In Landscaping
Act, which recognizes the state’s responsibility in mitigating the effects of urbanization on its
finite water resources, and the potential savings from water conserving landscape practices. In
accordance with the act, the City has adopted a water conservation-oriented landscape ordinance,
which meets conservation targets and addresses Community Image and Urban Design Element
concerns.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                         Community Image and Urban Design Element
                                                                                                  III-137

                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                        General Plan/Community Image and Urban Design
Design that is sensitive both aesthetically and environmentally is essential to preserving and
enhancing the diverse economic and neighborhood-based character of Cathedral City. The scale
and scope of land use patterns, management of transportation, flood control facilities and
community open space and conservation areas must respond and complement the human and
natural environment to reflect the City’s long-term community character envisioned in the
General Plan.
A variety of architectural styles, materials, and colors can be supported to reflect the
Southwestern flavor of the City. The integration of the natural desert environment, including
rocks, gravel, and native plant materials into the urban fabric will also extend the surrounding
landscape into the built environment. Existing and future development that focuses on quality
design, materials, and craftsmanship will help assure the construction of a built environment of
which the City can be proud.
The creation of a sense of place begins with embracing the unique environment and history of
the region. A new Civic Center and street improvements along the East Palm Canyon Drive
corridor were completed in 1998; an IMAX theater, in 1999, the interactive Fountain of Life in
2000, and The Mary Pickford Theatre and Experience along with an 1,100-space parking
structure were completed in 2001. These are the first of a series of recent Downtown
redevelopment projects in the city. Future Downtown projects will include homes, restaurants,
shops, plazas and other public gathering places, all of which will help establish an identifiable
city center and contribute to a renewed sense of place. Other new developments, including
commercial and other non-residential development, can also provide an important basis for
“placemaking” in the city.
A specific plan adopted in 2009 for the North City establishes the vision, regulations and design
standards to create a vibrant area that will define Cathedral City north of Interstate 10. The Plan
incorporates many of the Ahwahnee Principles described below.
The Ahwahnee Principles
In pursuing the goal of making Cathedral City a livable and vibrant community, the city has
adopted The Ahwahnee Principles, as a guideline. These principles address the need for
communities and regions to have a vision and strategy for economic development and an
enriched sense of community. Visioning, planning and implementation efforts should continually
involve all sectors, including the voluntary civic sector and those traditionally uninvolved in the
public planning process. These principles are as follows:
    1. All planning should be in the form of complete and integrated communities containing
        housing, shops, work places, schools, parks and civic facilities essential to the daily life
        of the residents.
    2. Community size should be designed so that housing, jobs, daily needs and other activities
        are within easy walking distance of each other.
    3. As many activities as possible should be located within easy walking distance of transit
        stops.
    4. A community should contain a diversity of housing types to enable citizens from a wide
        range of economic levels and age groups to live within its boundaries.

                                                                                                III-138

                                                                                   City of Cathedral City
                                                          General Plan/Community Image and Urban Design
    5. Businesses within the community should provide a range of job types for the
        community's residents.
    6. The location and character of the community should be consistent with a larger transit
        network.
    7. The community should have a center focus that combines commercial, civic, cultural and
        recreational uses.
    8. The community should contain an ample supply of specialized open space in the form of
        squares, greens and parks whose frequent use is encouraged through placement and
        design.
    9. Public spaces should be designed to encourage the attention and presence of people at all
        hours of the day and night.
    10. Each community or cluster of communities should have a well-defined edge, such as
        agricultural greenbelts or wildlife corridors, permanently protected from development.
    11. Streets, pedestrian paths and bike paths should contribute to a system of fully-connected,
        interesting routes to all destinations. Their design should encourage pedestrian and
        bicycle use by being small and spatially defined by buildings, trees and lighting; and by
        discouraging high speed traffic.
    12. Wherever possible, the natural terrain, drainage and vegetation of the community should
        be preserved with superior examples contained within parks or greenbelts.
    13. The community design should help conserve resources and minimize waste.
    14. Communities should provide for the efficient use of water through the use of natural
        drainage, drought tolerant landscaping and recycling.
    15. The street orientation, the placement of buildings and the use of shading should
        contribute to the energy efficiency of the community.
The community principles define a community where housing and all the things needed to meet
the daily needs of residents are located within walking distance of one another. They call for
returning to historic population densities around transit stops to provide the critical mass of
people and activities in these areas needed to make transit economically viable. They also call for
housing that provides places to live for a variety of people within a single neighborhood, instead
of separating people by income level, age or family situation.
Natural Systems and a Basic Strategy
Development and population growth result in substantial environmental effects, which can be
best addressed through a thoughtful integration of the natural environmental systems with those
of the built environmental. Developing and projecting a holistic picture of the mature City with a
sensitivity to site-specific design and development provides the basis for innovative uses of old
and new approaches. Flood control channels, for example, are viewed not only as storm drains
but also as opportunities for development of wildlife corridors and as improved open space for
hikers, equestrians and bicycle enthusiasts.

                                                         General Plan/Community Image and Urban Design
The technical and philosophical basis for community design affects the design, development and
build-out of the City.
Cohesiveness
The cohesiveness of Cathedral City is achieved by its connections to the natural and historic
features of the City and the Coachella Valley, and maintained by the recognition and
continuation of characteristics that have been handed down over time. The city’s integration of
the Ahwahnee Principles into its design and development, along with attention to creating a
pleasing balance between the natural and built environments, are the guidelines by which a sense
of community will be enhanced.
Cohesiveness in design can be sustained through an adherence to the essentials of scale and
proportion, site and setting, and materials and color. The integration of the natural desert
environment into the urban fabric enhances cohesiveness in design of the community. Within
these essential principles, a variety of architectural styles can be supported, including adobe,
mission style, and modern derivations of each, as well as modern designs ranging from the
International Style to Southwest Territorial architecture.
The desert provides an inspiring and pliable palette for design. It also presents clear constraints
and opportunities to living in a dry and sunny climate. The use of native and other drought
tolerant landscaping also extends the continuity of the desert into the built environment. The use
of gravels, rocks, and boulders further promotes the continuity of the built and natural
environments.
Character and Identity
Cathedral City’s natural setting, its foothills and desert washes are highly recognizable features
that define the City’s character and identity. A distinctive attribute of Cathedral City is the
remarkable mountain views existing from nearly every location in the city. The character of the
community and its setting can be preserved and enhanced through the integration of thoughtful
grading and revegetation and the use of building and landscape materials indigenous to the area.
With spectacular natural and built environs that attract families, vacationing visitors, and second
home residents from all walks of life, artists, professionals and others that value Cathedral City’s
environment, the City has unique and valuable resources upon which to build.
Encouraging the re-integration of native desert landscaping materials will also preserve and
enhance the City’s uniqueness. A wide variety of native and introduced plants make up the local
landscape palette: ocotillo, barrel cactus, encilia, agave, date palms, California fan palms and a
wide variety of cactus and succulents are essential symbols of the community and provide
endless design opportunities. The emulation of the natural landscape and the protection of open
space further the unique and marketable qualities of the community.
Placemaking
An essential component of the City’s affirmation of a sense of place is its conscious focus on the
unique opportunities that exist in the Downtown. As a newly emerging center for business,
government and culture, the Downtown establishes a course for the City as well as being its core
for activity. Existing and future design shall continue to emphasize quality planning, design,

material and craftsmanship essential to assuring structures and other aspects of the built
environment of which the City can be proud. Moreover, quality design standards in most
thoughtful development need cost no more, and can cost the community much less than poorly
conceived and insensitive design. The near and long-term benefits to the community of well-
envisioned design and quality development are significant.
Building from the Downtown, the City can use the Ahwahnee Principles to define other
neighborhoods in the City, and create self-sufficient, livable communities within the City. The
Community Image and Urban Design Element establishes the policies and programs that can
lead to neighborhood or area planning which reflects the unique character of all the City’s
neighborhoods, whether residential or commercial.
Opportunities for Variation in Neighborhood Character
The beauty and delicacy of the desert and mountains, and those portions of the built environment
that we cherish and hope to preserve, are the primary context within which community design
judgments are made. The sharp contrast between the natural and built environment is a unique
opportunity for community design. The level of assessment and the appropriate perspective will
vary with the land use and location being considered. For instance, residential development
proposed in highly exposed sites and commercial development plans require distinctly different
design review criteria. In every case, new development is required to respect its location and the
scale and character of the surrounding built environment.
Harmony and Disharmony
The character of Cathedral City is reflected both in the high degree of harmony between the built
and natural environment, and in areas where incoherent development still occurs in the city. A
wide range of siting and architectural design opportunities is available and should allow the City
to retain character in new development. Adhering to height limits, the use of natural materials,
and complementary colors and tones for building surface, and the liberal integration of open
space into community design concepts are more in keeping with the central character of
Cathedral City.
Nonetheless, flexibility and sensitive design evaluation, and the ability to see the positive
qualities of various architectural styles are also essential to a receptive design review process. If
quality design is lacking and cannot be secured from the developer or architect, then
unsatisfactory development proposals should not be approved. Sensitive design harmonizes with
surrounding building, avoids excessive disruption and does not overly compete for attention.
Diverse design approaches should avoid being abrasive and seek an elegant and dynamic
integration with the existing and planned built environment. It is equally important to promote an
eclectic collection of styles, and not to homogenize the design elements of a neighborhood,
leaving it a boring repetition of elevations, roof lines and building materials and colors.

architectural resources and the established character of a neighborhood provide a basic frame of
reference for proposed development. Planning and design criteria assist in determining a
project’s compatibility with the surrounding area. These criteria include:
    •   Site Analysis and Development
    •   Planning
    •   Building Height
    •   Building and Structural Setbacks
    •   Proportions and Massing
    •   Pattern and Rhythm of Structures
    •   Roof types and Materials
    •   Surface Color and Texture
    •   Building Projections
    •   Architectural Details
    •   Landscape Architectural Treatment
Site Analysis and Development Planning
Site analysis, in all development, provides one of the most important and frequently under-
exploited opportunities to understand the limitations and possibilities of the site. Interest
regarding development on highly exposed sites with valued scenic resources may conflict with
the scenic, open space, and/or community design goals of the community. An adherence to the
goals set forth by the Ahwahnee Principles will provide focus and intention to the process. Site
analysis and efficient development staging can help limit the amount and cost of grading, can
maximize lot and building orientation, and provide a site and structure that optimizes the
opportunities and minimizes the constraints of the development site.
Building Proportions, Height and Setbacks
New structures should be similar in height to, and compatible with, other buildings in the
vicinity, with the goals of preserving and enhancing design qualities of the built environment and
preserving viewsheds. Setbacks should be compatible with those of surrounding structures and
                                                scenic resources, providing building presence
        Proper Massing of Buildings
                                                without allowing the structure or development to
                                                dominate other buildings, the streetscape or the
                                                natural scenic viewshed.
                                                The proportions of proposed residential,
                                                commercial or industrial structures will also
affect their compatibility with site and surrounding conditions. Establishing a relationship
between existing and planned development may set a standard that is meant to rejuvenate a
neighborhood, giving it greater influence in establishing future design criteria for the
neighborhood. Generally, height and width of             Improper Massing of Buildings
building elevations should not be significantly
out of character with existing neighborhood
development or natural scenic viewsheds.

Pattern and Rhythm in Community Design
Nature makes, and human communities strive to adopt, natural and instinctively pleasing patterns
and rhythms of motifs and massing in community development. How well these elements are
handled can range from harmonious to dissident or clashing relationships. The recurrent
alteration of peaks and slopes of the hills and the mountains can be emulated and complemented
in the design of building roof lines, and in the space and solids of buildings. The development of
pattern and rhythm establishes a theme when viewed in the context of surrounding development.
At close quarters, pedestrians should be provided with a varied integration of structure and
landscaping to soften and tie the structural elements to the natural ones.
Roof Types and Materials
The rhythmic patterns in new buildings and landscape architectural treatments should
complement and integrate with the established structures and surrounding natural environment.
Roof types and materials can play a critical role in either complementing or degrading the natural
scenic viewshed.
Roof types, from flat to multiple arrays of
hipped roofs, provide a range of possibilities
for contrasting or imitative treatment.
Unnecessary building heights are frequently
related to roof design, when the roof should be
balanced with the building elevation it helps to
                                                                       Roof Lines
create. Scale, pattern and rhythm are also
applicable to roof design and materials.
Surface Texture and Color
Prevailing sunny conditions in conjunction with the light color of the surrounding desert make
the selection of surface texture and color especially critical to compatibility issues. Surfaces that
emulate the coarse, warm tones of the surrounding valley and hills are highly desirable, while
slick and shiny finishes produce glaring surfaces that detract from the viewshed and are not
pleasing to the eye. However, the emergence of post-modern and other hybrid architectural
styles, with their juxtaposition of architectural motifs and the use of contrasting, unusual colors
and building materials, are examples of how contrast can be made compatible within broader
standards.
Surface texture differs from patterns and rhythm in that texture is provided on a substantially
reduced scale. It is seldom as strong a design element as architectural pattern or massing.
Although styles change with time, and while the use of strong color may play a dominant part in
the design of structures, color is easier to change once development has occurred. The use of
texture ranges from smooth adobe-type stucco or plaster to fluted, split-face concrete aggregate
block. As with other elements of design, texture must be used carefully so as to complement the
overall design while being compatible with surrounding materials.
Building Projections and Architectural Details

Much of a building’s design is expressed in the detail and projections that grow out of the
building envelope. Building projections and other architectural details play important functional
and aesthetic roles in a building’s efficiency as shelter as well as its appearance. Providing
privacy and screening form the elements, projections and architectural detail also affect
surrounding development. The use of porches and verandas can further enhance residential living
space and provide protection from sun and wind. While simple and ornate architectural detail
may each represent legitimate design principles, buildings of each style may clash or contrast
with surrounding development, and suffer from the comparison. The appropriateness of a
particular building design must be viewed within the context of the building’s natural setting and
man-made environment.
Site Planning and Community Design
Site planning involves the distribution of buildings, parking, driveways and landscaped open
space areas of a site. It establishes the development’s relationship to the street and surrounding
lands. The influences of site design are not always easy to visualize and assess without the
development of a detailed site plan. Frequently, the complexity or importance of a proposed
development may make it appropriate to require the preparation of perspective renderings of the
plan and structures.
Care should be taken not to allow artistic applications of color, landscaping and graphic “eye
wash” to obscure or misrepresent the final product as it will actually appear on the development
site. Together with building architecture, site planning is a critical design parameter determining
the compatibility of proposed development with the existing development in the area and the
character of the community.
Gateways, Crossroads, Corridors and Scenic Places
In addition to the architectural character of community design, other elements must be addressed
when considering the community as a whole. These include areas with important landmarks and
focal points, which lend identity and character to the community. Landmarks or focal points may
include natural, historic, architectural, or cultural areas of interest.
Some of the most important community assets are the scenic resources of the Coachella Valley,
including the San Jacinto, Santa Rosa, San Bernardino and other mountain ranges surrounding
and encompassing the City, Flat Top Mountain, Edom Hill and the desert floor. Preservation of
these scenic vistas has been an important goal of the community. However, various types of land
development, the construction of buildings and walls, landscaping, roads and the extension of
utility lines and other facilities have all impacted and threatened to degrade the scenic resources
of the community.
The City’s natural scenic beauty, as viewed from public thoroughfares and private lands,
provides residents and visitors with a direct experience of the breathtaking landforms that define
the character of the community. The protection and enhancement of the City’s viewsheds is
critical to promoting a quality image of Cathedral City. An essential part of this effort is the

identification of important areas of significant natural scenic value and setting standards to
preserve these resources with continued urban development.
The scenic resources of Cathedral City are most apparent to the traveling public. The natural
vistas visible from City streets cannot be properly viewed or appreciated if screened by
buildings, walls and landscaping, or the indiscriminate placement of signage. The City, County
and State all play active roles in scenic resource preservation.
Cathedral City has a variety of important entry and focus points, which provide opportunities to
reinforce the City’s identity and scenic viewsheds. The integration of monuments and
appropriate signage, as well as special streetscape and landscape treatments, can be used to
reflect the community’s unique character. Focal points can be located anywhere along major
routes, including important street corners, within parks and other public open space, civic
buildings, schools and historic areas. Adequate areas for significant landscape or architectural
treatment, City entry signage, special paving, and other identifiable treatments all lend character
and identity to City entry and other focus points (also see Scenic Highways discussion in this
element).
Examples of developed landscape architectural elements include the median on East Palm
Canyon Drive through the City, which provides a welcoming experience to motorists, bicyclists
and pedestrians as they travel through town. The landscaped median also provides a sense of
place and vitality to the City. Landscaping elements, monumentation, signage, site furnishings,
and open space areas should all be considered in the development standard and policies for
landmark or focal point enhancement.
Other corridors that exist in the city are Ramon Road, Date Palm Drive, Landau Boulevard,
Cathedral Canyon Drive, Varner Road, Palm Drive and Perez Road. Crossroads, or major
intersections, in Cathedral City are at Vista Chino Road/I-10/Date Palm Drive, Ramon
Road/Date Palm Drive, Dinah Shore/Date Palm Drive, Date Palm Drive/East Palm Canyon
Drive, Palm Drive/I-10, Palm Drive/Varner Road, Varner Road/Mountain View Road and
Gerald Ford/Date Palm Drive. Improvements at these main intersections of the city are currently
(2001) in various development and planning stages, and will be monitored by Gateway Plans that
will be adopted into the City’s amendment codes.
Neighborhood parks are among the city’s most valued scenic places, as they provide an
enhanced sense of community for its residents as well as a visual sense of calm and well-being;
the citizens of Cathedral City have made it clear that residential neighborhoods are among the
City’s greatest assets. The layout of land parcels within a subdivision can influence the economic
impact, traffic safety, and livability of a neighborhood. Placing parks in the center of a
neighborhood, for example, serves to provide a community with a meeting point, a place for
family activities, and a central neighborhood gathering place.
Signage and Viewsheds of Public Rights-of-Way
The East Palm Canyon Drive commercial corridor, Date Palm Drive and Ramon Road are the
most frequently traveled, and are most impacted by signage of businesses attempting to make

their existence and location known. Enhancing commercial signage should be conducted in a
manner that minimizes the adverse economic impact on business, while restoring the viewshed
along existing and planned commercial corridors. Businesses located within Redevelopment
project areas may be able to participate in and benefit from RDA sponsored sign renovation
programs.
Transportation and Community Design
A broad range of transportation-oriented community design issues must be faced as the
community continues to grow. Development design issues and details that must be given careful
attention include entry point monument signage, street signage, commercial signage, street
lighting levels and fixtures, bus turnouts and shelters, curb and pavement treatments, median
island and parkway design and landscaping, roadway reflectors and guardrails, bike lanes and
other on-road graphics, and utility structures and facilities. Consistent safety and comfort
features for pedestrians and bicyclists are central to the city’s vision of itself as a livable
community.
Developers of new commercial projects should be encouraged to “break up” large expanses of
parking with landscaping and pedestrian paths, locating buildings at the street and parking at the
sides or rear of the buildings. This design approach also serves to provide the streets with a sense
of vitality and community.
Scenic Highways
Especially striking are the mountain vista to the west and south as one descends into Cathedral
City from the I-10 overpass and the hill and mountain vista. It is an essential and critical
component of community design in Cathedral City, while effectively linking the City with other
Coachella Valley communities. Many functional community design goals can be achieved
through the detailed design and planning for the city’s major gateways and corridors. The safe,
functionally efficient and aesthetically pleasing design and buildout of these sites is a key
element in the City’s overall economic health and prosperity.
Neighborhood Design
The City of Cathedral City prides itself on having a wide variety of neighborhood settings and
considers its residential neighborhoods to be on of its greatest resources. Attributes that can
make a neighborhood unique include adherence to the Ahwahnee Principles’ concepts set forth
in its preamble:
         “Existing patterns of urban and suburban development seriously impair our quality of
         life. The symptoms are:
              •  more congestion and air pollution resulting from our increased dependence on
                 automobiles,
              •  the loss of precious open space,
              •  the need for costly improvements to roads and public services,
              •  the inequitable distribution of economic resources, and
              •  the loss of a sense of community.

        By drawing upon the best from the past and the present, we can, first, infill existing
        communities and, second, plan new communities that will more successfully serve the
        needs of those who live and work within them.”
Architecture: Architectural commonality can be established throughout the neighborhood with
the coordinated and complementary use of various design components, including building colors,
roof design and tile color, window and garage door treatment and architectural building accents
and details. These components should be mixed to create a balance of variety, compatibility and
conformity or cohesion.
Perimeter Wall/Fence Treatment: Walls and fences define the borders of residential communities
and are used in perimeter landscape treatments for a variety of other development types in the
City. Designs may consist of wrought iron, stuccoed concrete block, plain and painted
slumpstone, split-faced block, plastered, brick-capped or tile accented, and intermittent columns
or pilasters. Interspersing solid walls with wrought iron fencing provides views into development
open space areas and relieves the closed in feeling that walls can engender.
Wider parkways provide additional wall set backs and landscape treatment that reduces the
enclosed feeling. Wall breaks and fenestration along public rights-of-way help to integrate
private community open space and viewsheds with those of the traveling public. The City should
encourage the continued use of this type of viewshed window as a means of reducing the tunnel
effect and preserving scenic vistas.
Parkway Landscaping: One of the most prominent and visible exterior features of neighborhoods
and private communities is parkway landscaping. Design can range from the formal to the
“natural” or combinations of both approaches. Formal design may include ordered rows of date
palms or other distinctive tree, regularly interspersed with equally ordered shrubs and beds for
annuals plantings. More informal designs seek to imitate nature by interspersing native and non-
native desert plantings in a free-form or random pattern. Groupings of major elements, and the
use of lawn areas may also be integrated into both more and less formal designs.
Community Design in Public Facilities
Community Design encompasses the entire city and includes public buildings, utilities, and street
traffic control and safety devises that have the potential to detract from the appearance of the
community. The City must consistently make quality appearance one of its prime priorities.
Current efforts include the development of unique and distinctive desert landscape treatments on
major roadways. Desert colors and tones can also be integrated into street signs, traffic signals
and lighting standards to soften their impact on the surrounding viewshed.
Bus shelter design should also be a high priority, making these facilities functionally superior
and aesthetically pleasing. These structures can utilize architectural styles that complement the
streetscape treatment and elevate the appearance of these utilitarian structures. Utility cabinets
located along the street, including traffic signal and telephone switching facilities, are frequently
painfully obvious. To the greatest extent possible, these features should be installed in
underground vaults, or effectively screened from public view. Overhead utility lines also present

visual obstructions to the natural setting and may pose safety hazards that should be minimized
by a program of utility undergrounding.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Community design considerations, including preservation and enhancement of scenic highways,
can subtly and profoundly shape the image of the community. Establishing basic criteria to
promote good and conscientious design that enhances community cohesiveness will allow
Cathedral City to emerge as a thriving community. Community design considerations are
directly related to issues associated with land use, traffic, arts and culture, health and safety,
economic development and environmental systems.
The Community Image and Urban Design Element can be implemented by several mechanisms,
which include the thoughtful application of the other Elements of the General Plan, the City
Zoning Ordinance, adopted Specific Plans, and through Redevelopment Plans and Neighborhood
Plans for individual project areas. The most effective instrument will be the Zoning Ordinance,
which set forth specific standards and establishes design parameters and guidelines for site
planning and building design.

               ECONOMIC & FISCAL ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Economic and Fiscal Element is to provide a multi-dimensional picture of the
City’s economy through a broad range of data and information. The element explores the health
of the local economy and the relationship between City government and its responsibilities, such
as establishing and enforcing land use policies and regulating new development. The element is
also intended to examine the City’s potential economic opportunities and constraints, and set
forth a series of goals, policies, and programs that will help create a viable, well-balanced
economy.
BACKGROUND
The overall health of the City’s economy is a product of the complex interrelationships between
the City’s and region’s physical and economic environments. In this regard, the Economic and
Fiscal Element is related, to some degree, to all other General Plan elements. The issues
addressed in other General Plan elements are largely centered around the protection of human
life and property from environmental hazards, the provision of adequate public services and
facilities, and the enhancement of natural and cultural resources, all of which directly impact the
City’s ability to retain and attract businesses and residents, who support the local economy. The
Economic and Fiscal Element has the strongest relationship with the Land Use Element, which
determines the distribution of land uses by type, location, intensity, and extent of use, and
therefore impacts the City’s long-term economic prosperity.
The Economic and Fiscal Element is based upon California Government Code Section 65030.2,
which states: “land use decisions shall be made with full knowledge of their economic and fiscal
implications, giving consideration to short-term costs and benefits, and their relationship to long-
term environmental impacts as well as long-term costs and benefits.” The Element also examines
issues set forth in Government Code Sections 65863.6 and 66412.3, which require cities and
counties to balance the available fiscal and environmental resources against the housing and
public services needs of the community.
Economic Conditions in Cathedral City
In formulating appropriate fiscal and economic development goals, policies, and programs, it is
essential to understand the City’s role in the Coachella Valley economy. Over the past two
decades, the Coachella Valley has emerged to become one of the premier destination resort areas
in the country, attracting visitors, seasonal residents, and retirees, who bring revenue to the
valley and generate a spin-off demand for jobs and visitor-related services.
In recent years, communities in the eastern Coachella Valley, particularly Palm Desert and La
Quinta, have positioned themselves to absorb much of the revenue generated by the regional
tourist industry, by attracting nationally recognized resort and convention centers, first-class golf

Amended June 24, 2009                                                                             III-153

                                                                                   City of Cathedral City
                                                                 General Plan/Economic & Fiscal Element
course and recreational facilities, highly valued country club and estate residential developments,
and a wide range of visitor-serving retail and restaurant establishments.
Cathedral City’s position in the regional tourist industry has been more modest, and the City is
better known for its ability to provide a wide range of affordable housing products, including
mobile homes, apartments, single-family detached units in standard subdivisions, and custom
homes. The City has successfully marketed itself to permanent residents, particularly younger
families. City-based retail development has traditionally been limited to neighborhood and
community-scale commercial centers, which principally serve year-round families living in the
City and other communities in the western valley.
Over the past five years, however, the City has made a substantial commitment to promoting
local economic growth through aggressive action and innovative planning. The City’s most
comprehensive economic development effort has been the Downtown Redevelopment project,
which was initially proposed by the City in 1992. The downtown area is generally bounded by
Date Palm Drive on the east, C Street on the south, Cathedral Canyon Drive on the west, and the
Whitewater River Stormwater Channel on the north. The project was conceived and developed
as a pedestrian-oriented festival marketplace, containing a combination of shopping, dining, and
entertainment venues, including the IMAX and Mary Pickford theaters, which are intended to
attract shoppers and moviegoers throughout the Coachella Valley. It is anchored by the Civic
Center building, which serves as an important municipal monument and provides a central
gathering place for community functions. The Downtown Redevelopment project involved
significant roadway improvements to the East Palm Canyon Drive corridor, the construction of a
municipal parking structure, and other public improvements aimed at upgrading the image of the
downtown district. The revitalization effort was intended to stimulate private investment in this
portion of the City and strengthen the City’s economic position in the regional economy.
City Cost/Revenue Trends
Table III-34, below, provides a historical presentation of the City’s major General Fund revenue
sources for Fiscal Years 1996/97 through 2000/01. The data indicate that total revenues have
increased by approximately 32% over the five-year period. There has been steady growth in
several categories, particularly the sales tax, transient occupancy tax, and Planning Department
revenues. Interest revenue has fluctuated with changes in interest rates over time. Property tax
revenues have been more sensitive to the rise and fall of the real estate market, and have
remained relatively steady over the past five years.

In addition to the General Fund revenues described in the table above, the City’s Redevelopment
Agency is expected to receive approximately $12,712,127 in tax increment revenue in Fiscal
Year 2000/01. This represents an increase of $584,043 over the previous year. This revenue
source has been instrumental in implementing the Downtown Redevelopment project and
reducing the need to use General Fund revenues for funding capital improvements along East
Palm Canyon Drive and in other redevelopment project areas.
Expenditure Trends
Table III-35, below, summarizes City expenditures since Fiscal Year 1996/97, and indicates that
expenditures have increased by approximately 45% over the past five years. The City’s highest
expenditure category has consistently been the Police Department, closely followed by the Fire
Department and General Government services. In addition to the General Fund expenditures
listed below, the City’s Redevelopment Agency will allocate approximately $12,648,171 during
Fiscal Year 2000/01 in the form of debt service, pass-through funds to other agencies, set-aside
funds for low and moderate income housing, and discretionary purposes.

Demographic Characteristics
In order to understand the needs of the City in the future, it is important to understand the
makeup of its citizenry, and the changes that have occurred in that makeup in the last several
years. The following section provides statistical data regarding the residents of Cathedral City.
Where available, 2000 Census data has been utilized, but it is important to note that only very
limited information has been released by the Census Bureau at the time of this writing (2001).
Population
Like other Coachella Valley communities, the City of Cathedral City has experienced
tremendous growth over the past two decades. During the 1980s, the City’s population nearly
tripled, increasing from approximately 11,100 in 1980, to 30,085 in 1990. According to the U.S.
Census, the population reached 42,647 by 2000, representing an increase of 42% since 1990.
Age Distribution
Although the Coachella Valley is a popular destination for seniors and retirees, Cathedral City
has traditionally attracted young adults and families, partly because of its wide range of
affordable housing products. According to the 1990 Census, the median age of Cathedral City
residents was 31.4 years. By 2000, it had increased slightly to 32.0 years. The median age for
Cathedral City residents is comparable to that of Riverside County residents (33.1 years), but is
substantially younger than that of neighboring communities.

The median age in Cathedral City is about 15 years younger than in Palm Springs (46.9 years)
and about 29 years younger than in Rancho Mirage (61.3 years). The table below illustrates the
City’s age distribution for year 2000, and indicates that younger and middle-aged adults, ages 25
to 54 years, comprise the largest segment (40.7%) of the City population.

Ethnicity
Since 1990, the City has experienced a shift in its ethnic composition, with a larger percentage of
residents identifying themselves as Hispanic or Latino. According to the 1990 Census, 37.2% of
City residents were characterized as Hispanic, but by 2000, this number had grown to 50.0%.

Household Size
A “household” includes all of the people who occupy a housing unit. It does not include those
living in group quarters; however, their impact on the City’s household characteristics is very
limited and accounted for only 0.2% of the City’s population in 1990 and 0.3% in 2000.
Household size represents the average number of people living in a dwelling unit. In 1990, there
were a total of 10,805 households in Cathedral City, with an average household size of 2.75
persons per household. By 2000, the number of households had increased by about 30% to
14,027, with an average size of 3.03 persons per household. The City’s average household size is
comparable to that of the Riverside County average (2.98 persons per household), but is
substantially larger than that of neighboring Palm Springs (2.05) and Rancho Mirage (1.92).
Median Household Income
The median household income in Cathedral City was $30,908 in 1990, which was slightly higher
than the median household income ($29,900) of the Coachella Valley as a whole. As illustrated
in the table below, City residents are likely to have middle-class incomes, with 35% of
households earning between $25,000 and $49,000 annually.

Updated household income data from the 2000 Census was not available at the time of this
writing. However, other data sources indicate a substantial increase in the City’s median
household income. The Inland Empire Economic Databank and Forecasting Center estimated
that, in 1998, the City’s median household income was $44,158. The Inland Empire Quarterly
Economic Report estimated that the median income was approximately $42,710 in 1999.
Employment Characteristics
According to a recent (2000) regional economic study conducted by the Coachella Valley
Economic Partnership, there were approximately 74,146 jobs in the Coachella Valley in 1991.
By 1999, the number had increased by 35.2% to 100,231, a growth rate that outpaced that of the
Inland Empire to the west. Given the Coachella Valley’s popularity as a resort destination,
regional employment opportunities are heavily oriented toward retail, hotel/recreational, and
service-related industries. Agriculture, construction, and health services also represent strong
sectors of the regional economy.
Employment characteristics in Cathedral City are generally consistent with regional trends. In
1990, approximately 62% of City residents 16 years and older were employed in the labor force.
As shown in the following table, most worked in the retail trade (23%) or construction (14%)
industries. The largest employers of Cathedral City residents are listed in Table III-40.

A 2000 Coachella Valley Economic Partnership regional economic study indicates that 91.3% of
all working Coachella Valley residents have jobs within the regional area, and only 7.6%
commute to jobs outside the desert region. However, within the Coachella Valley, there is a
relative imbalance between the location of jobs and residents, which forces many residents to
travel to neighboring cities for work.

indicates that, while Cathedral City is home to approximately 15.3% of the regional population,
it provides only about 5.4% of all regional jobs. These data imply that many City residents are
traveling to other cities for work. The City needs to continue its concentrated efforts to attract
businesses that generate stable, high-paying jobs for local residents. Revitalization of the
downtown is expected to have a significant positive impact in this regard over the long-term;
however, other business attraction efforts should be undertaken to enhance this effort. The City’s
stable year-round labor force and its central location in the upper Coachella Valley are key
factors in marketing the City as an optimal business location.

Housing Market
Among Cathedral City’s economic strengths is its ability to provide a variety of affordable
residential products, ranging from apartments to newer master planned residential developments,
at competitive prices that are typically lower than those found in other Coachella Valley
communities. According to the California Association of Realtors, during the fourth quarter of
1998, the median sales price for new and existing homes in Cathedral City was $96,000. More
recent data indicates that home values are increasing throughout the Coachella Valley, but
Cathedral City continues to offer some of the most competitive prices. The Inland Empire
Quarterly Economic Report shows that, during the first quarter of 2000, median housing prices in
Cathedral City were $117,750 for existing homes, and $165,700 for new homes.
The City’s housing stock increased from 15,229 units in 1990 to 17,916 units in 2000, which
represents a ten-year increase of about 17%. As shown in the following table, the majority of
new structures are single-family, detached dwellings, which is typical of a low-density, suburban
community. Much of this new development has occurred in the northern portion of the City,
between 30th Avenue and Interstate-10. The percentage of attached single-family units and
mobile homes in the City’s housing mix has decreased since 1990, while the percentage of multi-
family units has remained relatively unchanged.

Due to the Coachella Valley’s popularity as a resort destination, and its ability to attract a
substantial part-year, non-resident population, the regional demand for second home ownership
is strong. It is estimated that approximately 27% of all housing units in the Valley are used for
non-resident purposes (Economic Research Associates, 1996), and growth in second home
ownership is expected to remain strong during the next decade. Traditionally, these units have
been constructed in the cities of Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, and Palm Springs. The 2000 U.S.
Census identifies the number of “vacant” housing units, which are used for seasonal,
recreational, or occasional use. These units account for 23.5% (7,240 units) of all housing units
in Palm Springs, 26.1% (3,079 units) in Rancho Mirage, and 19.0% (485 units) in Palm Desert.
Second home ownership has been more modest in Cathedral City, however, where only 10.5%
(1,874 units) of housing units are vacant for seasonal or recreational purposes (2000 U.S.
Census). A study of development prospects for Cathedral City estimated that, if recent trends in
second home ownership continue, the City could attract a significant share of new non-resident
housing products over the next decade, possibly adding as many as 1,400 new units to the City’s
housing mix (Economic Research Associates, 1996). The Downtown Redevelopment area,
which is centrally located and can accommodate higher-density housing opportunities, could be
instrumental in attracting vacation homebuyers and retirees to Cathedral City. The Downtown
Precise Plan includes lands between Cathedral Canyon Drive and Date Palm Drive which are
planned for a variety of housing types, including affordable housing, senior and congregate care
units, and condominium or townhome units.
The City could realize substantial spin-off revenues, particularly increased sales and use tax
revenues and increased demand for retail and service-related jobs, generated by a larger non-
resident population. The City should consider directing future marketing efforts at this growing
and potentially lucrative market, and determine whether and where second-home ownership fits
into the community’s long-range goals.

Commercial Development
Commercial development is a critical component of most communities, as the sale of goods and
services can generate significant sales tax revenue and employment opportunities. Over the past
decade, the City of Palm Desert has established itself as the retail powerhouse of the Coachella
Valley, with the City of La Quinta emerging as a strong competitor. Their dominance in the
regional retail market is partly due to their central location within the Coachella Valley,
relatively high resident income levels, and the ability to offer a wide range of retail facilities,
including exclusive specialty shops, large department stores, chain restaurants, and large-volume
home improvement warehouses.
Commercial development in Cathedral City has been traditionally comprised of smaller-scale
neighborhood and community shopping centers, which serve City residents but are not able to
attract a larger consumer base. An exception is the automobile dealer industry in the Cathedral
City Auto Center on East Palm Canyon Drive, which, given its specialty, is able to attract
consumers from throughout the Coachella Valley and other desert communities. Other major
retailers are also auto-related and include auto parts stores and repair shops.
Revitalization of the City’s downtown core has afforded the City with tremendous opportunities
to further define and expand its role in the regional retail market. Consistent with the downtown
district’s marketed image as a festival marketplace, existing commercial development includes
an IMAX theater, the Mary Pickford Theater (multiplex cinema), and small-scale restaurants and
retail shops. However, the Downtown district has not yet reached its full retail potential, and
additional development opportunities exist.
Taxable Sales and Sales Tax Revenues
The table below describes taxable sales trends in the City from 1995 through 1999, as recorded
by the California Board of Equalization. The data indicate that the City’s taxable sales increased
steadily by nearly 53% during this five-year period. This is a substantial increase due, in part, to
tremendous sales tax revenue gains generated by automobile-related sales, which increased
nearly 73%. Other growing markets included home furnishings/appliances, for which taxable
sales more than doubled from 1995 to 1999, and eating/drinking establishments, for which sales
tax revenues increased by about 29%. In 1995, there were approximately 1,070 taxable sales
generators/outlets in the City, but by 1999, the number had decreased to 993. It is interesting to
note that, during this five-year period, the increase in total taxable sales occurred despite a loss of
77 taxable sales generators/outlets in the City.
The latest taxable sales data, provided by the City, indicate that taxable sales during year 2000
were $684,864,500. This represents an increase of about $75,035,500 over 1999 taxable sales, or
a one-year increase of about 12.3%.

The table above indicates that, for 2001, the total sales potential of City residents was estimated
at $730,489,000. However, according to the City, actual taxable sales in Cathedral City in 2000
were $684,864,500. The difference of $45,624,500 represents the approximate retail sales
potential of City residents that is not being spent within the city limits, and suggests that there is
significant retail leakage to other communities. This represents a loss of revenue for local
businesses as well as the City General Fund.
The City is losing approximately 6.2% of its retail spending capacity to other communities. This
is attributable to several factors. First, as described earlier, there is a relative imbalance between
the number of jobs and residents in Cathedral City, which forces much of the City’s labor force
to work outside the City and provides them with opportunities to shop elsewhere while
commuting to work. The City also has a basic range of retail outlets that have difficulty
competing with larger chain stores and specialty shops elsewhere in the valley.

Wal-Mart and Target are exceptions to this pattern. In the same regard, historically, Cathedral
City has had an excess of strip commercial development spread out along arterial roads, rather
than a comprehensive shopping mall or consolidated shopping district that centralizes retail
synergies within the City. The revitalized Downtown Redevelopment Area is expected to fill this
void over the long-term, but is still in the process of defining itself as a regional retail center.
Nonetheless, it is anticipated that the investments made in the Downtown district will enhance
the City’s ability to attract businesses that offer unique, yet essential products and services to the
local and regional population.
Tourism and Traveler Revenues
The Coachella Valley has long been recognized as a leading resort destination, which is best
known for its unique desert environment and climate. A major portion of regional hotel facilities
was constructed during the 1980s, and despite the national recession of the early 1990s, the
tourism industry has remained the stronghold of the regional economy. Although many
Coachella Valley cities have embraced tourism as the foundation of their local economies, the
industry has generally played a more limited role in Cathedral City. The following table provides
an inventory of regional hotel/motel facilities and associated revenues.

As described above, there are 227 hotel/motel properties (with 14,597 rooms) in the Coachella
Valley, and only seven (529 rooms) are located in Cathedral City. During 1999, the City’s gross
hotel room sales totaled approximately $11.4 million, which represents only about 3.2% of all
room sales in the Coachella Valley.

Despite Cathedral City’s limited representation in the regional hotel/motel market, hotel
operations provide the City with one of its largest revenue sources, transient occupancy taxes.
The transient occupancy tax (TOT) is imposed on individuals for the privilege of occupying a
hotel or motel room in the City. Cathedral City’s TOT rate is 10%, which is added to the
occupant’s hotel bill and remitted to the City by hotel/motel operators on a monthly basis. The
following table describes TOT revenue trends since Fiscal Year 1995/96, and shows that TOT
revenues have grown nearly 65% during this six-year period. The first significant increase in
revenues occurred between in FY 98/99, when revenues increased by 30% over the previous
year. The City anticipates that they will reach $1.3 million during FY 00/01.

In addition to the direct revenue generated by transient occupancy taxes, tourists also spend a
considerable amount at local restaurants, shops, and recreational/cultural attractions. These
expenditures translate into increased sales tax revenues for the City and increased earnings for
the local labor force, much of which is ultimately funneled back into the local economy.
The City could potentially capture a larger share of the tourism industry by attracting high-
quality hotels and/or bed and breakfast facilities to its newly revitalized Downtown
Redevelopment Area. According to the Downtown Precise Plan, land south of East Palm Canyon
Drive and west of Cathedral Canyon Drive is designated for Bed and Breakfast (BB)
development. These lands could accommodate a total of approximately 500 rooms, including
285 bed and breakfast rooms, 175 senior hotel rooms, and 40 rooms for people with special
needs. Vacant mixed-use commercial lands in the vicinity of the I-10/Date Palm Drive and I-
10/Palm Drive interchanges are also appropriate for future hotel/motel development. Interstate-
10 provides essential inter-city and inter-regional access and is a critical part of the local road
network moving people and goods into and out of the Coachella Valley. In the vicinity of Date
Palm Drive, it carries approximately 54,000 automobiles per day.

The construction of an attractive and well-planned hotel/motel and other highway-serving
commercial development at this location would serve the traveling public and allow the City and
local businesses to capture a share of the drive-by market.
Commercial Development Opportunities
Analysis of existing commercial development in Cathedral City and the spending patterns of
City residents indicates that the attraction of large-scale, high-volume retail outlets should be one
of the areas of focus of the City’s economic development strategy. This type of development will
allow the City to tap into the regional retail market, capture a larger share of regional sales tax
revenues, and generate additional employment opportunities for City residents.
There are several large, undeveloped properties in the City, with physical attributes that are ideal
for the retail environment. These include the 40-acre business park at the northeast corner of Da
Vall Drive and Ramon Road, and the 80-acre parcel immediately west of the state-owned
rehabilitation center on Ramon Road. Both of these sites are accessible to existing high traffic
volumes on Ramon Road and could accommodate a wide range of mixed-use, community
commercial developments. Land at the southeast corner of Date Palm Drive and Vista Chino is
designated for General Commercial purposes, with Industrial land immediately to the east. Land
north of Interstate-10, east of Palm Drive, and both east and west of Date Palm Drive is
designated mixed-use commercial. These sites are ideally situated for large-scale retail
development, will benefit from its location adjacent to Date Palm Drive and Interstate-10, and
could potentially attract a significant share of the regional market. Each of these sites offers
important opportunities for the creation of high-quality, integrated retail developments. Such
efforts may take place within the parameters of somewhat refined master plans that provide for
coordinated access, parking, and pedestrian open spaces. Major utilities and public infrastructure
are already in place to serve the sites south of Interstate 10 and will generally require only site-
specific extensions and modifications.
Industrial Development
Industrial development can bring stable and generally higher paying jobs to a community and
can induce development in a variety of secondary or supporting industries. The success of
industrial development is dependent upon several factors, including site accessibility, the
availability and affordability of utilities, labor force quality, and the public policy environment,
as it pertains to industrial growth. With the exception of the agri-business sector that dominates
the eastern Coachella Valley, industrial activity in the Coachella Valley has traditionally been
limited to light industrial and industrial park development, which includes contractors/
construction companies, auto repair/parts services, and commercial tenants such as insurance
agencies, realtors, tax/financial advisors, and related service providers.
An analysis of land use designations indicates that Cathedral City has allocated sufficient
acreage to accommodate future industrial development. Land costs are generally low, and parcels
are available in variable lot sizes, ranging from a few to many acres. Within the General Plan
planning area, lands designated for industrial or business park uses are concentrated in two
general locations: 1) in the vicinity of Perez Road, between the Downtown Redevelopment Area
and the Whitewater River Stormwater Channel, and 2) adjacent to the Interstate-10/Union

Pacific Railroad corridor.
The Perez Road corridor is nearly built-out and contains a combination of industrial and service-
related businesses, such as auto repair/parts companies, printing/art supply shops, and heating/air
conditioning repair services. Industrial acreage near the I-10 freeway corridor remains vacant.
These parcels are ideally situated to take advantage of the convenient truck access provided by
Interstate-10 and Date Palm Drive, and the potential freight rail access provided by the Union
Pacific Railroad. However, future development opportunities in this vicinity will be constrained
by environmental factors, including extremely high winds and blowing sand and dust emanating
from the San Gorgonio Pass, and occasional flooding and runoff associated with the Salvia Wash
and Indio Hills. Development north of I-10 will require the extension of water, sewer, and other
utilities as described in the North City Specific Plan, as well as the construction of local roads
and other site-specific improvements.
New Construction Trends
Since 1990, new construction valuations have increased steadily, with single-family construction
representing the lion’s share of new development. As shown in Table III-47, below, since 1997,
the number of new single-family residential permits issued has increased nearly four-fold, from
98 permits in 1997, to 483 in 2000. Single-family building permit valuations have increased
more than five-fold, from about $14.4 million in 1997, to more than $75 million in 2000. The
level of multi-family development has fluctuated even more widely over the past four years, with
the number of permits ranging from a low of one permit in 1997, to a high of 22 in 1999. Multi-
family residential valuations have also fluctuated widely, from a low of $205,700 in 1997, to a
high of $16.6 million in 1999. Much of the new residential development has been concentrated
in the northerly portion of the City, north of McCallum Way.
The “Commercial” category described in the table below includes both commercial and
industrial development. However, new industrial development has been extremely limited, and
City staff estimates that only one new building has been constructed on industrial-zoned land in
recent years. The building is located at the corner of Date Palm Drive and Perez Road and is
actually used more for retail, rather than industrial, purposes. Therefore, the “Commercial”
category described below most accurately reflects commercial development trends in the City,
and industrial development can be presumed to be more modest.
Commercial development remains an important contributor to the City economy, and although
the level of new commercial construction slowed during 1998, it rebounded in 1999 and
increased substantially in 2000. Since 1997, the number of new commercial building permits has
range from a low of 14 in 1998, to a high of 32 in 1999. Commercial valuations have ranged $4.4
million in 1998 to nearly $24.3 million in 2000.

Agua Caliente Lands
The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians owns four complete and three partial Sections of
land within the City limits (one Section equals 640 acres). These Sections of land are generally
distributed in an alternating checkerboard pattern, and some include undeveloped parcels, which
have been marketed for ambitious development projects in the past, such as lodging facilities,
regional shopping centers, and recreational and cultural complexes. The construction of such
large-scale development projects typically requires the assembly of numerous adjoining Indian
allottee properties, and the leasing and development of these lands is subject to multi-party
negotiations between the Agua Caliente, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and City of Cathedral
City.

Tribal lands comprise a substantial portion of the City and occur in strategic locations, including
immediately adjacent to the Interstate-10 and Date Palm Drive corridors, and within walking
distance of the Downtown Redevelopment Area. If the full development potential of these lands
is to be realized, development agreements will need to be secured and negotiations undertaken
between private developers, utility providers, realtors, the Agua Caliente, Bureau of Indian
Affairs, City of Cathedral City, and other parties. The cultivation of a cooperative relationship
between the Agua Caliente, BIA, and City is essential to the implementation of the City’s long-
range economic development goals and should be continually pursued.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Although the City has generally recovered from the economic recession that impacted Southern
California during the early 1990s, its economy has not fully regained the vigor it enjoyed during
the 1980s. The City has responded with aggressive action and innovative planning, namely its
Downtown Redevelopment project, which serves as a physical focal point and community
gathering place, defines a centralized shopping and entertainment district, and is expected to
provide the impetus for new capital investment and redevelopment along the East Palm Canyon
corridor. The role of the Redevelopment Area in the local and regional retail market is still being
defined, and its ability to meet the needs of the shopping public need to be continually re-
evaluated.
The City must also exploit other opportunities for economic development. In particular, it must
develop and implement strategies to effectively compete with the retail industry boom that has
occurred in the central/eastern Coachella Valley in recent years. Economic policies and programs
should be directed at attracting employment-generating businesses, which may include high-
quality visitor accommodations (hotels, inns, bed and breakfasts), light industrial development,
and a broader menu of commercial establishments. This will help the City balance the ratio of
housing to jobs and encourage residents to work and spend within the City limits. The City can
capture a share of the tourist drive-by market by expanding highway-serving commercial
development at the I-10/Date Palm Drive interchange and at the I-10/Palm Drive interchange.
Revitalization of the Downtown provides the City with new opportunities to attract vacationing
homebuyers and retirees, by facilitating the development of second homes and non-resident
condominiums.
The City has adopted the North City Specific Plan, a planning tool for the development of the
area of the City north of Interstate 10, including the Interstate-10/Date Palm Drive and Interstate-
10/Palm Drive interchanges. The Specific Plan lays out the zoning, development, performance
and design standards, “backbone” infrastructure and an infrastructure financing plan. Since the
Specific Plan has received environmental clearance and the Coachella Valley Multiple Species
Habitat Conservation Plan is in place, comprehensive planning for future development has
already been accomplished. This gives North City a competitive advantage over other Interstate-
adjacent development sites.
An essential component of any economic development plan is the effective marketing of the City
as a business-friendly community. This may require the preparation of site-specific property

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Biological Resources Element is to preserve and protect the integrity of the
natural environment and its many biological resources. For the purposes of this element,
biological resources represent the plants and wildlife species, as well as the ecosystems and
habitats, which contribute to an area's natural setting. These resources not only enhance and
contribute to the natural environment; but they also add to the health, identity and image of the
built environment. This element describes the natural environment and identifies the important
and valuable biological resources occurring within Cathedral City and the surrounding area. It
also references other information sources, which are intended to guide decision makers in
regulating land use and development, while protecting these critical resources. The goals,
policies, and programs set forth in this element are designed to ensure the long-term preservation
of biological resources in a manner, which benefits the entire community.
BACKGROUND
The Biological Resources Element has a direct relation to important policy issues in the Land
Use and Open Space Elements. It is also related to the Parks and Recreation Element, which
addresses the community’s enjoyment of, and commitment to its natural resources. Cathedral
City has been an active participant in the development of the Coachella Valley Multiple Species
Habitat Conservation Plan, which is a regional effort to conserve adequate, unfragmented habitat
for a wide range of special-status plant and animal species. In addition, portions of the City are
included in the Santa Rosa Mountains Wildlife Habitat Area that has been established to protect
sensitive Peninsular Bighorn habitat from potentially adverse development. The General Plan
study area is also home to the Willow Hole-Edom Hill Preserve, a unique blowsand preserve that
provides critical habitat to the special-status Coachella Valley Fringe-toed Lizard. The Biological
Resources Element will influence and contribute to the effective implementation of conservation
strategies, goals, policies, and programs.
The City is required to include an element, which provides for the preservation and conservation
of wildlife resources by California Government Code Section 65302(d). This section of the Code
also requires that the City provide inventories of natural vegetation, fish and wildlife and their
habitat, including rare and endangered species in the General Plan. This element also includes, as
required, goals, policies and programs, as well as plans and maps showing where important areas
for the preservation of plant and animal life, including habitat for fish and wildlife species, and
areas required for ecological and scientific study, are located.
There are also many state and federal regulations that have been established to protect and
preserve biological resources. The Endangered Species Act is one of the most valuable laws for
protecting species and habitat. It acts to identify all endangered species, and to increase their
populations to sustainable levels. In addition to the Endangered Species Act, California has
several additional laws and regulations that directly and indirectly protect plant and wildlife

The Regional Environment
The Coachella Valley's environment has many physical attributes which have a direct effect on
the type of habitats and biological communities that exist within the region. In the Valley, these
attributes are largely shaped by the geographic location, climate, topography and geology of the
area. The following discussion provides a brief description of these conditions in the Coachella
Valley, and how they take shape to form the basis for habitat and biological resources in the
planning area.
Topography
The Coachella Valley is characterized by extreme variation in topographic features, from the
low-lying desert floor to the hillsides and mountain ranges that surround most of the Valley. The
Salton Sea, located at the southeast end of the Valley, occurs at an elevation of about 228 feet
below sea level and has no natural outlet. The northern, western and southern edges of the Valley
are bordered by major mountain ranges, including the San Bernardino, Little San Bernardino,
San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains. Summit elevations range from 9,600 feet to 11,502 feet
above mean sea level. These topographic characteristics are primarily a result of the San
Andreas, San Jacinto and other regional seismically active earthquake faults. These faults have
uplifted, subsided and shifted the ground, forming the Valley's contrasting features, while
erosion, weathering and other secondary geological processes shaped the mountains into a series
of canyons and alluvial fans that extend onto and fill the valley floor with sediment and sand.
This unique, expansive and varying geography has created a distinctive desert environment, one
with a number of intricate habitats, wildlife and plant communities that make the region a rich
resource area.
Climate
The region’s climatic conditions are greatly influenced by the mountain ranges to the west,
which block the Valley from much of the cooler maritime conditions that occur in the Inland
Empire. These mountain barriers isolate the Valley and create a subtropical desert environment
characterized by low rainfall, low relative humidity, and large levels of direct sunshine, with
very hot summers and mild winters. Daytime temperatures during the summer months generally
exceed 100˚ F, sometimes reaching more than 120˚ F. In the winter, daily temperatures range
from 80˚F to 30˚F. The surrounding mountains, however, are cooler than the valley floor and
have an approximate 5˚F decrease for every 1,000-foot increase in elevation. Mean annual
rainfall ranges between four and six inches on the desert floor, and about fifteen inches in the
nearby mountains on the northern and western end of the Valley. The majority of precipitation
occurs during the winter months, but infrequent intense thunderstorms may occur during late
summer and early fall. However, most of the rainfall generated by these storms falls on
surrounding mountain slopes, keeping the desert floor relatively dry throughout the year.
Wind also has a significant effect on the climate of the Coachella Valley. As the desert floor
heats up, cool air from the west is drawn into the Valley through the narrow San Gorgonio Pass.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                     Biological Resources Element
Amended June 24, 2009                                                                             IV-2

                                                                                   City of Cathedral City

This concentrates the air currents and generates strong winds, which pass over the most erosive
portions of the valley floor, transporting large quantities of sand and dust throughout the region.
This natural sand migration and transport process is responsible for creating desert sand dunes,
which are an important habitat for native wildlife.
Plants and animals in this climate survive by utilizing a variety of structural and behavioral
adaptations to conserve water and endure the heat. Plants have adapted mechanisms in their leaf
structure, such as tissues that can store water and thick epidermal layers, which help reduce
water loss from evaporation. Many plants also produce leaves seasonally, and have spines and
thorns to discourage predators while also providing shade. Animals escape the main onslaught of
daytime heat by hiding in burrows or shelters, and emerging only at night to hunt for food and
water. Some animals can obtain most of the moisture they need from grains and seeds they eat,
and they have adaptations that allow them to eliminate body wastes without losing moisture.
COACHELLA VALLEY DESERT HABITATS AND NATURAL COMMUNITIES
The Coachella Valley is located in one of the hottest and driest parts of the country, making it a
harsh and sometimes inhospitable place to live. Nevertheless, the Coachella Valley Desert
comprises one of the most biologically unique and diverse regions in the country. Vegetation on
the desert floor is sparse and limited by heat and aridity. The climate becomes milder away from
the desert floor, as elevation increases. These hillside and mountainous areas support more
vegetation, including as many as nine species of cacti, a variety of woody plants such as palo
verde and smoke tree and many herbaceous plants. In addition, they also contain a number of
canyons and ravines, which collect snowmelt and runoff from the surrounding mountains. These
niches in the mountainside support native fan palm communities and a wide variety of other
plants and animals.
Plant communities are an important factor in determining the type of habitat and natural
community in an area. Habitat describes the place or set of environmental conditions in which
plants and animals naturally live and grow. Habitats are more specific descriptions of locations
within a region, which have a distinct assortment of species. Temperature and precipitation are
primary factors in determining locations of different habitats. However, in the Coachella Valley
and surrounding areas, desert habitats are generally divided into topographical habitats that are
identified by physical differences in slope, substrate and water supply.
Valley Floor
Open space lands within the central portion of the Coachella Valley encompass the valley floor
habitat. This habitat is characterized by relatively flat and low-lying terrain, with sparse
vegetation and regions of blowing sands. The valley floor habitat contains active desert dunes,
and stabilized and partially stabilized sand dunes and fields. These areas consist of aeolian, or
windblown, sand deposits, which originated from the erosion of adjacent hills, sand deposition in
nearby ravines, and sandy soils transported by strong winds. Active dunes are situated in areas
on the valley floor that are highly exposed to the elements and are subject to intense heat and
high wind conditions. The high winds continually amass and remove sand from the active dunes.
"Active" means that the area has no windbreaks or other impediments to hinder the aeolian

processes that cause sand accumulation and depletion in the sand fields. Because the dunes are
continually shifting and accumulating sand, perennial plant cover is very low, and much of the
surface is barren for most of the year. Vegetation that does occur is largely limited to species
such as primrose (Oenothera) species, desert dicoria (Dicoria canescens), and sand verbena
(Abronia villosa). Stabilized and partially stabilized sand fields are sand accumulations that lack
the structure of sand dunes and are considered a Community of Highest Inventory Priority
(CHIP) by the State. In these areas, vegetation grows more readily and consists primarily of a
variety of scattered perennial herbs and shrubs. The most visible and abundant type of vegetation
within this valley floor community is the creosote bush (Larrea tridentate), which is an
evergreen shrub. Other perennial shrubs include sand verbena (Abronia villosa), dalea (Dalea)
species, and burrobush (Oenothera deltoides). Plants that have been identified in sand fields near
the Whitewater River flood channel include four-winged saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Indian
ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides), sandpaper plant (Petalonyx thurberi), and Devil’s lantern
(Oenothera deltoides).
The planning area contains two active sand transport systems. Sand accumulations in the
Willow Hole-Edom Hill Preserve are dominated by extensive mesquite thickets that are
supported by a high water table and blowing sand. The Willow Hole-Edom Hill Preserve
provides critical blowsand habitat to the Coachella Valley Fringe-Toed Lizard and other
sensitive species. Historically, the valley floor, particularly along the Whitewater River, has
functioned as an active sand transport corridor for aeolian deposits blowing from the northwest.
However, urban development in Cathedral City and Palm Springs to the west has restricted sand
movement and resulted in a loss of this sensitive habitat.
Most of the development within the planning area and the region has occurred along the valley
floor. As a result, the open space lands that comprise the valley floor habitat are largely
fragmented and disturbed. As development and growth continue, this habitat will continue to
shrink, removing valuable examples of plants and wildlife.
Sandy Washes
The desert wash habitat consists of channels and watercourses that drain the mountains
surrounding the Valley. As washes emerge from canyon mouths, they form deep channels that
cut through the alluvial plain. Farther from the canyons, washes become shallower, broader and
less defined, and the physical differences between the washes and the alluvial plain diminish.
The Desert Dry Wash Woodland plant community typically occurs in gravelly washes, although
it is known to occasionally integrate with the valley floor's creosote bush scrub community. The
Dry Wash Woodland is dominated by palo verde (Cercidium floridum) and smoke tree
(Psorothmnus spinosus), but also includes desert willow (Chylopsis linearis), desert lavender
(Hyptis emoryi), and cheesebush (Hymenoclea salsola). This vegetation community occurs at the
Willow Hole-Edom Hill Preserve, as well as limited locations along the Whitewater River.
Desert wash habitat often serves as travel corridors for wildlife that are supported by both the
wash and the alluvial plain habitats. Birds are generally abundant in desert washes. Typical
species include verdin, phainopepla and black-tailed gnatcatcher. The largest desert washes in
the planning area include the Whitewater River Wash, the Morongo Wash and the Long Canyon

Wash. Channelization and control structures have been constructed along the majority of the
Whitewater River. However, the Morongo Wash and Long Canyon Wash are located north of the
freeway in predominantly undeveloped regions, and still support adequate and viable sandy wash
habitat.
Alluvial Plain
Lands south of East Palm Canyon Drive and at the foothills of the Santa Rosa Mountains can be
characterized as alluvial plain habitat. This habitat develops on flood-formed fans that extend
from mountain canyons such as Cathedral Canyon in the Santa Rosa Mountains. At its highest
points near the mountain ridges, the alluvial plain consists of coarse rock and sand that has
accumulated from a number of large floods that began shaping the plain during prehistoric times.
This material becomes smoother and sandier as the fan continues downward toward the valley
floor. The habitat and communities found on these plains transition with increasing distance from
the canyon mouths, as the substrate is slowly altered from rocky to sandy deposits.
Sonoran mixed woody and succulent scrub is the dominant plant community of the alluvial plain
habitat. This community occurs along the lower slopes of the Santa Rosa Mountains and is
widespread, forming the south edge of the Coachella Valley. Sonoran mixed woody and
succulent scrub is a variant of the creosote scrub community, and is very typical of the Colorado
Desert. Typical plant species found on the lower alluvial plain include creosote bush, indigobush
(Dalea schottii), dyeweed (D. emoryi), catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii), smoketree (Dalia
spinosa) and Palo verde (Cercidium floridum). Plant distribution and variety changes farther up
the plain, and a variety of cacti including pencil cholla (Opuntia ramosissima) and barrel cactus
(Ferocactus acanthodes), as well as chuparosa (Belaperone californica) and desert lavender
become increasingly common.
Desert Fan Palm Oasis Woodland
The Desert Fan Palm Oasis Woodland is a sensitive plant community considered to be a
Community of the Highest Inventory Priority (CHIP) by the State of California. Its range extends
from the Baja Peninsula to Death Valley National Monument, although occurrences of this plant
community are discrete and isolated. Oases develop along geologic fault lines where ground
water rises near the surface and is capable of supporting dense vegetation. The California fan
palm (Washingtonia filifera), the largest palm in North America, dominates this community.
Mature individuals can grow to 25 meters in height and almost one meter in trunk diameter.
Other members of this plant community include desert baccharis (Baccharis sergiliodes) and
arrowweed (Pleuchea sericea). A natural fan palm oasis community occurs at the Willow Hole-
Edom Hill Preserve within the planning area, north of Interstate-10. Fan palm oases are also
found within canyons of the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains, where natural streams flow
from the snowmelt and runoff.
This habitat provides important cover and food to migrating and wintering birds as wells as birds
of prey such as the golden eagle (Aquilachrysaetos) and the prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus).
Other wildlife found within the desert fan palm community include the southern yellow bat,
common kingsnake, desert slender salamander (Batrachoseps aridus), and the giant palm-boring
beetle (Dianpate wrightii). The Peninsular Bighorn sheep often visit the oases in the Santa Rosa
Mountains to make use of the natural supply of water that flows through the woodland.

Rocky Slopes Habitat
The Santa Rosa Mountains , which extend from the edge of the alluvial plain at the south end of
the planning area, comprise the rocky slopes habitat. This habitat is characterized by steep slopes
and continuous rock that is either weathered and fractured bedrock, or broken and displaced into
loose debris of sand, pebbles and stone. Because of the sharp slopes and extensive rock surfaces
on the lower slopes, this habitat appears incapable of supporting vegetation. However, the rocky
slopes habitat supports up to 102 perennials and 115 annual species. Plant density and size
increase with elevation and associated increases in annual rainfall. Plants of the rocky slopes
habitat include creosote bush, brittlebush (Encelia farinosa), burrobush (Ambrosia dumosa),
agave (Agave deserti), Ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens), spike moss (Selaginella eremophila),
Parry's cloak fern (Notholaena parryi), arrowleaf (Pleurocoronis plurisetaa), pigmy cedar
(Peucephyllum schottii), bedstraw (Rubiceae), and crossosoma (Crossosoma bigelovii).
The rocky hillsides of the Santa Rosa Mountains, provide habitat for a different variety of plants
and animals from those on the valley floor. Connectivity with the vast areas of wildlands in the
Santa Rosa Mountains allows for the presence of wide-ranging animals, including bighorn sheep,
as well as predators such as prairie falcon, golden eagle, bobcat and mountain lion.
SENSITIVE, RARE AND ENDANGERED SPECIES
As noted above, the Cathedral City planning area contains a wide range of significant biological
resources. A number of these resources are species of plants and animals that are highly
specialized and endemic to a single habitat. Due to the loss of viable habitat, some of these
species have been listed as threatened or endangered by the federal and state governments.
"Endangered" species refers to those with such limited numbers that they are considered in
imminent danger of extinction, while "threatened" species are those that are likely to become
endangered, particularly on a local scale, within the foreseeable future. "Sensitive" species are
those that are naturally rare and that have been locally depleted and put at risk by human
activities. Although the perpetuation of a sensitive species does not appear to be significantly
threatened, they are considered vulnerable and are often candidates for future listing. The
following tables list the endangered, threatened or sensitive species within the planning area.

Ecosystem Management and Biodiversity Protection
Human life is inextricably linked to the natural environment. Native species provide us with a
number of life-sustaining resources and services. Soil formation, waste disposal, air and water
purification, nutrient cycling, solar energy absorption, and management of biogeochemical and
hydrological cycles are all dependent on biodiversity. The Earth's ecosystems are composed of
these interactions between species and the natural environment and represent the culmination of
historic evolutionary processes of long standing. The complexity of these systems is not yet fully
understood, but it is clear that each member of an ecosystem has an important role to fulfill.

Humans are the most dominant organisms on the earth, making use of more than half of the
world's terrestrial ecosystems. While utilization of natural resources is necessary for human
survival, many of our current practices are often disruptive and damaging to ecological processes
and to the natural environment. The conversion of natural habitat to human uses is the largest
single cause of biodiversity losses.
An important step towards protecting biodiversity is through the careful management of natural
communities and ecosystems. Ecosystem management attempts to integrate ecological,
economic and social goals in a unified approach. It recognizes that we cannot have sustained
progress toward social goals in a deteriorating environment or economy, or vice versa. Each of
these domains affects, and is affected by the others. Adapting legislation to restore, maintain and
safeguard ecological systems will ensure the well being and security of future generations.
Public Land Agencies and Ecosystem Management
In addition to regulations and legislation regarding biological resources, there are also several
public land agencies and non-profit organizations that focus on thoughtful ecosystem
management and biological resource protection. While many of the lands that are owned and
managed by these agencies and organizations provide for varying degrees of disturbance from
recreational uses, the mandate for most is the safeguarding of cultural, scenic and biological
resources.
Within the Valley there are several of public land agencies and non-profit organizations which
work together frequently in managing the Valley's open space lands. Some of these agencies
include the National Park Service, the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Land
Management as well as California state agencies including the California Department of Fish and
Game, and the California Department of Parks and Recreation. Predominant non-profit
organizations include the Mountains Conservancy and the Nature Conservancy.
Endangered Species Act
The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 provides much needed protection to biological
resources, and is a dominant force in biodiversity protection. Congress passed the Endangered
Species Act to "provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened
species depend may be conserved, and to provide a program for the conservation of these
species." The Department of the Interior, acting through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is
responsible for the protection of most threatened and endangered species. The Department of
Commerce, through the National Marine Fisheries Service, has responsibility for marine
mammals and anadromous fish. The structure of the ESA can be broken down into the following
components:
    1.      Listing of species and designation of critical habitat,
    2.      recovery planning, and
    3.      prohibitions and exceptions to prohibitions.
Listing Endangered and Threatened Species
An "endangered" species is any species of animal or plant that is in danger of extinction
throughout all or a significant portion of its range, while a "threatened" species is any species of

Amended June 24, 2009                                                                                IV-9
                                                                                    City of Cathedral City

animal, or plant that is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all
or a significant portion of its range.
"Candidate" species is a species for which substantial information is available to support a listing
proposal, but for which a lack of funding and personnel preclude listing. The Secretary of the
Interior is required to publish "notices of review" which list the status of candidate species.
Currently (2001), the United States has 972 species on its endangered species list, 272 threatened
species and 173 candidate species - many of which have remained on the candidate list for more
than a decade. Species can be added to the list of endangered or threatened species for five
reasons:
     1.     Current or threatened destruction of habitat;
     2.     Overuse of the species for commercial, recreational, scientific or educational
            purposes;
     3.     Disease or predation;
     4.     Ineffective regulatory mechanisms; and
     5.     Other natural or manmade factors affecting the species chances of survival.
Protecting Critical Habitat
Critical habitat is defined as the geographic area containing physical or biological features
essential to the conservation of a listed species, or an area that may require special management
considerations or protection. Neither federal agencies nor private landowners may destroy or
adversely modify critical habitat of any listed species. More than 80 percent of all species listed
as either threatened or endangered have no designated critical habitat.
Recovery Planning For Threatened and Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act requires the Service to develop and implement recovery plans for
all threatened and endangered species that occur in the United States. Recovery plans set forth
what is needed for a species to "recover" to the point that it no longer needs the protections of the
ESA. The plans must include specific management recommendations for the species and
objective, measurable criteria which, when met, would signal the recovery of the species.
Prohibited Actions under the Endangered Species Act
The Act establishes broad prohibitions against "taking" endangered or threatened species. In
other words, on both public and private lands of the U.S., it is illegal "to harass, harm, pursue,
hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture or collect" threatened or endangered animals. The Service
has defined "harm" to include significant destruction of a species' habitat that results in actual
death or injury.
Incidental Take Permits and HCPs
The ESA contains an exception to the strict prohibition against "take" in which the Service may
permit a project to go forward and destroy threatened and endangered species and their habitat as
long as the taking is "incidental" to, and not the purpose of, the project. This permit is commonly
referred to as an "incidental take permit" (ITP).
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                        Biological Resources Element

The Service cannot issue an ITP unless the permit applicant submits a conservation plan known
as a "Habitat Conservation Plan" (HCP). HCPs must specify the proposed project's impact to the
species and include mitigation measures which will reduce the project's impacts. The City is a
participant in the Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) which
is intended to protect a number of species (please see further discussion below).
California Endangered Species Act
The California Endangered Species Act (CESA), administered by the California Department of
Fish and Game, largely parallels the federal law, and provides similar requirements and
mandates to those described above. CESA, however, goes further than the ESA in that it
prohibits the taking of both endangered species and those petioned for listing at the state level.
CESA also includes plant species under its protection, where the federal ESA only protects
plants on federally owned lands or where there is a federal nexus. In Cathedral City and other
Valley communities, local government is responsible for ensuring that all proposed projects
conform to the standards and mandates of both the federal and state Acts. The MSHCP conforms
to the standards of both laws, in order to receive incidental take permits from both the federal
and state governments.
Habitat Protection
While the ESA is a powerful tool for biological resource protection, it generally focuses on
individual species, rather than entire biological communities. Nevertheless, the driving force
behind today's decline in species is the destruction, degradation and fragmentation of critical and
essential habitat due to increasing human population and conversion of valuable open space land
to urban uses. Human exploitation of our resources is the primary cause of habitat loss,
degradation and fragmentation.
While habitat loss and degradation are obvious threats to species survival, habitat fragmentation
is a less obvious threat. Habitat fragmentation has two parts: a decrease in the habitat type; and
the allotment of the remaining habitat into smaller, more isolated pieces. The problems that arise
from habitat fragmentation include smaller populations due to small amounts of habitat, isolation
of populations into fragmented parts with less genetic diversity, and potential increase in
predators, competitors and parasites. As a result, habitat fragmentation is one of the greatest
threats to species and the ecosystems they rely upon for survival.
Habitat protection and the widespread preservation of ecosystems provide support for maximum
biological diversity, and ensure the long-term protection of all species. The efforts being made
through the MSHCP propose to protect these ecosystems, and provide long-term viability for the
species included in the Plan.
Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument
On October 24, 2000, the President of the United States signed legislation creating the Santa
Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument. The new Monument encompasses
approximately 272,000 acres within the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains, with lands
administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS),
California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), the California Department of Parks and
Recreation, the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, and the Coachella Valley Mountains

Conservancy in cooperation with the county, adjacent cities and private owners. The National
Monument designation provides further protection and preservation of nationally significant
biological, cultural, recreational, geological, wilderness, educational, and scientific resources.
The benefits of the Monument designation include the enhanced potential for funding
opportunities, increased cooperative management between the federal land agencies, and
additional protection for the area's natural resources.
Willow Hole-Edom Hill Preserve
The Willow Hole-Edom Hill Preserve was established, as previously stated, to assist in
preserving the federally listed Coachella Valley Fringed-toed Lizard, in the northern planning
area of the City. The preserve, created through the implementation of the HCP for this species,
provides an important environment for blowsand endemic species, and has grown over time to
include 2,469 acres. Important biological resources found on the preserve include mesquite
hummocks, a fan palm oasis, and habitat for the Coachella Valley milk vetch, Little San
Bernardino Mountains gilia, Palm Springs ground squirrel, Palm Springs pocket mouse,
burrowing owl, crissal thrasher, and the Coachella Valley giant sand treader cricket. The
preserve is classified as an Area of Critical Concern (ACEC), with lands owned primarily by the
Bureau of Land Management.
Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan
The Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP), approved by
Riverside County and all Coachella Valley municipalities and with overall management by the
Coachella Valley Association of Governments (CVAG), contains principles, policies and
regional proposals to conserve the Coachella Valley's biological resources and protect biological
diversity on a regional scale. Within Cathedral City, MSHCP lies within the North City Specific
Plan area north of Interstate-10. The MSHCP is intended to balance environmental protection
and economic development objectives and simplify compliance with endangered species-related
laws.
The MSHCP's ecosystem approach recognizes the fragile and interconnected nature of biological
communities, and focuses on entire natural systems. The Coachella Valley MSHCP is intended
to provide a seamless network of adequate habitat for the protection and safekeeping of long-
term viable populations of the species that are currently listed as threatened or endangered.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan is a good opportunity for the
City of Cathedral City to work towards long-term protection of important biological resources.
Not only does the plan preserve important plant and animal species, it also establishes a regional
ecological system that will be able to support important and intact ecosystems and communities.
The City needs to find ways to make the built environment more harmonious with the natural
environment, and establish means for doing so. This can be achieved by implementing the
General Plan, and through thoughtful adoption of Zoning, Subdivision and Grading Ordinances.
The City also has the opportunity to regulate growth and limit impacts through community
planning and development regulation.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORIC
RESOURCES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Archaeological and Historic Resources Element is to set forth goals, policies,
and programs intended to preserve the cultural heritage and historic traditions of the City of
Cathedral City and its vicinity. It provides the basis for the identification and preservation of
these valuable resources. The Element also references other information sources that provide
detailed descriptions and evaluations of archaeological and historic resources within the General
Plan planning area.
For the purpose of this element, archaeological and historic resources are divided into three
separate discussions, prehistoric, historic and locally significant. These divisions are based on
time periods, and the differing cultures and events of those times. While they represent different
components of the City's history, they all are equally important to the preservation of the City’s
and Valley’s unique heritage.
BACKGROUND
The Archaeological and Historic Resources Element is directly related to several other General
Plan elements, including Biological Resources, Land Use, and Open Space and Conservation. It
may also influence the Community Image and Urban Design Element.
The issues addressed in the Archaeological and Historic Resources Element are some of those
identified in subdivision (b) of California Government Code Section 65560 and Public Resources
Code Section 5076. The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Section 21083.2(g),
also requires the City to document, or cause to be documented, cultural resources when the
potential for significant resources exists. The General Plan EIR contains a detailed discussion of
prehistoric and historic settlement in the Coachella Valley, as well as identification of significant
sites and features. The EIR also addresses potential impacts resulting from implementation of the
General Plan.
Cultural traditions and artifacts serve as important links between the past, present, and future.
They are an integral part of community life and provide a meaningful sense of heritage and
history. Numerous archaeological sites, established by Cahuilla Indians as early as 1500 years
ago, have been identified throughout the Coachella Valley. The region also contains important
historic features, including roads and trails, which were used by early European settlers
beginning in the late eighteenth century.

Eight structures in the planning area are listed in the California Office of Historic Preservation’s
Historic Property File for Riverside County. They were established during the early 1900’s, as
Cathedral City was beginning to define itself as a resort and residential community.
Prehistoric Times
The prehistoric period refers to the time prior to the arrival of non-Indians, when native lifestyles
and traditions remained essentially undisturbed, strong and viable. The prehistoric period in the
Coachella Valley is generally divided into the Late Prehistoric and Archaic Periods. The
transition between these two periods is generally considered to be around AD 1000, and is
identified by the introduction of ceramics into the region from the Colorado River cultures. For
this reason, the Archaic Period is generally referred to as the "pre-ceramic" period. Also
significant during prehistoric times was the introduction of the bow and arrow, approximately
around AD 500, and the change from burial practices to cremations, around 500 BC.
The Cahuilla
The Cahuilla people were the first known inhabitants that settled in the Coachella Valley.
According to archaeologists, the Cahuilla came from the north approximately 2,000 to 3,000
years ago. They are thought to have migrated south from the Great Basin region of Nevada,
Utah, and eastern California. The descent of these native peoples has been derived from
linguistic relationships, which has offered traces of their ancestral past. The Cahuilla belong to
the Uto-Aztecan language family, and are a Takic speaking people. Other people that belonged
to the Takic group are the Serrano, Luiseño, and Gabrieliño people, who are located within the
surrounding regions of southern California.
The Cahuilla are generally divided into three groups by anthropologists, according to their
geographic locations in the region; the Pass Cahuilla of the San Gorgonio Pass/Palm Springs
area; the Mountain Cahuilla of the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains and the Desert
Cahuilla of the eastern Coachella Valley. All three groups spoke the Cahuilla language, had
similar lifestyles and practiced the same traditions. The following discussion provides general
information on their environment, way of life and society, as well as historical and present day
information.
The Cahuilla and Their Environment
The range of the Cahuilla people today is in the same general location within the Coachella
Valley that was inhabited by their ancestors 2,000 to 3,000 years ago. The Coachella Valley
provided the people tall mountains, deep valleys, rocky canyons, passes and arid desert land for
sustenance, shelter and places to escape the heat or the cold. Many of the Desert Cahuilla lived
around ancient Lake Cahuilla, which was located where the Salton Sea is today, and at times
extended as far north as the City of La Quinta. Remains indicate that these people ate fish,
shellfish, water plants and birds as well as land animals and plants. However, when the lake
dried out around AD 1500, these people had to rely more heavily on the nearby hills and
mountains for water, food and shelter.
Plants were very valuable to the Cahuilla, as they provided the majority of materials necessary
for shelter, clothing, and tools, as well as the majority of the people's food. The most important
Cahuilla food plant was the mesquite tree, which offered blossoms and beans for sustenance.

Dried bean pods would be gound into a meal for cake or gruel, while the ripened pods were
crushed and made into a beverage. The Cahuilla also used over sixty different plants in their diet,
including cacti, agave, yucca, fan palm trees, pinyon trees and other seed or fruit producing
plants. In more recent times, the Cahuilla also grew crops of corn, squash, beans and melons,
which they acquired from the tribes of the Colorado River.
Although there was a great deal of emphasis on plant foods, many animals were also hunted and
trapped for food and other raw materials. Large game animals, including mule deer, mountain
sheep and pronghorn were favored because of the quantity of food and materials that could be
collected from them,. While they were hunted throughout the year, they were often hard and
dangerous to kill. For that reason, small game animals including squirrels, rabbits and mice
provided the bulk of the meat protein in the Cahuilla diet, because of their large numbers and
ease of capture. In addition to food, the large and small game also provided hides and fur for
blankets and clothes, as well as bones for tools and utensils.
Settlements and Manufactures
Cahuilla settlements usually were clustered around hand dug wells and water holes, and many
were near streams that flowed from canyons at the base of the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa
Mountains. Communities were permanent as long as water supplies lasted. Cahuilla dwellings
consisted of substantial rectangular structures with forked mesquite posts that held roof beams.
Along the sides and on the beam tops were arranged lengths of palm fronds and brush, which
were held in place by horizontal poles fastened to the thatches. On some houses the brush was
smeared with a coat of mud, and a layer of dirt was added to the roof. At the front of the house
was a porch, which was constructed like a house but walled only on the windward side.
Settlements also included a bathhouse that was framed with posts and poles, and built into a
shallow pit. The social and ceremonial leader occupied the dance house, which was forty feet in
diameter with walls of fitted boards and a palm-thatched roof. At the back of the house was a
room where the sacred bundle was kept, and at the front of the structure was a fenced enclosure.
                                        An aboriginal house stayed relatively cool even in the
                                        hottest weather, the inside staying dark, with natural light
                                        filtered in only through the doorway. Toward the center of
                                        the structure was a fireplace that was encircled by cooking
                                        pots. At the back of the
                                        house, blankets and
                                        animal skins served as
                                        mattresses. Attached to
                                        the roof beams were
                                        bundles of plants or
                                        dried meat for future
use. Most artifacts around a settlement were made from plant
fibers. Baskets of varied sizes and shapes were fashioned for
use as utensils and food storage containers. Inside the
settlements were grinding stones, which consisted of a concave
stone called metate and a smaller, hand held stone called a
mano.                                                                   Cahuilla Indian Baskets

Social Structure and Organization
The broadest level of social identification and organization for the Cahuilla was the overall group
of persons speaking the Cahuilla language and recognizing a commonly shared cultural heritage.
However, there is no indication that the Cahuilla as a whole united for any activity as a single
unit prior to European contact, but some organization did take place shortly after that time. The
Cahuilla culture was seen as distinct from other Takic speaking people, and cultural nationality
was determined by birth, language and socialization.
The next level of organization was the moiety, which was a social entity that had more precise
definitions of membership. The Cahuilla were divided into two moieties, the wildcats (Mukat)
and the coyotes (Tamaioit), which were important entities of Cahuilla mythology. Every Cahuilla
was a member of his or her father's moiety. The function of this division of social organization
was to regulate marriage and ritual reciprocity and continuity. The members of one moiety could
only marry a member of the opposite moiety. The moieties also served an economic and
ceremonial function at most Cahuilla rituals, at which inter-moiety cooperation was mandatory.
The ‘sib’ is the next unit of organization, and was composed of a number of lineages, varying
from three to ten. Each group was named and claimed a common ancestor to which all others
were related to varying degrees. The sib was a political unit, an economic-corporate unit, and a
ceremonial unit. The leader (net) of a sib directed subsistence activities, was the mediator in
intra-sib disputes, and was responsible for the correct performance of ceremonies. The sib also
united for the protection of its resources; when large communal hunting activities were
undertaken; or at times of impending or real disaster (floods, droughts or earthquakes).
The social organization of the Cahuilla had many adaptive and advantageous functions. The
moiety principle set up a reciprocal social system. It regulated marriage, requiring that each
Cahuilla lineage exchange women with another lineage of the opposite moiety. This helped to
ensure the expansion of economic and political alliances to several other groups. The lineage
principle defined group membership and food-
producing areas. The delineation of the groups within
geographical areas minimized the possibility of
conflict over food resources, and guaranteed that
food-producing areas were exclusively available to
particular groups of people.
Historic Changes in Cahuilla Life
The first Europeans to meet the Cahuillas were a
group of Spaniards who came to the territory in the
company of Indians from Mexico, under the direction
of Juan Bautista de Anza. In 1774, Anza and his men
set out to look for a good, easily passable land route
between the state of Sonora in Mexico and the
Monterey Peninsula of California, where one of the
earliest missions was established. However, because
the Valley was inland and isolated from Spanish

outposts, the Cahuilla at first had little contact with the Spanish soldiers, priests and civilians.
However, in the early 1800s, the Cahuilla began to hear more about mission life, and many
began visiting them and returning with new material goods. By 1819, several missions were
established, including those near San Bernardino, Santa Ysabel and Pala, and many Cahuilla
were learning to speak Spanish. In addition, the Cahuilla were learning European farming
techniques, raising cattle and using horses for farming, herding and transportation. Although the
Cahuilla were acquiring new skills and abilities from the Spanish, they used them only to
supplement their traditional practices. Despite all the changes that were brought by the Spanish,
the Cahuilla remained economically and politically independent.
In 1822, the Mexicans succeeded in driving the Spanish forces out of Mexico and California.
This change in power also brought change to the inland area. Mexicans began exploiting land for
agriculture and ranching, including Cahuilla land. Many of the Cahuillas began working as
skilled laborers on the ranches, and the Mexicans relied on them for ranch labor and
management. By 1848, the United States had gained control over California, and was taking up
much of the land. In the same year, gold was discovered and Americans began passing through
the area in increasing numbers on their way to the gold fields. They also began taking choice
hunting and food gathering lands, away from the Cahuillas. By the 1850s, the relationship
between the Cahuilla and the non-Indians had become tense. The non-Indians viewed Cahuilla
territory as desirable land, and conflicts arose over who had the right to own and use the land. In
1862 and 1863 a small pox epidemic killed many Cahuilla. The Cahuilla population, which had
been as high as 6,000 to 10,000, was diminished to only 2,500. The Cahuilla could no longer
make a strong stand against outsiders, whose populations in the area were growing rapidly.
In the late 1870s the first reservations were established for the Cahuilla people. These included
the Cahuilla, Torres-Martinez, Cabazon and Morongo reservations. However, land on these
reservations was not very well protected by the law, and many settlers continued to use Indian
land for themselves. Therefore in 1891, the Mission Indian Relief Act was enacted, which
formally established reservation land for the Indians of southern California. For Indians in and
around the Palm Springs and Cathedral City area, the act set aside 32,000 acres for reservation
land in a checkerboard pattern. While setting up reservations and defining boundaries, the Act
actually took land away from the Cahuilla. After the reservation act went into effect, the
Cahuillas were left with two-thirds of the land they had controlled prior to 1891. Reservation life
also changed Cahuilla traditions, more so than their first contact with the Spanish and the
Mexicans had. Traditional hunting and harvesting techniques were no longer sufficient to feed
people. Instead, Cahuillas became more reliant on farming, cattle ranching, land rentals, wage
labor and employment on the reservations.
Cahuilla Life in Present Times
Conflicts over land rights continued into more recent times. However, as more laws were enacted
the Cahuilla were able to adapt more efficiently to the changing times. In 1959 two bills passed
that helped to provide the Cahuillas with more economic stability. The equalization bill allotted
land to all tribe members who had not receive land allotments, and ensured that the allotments
were to be based on 1957-1958 appraised land values. The second bill provided that reservation
lands could be leased for a period not exceeding ninety-nine years. The first large enterprise on
leased land was the Palm Springs Spa Hotel complex. The spa was completed in 1960 at a cost

of $1.8 million. In the 1970s, a court decision found that Indians have control over the zoning of
their lands within a city. As a result, the City of Palm Springs and local Indian planning
commissions began to work together for mutual benefit. Similar arrangements have been
negotiated with both Cathedral City and Rancho Mirage.
In recent times, the Cahuilla have turned increasingly toward an emphasis on their heritage.
Cahuilla work as consultants to cultural anthropologists and on archaeology field crews. Efforts
are also being undertaken to preserve the Cahuilla language and other traditional aspects of their
culture. Consequently, the Agua Caliente Band have opened a museum that teaches about the
traditional lifestyles and practices of their ancestors, establishes a sense of roots for modern day
Cahuilla, and helps to revitalize their heritage.
Prehistoric Resources in the Planning Area
Several research methods were utilized to help identify archaeological resources in the planning
area. A records search was conducted at the Eastern Information Center (EIC), University of
California, Riverside. The EIC maintains records and maps of previously recorded
archaeological resources. For information on possible sites of Cahuilla traditional cultural value,
research was also done in the current scholarship on Cahuilla culture and history. A field
reconnaissance was also conducted to inspect the current conditions of previously recorded
properties.
According to the EIC, the Cathedral City area has not been extensively surveyed for cultural
resources. In all, less than one-third of the planning area has been covered by project-related
studies. The majority of the studies took place in the northern portion of the planning area on the
valley floor and in Indio Hills. In the southern portions of the planning area, several relatively
small-scale studies have taken place around Cathedral City's urban core and no archaeological
sites were recorded.
In the planning area, only one prehistoric site has been recorded into the California Historical
Resource Information System. This site consists of a rock ring feature. Members of the
Coachella Valley Archaeological Society report the presence of another prehistoric site in the
vicinity of Willow Hole, but the site has never been recorded. There are however, six locations
within, or in close proximity to the planning area that have been identified by Cahuilla cultural
authorities to be of potential cultural significance. Four of the six are found along the foot of the
San Jacinto Mountains, near the southern end of the planning area, while the fifth is situated in
the Whitewater River bed in the same general vicinity. All five of these locations are associated
with the various streams or canyons where water sources were available. The sixth location is
situated in the Edom Hill area, in the northwestern portion of the planning area. None of the six
sites are located on the valley floor. The six locations of cultural value are listed in the table
below. Sites are shown in Exhibit IV-8.

Given the above findings, certain locations within the planning area are regarded as highly
sensitive for prehistoric and archaeological sites. The foothills and canyons area along the base
of the Santa Rosa Mountains, and the mesquite dunes between Seven Palms Valley and Edom
Hill are highly sensitive for prehistoric archaeological resources. The balance of the planning
area on the valley floor, in contrast, contains a low sensitivity for prehistoric archaeological
resources (see also Exhibit IV-9).
Historic Period
The Historic Period in the Coachella Valley refers to the period of time of the first European
contact, which is around the late 1770's. This period ends about the time of World War II, and
therefore historic resources generally refer to significant sites that are more than forty-five years
of age. Historic resources and sites generally consist of structures or buildings, permanent trails
or highways.
History of the Coachella Valley
The primary route through the Coachella Valley was a trading route, known as the
Cocomaricopa Trail, which connected the coast to the Colorado River. The route, originally used
by the native peoples of the area, was used by early European explorers as early as 1815. In
1862, the Trail was rediscovered by William Bradshaw, and became known as the Bradshaw
Trail. It became the primary access between the Los Angeles basin and gold mines in Arizona,
until the completion of the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1877. The Bradshaw Trail was once
again used in the early 20th Century, to create a portion of the “Ocean to Ocean” highway. In the
Coachella Valley, Highway 111 today closely follows the Bradshaw Trail, known as East Palm
Canyon Drive in Cathedral City.
The Southern Pacific Railroad brought non-Indian settlement in the Coachella Valley in the
1870s, when stations were established, and spread further in the 1880s, after public land was
opened for claim under the Homestead Act, the Desert Land Act, and other federal land laws.
Traditionally, farming was the dominant economic basis in the valley, thanks in part to the
development of groundwater resources. In particular, the completion of the Coachella Canal in
1948-1949, provided an adequate and reliable water supply. The main agricultural staple in the
Coachella Valley was the date palm, which was first introduced around the turn of the century.
By the late 1910s, the date palm industry had firmly established itself. Starting in the 1920s, the
Coachella Valley developed a new industry that consisted of equestrian camps, resort hotels, and
eventually country clubs. This industry gradually spread throughout the Valley, transforming the
area to a very popular winter retreat.
Historic Resources in the Planning Area
In the early 1980s, the Riverside County Historical Commission commissioned a countywide
historical resources reconnaissance, which led to the recordation of eight historic-era buildings
within the planning area. All of these were located in Cathedral City's old downtown area, and
their construction dates ranged between the mid-1920s and the late 1930s.

Another historic building, located in the northern portion of the planning area has been added to
the California Historical Resource Information System since the original survey. It was a 1930s
highway service station on Varner Road, formerly a part of the original Ocean-to-Ocean
Highway. The site was reported to be in ruins at the time of its recordation. A field survey
performed in 2001 found that the majority of the buildings recorded during the 1980s survey
have been removed. All of the recorded historical sites are listed in the table below.

Locally Significant Resources
Because the City of Cathedral City is a relatively new community, the number of historical
resources is limited. However, the City does have some sites which are considered locally
significant, and worthy of protection. These sites are generally those that contribute to the City's
image, culture and integrity. This section focuses on local history and the development and
founding of Cathedral City.
The Founding of the City of Cathedral City
The City of Cathedral City was founded in 1925 by four developers, John Grove, George Allen,
Glenn Plumley and M.V. Van Fleet, whose names were given to some of the original streets in
the subdivison they created. The name of the town was derived from nearby Cathedral Canyon,
which had been known by that name since at least the turn of the century. Created to provide
affordable low-to moderate-income housing, the town was characterized by its narrow streets
lined by small and often odd-shaped lots, and became known as the "blue-collar neighbor" of
Palm Springs.
With the upgrading of present-day Highway 111 in 1927, several motels and restaurants were
constructed along the newly paved state highway. At that time the highway was known locally as
Broadway, and it formed the core of Cathedral City's downtown commercial district. During the

                                                                                                            IV-33
                                                                                      City of Cathedral City
                                                 General Plan/Archaeological and Historic Resources Element
1930s, the Cathedral City attracted Palm Springs visitors with the opening of two prominent
gambling casinos, the Dune Club and 139 Club.
The 1940s and the early 1950s marked a period of relatively rapid growth for Cathedral City.
During World War II, the town served as a bedroom community to the military installations
established in the vicinity as a part of the war effort. By the mid-1950s, residential development
had expanded from the original townsite southward into the cove area, westward along Highway
111, and northward to the Ramon Road corridor. The rural northern portion of the planning area
also saw significant growth in the early and mid-1950s. In this area, five-acre parcels were
patented by the U.S. government, under the so-called "Baby Homestead Act," to residents of the
Los Angeles basin who were looking for weekend retreats in southern California's desert.
During the post-WWII era, Cathedral City and the other cities along Highway 111 became the
fastest growing communities in the Coachella Valley, and began to play an increasingly
important role in the regional economy. In 1981, Cathedral City was incorporated as the 18th city
in Riverside County. With a population over 42,000, it is currently (2001) the third largest city in
the Coachella Valley.
Areas of Sensitivity for Historic Resources
Although the locations identified in Table IV-3 have been in many cases either lost or altered,
certain areas of the City can be considered sensitive for historic resources, parts of the City still
contain buildings dating back from the 1910s through the 1950s. These include the downtown
area, in the lettered streets; the Cree Road/Palm Valley School Road neighborhood, on the north
side of East Palm Canyon, at the western City limit; the area along 20th Avenue, in the northern
end of the planning area, which was used for ranching; and the Cove neighborhood and the
flatlands at Edom Hill and Flat top Mountain, which may contain 1950s era structures. Although
none of these areas contain sufficient coherent historic significance to be designated a historic
district, individual structures may prove to have significance. Exhibit IV-9 shows sensitivity
areas for historic cultural resources.
Historic Preservation Programs
Federal Programs
The National Park Service and the State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPO) of each state
administer the Certified Local Government (CLG) program, which allows local governments to
take a much more active role in historic and prehistoric preservation efforts in their communities.
Local governments must meet certain requirements to qualify as a CLG, including local
ordinances which establish systems and standards for the preservation of resources. CLGs can
also take advantage of technical assistance, professional assistance, and other state-wide
programs.
The National Register of Historic Places is maintained by the Secretary of the Interior. It
provides a national inventory of districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects and other features of
national, state or local significance. Properties eligible for listing must meet certain pre-defined
criteria. There are no properties within the planning area currently listed on the National
Register.

                                                General Plan/Archaeological and Historic Resources Element
A number of other federal statutes provide programs for the preservation of historic and
prehistoric resources, including tax credits for the certified rehabilitation of historic buildings,
Community Development Block Grants, and the historic building reservation program which is
part of the Transportation Equity Act of 1998.
State Programs
The State Office of Historic Preservation manages California’s CLG program, as described
above, and provides a number of services to participating local governments. In addition, the
state established the California Register of Historical Resources in 1992, which is California’s
equivalent to the National Register. Two other registers are managed by the Office of Historic
Preservation – the California Historical Landmarks register, which identifies properties of
statewide historic importance; and the Points of Historical Interest register, which inventories
properties of regional importance. Properties which are listed on these registers are eligible for
property tax reductions, benefits provided by the California Heritage Fund, alternative building
regulations under the Historic Building Code, seismic retrofit tax credits, and historic
preservation bond measures. There are no properties in Cathedral City on either register at this
time.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The lack of identified and recorded resources in Cathedral City does not mean that the City is
devoid of these resources. The City’s modest beginnings may not have resulted in the high
profile development of resort hotels and “movie star hangouts” which have been well
documented elsewhere in the Valley, but the City’s history is no less significant. Structures and
properties within the City may bear preserving, and must be identified early in the development
process.
The City of Cathedral City has a rich and interesting history that provides a meaningful sense of
heritage to residents and visitors. As the city continues to grow and develop, every effort should
be made to identify and preserve the artifacts, places and resources, which have a relation to the
City's history. Although many historic structures have already been lost, the City should search
for ways to revitalize its past. Furthermore, many present day structures, resources and traditions
play a role in the City's cultural values. These resources should be identified and preserved as
well for their importance to the City.

WATER RESOURCES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Water Resources Element is to address issues pertaining to water quantity,
quality and availability for current and future City needs. An important aspect of this element is
the coordination and cooperation between the City, Coachella Valley Water District, Desert
Water Agency and other agencies responsible for supplying water to the area. The element also
addresses water consumption trends in the Coachella Valley, groundwater recharge, recycled
water and wastewater treatment, and their increasingly important roles in groundwater
management. The goals, policies and programs set forth in this element direct City staff and
officials in the management of this essential resource.
BACKGROUND
This element is directly related to the Flooding and Hydrology Element, as both address the
protection and recharge of groundwater resources; and to the Land Use Element, which
potentially directly affects the need for water in the City. Water resource issues are also
important components of the Emergency Preparedness, Community Design, Economic
Development and Water, Sewer and Utilities Elements of this General Plan.
The Water Resources Element incorporates the requirements of California Government Code
Section 65302(d). Also, the Element implements Section 21083.2(g) of the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), which empowers the community to require that adequate
research and documentation be conducted when the potential for significant impacts to water and
other important resources exists.
DOMESTIC WATER RESOURCES
Native Americans in the Coachella Valley were restricted to the direct use and diversion of
streams in mountain canyons, the digging of wells to intercept underground aquifers in Indian
Wells, and the exploitation of artesian wells along the Banning and Mission Creek Branches of
the San Andreas Fault system near Desert Hot Springs for their water.
It was not until the twentieth century that the enormous extent of the groundwater basin
underlying the Coachella Valley was recognized. Analysis of groundwater repositories by the
U.S. Geological Survey and the California Department of Water Resources has determined that
the subsurface aquifer is separated into distinct subbasins, which are further divided into
subareas.

The boundaries between these structures are generally defined by fault barriers, constrictions in
basin profiles, and the unique hydrologic characteristics of each subbasin or subarea. Underlying
sands, gravels and other water-bearing fill have eroded from surrounding mountains into the
fault-controlled valley floor. The first 1,000 feet of these eroded materials comprise a storage
capacity of more than 39 million acre-feet (one acre-foot equals about 326,000 gallons).
The Desert Water Agency (DWA) and the Coachella Valley Water District (CVWD) are
responsible for providing domestic water to the General Plan planning area. Development east
and north of the Whitewater River occurs within the service boundaries of CVWD, and
development west and south of the river occurs within the service boundaries of DWA. These
agencies utilize wells to extract groundwater from the Whitewater River subbasin, which
underlies most of the planning area (lands within the Indio Hills and the Santa Rosa Mountains
are not underlain by any groundwater basins due to the non-water bearing composition of these
mountains).
Whitewater River Subbasin
The Whitewater River subbasin is the primary groundwater repository for the Coachella Valley
and the City of Cathedral City. Encompassing a major portion of the valley floor, it covers
approximately 400 square miles and extends from the junction of Interstate-10 and State
Highway 111, to the Salton Sea about 70 miles to the southeast.
The subbasin is divided into four distinct subareas, including the Palm Springs, Thermal,
Thousand Palms and Oasis subareas. The Palm Springs subarea underlies most of the City,
including lands generally located west of Date Palm Drive. Lands generally east of Date Palm
Drive are underlain by the upper Thermal subarea. The northernmost portion of the planning
area, including lands north of Interstate-10 and south of the Indio Hills, is underlain by the
Thousand Palms subarea. CVWD’s Management Area, which includes all the subareas
underlying the planning area, has an estimated storage capacity of 11 million acre-feet.
The Palm Springs subarea contains approximately 4.6 million acre-feet of groundwater in
storage in the first 1,000 feet below the ground surface. The subarea is largely comprised of
alluvial fan deposits exceeding 1,000 feet in depth. The subarea is naturally recharged by
infiltration of runoff from the San Jacinto Mountains and the Whitewater River, and from
subsurface inflow from the San Gorgonio Pass subbasin to the west.
The Thermal subarea extends from eastern Cathedral City, south to the Salton Sea. It contains
approximately 19.4 million acre-feet of groundwater in storage in the first 1,000 feet below the
ground surface, and is characterized by confined or semi-confined groundwater conditions, with
free moving water conditions in alluvial fans at the base of the Santa Rosa Mountains. CVWD
well logs have identified two aquifer zones in the Thermal subarea. The lower aquifer zone is
estimated to be at least 500 feet and possibly more than 1,000 feet thick, and is composed of
Ocotillo conglomerate, which consists of gravels and silty sands interbedded with silt and clay.
The upper aquifer zone, under which Cathedral City occurs, is similar in composition to the
lower aquifer zone, but is not as thick. An aquitard layer, composed of fine-grained materials that
slow the vertical flow of groundwater, separates the upper and lower aquifer zones and is
estimated to be between 100 and 200 feet thick throughout much of the Thermal subarea.

The Thousand Palms subarea contains approximately 1.8 million acre-feet of groundwater in
storage in the first 1,000 feet below the ground surface. It extends along the southerly edge of the
Indio Hills and is small in comparison to the Thermal subarea. Its southwesterly boundary has
been determined based on its distinctive groundwater chemical characteristics. Water in the
Thousand Palms subarea is characterized by high concentrations of sodium sulfate, while water
in other subareas of the Whitewater River subbasin is generally characterized by calcium
bicarbonate. This is largely attributed to limited recharge to the Thousand Palms subarea. The
subarea is recharged by limited runoff from the Indio Hills and experiences little, if any, inflow
from other subareas or subbasins. Since there is little opportunity for intermixing or “dilution” by
water of different chemical compositions, the native sodium sulfate is present in greater
concentrations in the Thousand Palms subarea.
Mission Creek Subbasin
In the northern portion of the City and Sphere of Influence, north of Interstate 10, is the Mission
Creek subbasin. It extends from the Mission Creek to the Banning Faults on the north and south,
and from the San Bernardino Mountains to Edom Hill. Groundwater flows in a southeasterly
direction within the basin, which has a storage capacity of about 2.6 million acre feet, and is
estimated to have recoverable water in the range of about 1 million acre feet.
Water Demand in the Coachella Valley
CVWD estimates that, within the first 1,000 feet below the ground surface, there are
approximately 28.8 million acre-feet of groundwater in storage in the Whitewater River subbasin
and about 39.2 million acre-feet in all subbasins underlying the Coachella Valley. Nonetheless,
since the expansion of agricultural activities in the early 1900s, and the emergence of the
Coachella Valley as a destination resort area with lushly landscaped golf courses and residential
communities, depletion of the groundwater in storage has continued steadily.
Continued development in the City and Coachella Valley will result in proportionate increases in
the demand for domestic water. CVWD estimates that, of all water “produced” (used) in the
valley, 60% is permanently “lost” to consumption, and 40% is reintroduced into the groundwater

table for later use, including a percentage of irrigation water applied to residential and golf
course landscaping. CVWD estimates that the per capita water consumption rate in its Coachella
Valley service area is approximately 550 gallons per day. This is an aggregate figure that
accounts for all water uses in the community, including residential, commercial, industrial, golf
course, irrigation and other uses, and is not intended to represent a specific land use. Project-
specific consumption rates may be more or less depending on the type and density of
development and the extent of water-intensive amenities (such as types of landscaping, fountains
and swimming pools) incorporated into each project.
Groundwater pumped from the Upper Coachella Valley (generally extending from Whitewater to
Palm Desert) is typically used for domestic purposes and golf course irrigation. Water pumped
from the Lower Coachella Valley (generally extending from La Quinta to the Salton Sea) is
primarily used for domestic purposes and the irrigation of approximately 72,800 acres of
agricultural lands. As described in CVWD’s “Coachella Valley Draft Water Management Plan”
(November 2000), total water demand in the region increased substantially during the twentieth
century, from 96,300 acre-feet per year in 1936 to 668,900 acre-feet per year in 1999. The
following table summarizes the major water consumers and demand rates during this period.

Overdraft Conditions
The historical depletion of groundwater in the Coachella Valley has resulted in a condition
known as overdraft, in which the demand for groundwater exceeds the amount of recharge into
the groundwater basin. CVWD well monitoring data indicate that from the 1950s to 1970s, water
levels in the Upper Coachella Valley decreased by approximately 50 to 100 feet. From the 1920s
to the 1950s, water levels in the Lower Coachella Valley decreased by approximately 50 feet.
They leveled off somewhat after 1949, following the introduction of Colorado River water for
irrigation in 1949. However, by the 1980s, water levels in the Lower Valley continued to decline,
a trend that continues to the present day. Overdraft can result in significant adverse social,
environmental and economic impacts, including the increased potential for land subsidence,
increased infrastructure and energy costs associated with drilling deeper wells and installing
larger pumps, and the threat of a diminishing long-term water supply.

To determine the extent of overdraft in the Coachella Valley, CVWD has compared the change
in freshwater storage in the groundwater subbasins over time. The change in freshwater storage
is the difference between inflows and outflows of the basin, excluding inflows of poor quality
water from the Salton Sea and irrigation flows that are induced by overdraft conditions.
In 1999, the change in freshwater storage in the Coachella Valley was estimated at 136,700 acre-
feet per year. This amount of groundwater was being withdrawn from the basin per year, but was
not being replaced. Of this, approximately 32,400 acre-feet were overdrawn from the Upper
Coachella Valley, and 104,300 acre-feet were overdrawn from the Lower Coachella Valley.
From 1936 to 1999, the cumulative change in freshwater storage was estimated at nearly 4.7
million acre-feet. The table below illustrates the relative imbalance between inflows and
outflows in the Coachella Valley.

The upper Whitewater River subbasin, in particular, has been characterized by historically
significant declining water table conditions. To more effectively manage this area, CVWD and
DWA have designated it as a “Management Area” and have carefully monitored its inflow and
outflow rates. The Management Area consists of the Palm Springs and Thousand Palms subareas
of the Whitewater River subbasin, and that portion of the Thermal subarea experiencing a
significantly declining water table. All of these subareas underlie, to some extent, the Cathedral
City General Plan planning area. Within the Management Area, overdraft is estimated at 35,621
acre-feet per year, or 0.32% per year.
Primary Water Sources
The principal water source for the Coachella Valley is groundwater, which is naturally recharged
by precipitation and runoff from the San Jacinto, Santa Rosa and San Bernardino Mountains.
Surface water from the Whitewater River and the Snow, Falls and Chino Creeks also constitutes
an important source of water, although annual supplies are highly variable due to fluctuations in
annual precipitation. Other important regional water sources include recycled water from

wastewater treatment plants in the Coachella Valley, and imported Colorado River water, both of
which are discussed below.
Groundwater Replenishment
To meet anticipated regional demand for domestic water, CVWD and DWA have contracted for
State Water Project (SWP) water to supplement groundwater resources. The agreement entitles
CVWD and DWA to supplemental water, which would be transported from northern California
to the Coachella Valley via the Coachella Aqueduct. However, due to the extraordinary costs
associated with the construction of such a project, the aqueduct has not yet been built.
Until the water delivery system is constructed, CVWD and DWA have entered into an agreement
with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD). The contract allows
CVWD and DWA to exchange their SWP entitlements for like amounts of Colorado River
water, which is transported to the Coachella Valley via MWD’s Colorado River Aqueduct. The
aqueduct passes through the northern portion of the valley, and is tapped where it crosses the
Whitewater River. Exchange water is then diverted to a series of spreading ponds near
Whitewater, where it percolates to replenish groundwater supplies. A substantial amount of
Colorado River water is also transported to the lower valley via the Coachella Branch of the All-
American Canal. This represents an important source of water for approximately 72,800 acres of
agricultural lands, as well as fish farms, commercial greenhouses, and waterfowl migration
ponds.
Since the inception of the artificial recharge program in 1973, more than 1.7 million acre-feet (or
approximately 50,000 acre-feet per year) of Colorado River water has been diverted to recharge
the Whitewater River subbasin. Temporary halts or severe reductions in recharge waters are
necessary when there has been inadequate rainfall or snowfall in the western Sierras.
Despite the addition of recharge waters to the groundwater subbasins, groundwater levels in the
Coachella Valley continue to decline. CVWD has sought additional methods of assuring an on-
going supply of domestic water, including increasing its Colorado River water entitlements. The
Seven Party Agreement of 1931 divides California’s share of Colorado River water among seven
California agencies, including CVWD. According to the agreement, CVWD and the Imperial
Irrigation District (IID), which provides domestic water to other communities in the Coachella
Valley, share the third priority for Colorado River water. However, IID has the first option to
take as much third party water as it can put to reasonable and beneficial use within its service
area. A new tentative agreement, the Quantification Settlement Agreement, has been drafted
between CVWD, IID and MWD. It proposes that an average of approximately 456,000 acre-feet
per year of Colorado River water be made available to CVWD throughout the 75 year life of the
agreement; which would provide CVWD with reasonable assurances of supplemental water.
Formal approval of the agreement is pending (2001).
Wastewater Reclamation and Recycling
CVWD and DWA have implemented programs to allow tertiary (third stage) treated wastewater
to irrigate golf courses, municipal greenbelts and other landscaped areas. Wastewater typically
undergoes two stages of treatment before being released to percolation ponds and being
reintroduced into the groundwater table.

Tertiary treated water undergoes a third level of treatment which makes it useable for irrigation
of landscaping and golf courses. In the Lower Valley, recycled effluent from fish farms has also
been used for agricultural irrigation, bird migration ponds and fish farms.
The Cook Street Wastewater Reclamation Plant, owned and operated by CVWD, which serves
development in Cathedral City, is capable of generating tertiary treated water. This plant has a
tertiary water capacity of 10 million gallons per day (mgd) and is expected to undergo expansion
to 15 mgd within the next few years.
The use of recycled water for irrigation has been effective in reducing the demand for
groundwater resources. In 1999, approximately 4% of the water demanded by development in
the Upper Coachella Valley consisted of recycled water.
WATER QUALITY
Water quality in the Coachella Valley is generally good to excellent. Exceptions are primarily
limited to perched and semi-perched water tables occurring in the lower valley, where on-going
crop irrigation has increased total dissolved solids. Groundwater quality can be affected by a
number of things, including the type of water-bearing materials in which the water occurs, water
depth, proximity to faults, and presence of surface contaminants.
As discussed in CVWD’s “Coachella Valley Draft Water Management Plan” (November 2000),
historical data indicate that the amount of total dissolved solids (TDS), salts and nitrates have
increased throughout the Coachella Valley groundwater basin during the past century. During the
1930s, TDS concentrations in the upper aquifer of the Coachella Valley groundwater basin were
typically less than 250 milligrams per liter (mg/L). By the 1970s, TDS concentrations averaged
300 mg/L, and they have risen to a current average of about 540 mg/L.
High TDS concentrations are typically detected near major faults, and have been observed along
the San Andreas fault system. In the vicinity of the fault zone separating the Thousand Palms
subarea from the Thermal subarea, for example, TDS concentrations have exceeded 1,000 mg/L.
However, other evidence indicates that high TDS concentrations may also be associated with the
importation of Colorado River water, which is about three times higher in total dissolved solids
than natural upper Whitewater River groundwater. The following table illustrates the relative
quality of surface water recharging the subbasin, including that imported from the Colorado
River.

Salts have also been added to the groundwater basin through the importation of recharge water,
as well as through natural recharge processes, wastewater percolation, the application of
fertilizers, and intrusion of the Salton Sea into the groundwater basin. CVWD estimates that the
quantity of salts added to the groundwater basin increased from approximately 12,000 tons per
year in 1936, to about 265,000 tons per year in 1999. The majority of salts (65%) come from the
lower valley, where agriculture predominates. Salt removal can be accomplished via agricultural
drains that drain directly into the Salton Sea, and the Coachella Valley Stormwater Channel,
which isolates agricultural drainage and fish farm effluent.
Nitrate concentrations in the groundwater basin have also increased over the past century.
CVWD data indicates that nitrate concentrations in the Coachella Valley’s groundwater
increased from less than 4 mg/L in the 1930s, to more than 45 mg/L in wells adjacent to the
Whitewater River in the 1970s. According to the California Department of Water Resources,
these increases are most likely related to the application of fertilizers on agricultural lands and
golf courses, and effluent from septic tanks and wastewater treatment plants.
Other agencies have also acknowledged that septic tanks have the potential to adversely impact
groundwater supplies. The greatest impacts to water quality are expected to occur where septic
systems serve relatively large populations in high densities, and where these systems are old or
poorly maintained. Community sewer systems provide excellent protection for groundwater
supplies, as they provide for the swift removal, disposal and treatment of wastewater.
WATER QUALITY LEGISLATION
To assure adequate planning, implementation and enforcement of water quality control efforts, a
variety of state and federal legislation has been enacted, including the federal Clean Water Act
and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and California statutes and administrative
laws such as the California Water Code, California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA),
California Code of Regulations, and other legislation including the Health and Safety Code, Fish
and Game Code, and Public Resources Code.

CALIFORNIA REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB) is responsible for
implementing state and federal laws pertaining to water quality, including enforcing penalties for
noncompliance in the control of water quality. In the Coachella Valley, the CRWQCB primarily
deals with agricultural drainage, impacts of geothermal power, and concerns about the Salton
Sea, Tahquitz Creek and other sources of surface water. It also monitors leaking fuel storage
tanks, illegal discharges of human or animal waste, and the inappropriate disposal of hazardous
and toxic materials.
NATIONAL POLLUTANT DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM
The City of Cathedral City participates in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES), which implements the federal Clean Water Act. The NPDES mandates the
development and implementation of plans and programs for storm water management that
effectively prohibit non-storm water discharge into storm drains, and require controls to reduce
the discharge of pollutants from storm water systems into waters of the United States. NPDES
plans are exempt from the CEQA analysis process. The Clean Water Act also requires that all
point sources discharging pollutants directly into waters of the United States obtain an NPDES
permit, which specifies limits on what can be discharged, monitoring and reporting requirements,
and other provisions that assure discharge does not adversely impact water quality or human
health.
WATER CONSERVATION
Water conservation is essential as both a short-term and long-term resource management
strategy. One of the best opportunities for municipal water conservation is the use of water-
efficient landscaping treatments, including drought-tolerant plant materials and irrigation
systems that minimize runoff and evaporation while maximizing watering of plant roots.
Fortunately, City residents have shown an appreciation for the native desert environment and the
opportunities it provides to reduce the use of water-dependent turf.
The City has incorporated water-conserving landscape and irrigation principles into its
Development Design Guidelines. The guidelines require that new landscape plans be designed to
incorporate native and locally compatible planting materials, and that large expanses of lawn and
grass be avoided. The document refers developers and related parties to the landscaping and
irrigation guidelines published by CVWD, and recommends that developers contact CVWD
and/or DWA staff for further consultation. The City has also adopted a Street Tree Policy, which
identifies a wide range of trees appropriate for the desert environment and requires that trees be
irrigated with low-flow, automatically timed irrigation systems designed for water conservation.
In accordance with state law, the City also requires the installation of low-flush toilets and low-
flow faucets and showerheads in new construction.
To further reduce the impacts of development on groundwater supplies, CVWD and DWA have
also adopted a wide range of water conservation programs, including water audits that identify
wasteful water usage and provide recommendations for greater efficiency. The agencies provide

public educational programs, workshops and publication, which explain the environmental and
economic benefits of water conservation. To demonstrate the appropriate usage of native plants
and the most water-efficient irrigation techniques available, CVWD maintains two xeriscape
demonstration gardens. Finally, as stated above, the use of reclaimed water for landscaping
irrigation also helps to conserve the area’s water resource.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The wise use and conservation of water resources will continue to be a central theme of
community development planning in southern California. Cathedral City plays an important role
in the long-term protection of this valuable resource. The city and local water agencies have
developed programs intended to increase the use of efficient landscape and irrigation design,
water efficient appliances and fixtures, and recycled water. Effective storm water management
programs and the protection of local mountain watersheds will also assure preservation of a
viable source of groundwater. The City must continue to work closely with neighboring
communities and local water purveyors to assure a healthful, long-term supply of water.

AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
PURPOSE
It is the intent of the Air Quality Element to provide background information on the physical and
regulatory environment affecting air quality in the City and the region. The element also
identifies goals, policies and programs that are meant to balance the City’s actions regarding land
use, circulation and other civic issues with their potential effects on air quality. This element and
local and regional air quality planning efforts are intended to address ambient air quality
standards set forth by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air
Resources Board (CARB).
BACKGROUND
The Air Quality Element is directly related to the Land Use Element in its association with land
use types and intensities. This Element is also related to the number, length, and timing of traffic
trips, which are discussed in greater detail in the Circulation Element, as well as the amount of
open space planned for preservation in the Open Space and Conservation Element. The
Economic Development Element, which addresses the protection of natural resources important
to the local economy, is also related to issues of air quality.
Air quality is a major concern in southern California, largely because of the potentially
significant health effects and property damage caused by air pollutants. Concerns over air
pollution have led to state and federal legislation mandating regional plans to improve air
quality. In 1988, the State Legislature enacted Assembly Bill 2595, which became known as the
California Clean Air Act (CCAA). The purpose of this action was to protect the future health and
welfare of the people of the State of California and protection of the State’s environment and
economy, regardless of federal government actions or policy directions. The California Air
Resources Board has been entrusted as an overseer of the CCAA and advises and evaluates the
efforts made by regional air pollution control agencies and districts regarding compliance with
the requirements of the California Clean Air Act.
The federal Clean Air Act (CAA) is intended to ensure that all Americans have the same basic
health and environmental protections with regard to air quality. The Act was last amended in
1990 and is enforced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The CAA
establishes minimum air pollution standards that must be met, but allows states to enact and
enforce stronger standards; the US EPA delegates much of the responsibility for carrying out the
CAA to state air pollution agencies. State Implementation Plans (SIPs) are developed for areas
out of compliance with federal standards, and are designed to meet ambient air quality standards
and deadlines specified in the federal Clean Air Act and emission reduction targets of the
California Clean Air Act. Required emission reductions and attainment deadlines are based on
the severity of the region’s air pollution.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                                Air Quality Element

The City of Cathedral City is located within the Salton Sea Air Basin (SSAB), a geographic
region whose air quality and pollution control actions are regulated and monitored by the South
Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). The SCAQMD is responsible for the
development of the regional Air Quality Management Plan, a multi-tier effort to regulate
pollutant emissions from a variety of sources.
Cathedral City is also involved in regional management of air quality through various actions
taken by the Coachella Valley Association of Governments (CVAG) and the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG). The City has adopted its own Fugitive Dust Emissions
Ordinance to further local control of excessive fugitive dust and other particulate emissions,
especially those associated with urban development.
Criteria Pollutants
Criteria pollutants are those air pollutants for which federal and state air quality standards exist
and include ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, suspended particulate
matter (PM10) and lead. Each of these pollutants is briefly described below.
Ozone (O3) is formed when byproducts of the internal combustion engine react in the presence of
ultraviolet sunlight. Ozone is a pungent, colorless, toxic gas commonly referred to as smog.
Motor vehicles are the major source of ozone precursors, and conditions in the Coachella Valley
are occasionally well suited for the formation of photochemical smog. Excessive exposure to
ozone can result in diminished breathing capacity, increased sensitivity to infections, and
inflammation of the lung tissue.
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a reddish-brown gas that results from a combination of nitric oxide
and oxygen. The primary sources of nitrogen dioxide in the Coachella Valley are the incomplete
combustion of motor vehicle engines, power plants, and other industrial operations. Short-term
exposure to nitrogen dioxide can result in airway constriction in healthy individuals and
diminished lung capacity in individuals with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Sulfur dioxide is a colorless, extremely irritating gas that results from the combustion of high-
sulfur content fuels, such as coal and oil. Sources of sulfur dioxide include fuel combustion of
motor vehicles, chemical plants and sulfur recovery plants. Short-term exposure to sulfur dioxide
can result in airway constriction and severe breathing difficulties in asthmatics, as well as lung
tissue damage and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, toxic gas largely caused by the incomplete
combustion of fossil fuels in motor vehicles. In high concentrations, carbon monoxide can
contribute to the development of heart disease, anemia and impaired psychological behavior.
Suspended Particulate Matter consists of fine suspended particles, such as soil and mineral dust,
soot and smoke, and aerosols, many of which are byproducts of fuel combustion, tire wear and

fragmentation, but can also be produced by sand deposited on road surfaces and ground into finer
particles by motor vehicles. Fine particulate matter poses a significant threat to public health.
Elevated PM10 levels are associated with an increase in respiratory infections and occurrences of
asthma attacks. PM10 is currently (2001) the most serious air pollutant in the City and the
Coachella Valley region.
Lead (Pb) occurs in the atmosphere as particulate matter resulting from leaded gasoline and the
manufacturing of batteries, paint, ink and ammunition. The elimination of leaded gasoline in
recent years has reduced the hazards associated with airborne lead. However, excessive exposure
to lead can lead to anemia, kidney disease, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and neuromuscular and
neurological disorders.
Ambient Air Quality Standards
Both the federal and California governments have established air quality standards for the
criteria pollutants described above. The standards are designed to protect that segment of the
population that is most susceptible to respiratory distress or infection, including asthmatics, the
elderly, children, and those who are weak from disease or illness. In general, state standards are
more restrictive than federal standards, particularly with the regard to PM10 and sulfur dioxide. A
comparison of state and federal ambient air quality standards is provided in the following table.

To determine whether existing ambient air quality complies with the standards shown above, the
South Coast Air Quality Management District operates and maintains regional air quality
monitoring stations throughout its jurisdiction. The City of Cathedral City is located within
Source Receptor Area (SRA) 30, which includes monitoring stations at the Palm Springs
International Airport and in the City of Indio. These stations monitor contaminant levels and
meteorological conditions on a daily basis.

Sensitive Receptors
Sensitive receptors are those persons or land uses that may be subject to respiratory stress and/or
significant adverse impact as a result of exposure to air contaminants. The California Air
Resources Board has indicated that the following segments of the population should be
considered sensitive receptors: children under 14, seniors over 65, athletes, and people with
cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases. Sensitive land uses include hospitals, nursing
and retirement homes, schools, playgrounds, parks, athletic facilities, and residential and
transient lodging facilities.
Regional Climate and Meteorology
The air quality of a particular locale is a function of the amount of pollutants emitted and
dispersed and the climatic, meteorologic, and geophysical conditions that reduce or enhance the
formation of pollutants. The Coachella Valley is a low-lying desert basin characterized by low
annual rainfall and low humidity. The valley is surrounded on the north, west and south by
mountain ranges that physically isolate the region from coastal influences. Temperatures can
exceed 120°F in summer months.
The valley is occasionally susceptible to air inversions, in which a layer of stagnant air is trapped
near the ground where it is further loaded with pollutants. This process, when combined with
chemical aerosols and other pollutants emitted by automobiles, furnaces and other sources, can
result in substantial haziness. Heat and bright sunshine can further act on this mix of pollutants to
create photochemical smog.
Wind direction and speed are also important climatological components that affect air quality in
the Coachella Valley. The valley is subject to strong and sustained winds. Each year, winter rains
cause erosion of the adjacent mountains, and water runoff produces and sorts substantial deposits
of gravel and sand throughout the major drainage areas in the valley. These materials can
become suspended in the air during strong wind events.
As the desert floor heats up in the spring months, it draws cooler coastal air masses from the
narrow San Gorgonio Pass to the southeast, generating strong winds that cross the most erosive
areas of the valley.
Most of the land within Cathedral City’s incorporated boundaries is located within the “Active
Blowsand Hazard Zone” designated by CVAG in the 1990 “State Implementation Plan for PM10
in the Coachella Valley.” This zone identifies land that, based on location or soil characteristics,
is subject to soil wind erosion, or to potential sand accumulation and/or abrasion.
These winds transport and deposit large quantities of sand and dust on buildings, fabrics and
automobiles, thereby reducing visibility and damaging property. Extensive wind-borne soil can
dirty streets, pit windshields and obliterate landscaping. Dust on vegetation can interfere with
plant respiration and stunt plant growth. The adverse health effects in humans can be severe, and
include reduced lung capacity and functioning.

Regional Pollutants of Concern
Analysis of the ambient air quality data collected at the Palm Springs and Indio monitoring
stations indicates that ozone and PM10 are the most prevalent air pollutants in the Coachella
Valley.
Ozone
The Coachella Valley has a history of exceeding state and federal ozone standards, and is
currently designated as a “severe-17” ozone non-attainment area under the federal Clean Air Act.
This designation means that the area must comply with federal ozone air quality standards by
November 15, 2007, which is 17 years from the date the Clean Air Act was enacted.
Although some of the Coachella Valley’s ozone is generated by motor vehicles and other local
sources, the valley’s poor ozone quality is largely due to the transport of both ozone and its
precursor emissions from the upwind South Coast Air Basin to the west. An analysis of ozone
trends since 1976, from SCAQMD’s 1994 “Air Quality Management Plan for the Coachella-San
Jacinto Planning Area,” indicates a parallel downward trend in the number of days exceeding the
federal 1-hour ozone standard for both the South Coast Air Basin and the Coachella-San Jacinto
Planning Area. This downward trend has occurred despite the fact that population growth in the
Coachella-San Jacinto Planning Area was about 3% greater per year than that of the South Coast
Air Basin. Although it is difficult to quantify the total amount of ozone pollutant that is
contributed from other regions, improved air quality in the Coachella Valley is partly dependent
upon reduced ozone emissions in the South Coast Air Basin.
PM10 Emissions
The Coachella Valley also has a history of elevated PM10 emissions, which are the result of both
man-made activities (including vehicle use and construction activity) and natural occurrences,
such as windstorms. In 1990, the SCAQMD adopted the “State Implementation Plan for PM10 in
the Coachella Valley,” (90-CVSIP) which identified “reasonably available control measures” for
PM10, and established a future attainment date for areas previously unable to meet federal PM10
standards.
In 1993, the EPA reclassified the Coachella Valley from a “moderate” to a “serious” non-
attainment area for PM10. In response, CVAG and its member cities have worked closely to
implement the measures set forth in the 90-CVSIP, including the adoption of city-based dust
control ordinances, street sweeping programs, and the use of chemical stabilizers, wind/sand
fencing, site watering techniques and landscape treatments designed to reduce local fugitive dust
emissions.
The City of Cathedral City adopted its own Fugitive Dust Emissions Ordinance, which sets forth
requirements for the control of dust during construction and demolition activities, as well as on
certain land uses, such as unpaved roads and parking lots. In addition, the City secured grant
funding to purchase alternative fuel vehicles and establish of a compressed natural gas (CNG)
fueling station to service its vehicle fleet.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                            Air Quality Element
                                                                                               IV-55

                                                                                   City of Cathedral City
                                                                        General Plan/Air Quality Element
Although the Coachella Valley achieved federal PM10 standards in 1996, “attainment status”
requires that the region achieve these standards for three consecutive years. In 1999, federal
PM10 standards were exceeded once again. The region continues to be designated a “serious”
non-attainment area for PM10, with construction activity representing the most significant source
of fugitive dust emissions.
In an effort to remedy this situation, the SCAQMD recently developed “Guidelines for Dust
Control Plan Review in the Coachella Valley,” which is intended to supplement local dust
control ordinances. Should the region continue to fall short of federal PM10 standards, the U.S.
EPA could impose more stringent regulations or sanctions on local jurisdictions.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
It is the responsibility of the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and the
City, with the cooperation and coordination of Coachella Valley Association of Governments
(CVAG), to monitor pollutant levels to regulate and control air pollutant emissions. The City has
actively and effectively taken steps to control and improve air quality in the community. With
continuing conditions that facilitate the generation of fugitive dust and other pollutants, clearly
more needs to be done to effectively control and improve local air quality.
Issues of air quality are also addressed in California Government Code Section 65302(b), which
requires that existing transportation-related air quality impacts and trends also are addressed. The
General Plan EIR quantifies potential air pollutant emissions associated with the buildout of the
community, including emissions associated with community traffic. Additionally, the California
Clean Air Act (Assembly Bill 2595) requires the development of air quality policies and
programs to protect and preserve the environment and general public from the harmful effects of
air pollutants.

OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION
ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Open Space and Conservation Element is to provide guidance for the
management and preservation of open space lands and natural resources, including water
resources, wildlife habitat and scenic resources. Conservation of natural resources and the
provision and preservation of open space lands are important and necessary to maintaining a
balanced and healthy community. As urban growth continues in the City, thoughtful planning
and resource management becomes increasingly important in helping to conserve natural
resources and open space lands. One of the major objectives of the General Plan is to preserve
and enhance the community, and to ensure that long-term growth within the City does not
adversely affect environmental resources. The policies and programs set forth in this Element
will help assure the preservation and long-term viability of valuable natural resources, and
prevent the premature and unnecessary conversion of open space land to urban uses. The Open
Space and Conservation Element represents the City's commitment to environmental quality as a
key component to land use planning.
In function and content, the Open Space Element and Conservation Element, as defined by state
law, often overlap. The requirements of state law result in conservation elements which are
oriented toward the management of natural resources to prevent waste, destruction or neglect.
The Open Space Element, in contrast, emphasizes open space as a land use and requires that
preservation and management of natural resources be considered in land use planning and
decision-making. This combined Open Space and Conservation Element describes conservation
practices and open space lands, thereby meeting the requirements of both elements under law.
BACKGROUND
The Open Space and Conservation Element is almost exclusively dedicated to the conservation
of natural resources and open space lands. The comprehensive issues addressed in this Element
are directly related to many other General Plan Elements, including the Land Use, Circulation,
Parks and Recreation, Biological Resources, Cultural Resources, Water Resources and the
Geotechnical Element.
Open space land is generally defined as any parcel or area of land or water, which is essentially
unimproved and devoted to an open space use. Open space areas are mainly lands designated for
the preservation of natural resources, including plant and animal species, for passive recreational
uses and for the production of resources (Government Code 65560(b)).

Government Code Section 65566, also known as the Open Space Lands Act, requires that local
governments prepare open space plans before adopting required open space related ordinances.
The Act helps assure consistency between the open space plan and zoning regulations.
Government Code Section 65561 states that the preservation of open space land is necessary, not
only for the maintenance of the economy of the state, but also for the assurance of the continued
availability of land for the production of resources, the enjoyment of scenic beauty, and for
recreation and use of natural resources.
Government Code Section 65302(d) requires that General Plans include elements which address
resource conservation issues. It also sets forth other topics that may be addressed, including
reclamation, protection of watersheds, and resource degradation.
Resource Conservation
Demands on resources increase relative to increases in population. For this reason it becomes
necessary for a community to periodically reassess its uses of these resources, particularly those
that are finite and nonrenewable, or those that are critical to life support such as air and water.
Furthermore, communities should be proactive in their attempt to be efficient and ecologically
aware of the region and its limitations. Although the traditional need for resource conservation
concerned itself with natural resources, it is also important for a community to assess the man-
made cultural and historic resources it wishes to preserve for future residents. The following
discussions offer a brief overview of Cathedral City’s and the Coachella Valley’s natural and
cultural resources.
Scenic Resources
The aesthetic quality of a place is generally described by the combination of the natural and built
environments. The Coachella Valley is surrounded by the San Jacinto, San Bernardino, Little
San Bernardino, and Santa Rosa Mountains, which provide a dramatic backdrop to the area and
contribute to the Valley’s unique desert character. The predominant built environment within the
Valley consists of resort developments that utilize oasis-like landscaping. Together, these scenic
attributes blend to create an exceptional and rare place that is aesthetically pleasing and
contributes to everyone’s quality of life.
Biological Resources
The Coachella Valley’s unique desert climate and topographical features create an environment
that supports a wide variety of wildlife species, habitats and communities. The Sonoran Desert
Creosote Community generally dominates the valley floor, and most of the planning area. This
community consists of shifting windblown sand, sand fields and dunes with sparse vegetation
and a number of uniquely adapted and special-status wildlife species. Other plant communities
and wildlife habitats include Desert Fan Palm Oases, which are found in canyons and places with
naturally occurring water, alluvial plain habitats, and desert dry wash habitats. The surrounding
hillside habitat is an area of transition where the arid valley floor gives way to desert mountains
with dense shrubbery and trees.

                                                                                  City of Cathedral City
                                                      General Plan/Open Space and Conservation Element
Within these areas the Coachella Valley hosts a variety of sensitive plant and animal species,
some of which have been listed as threatened or endangered by federal and state governments.
Most notable of these are the Peninsular bighorn sheep, Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard,
desert slender salamander, desert tortoise, California ditaxis and Coachella Valley milk vetch.
The area also supports more common species, such as the chuckwalla, zebra-tailed lizard,
Golden eagle, Peregrine falcon, Western burrowing owl, coyote and Palm Springs ground
squirrel (also see the Biological Resources Element).
Historical Resources
The Coachella Valley contains abundant archaeological evidence, which documents the
existence of prehistoric and historic human populations. Cultural resources found within the
region include Native American settlements, as well as trails and other sites established prior to
the arrival of European Americans. Historic structures and other sites used during early European
settlement also exist throughout the Valley.
The Desert Cahuilla are the most prominent native culture to evolve in the Coachella Valley.
Archaeologists believe that the Cahuilla traveled to the Coachella Valley from the north as early
as 2,000 to 3,000 years ago. Several Native American villages are known to have developed in
the Coachella Valley around the year 1200, and historic sites from this era include milling sites,
quarries for making tools, and religious and artistic sites. The Cahuilla established a number of
villages in the region, most of which were near the mountains and canyons and around ancient
Lake Cahuilla. Today, the Cahuilla continue to inhabit portions of the Coachella valley (also see
the Cultural Resources Element).
Water Resources
The majority of water resources in the region come from naturally occurring groundwater
reserves. The Valley is underlain by a system of groundwater basins that are separated in distinct
subbasins and subareas within subbasins. The Whitewater River subbasin serves as the primary
groundwater repository for Cathedral City. The subbasin encompasses a major portion of the
valley floor, covering approximately 400 square miles. It is divided into four subareas: Palm
Springs, Thermal, Thousand Palms and Oasis. The Palm Springs subarea of the Whitewater
River subbasin serves the planning area. The Palm Springs subarea is naturally recharged by
infiltration of runoff from the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains, the Whitewater River and
subsurface inflows from the San Gorgonio Pass subbasin. The groundwater storage capacity of
the subbasin is estimated at 4,600,000 acre-feet. The quality of water extracted from the regional
water basins is generally good to excellent. However, groundwater levels in the region have
declined steadily due to increasing urbanization in recent decades. As an essential resource,
water needs to be conserved and used efficiently (also see the Water Resources Element).
Energy Resources
Energy resources are integral in residential, commercial and industrial land uses, and especially
in transportation. Currently, the majority of energy is derived from nonrenewable or
environmentally damaging sources. In addition, most energy is not produced on a local or even
regional scale and therefore can be expensive, inefficient and unreliable.

Energy conservation has become a major theme to energy usage in California. The basic
concepts of energy conservation are using energy resources more efficiently through improved
technology; the effective use of building design standards; reducing unnecessary use and
dependence on nonrenewable sources; and conserving related resources. Development of
renewable and alternative energy sources should also be a key component to energy
conservation. Not only are renewable resources environmentally benign, they can be produced
on a local scale, and are therefore more dependable and efficient. Solar power and wind power
are two significant renewable energy resources that are increasingly being utilized in the
Coachella Valley. The development of these renewable energy resources in conjunction with
energy conservation measures will help to continue to meet the energy demands of the Valley
(also see Energy and Mineral Resources Element).
Open Space Lands
Open space lands perform a number of vital functions in an urban environment. Incorporation of
open space within a land use plan offers relief and contrast to high-density development, thereby
establishing an attractive setting for urban activities and contributing to a community's quality of
life. Open space can be utilized to establish edges or boundaries to a community or
neighborhood, serve as a buffer between incompatible land uses, or provide opportunities for
recreational activities. Protection of sufficient open space land promotes environmental quality
by safeguarding valuable resources and maintaining the integrity of natural systems.
Furthermore, access to open space areas, and preserving scenic landscapes, critical habitat,
ecologically valuable land and recreational areas are critical components of livable communities
and healthy economies. By and large, open space and land conservation benefit communities
environmentally as well as economically.
In general, the State recognizes four broad categories of open space land including: open space
for the preservation of natural resources, open space for resource management, open space for
recreation, and open space for public health and safety. The following discussion defines each of
these open space categories. While not all of these designations are relevant to the City and its
sphere of influence, they are applicable on a regional level.
Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
Open space for the preservation of natural resources refers to areas required for the protection of
scenic resources, plant and animal species and crucial habitat, as well as areas required for
ecologic reserves and scientific study. Habitat conservation in the Coachella Valley has become
increasingly important due to the amount of federally listed species in the region. There are many
areas within the Coachella Valley that are dedicated to the preservation and protection of plant
and wildlife species, most of which are included in the Coachella Valley Multiple Species
Habitat Conservation Plan area. The following includes brief descriptions of open space areas for
the preservation of natural resources within or proximate to Cathedral City.
Willow Hole-Edom Hill Preserve ACEC
The Willow Hole-Edom Hill Preserve/ Area of Critical Concern (ACEC) is located on 2,469
acres at the west end of the Indio Hills. It consists of two separate areas: Willow Hole and Edom
Hill, which are 2 to 3 miles apart. Approximately 2,163 acres are owned by the Bureau of Land
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                 Open Space and Conservation Element

Management (BLM), 90 acres by the Coachella Valley Mountains Conservancy, and 216 acres
by private parties. The preserve is classified as Class "L", Limited in the California Desert
Conservation Area (CDCA). Class L means that limited use is allowed, to protect sensitive,
natural, scenic, ecological and cultural resources. Important biological resources found on the
preserve include mesquite hummocks, a fan palm oasis, and habitat for the Coachella Valley
milk vetch, Little San Bernardino Mountains gilia, Palm Springs ground squirrel, Palm Springs
pocket mouse, burrowing owl, crissal thrasher, and the Coachella Valley giant sand treader
cricket. The preserve is also home to migratory birds, such as the least Bell's vireo, southwestern
willow flycatcher, yellow-breasted chat and the yellow warbler. Management objectives and
prescriptions include habitat protection through land acquisition and control of recreational uses.
Coachella Valley Thousand Palms Preserve
The Thousand Palms Preserve is situated in the western Coachella Valley in, and immediately
south of the central portion of the Indio Hills. It consists of 13,030 acres of BLM, United States
Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG),
California Department of Parks and Recreation, and Center for Natural Lands Management
lands. The preserve is managed to protect and enhance the habitat of the Coachella Valley fringe-
toed lizard. In 1980, the federal government listed the Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard as
threatened, due to the loss of crucial habitat. In April 1984, the Nature Conservancy purchased
1,920 acres of crucial habitat to ensure the protection of the lizard and other plants and animals
that share its unique ecosystem. The preserve provides managed access to the site's palm oases
and other areas of interest through a system of trails ranging from 1 to 6 miles.
Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains
The Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains contain many valuable biological and scenic
resources. For that reason, many areas within these mountains have been protected and are
managed under a variety of public land agencies.
The U.S. Forest Service manages lands within these mountains, designating them as Wilderness
areas. The San Jacinto Wilderness is split into two units in the mountains south of the Coachella
Valley on approximately 32,850 acres. The northern unit is made up largely of the San Jacinto
Peak, while the southern unit incorporates lands along the ridgeline of the San Jacinto Mountains
and includes the headwaters of Andreas, Murray and other desert canyons.
The Santa Rosa Wilderness lies in the Santa Rosa Mountains south of the Coachella Valley, and
is situated on approximately 20,160 acres. Biological resources within these lands include
diverse natural communities from Sonoran mixed woody and succulent scrub, to peninsular
juniper woodland and scrub, to Jeffrey pine forest, and habitat for the peninsular bighorn sheep
and gray vireo. These areas are covered under the San Bernardino National Forest Land and
Resource Management Plan. According to this plan, wilderness is managed to provide for both
recreational opportunities and resource and habitat preservation. However, management within
the Santa Rosa Wilderness is also coordinated with CDFG and BLM for the protection of the
peninsular bighorn sheep.

The Santa Rosa Mountains have also been designated as a National Scenic Area, which is
managed by the BLM. It encompasses all BLM land in the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto
Mountains. These areas outside the wilderness areas are classified as Class "L" (limited use to
protect sensitive, natural, scenic, ecological and cultural values) in the BLM’s California Desert
Conservation Area (CDCA) plan. Currently (2001), there has been no management plan adopted
for the Santa Rosa Mountains National Scenic Area.
In 2000, the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains were designated a National Monument.
Management for these lands is included in the Santa Rosa Mountains Wildlife Habitat
Management Plan. The Plan is implemented by the BLM and the CDFG in an effort to manage
bighorn sheep and other sensitive species.
Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP)
The Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) has recently been
prepared by the Coachella Valley Association of Governments (CVAG), and approved by the
County and all but one of the cities in the Coachella Valley, and includes principles, policies and
regional proposals to conserve biological diversity on a regional scale. The Coachella Valley
MSHCP provides a seamless network of adequate habitat for the protection and safekeeping of
long-term viable populations of the species that are currently listed as threatened or endangered.
Cathedral City is one of the MSHCP participants.
Open Space for Resource Management
Open space for the management of natural resources refers to those lands that contain resources
which are utilized and developed, such as agricultural lands, areas containing major mineral
deposits, areas of economic importance for the production of food or energy, and areas required
for recharging groundwater or for water storage. In the planning area and surrounding areas, this
open space designation represents the utility corridor along the northern portion of the planning
area, areas within the Indio Hills that are suitable for the generation of wind energy, as well as
significant drainage areas that help to replenish the groundwater reservoir.
Open Space for Recreation
Open space for outdoor recreation includes areas of outstanding scenic, historic and cultural
value, areas that are suitable for park and recreational purposes, and areas that can serve as links
between major recreation and open space reservations, including utility easements and trails and
scenic highways corridors.
Golf courses represent an important source of recreation in the Coachella Valley, and are also
central to the region's economy. Public and private golf courses comprise a substantial portion of
open space lands in the City and surrounding areas. Parklands are another important source of
open space for recreation. The City is home to five parks including, Century Park, Patriot Park,
Second Street Park, Agua Caliente Park and Panorama Park (Also see the Parks and Recreation
Element).
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                Open Space and Conservation Element

 In addition to the active recreational opportunities that the City's parks provide, there are also
numerous trails and facilities throughout the Valley that support passive recreation on a regional
scale, such as Joshua Tree National Park, the Living Desert, and the numerous mountain trails
through the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains.
Open Space for Pubic Health and Safety
Open space for public health and safety refers to those lands that require special management or
regulation because of hazardous or special conditions, such as earthquake fault zones,
floodplains, unstable soil areas, and high fire areas. Although these lands remain open due to
hazardous conditions, they have potential for other open space uses. Flood control facilities may
be usable for wildlife habitat and for recreational purposes. Land located along fault lines can
remain in its natural condition as a wildlife corridor. In the planning area and immediate vicinity,
this category of Open Space is associated with the flood control facilities for the Whitewater
River and other drainages, areas within the Indio Hills that are in close proximity to the fault
line, and the now-closed Edom Hill landfill. While these areas are unsuitable for development,
they do provide viable open space lands.
Open Space Land Use Categories
The General Plan provides for approximately
2,901.06 acres of open space lands, or 18% of
the total planning area. The City maintains four
Open Space land use categories, they are: Open
Space-Private, Open Space-Public, Open Space-
Watercourse and Open Space-Other. The types
of designated open space land uses and the
acreages of each are shown in the table below.

Private open space generally refers to the private golf courses located within the City, which
constitutes about 27% of open space land. Public open space makes up approximately 61.9% of
open space land and refers to the City's public parks and undeveloped public lands in the
northeastern portion of the City. Open Space-Watercourse makes up a large portion of open
space within the City, representing 21% of open space land. This designation refers to the
Whitewater River and the east, west and north portions of the Cathedral Canyon channel. Lastly,
Open Space-Other represents the utility corridor for high voltage transmission lines within North
City, and amounts to approximately 14.3% of the open space within the City. Some open space
uses overlap each other. As an example, the golf course for the Cimarron Golf Resort is located
within the OS-W designated Whitewater River channel.
Land Acquisition
One way to ensure the development or preservation of natural resources is through the
designation of open space. Open space regulation provides means and methods of obtaining open
space lands, and allowing land to be preserved for the good of the community. In California,
many conservation programs and legislative enactments have been put into effect, including the
Conservation Easement Act, Open Space Easement Act of 1974 and the Scenic Deed Act.
Programs and Legislative Enactments
To facilitate the continued preservation of open space in California, a number of conservation
programs and legislative measures have been enacted. The following discussion presents a brief
description of legislation associated with open space and natural resources conservation.
The Conservation Easement Act
The Conservation Easement Act (Civil Code Sections 815-816) was established to encourage the
dedication of open space lands for ongoing conservation. A conservation easement is a voluntary
agreement that allows a landowner to limit the type or amount of development on their property,
while retaining private ownership of the land.
The easement is binding to successive owners of the land The purpose of a conservation
easement is to retain land predominantly in its natural, scenic, historical, agricultural, forested, or
open space condition. By granting conservation easements, a landowner can assure that the
property will be protected forever, regardless of who owns the land in the future.

                                                                                  City of Cathedral City
                                                      General Plan/Open Space and Conservation Element
Open Space Easement Act
The Open Space Easement Act of 1974 (Government Code Sections 51070-51097) provides
another mechanism for preserving open space land. This gives local governments the authority to
accept easements granted to them or non-profit organizations for the purpose of conserving open
space and agricultural lands.
The Scenic Easement Deed Act
The Scenic Easement Deed Act (Government Code Sections 6950-6954) authorizes local
governments to purchase fee or scenic easements, but there is no special mechanism for
obtaining them. Land uses are regulated by the Act, and local governments are authorized to
adopt an ordinance, which establishes open space covenants with property owners.
Public Land Trusts
A public land conservation trust is another mechanism devoted to protecting open space,
agricultural lands, wildlife habitats and natural resource lands. Land trusts achieve their
objectives primarily through acquiring and managing interests in land.
Land conservation trusts can help to preserve open space and resource lands in a variety of ways.
Trusts funds can be used to acquire fee simple interest in real estate to then manage or lease back
holdings, or to purchase conservation easements that protect sensitive land from development.
Since they are less restrained by formalities and regulations, private land trusts are usually able
to respond more quickly than governmental entities to purchasing opportunities. They also have
more experience to help public agencies with the technicalities of acquisition. A public land trust
helps to preserve environmentally sensitive open space and conservation lands, pursue State and
Federal financing with grants and loans, and other assistance methods for the preservation of
open space. Several land trusts exist in the Coachella Valley, including the Cathedral City
Mountains Conservancy, the Coachella Valley Mountains Conservancy, The Nature
Conservancy, The Living Desert, The Wildlands Conservancy, The Center for Natural Lands
Management, and the Friends of the Desert Mountains.
Methods of Funding Open Space
Viable funding mechanisms are essential to financing the acquisition and management of open
space lands. These mechanisms may include State obligation bonds, grants and tax increment
financing. In addition to these funding mechanisms, the Legislature has helped organizations
create grant and loan programs that can aid open space financing. These are available on a
competitive basis for specific projects, and include:
•       Land and Water Conservation Fund/Department of Parks and Recreation
•       Habitat Conservation Program/Department of Parks and Recreation
•       Simms Trail Bill/ Department of Parks and Recreation
•       Public Access Program/ Department of Fish and Game
•       Wildlife Conservation Board Program/Department of Fish and Game
•       Urban Forestry Program/California Department of Forestry

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The City of Cathedral City and its surrounding area are located within a unique desert
environment that contains many valuable natural resources and open space lands. The City, as a
priority, should continually pursue the safeguarding and protection of these resources in planning
and decision-making. While growth will continue to occur in the region, the implementation of
the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, MSHCP, and other regulatory mechanisms will help to
promote conservation and ensure that development will not interfere with or interrupt open space
and conservation lands in the future.
Regional support and participation in the Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan is essential
to secure a regional system of conservation lands for long-term preservation.
The City can also have an important role to play in encouraging and supporting the preservation
efforts of non-profit and other conservation groups, and assist in acquiring additional open space
lands. Assistance may also be provided in finding federal and state grants for purchase of
conservation easement and/or fee simple ownership interest.

ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES
ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Energy and Mineral Resources Element is to establish policies that direct the
City's development, use and management of mineral and energy resources. Energy and mineral
resources are essential components to the community, as they enable development and growth,
enhance the quality of life and influence the local economy. However, traditional generation and
use of these resources also raise a number of concerns. Many of the energy and mineral
resources that are currently being utilized are in limited supply. Energy shortages and increasing
utility rates have become a serious problem in California. This element is intended to be
responsive to the community’s dependence on these resources, and to identify opportunities for
more local control.
This element includes discussions of conventional and renewable energy resources, quantifies
energy use, and addresses mineral resources. The policies and programs in this Element should
be considered tools to help the City find effective solutions to energy resource issues, while not
negatively affecting its long term growth.
BACKGROUND
The Energy and Mineral Resources Element applies to several other elements in the General
Plan, including Land Use, Open Space and Conservation, Air Quality, and to a lesser degree
Housing, Community Design and Economic Development. A number of state and federal
regulations pertain to energy and mineral resource issues. California Code Section 65560(b)
directs cities to preserve energy and mineral resources. Government Code Section 65302(d)
mandates the inclusion of resource conservation in General Plans, and includes issues to be
addressed in this Element, such as reclamation, resource degradation and preservation for long-
term use.
Some of the state regulations affecting mineral and energy resources include Title 24 building
standards to reduce unnecessary energy use in new or substantially remodeled construction, and
the State Solar Rights Act and Solar Shade Control Act, which facilitate the use of solar energy.
Energy Resources
Energy resources play a vital role in many land uses, and are particularly critical to
transportation. Currently, the majority of energy is derived from limited and non-renewable
resources. These resources are restricted and not viable for long-term production, and their
production and use are damaging the environment. Furthermore, existing energy resources are

not managed locally, and therefore are not always readily available or dependable.
Environmental degradation, energy shortages, rising energy costs, diminished reserves and
uncertainties about future availability of resources have made traditional non-renewable energy
resources an important subject of public discussion in recent months in California. Alternate
sources of energy, which had limited exposure in recent years, are once again in the spotlight for
future growth.
The following table provides a breakdown of the energy resources utilized in California, the
percentage of total energy use that each resource contributes and estimated reserves. The
percentage of energy from renewable energy resources in California is largely due to wind and
solar farms, which are continually gaining popularity throughout the state. Other renewable
resources that are utilized in smaller amounts include geothermal and biomass.

While existing energy usage is heavily dependent on non-renewable sources, there are several
renewable resources that offer sound alternatives to traditional energy systems. The following
provides a brief description of conventional and alternative energy resources.
Conventional Energy Sources
Nuclear
Nuclear power development began in the late 1950's to fill in the deficit caused by predicted
shortages of oil and natural gas. Nuclear power is derived from splitting uranium or plutonium
atoms. While nuclear power plants produce no air pollution, they can pose grave risks to human
health and the environment when malfunctions occur. In California, several nuclear power plants
provide electricity throughout the state.
Coal
Coal is fossilized plant material preserved by burial in sediments and altered by geological forces
that compact and condense it into a carbon-rich fuel. Coal was a prominent source of energy
between 1870 and 1950. While coal is still used, the public health and environmental costs of
coal extraction and use are great. About 65% of the sulfur dioxide, 33% of the carbon dioxide,
and 25% of the nitrogen oxide emissions in the U.S. are produced by coal burning plants.

                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                     General Plan/Energy and Mineral Resources Element
Natural Gas
Natural gas is the most rapidly growing energy source because it is convenient, cheap and clean
burning. Although natural gas reserves will last for many decades, they are finite and as they
become more scarce, the price will rise. Furthermore, natural gas is not as easy to transport in
large quantities, and expansion of the pipeline system can have significant environmental
impacts and be expensive.
Hydropower
Dams provide electricity by guiding water down a chute and over a turbine at high speed.
Although water is considered a renewable resource, large-scale hydropower is a conventional
source of energy. While it does not produce air emissions, large dams do raise some serious
environmental issues, such as flood control, water quality and depletion of valuable fish and
wildlife habitat. Therefore, while large hydropower is clean, it can have negative environmental
impacts as well. However small-scale hydropower (less than 30 MW) projects are considered an
appropriate use of water, with minimal environmental impacts, since they are not dependent on
dams, and therefore do not affect watersheds and alter fish and wildlife habitat.
Renewable Sources of Energy Production
Geothermal
The earth's internal temperature can provide a useful source of energy. High-pressure, high-
temperature steam fields exist below the Earth's surface. Geothermal energy is generated by
converting hot water or steam from deep beneath the Earth's surface into electricity. Until
recently, the main use of this energy source was in baths built at hot springs. Geothermal plants
emit very little air pollution and have minimal impacts on the environment.
Biomass
Organic matter, called biomass, can be burned in an incinerator to produce energy. In newer
facilities, the biomass is converted into a combustible gas, allowing for greater efficiency and
cleaner performance. Biomass resources include agricultural, forestry and food processing
byproducts as well as gases emitted by landfills.
                                                  Wind
                                                  The wind turbine is a source of clean,
                                                  renewable energy. Wind turbines use strong,
                                                  steady wind to create electricity. Wind power
                                                  emits no pollution and has very little impact on
                                                  the land. While expensive facilities are needed
                                                  to store the energy created by windmills for
                                                  use at non-windy times, wind power is cheaper
                                                  than any other new energy source.

Solar
The sun's radiation is used directly to produce electricity in two ways: photovoltaic (PV) systems
and solar thermal systems. PV systems change sunlight directly into electricity. Solar thermal
systems use the sun's energy to heat a fluid that produces steam, which then turns a turbine and
generator. The sun's radiation can also be used passively, through the use of certain building
materials and designs, to improve heat gain in the winter and minimize it in the summer.
Electric Power
History of Power Services
Historically, electric utilities have been responsible for generating, transmitting and distributing
electricity. Jurisdiction over the electric utility industry was divided between the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC), which regulated transmission and wholesale transactions in
interstate commerce, and the states, which regulated local distribution and shareholder-owned
utilities' retail sales. Traditionally, state public utility commissions (PUC's) have granted utilities
exclusive franchise areas and required them to serve all customers in their areas at regulated rates
that included generation, transmission and delivery, based on cost of service.
Deregulation
In 1998, Assembly Bill 1890 (AB 1890) deregulated the electric industry. Deregulation resulted
in a shift from a regulated to a market-driven system, allowing consumers to choose their
electricity provider. Deregulation has led to the restructuring of the energy system, resulting in
the creation of two new entities: the Independent System Operator (ISO) and the Power
Exchange (PX), which are both independent of the utility companies.
The California ISO is a not-for-profit corporation that has control of the long-distance, high-
voltage power lines that deliver electricity throughout California, and between neighboring states
and Mexico. The first participants in the ISO were the state's three investor owned utilities
(IOU's): Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison.
These utilities were mandated by AB 1890 to release control, but not ownership of their
transmission lines to the ISO, enabling other energy generators to transmit energy to consumers.
The mission of the California ISO is to ensure that the power grid is safe and reliable and that
there is a competitive market for electricity in California.
The California Power Exchange (PX) provided a competitive marketplace where buyers and
sellers of power complete traded through an electronic auction. An independent board managed
the PX, with representatives of various constituencies involved in the electric power industry. It
belonged to the people of California and was created to benefit the public. The PX was not a
government agency, nor a utility, nor a generating facility.
The last year (2001) has demonstrated the effects of deregulation, and the ultimate outcome is
still to be determined. In the near term, Cathedral City and the other Coachella Valley cities can
influence the impacts which deregulation has on residents and businesses by offering
conservation initiatives, developing and regulating local power generation, and by influencing
energy policy on a regional and state level. The City must also continue to monitor the

development of private energy plants, including the Peaker plant recently built to the west of the
City.
Southern California Edison
Southern California Edison (SCE) is the electric service provider for the City of Cathedral City.
High voltage transmission lines deliver power to substations where power is stepped down and
distributed through lower voltage lines. Residences and businesses then receive power through a
transformer, which reduces voltages to safe levels.
SCE offers rebates for the installation of energy efficient equipment, including air conditioning
units, refrigerators and even light bulbs. For residential customers, the Automatic Power Shift
program allows substantial savings from June through October, in exchange for allowing SCE to
remotely cycle-off selected air conditioning units during peak periods of heavy use and potential
power outages. A similar program, the Interruptible Customer Program, is available for
commercial customers.
Natural Gas
Natural gas is becoming a more widely used resource, which has lower environmental impacts
than most electric generation facilities. It is transported throughout the country by high-pressure
transmission lines, and is available to commercial, industrial and residential users throughout the
City.
The costs of natural gas vary depending on the season and amount of use, but are currently still
affordable throughout the year. Although gas supplies are still abundant, the rapidly increasing
demand is expected to affect availability and cost in the future.
Southern California Gas Company
Natural gas is provided to the General Plan planning area by the Southern California Gas
Company (SCG). SCG’s services include detailed technical assistance and incentive programs
that address a wide range of use issues, land use planning, service extension and use-specific
technical consulting/problem solving. In addition, SCG has developed a wide range of energy
management, conservation and equipment retrofit programs for its customer base. These
programs include core nonresidential customers equipment rebates of up to 20% of the cost of
qualifying equipment. Assistance in facilities planning and analysis is also provided to maximize
energy efficiency and cost-effective equipment purchases and operations. SCG's Air Quality
Assistance Program provides users with information on current and upcoming energy
regulations, and helps them implement these regulations as well. SCG also actively participates
in the development of new technologies, primarily for industrial users.
Renewable Energy Resources in the Coachella Valley
The City benefits from two abundant renewable resources: sunshine and periods of high winds.
The San Gorgonio Wind Resource Area, which extends from the San Gorgonio Pass into the
City's northwesterly boundary, provides an important resource for the electric generation system
in this State. The number of sunny days, and the intensity of the sun in the Valley, make solar

energy generation an important resource as well. Both of these resources provide practical and
cost-effective alternatives to conventional energy.
Renewable energy resources provide an endless supply energy, and can significantly reduce
dependence on traditional energy sources. Local generation of renewable energy can also create
an opportunity for economic development for both the City and the region.
Wind Energy
The early wind energy projects in the Valley occurred in the mid-1980’s, on U.S. Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) and County of Riverside lands. The cities of Desert Hot Springs and
Palm Springs now have jurisdiction over wind farms which they annexed in the 1990’s, with the
City of Cathedral City having jurisdiction over eight (8) wind turbines north of Interstate 10 in
area annexed into the City in 2007.
The areas of the Valley particularly suitable to the generation of wind power were originally
delineated in the San Gorgonio Wind Resource Study. Additional analysis has refined and
expanded on the Study, resulting in a Valley-wide understanding of the location of the wind
resource area that is economically viable.
The cost of wind-generated electricity is now equal to or lower than electricity generated by coal
or natural gas. Its primary limitation is its lack of constancy – in order to make the resource more
generally dependable, storage of the energy generated is required.
Solar Energy
Photovoltaic systems have traditionally been very expensive, and therefore not often installed.
Although in recent years, the costs have come down, photovoltaic power is still used only in
limited applications. Photovoltaic systems are appropriate as stand-alone power systems and as
integrated components of building design and construction, and are slowly becoming more
widely used.
Residents in the Coachella Valley have for many years used solar thermal systems for domestic
hot water production and to heat their swimming pools. Most cities in the Valley also consider
passive solar design when reviewing development projects, and include them in their design
guidelines. The intense solar insulation which facilitates both solar thermal and photovoltaic use
puts Cathedral City in an ideal position for use of this resource by its residents and businesses
alike.
Hydrogen Fuels
As technologies change and develop, new and better fuels, including hydrogen fuels, which are
dependent on renewable rather than non-renewable sources, will become more practical for
everyday use. Hydrogen fuel cells convert energy into electricity with no harmful byproducts.
Hydrogen fuel applications are developing at a rapid pace, and can be used as primary power
sources when combined with other renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power.

Regional Research, Development and Implementation Programs
Two entities have taken the lead in the research, development and implementation of new energy
resource programs in the Valley: the SunLine Transit Agency and College of the Desert.
Several years ago, SunLine converted all its vehicles to compressed natural gas, including its
buses, vans and service vehicles. Since the conversion, city vehicles, post office delivery trucks
and taxicabs have also been converted to compressed natural gas. The conversion from diesel
fuel to compressed natural gas represents an important reduction in air emissions generated by
vehicles in the Valley.
In recent years, SunLine has also worked with the City of Palm Desert in developing hydrogen
fuel cells to power vehicles. SunLine now operates a complete hydrogen fuel facility which
produces, compresses, stores and dispenses hydrogen fuels for vehicles operated by Palm Desert
for gardening and maintenance.
The College of the Desert operates the Energy Technology Training Center (ETTC) and the
Advanced Transportation Technologies Initiative (ATTI). The ETTC has provided training in
alternative fuels technology since 1993, and is a model for such programs now being developed
for nine other community colleges in the State. The ATTI program trains and retrains workers to
be able to convert, service and repair advanced alternative fuel vehicles now and into the future,
through programs available at a network of community colleges throughout the state.
Mineral Resources
Mineral resources are naturally occurring crystalline substances which are economically
valuable, and include iron, sand and gravel and limestone. Mineral resources provide materials
for a variety of uses, making them important to community development and commerce.
The importance and value of mineral resources, coupled with their limited availability, make
careful planning a necessity. Moreover, the mining, processing and distribution of mineral
resources have broad and varied implications on the environment. Surface mining can scar the
landscape for hundreds of years if a mine is not adequately reclaimed. The Surface Mining and
Reclamation Act was established to deal with these issues. Its objective is twofold: ensuring the
conservation and wise use of mineral resources while concurrently addressing environmental
protection from mining impacts.
Locally Important Mineral Resources
Significant accumulations of sand and gravel, commonly referred to as ‘aggregate’ are found
throughout the Valley, resulting from the transport of soils and rocks from the mountains
surrounding the Valley to the Valley floor. Aggregate represents 80% to 100% of the contents of
asphalt, concrete, road base, stucco and plaster. Aggregate products are now being recycled
when roads are resurfaced and buildings demolished, so that new asphalt and concrete can be
created without additional mining.

Sand and gravel resources in the Valley were identified and mapped by the California
Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology in 1988, as required by the Surface
Mining and Reclamation Act. The report identifies significant mineral deposits in the region, in
an effort to protect them from incompatible land uses and conserve them for future development.
The report used three categories for identifying mineral resources:
MRZ-1:           Areas where adequate information indicates that no significant mineral deposits
                 are present, or where it is judged that little likelihood exists for their presence.
MRZ-2:           Areas where adequate information indicates that significant mineral deposits are
                 present, or where it is judged that a high likelihood for their presence exists.
MRZ-3:           Areas containing mineral deposits, the significance of which cannot be evaluated
                 from available data.
As shown on the state mineral resources map, only Mineral Resource Zone 3 (MZR-3) is
applicable to the City and its sphere-of-influence. MZR-3 generally refers to areas where
development has limited the ability to determine the presence or amount of mineral resources.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The use of energy and mineral resources is critical to our current lifestyles. The manner in which
we have mined, farmed or otherwise collected these resources has caused environmental
degradation, impacted wildlife habitat, affected our water and air quality, and been directly and
indirectly associated with adverse public health effects. Whether applied to the generation of
electricity or the mining of sand, the future of both mineral and energy resources is dependent on
our wise and carefully considered use of traditional resources, and our aggressive pursuit of new
and renewable options.
Steadily increasing economic and environmental costs associated with energy production and use
are forcing communities and countries to develop new energy policies. The community approach
to energy problem-solving can be a good alternative to the energy crisis in California. This "soft
path" approach, with its emphasis on local control, renewable resources and community-scale
technologies, is gaining favor in many communities.

This chapter of the General Plan addresses those man-made and natural environmental hazards which occur in the
City of Palm Desert and surrounding areas. General Plan elements discussed under this chapter include
Geotechnical, Flooding and Hydrology, Noise, and Hazardous and Toxic materials. The assessment of and planning
for these hazards or constraints is the primary purpose of this chapter of the General Plan.

                    GEOTECHNICAL ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Geotechnical Element is to describe the geotechnical conditions facing the
City and to establish goals, policies, and programs which protect the community from seismic
and related hazards. The Element and its supporting documentation are also intended to serve as
an information database, which guides future development and land use policies and educates
City residents about potential geotechnical hazards and methods to mitigate their impacts.
BACKGROUND
The Geotechnical Element, which focuses on the physical characteristics of the City and the
safety of its residents, is directly related to a number of other General Plan elements, including
the following: Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Public Buildings and Facilities, Water Resources,
Flooding and Hydrology, Emergency Preparedness, Police and Fire Protection, and Water,
Sewer and Utilities. The Geotechnical Element addresses potential seismic and related hazards,
which can result in significant property damage, generate exorbitant clean-up and reconstruction
costs, and interrupt the day-to-day operations of the City. In this regard, the Geotechnical
Element is also related to the Economic Development Element.
A wide range of state legislation, including the California Government Code and Public
Resources Code, requires that the City address geotechnical hazards and seismic safety issues.
Per California Government Code Section 65302(g), the General Plan is required to address the
need to protect the community from unreasonable risks associated with the effects of known
geologic hazards, such as seismically induced ground shaking, subsidence, and ground rupture
and failure. According to Government Code Section 65303, the General Plan may also address
other subjects relating to the physical development of the community. This is accomplished, in
part, by the Geotechnical Element, as well as the Flooding and Hydrology, Emergency
Preparedness, and other elements of this Plan.
Perhaps the most important piece of state legislation relating to seismic safety is the Alquist-
Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (found in Public Resources Code Sections 2621 et. seq.),
which is intended to protect human life and property from the hazards associated with fault
rupture. The Act and its impact on development in Cathedral City are described in this element.
Government Code Section 8876 establishes a program through which the City and other
jurisdictions located within the most severe seismic shaking zone, Zone 4 (as set forth in Chapter
2-23, Part 2, Title 24 of the Administrative Code), shall identify all potentially hazardous or
substandard buildings and establish a program for the mitigation of these structural inadequacies.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                             Geotechnical Element

Geologic Setting
The City of Cathedral City is located within the northwesterly portion of the Salton Trough, a
narrow, low-lying tectonic depression that began forming about 5 million years ago. The rocks
and sediments exposed at the surface of the General Plan planning area, which can be classified
based on their age, include:
    1) Mesozoic and older (66 million years old and older) rocks in the Santa Rosa Mountains,
    2) Pleistocene (11,000 to 1.6 million years old) sediments on Edom Hill, Flat Top
        Mountain, and the northwestern portion of the planning area, and
    3) Holocene (0-11,000 years old) sediments on the valley floor.
The distribution of these sediments within the planning area is illustrated in Exhibit V-1. Their
geologic and hydrologic characteristics are responsible for a number of geologic hazards and
engineering challenges, which are described throughout this element.
Metasedimentary Rocks
The oldest sedimentary rocks, which overlie volcanic rock and basement bedrock, are
conglomerates consisting of granitic and metamorphic debris. Within the General Plan planning
area, these units are limited to the slopes of the Santa Rosa Mountains (map symbol prb on
Exhibit V-1). The mountains consist of metamorphic rock of unknown age, which has been
intruded by Early to Late Cretaceous (80 to 120 million years ago) crystalline rocks. The
metamorphic rocks consist primarily of foliated schists and gneisses, which were probably
derived from ancient marine sediments.
The metasedimentary rocks found in the planning area are typically non-water bearing, except
where they are extensively jointed and fractured. Although joints, shears, and foliation provide
avenues for water penetration, these units have low to moderately low permeability.
Unweathered rock cannot be easily excavated, and blasting is usually required.
Alluvial Sediments
The most recently deposited sediments in the planning area are of alluvial (stream-deposited) or
aeolian (wind-deposited) origin. Alluvial surfaces can be differentiated based on age and the
degree of dissection and soil development. The youngest alluvial materials, known as active
channel deposits, have no soil development and occur within the active stream channels of the
planning area (map symbol Qw). These sediments are associated with the watershed of the
Whitewater River, including the Salvia and Morongo Washes south of the Indio Hills and the
Cathedral Canyon drainages at the base of the Santa Rosa Mountains. They also occur north of
the Indio Hills.
Alluvial sediments that are slightly elevated above the active stream channels and slightly more
dissected are classified as Qyf2, and occur in the northwestern corner of the planning area.

Coarse, poorly sorted sands and gravels are referred to as alluvial fan and stream-wash deposits
(map symbol Qf), and occur at the base of the Santa Rosa Mountains, on the alluvial fans
emanating from Cathedral Canyon.
Alluvial plain sediments are typically loose near the ground surface, but become denser with
increasing depth. They have medium to high permeabilities, except where silt layers retard the
percolation of water. Because these units can be readily compacted with a combination of
saturation and wheel rolling with rubber-tired construction equipment, they are generally suitable
for use as compacted fill. Shrinkage of 20% to 30% can be expected upon compaction.
Alluvial fan sediments, which are dry with higher permeabilities, are also generally suitable for
use as compacted fill. Compaction of the near-surface soils can be expected to result in up to
15% shrinkage.
The sediments that crop out in the Indio Hills are composed of Ocotillo Conglomerate, although
some geologic sources refer to them as “oldest alluvial fan deposits,” which are believed to be
late Pleistocene in age (map symbol Qdf on Exhibit V-1). Ocotillo Conglomerate consists of
pebble to cobble-sized sub-rounded clasts of locally derived gneisses and granites, with a lesser
amount of basic volcanic rock, limestone, and pegmatite. It is approximately 2,400 feet thick in
the Edom Hill area. The Ocotillo Conglomerate is the principal water-bearing unit of the upper
Coachella Valley and typically has high concentrations of clay and a moderate potential for
expansion (see “Expansive Soils” section below).
Aeolian Sediments
Wind-deposited (aeolian) sediments, which are typically alluvial in origin, are also referred to as
sand dune deposits (map symbol Qds). These silty, fine and medium-grained soils are picked up
and transported by strong winds emanating from the San Gorgonio Pass at the northwesterly
edge of the Coachella Valley. They are redistributed along the central valley floor where they
form shifting sand dunes. A thick accumulation of these windblown sands has formed the Palm
Springs Sand Ridge, which rises as much as 100 to 120 feet above the valley floor and covers a
significant portion of the General Plan planning area. As shown in Exhibit V-1, windblown
deposits underlie much of the developed portion of the planning area.
Aeolian deposits are typically loose near the ground surface, but become denser with increasing
depth. Like alluvial deposits, they are generally suitable for use as compacted fill, as they can be
readily compacted with a combination of thorough wetting and wheel rolling with rubber-tired
construction equipment. These units typically have high permeabilities, and shrinkage of up to
30% can be expected upon compaction.

Geologic Hazards
Slope Instability
Land adjacent to the Indio Hills and the east to
northeast-facing slopes of the Santa Rosa
Mountains have a moderate to high
susceptibility to rock falls and landsliding. The
metasedimentary and intrusive rocks that
characterize the slopes of the Santa Rosa
Mountains have several planes of weakness,
including joints, fractures, and foliation.
Depending on their orientation to man-made
cuts in the soil, these areas could be
susceptible to failure. Additionally, as these
rocks weather, they can form rounded boulders          View of sand ridge at Mountain View
which perch precariously on steep slopes and                            Avenue
pose rock fall hazards down slope. Earthquake
induced landslides and rock falls may occur in both the Indio Hills and Santa Rosa Mountains
and are addressed in subsequent sections of this element. Mitigation of these hazards is best
accomplished by avoiding development on steep slopes and implementing structural setbacks at
the toe of slopes. Any proposed development adjacent to steep slopes of the Santa Rosa
Mountains or Indio Hills should include an analysis for potential slope instability.
Collapsible Soils
Soil collapse, or hydroconsolidation, occurs when soils undergo a rearrangement of their grains
and a loss of cementation, resulting in substantial and rapid settlement under relatively low loads.
This phenomenon typically occurs in recently deposited Holocene soils in a dry or semi-arid
environment, including aeolian sands and alluvial fan and mudflow sediments deposited during
flash floods. The combination of weight from a building or other structure, and an increase in
surface water infiltration (such as from irrigation or a rise in the ground water table) can initiate
rapid settlement and cause structural foundations and walls to crack.
Alluvial and aeolian sediments in the planning area have the potential for collapse. Where
development is proposed on these soils, this hazard should be evaluated as part of site-specific
geotechnical evaluations, and recommendations should be made to mitigate the potential hazard.
These studies should include analysis of the settlement potential of the entire soil column to the
effective depth of infiltration of irrigation water, rather than only the near-surface soils.
Additional recommendations which can mitigate these impacts include pre-watering of
susceptible soils to induce collapse prior to construction, designing drainage to flow away from
structures, avoiding open-bottomed planters adjacent to structures, using roof gutters to direct
drainage away from foundations, and limiting the use of irrigation water.
Expansive Soils
Expansive soils contain significant amounts of clay particles that have the ability to give up
water (shrink) or take on water (swell). When these soils swell, the change in volume can exert

                                                                     General Plan/Geotechnical Element
significant pressures on loads that are placed on them, such as buildings, and can result in
structural distress and/or damage.
Given the relatively minor amount of clay present in soils in Cathedral City, expansive soils are
not considered a hazard in the planning area. Although the older fan deposits of the Indio Hills
may contain clay-rich soils near the surface, these units are typically removed and recompacted
during grading. Mixing of soils during this process is expected to reduce their expansion
potential.
Ground Subsidence
Ground subsidence is the gradual settling or sinking of the ground surface with little or no
horizontal movement, and is usually associated with the extraction of oil, gas, or ground water
from below the ground surface. Water contained in subsurface clay layers is squeezed out, and
the clay is compacted by overlying sediments. Subsidence can result in the disruption of
structures that are sensitive to slight changes in elevation, such as wells, canals, and sewer
pipelines, as well as changes to surface drainage, reductions in aquifer storage, and the formation
of earth fissures.
Subsidence as a result of groundwater withdrawal is one of the major environmental constraints
facing the Coachella Valley, although most evidence of regional subsidence has been observed in
the eastern Coachella Valley. Since the late 1970s, the regional demand for groundwater has
exceeded the supply, and the ground water basin in the Coachella Valley is currently in a state of
overdraft.
Ground surface fissures that occurred in 1948 near the intersection of Adams Street and Avenue
52 near the City of La Quinta are believed to have resulted from subsidence. CVWD’s
“Coachella Valley Water Management Plan” (November, 2000) indicates that, between 1996 and
1998, as much as 7 centimeters of subsidence occurred in the Palm Desert area. Continued
overdraft of the limited groundwater resource is expected to result in declining groundwater
levels, which will likely increase the rate of subsidence.
Mitigation of this hazard will require a regional approach to groundwater conservation and
recharge. The U.S. Geological Survey plans to take precise elevation measurements every 2 to 3
years to determine the extent of subsidence in the eastern Coachella Valley. Continued
monitoring of well water levels will also help assess the relationship between groundwater
overdraft and regional subsidence. (Please refer to the Water Resources Element for more
information about groundwater overdraft and recharge strategies.)
Wind Erosion
For thousands of years, strong winds emanating from the San Gorgonio Pass have been blowing
and redistributing sand deposits in a southeasterly direction along the central axis of the
Coachella Valley. This portion of the valley floor is largely composed of silty to sandy soils,
which are easily picked up and transported by the wind. The wind erosion hazard is further
compounded by the Whitewater River watershed, which crosses the most erosive zone of the
valley floor. Most of the sand particles contained within the watershed are sharp and abrasive, as

they have not been rounded or smoothed by stream activity. Wind erosion is further perpetuated
by urban development, especially when surface soils are disturbed and/or left unprotected.
As shown in Exhibit V-2, most of the General Plan planning area is located within a severe wind
erosion hazard zone. Blowing sand constitutes a significant local environmental hazard, as it
abrades and damages buildings and motor vehicles, fills drainages, driveways and yards, limits
visibility on roadways, and requires substantial expense for sand removal and clean-up. Wind
erosion and blowing sand also contribute to a significant health threat associated with the
suspension of fine particulate matter in the air. Mitigation of this hazard has required the
development and implementation of a multi-faceted mitigation plan, which includes the
submittal of a dust control plan to the City prior to development. Other mitigation measures
include watering of a site during construction, the installation of retaining walls and landscaping
materials, and the application of chemical soil stabilizers (please refer to the Air Quality Element
for more information about local and regional dust control measures).

Regional Tectonic Setting
The City of Cathedral City is located at the northwestern extreme of the Salton Trough, a broad
structural depression, which is the landward extension of the San Andreas rift zone. This
spreading ridge is responsible for separating Baja California from mainland Mexico and creating
the Gulf of California. As the ridge spreads, it forces the Pacific tectonic plate to move
northwestwardly into the North American Plate. These plates are sliding past one another at a
rate of about 50 millimeters per year, and their movement is responsible for generating the
earthquakes that occur in southern California.
Approximately 70% of the movement between the Pacific and North American Plates is
accommodated by the San Andreas fault. The remaining motion is distributed between the
Eastern Mojave Shear Zone and several sub-parallel faults of the San Andreas fault zone,
including the San Jacinto, Whittier-Elsinore, Newport-Inglewood, Palos Verdes, and several
offshore faults.
Measuring Seismic Activity
The severity of an earthquake is generally classified according to its magnitude or intensity.
Magnitude, a measure of the amount of energy released when a fault ruptures, is measured on the
Richter scale. Each whole number step in magnitude represents a ten-fold increase in the
amplitude of the waves on a seismogram and about a 31-fold increase in the amount of energy
released. For example, a 7.5 Richter magnitude earthquake is about 31 times more powerful than
a 6.5 Richter magnitude earthquake.
Intensity refers to a qualitative estimate of the damage caused by an earthquake at a given
location and is commonly measured on the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale. This scale
includes twelve levels of intensity, ranging from I (tremor not felt) to XII (total damage) and is
based upon observed damage to structures, other physical events, and human reactions to the
quake. The intensity of ground shaking at a given site is a complex interaction of many factors,
but of primary importance are the magnitude of the earthquake, the distance from the epicenter,
the type of bedrock or soil materials between the epicenter and the site, and site-specific
topographic features.
To evaluate the potential seismic hazards of a particular locale, geologists, seismologists,
engineers and urban planners refer to the maximum credible earthquake (MCE) and maximum
probable earthquake (MPE). The MCE is defined as the largest earthquake likely to occur on a
fault or fault segment. The MPE represents the earthquake most likely to occur in a specified
period of time, such as 30 or 500 years. The MCE and MPE magnitudes for a given fault are
used to establish structural safety criteria and are generally estimated by seismologists based on
the length of the fault, style of faulting, and other fault characteristics.

Seismic Activity in the Planning Area
To prevent development from being built directly on the trace of an active fault, the California
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act of 1972 has defined the following terms: active,
potentially active, and inactive faults. An “active” fault is one which has proven displacement of
the ground surface within about the last 11,000 years (within the Holocene Epoch). A
“potentially active” fault shows evidence of movement within the last 1.6 million years, although
the U.S. Geological Survey has modified this time period to 750,000 years. An “inactive” fault is
one which has not moved in the last 11,000 years, as determined by direct geologic evidence,
such as trenching.
Several faults are capable of generating strong ground shaking in the General Plan planning area.
Those capable of generating peak horizontal ground accelerations of about 0.1g and greater
(Modified Mercalli Intensities greater than VII) in the planning area are listed in Table V-1
below. Faults crossing the planning area are illustrated in Exhibit V-3.

San Andreas Fault Zone
The San Andreas fault is the principal boundary between the Pacific and North American
tectonic plates and controls the seismic hazard for southern California. In southern California,
the San Andreas fault system is comprised of three segments:
         1) Mojave Desert segment,
         2) San Bernardino Mountains segment, and
         3) Coachella Valley segment.
Only the Coachella Valley segment crosses the General Plan planning area. It consists of two
fault strands: the San Andreas Fault strand (also known as the North Branch or Mission Creek
fault) which occurs north and east of the planning area; and the Banning Fault strand (also
known as the South Branch fault) which extends across the northern portion of planning area.
The two strands merge southeast of the planning area, near the City of Indio, and continue
southeastwardly toward the United States-Mexico border. Paleoseismic studies indicate that the
last surface-rupturing earthquake on the Coachella Valley segment occurred around 1680. Prior
to this, earthquakes on this fault occurred at an average recurrence interval of every 220 years.
The segment is creeping at a rate of about 25 mm/year (+/-5 mm/year), and has more than a 22%
probability of rupturing before the year 2024.
The Banning Fault of the Coachella Valley segment is capable of producing a magnitude 7.4
earthquake that would result in peak horizontal ground accelerations of between 0.45 and 0.9g in
Cathedral City. Within the planning area, it consists of several splays that branch off from one
another, then come together. In the vicinity of the Edom Hill Landfill, just east of the planning
area, the fault consists of one main fault and at least three secondary splays. The Banning Fault is
believed to have been responsible for generating the magnitude 5.9 North Palm Springs
earthquake in 1986. Although the ground surface did not rupture during this quake, ground
fractures occurred on the northern side of the fault, between Whitewater Canyon and State
Highway 62.
The Mission Creek fault is capable of generating a magnitude 7.1 earthquake, with resultant peak
ground accelerations of between 0.4 and 0.8g in the City. Geotechnical studies in the Desert Hot
Springs area have documented several breaks that can be traced upward to within one foot of the
ground surface. It is estimated that the City would be susceptible to ground accelerations greater
than 1.0g during a simultaneous rupture of the Banning and Mission Creek faults.
The Coachella Valley segment joins the San Bernardino Mountains segment to the northwest of
the planning area, near the northwestern limits of the City of Desert Hot Springs. The San
Bernardino Mountains segment has a slip rate of about 24± mm/year (+/-5 mm/year), with an
average recurrence interval of 146 years. It is estimated that this segment has a 28% probability
of rupturing before year 2024.
Garnet Hill Fault
The Garnet Hill fault extends from the vicinity of Whitewater Canyon to possibly as far as Edom
Hill, and crosses the planning area just north of Interstate-10. Given its orientation and proximity
to the San Andreas fault, it has been suggested that the Garnet Hill fault is associated with, and
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                              Geotechnical Element
                                                                                                    V-12

                                                                      General Plan/Geotechnical Element
perhaps even an ancestral branch of the San Andreas fault. Although the California Division of
Mines and Geology has not designated it as an active fault, the Garnet Hill fault can act as a
plane of weakness and move in response to an earthquake on another nearby fault. Ground
fractures associated with the 1986 North Palm Springs earthquake were reported along the trace
of the Garnet Hill Fault and indicate that a near-surface response of weak surfaces occurred at
depth. Although the fault is not designated an Alquist Priolo Fault Zone, the City has the option
to designate a Fault Hazard Management Zone along this fault to restrict or regulate future
development across the trace of the fault.
San Jacinto Fault Zone
The San Jacinto Fault Zone extends from the City of San Bernardino, southeasterly toward the
Brawley area, where it continues south of the U.S./Mexico border as the Imperial Fault. The fault
is south of the Planning Area. The San Jacinto Fault zone has a high level of historic seismic
activity, with at least ten moderate (6 > M > 7) earthquakes having occurred between 1890 and
1986, and an estimated recurrence interval of between 150 and 300 years. Available data suggest
that the slip rates of the fault’s northern segments are about 12± mm/year (+/-6 mm/year), and
slip rates of the southern segments are about 4± mm/year (+/-2 mm/year). The San Bernardino
and San Jacinto Valley segments are estimated to have a 37% and 43% probability, respectively,
of rupturing before the year 2024.
East Mojave Shear Zone
The East Mojave Shear Zone includes several northwest-trending faults in the southern Mojave
Desert that collectively appear to be accommodating between 9% and 23% of the motion
between the North American and Pacific tectonic plates. Paleoseismic studies indicate that
several earthquakes have occurred in this area during the Holocene Epoch, including the 1992
Landers earthquake, which occurred on the Johnson Valley fault. A magnitude 7.3 earthquake on
one of these fault segments is expected to generate a peak horizontal ground acceleration of
between 0.1 and 0.15g and MMI seismic intensity of between VII and VIII in Cathedral City.
Pinto Mountain Fault
The Pinto Mountain fault is an east-trending fault that is traceable for approximately 47 miles,
from its junction with the San Andreas fault eastward to just east of the City of Twentynine
Palms, north of the planning area. The Pinto Mountain fault is considered active, and Holocene
Epoch movement has been documented. The fault is capable of generating a maximum credible
earthquake of 7.0, which would generate peak horizontal ground accelerations of between 0.15
and 0.3g in the General Plan planning area.
Seismically Induced Geotechnical Hazards
Liquefaction
Liquefaction is the total or substantial loss of shear strength of loose, sandy, saturated sediments
in the presence of ground accelerations greater than 0.2g. When liquefaction occurs, the
sediments involved behave like a liquid substance. This phenomenon can result in structural
distress and/or failure due to settlement, the buoyant rise of buried structures, the formation of
mud spouts and sand boils, and seepage of water through ground cracks.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                              Geotechnical Element
                                                                                                    V-13

                                                                                   City of Cathedral City
                                                                      General Plan/Geotechnical Element
As illustrated in Exhibit V-4, the potential for liquefaction to occur is low to none throughout
most of the planning area, principally because groundwater in the Cathedral City area typically
occurs 150 to 200 feet below the ground surface, too deep to saturate the loose sediments of the
valley floor. Although depth to groundwater may be less than 50 feet adjacent to the Santa Rosa
Mountains in the southern planning area, the alluvial sediments in this area are coarse-grained
sand, gravels, cobbles, and boulders that are not susceptible to liquefaction.
The potential for liquefaction is moderate to high, however, in the northern portion of the
planning area, in the vicinity of the San Andreas Fault. In this area, the fault acts as a barrier to
groundwater and causes groundwater to occur at shallow depths. Historically, springs and
flowing wells have been observed at Willow Hole and areas just north of the planning area.
During well drilling in 1981, groundwater was reported at depths of less than 30 feet northeast of
Willow Hole. Given that groundwater occurs within 50 feet of the surface in this area, the
unconsolidated alluvial sediments are highly susceptible to liquefaction. Shallow groundwater
has also been reported along the northern side of the Banning Fault, but sediments in this area are
semi-consolidated to consolidated and not susceptible to liquefaction.
Seismically Induced Settlement
Strong ground shaking can cause the densification or compaction of soils, resulting in local or
regional settlement of the ground surface. Settlement can damage structures and foundations, as
well as pipelines, canals, and other grade-sensitive structures. The potential for seismically
induced settlement to occur is controlled by the intensity and duration of ground shaking and the
density of subsurface soils.
As shown in Exhibit V-5, the valley floor, which contains loose, recently deposited sediments, is
highly susceptible to this phenomenon. Development proposed in these areas should include
subsurface geotechnical investigations, which evaluate the potential for seismically induced
settlement. Proper foundation design and the densification or compaction of subsurface soils
prior to development can mitigate some of the damaging effects associated with settlement.

Seismically Induced Slope Instability
It is estimated that a ground acceleration of at least 0.10g in steep terrain is necessary to generate
earthquake-induced rock falls. Given that several faults are capable of generating peak ground
accelerations of this magnitude in Cathedral City, there is a moderate to high potential for
seismically induced rock falls and landslides to occur in the General Plan planning area.
Susceptible areas are illustrated in Exhibit V-6, and include areas within and adjacent to the
slopes of the Santa Rosa Mountains and Indio Hills, particularly where the bedrock of the Santa
Rosa Mountains is intensely fractured or jointed. As shown in Exhibit V-6, nearly all of the areas
with a moderate or high susceptibility to slope instability are currently undeveloped. The East
and West Cathedral Canyon Washes act as a buffer between the slopes of the Santa Rosa
Mountains and development in the Cove, and would be expected to absorb much of the potential
damage from rock falls and provide some level of protection to existing habitable development.
Intense ground shattering can be expected at the top of Edom Hill and other narrow, steep ridges,
where topographical features can localize and focus the ground shaking at the ridge top.
Mitigation of these hazards can be best achieved by avoiding development on steep slopes and
enforcing appropriate building setbacks at the base of the slopes. Even engineered cut and fill
slopes constructed on the valley floor may be subject to failure if they are of sufficient height.
These slopes must be designed to resist seismically induced failure, and their design should be
based on site-specific soil stability analyses that include subsurface soil sampling and laboratory
testing.
Seiches
Seiches refers to the seismically-induced oscillation or sloshing of water contained in an
enclosed basin, such as a reservoir, pond, water storage tank, or swimming pool. This hazard is
dependent upon the frequency of seismic waves, distance and direction from the epicenter, and
design criteria of the enclosed body of water. Although damage from small bodies of water, such
as swimming pools, would be expected to be minor, damage to or failure of larger bodies of
water, such as water tanks and retention basins could result in the inundation of land and
structures downgradient, hinder efforts to suppress fires, and limit the supply of potable water
after a major earthquake.
The Desert Water Agency owns four water reservoirs, which are situated on elevated terrain
surrounding the Cathedral Canyon Cove in the Santa Rosa Mountains. Damage to and/or failure
of these tanks could result in inundation of homes and property in the Cove neighborhood. Two
water reservoirs owned by the Coachella Valley Water District are located on Flat Top Mountain
in the northern portion of the planning area. Although land downgradient from these tanks is
currently vacant, their damage or failure could impact future development. Design elements,
such as baffles and braces, are warranted to reduce the potential for seiches in tanks, open
reservoirs, and ponds where overflow or structural failure may cause damage to nearby
properties. The American Water Works Association (AWWA) Standards for Design of Steel
Water Tanks includes new criteria for the seismic design of water tanks.

Applicable Legislation
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act
Perhaps the most important piece of legislation related to the mitigation of earthquake hazards is
California’s Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act, which was signed into law in 1972.
The primary purpose of the act is to mitigate the hazard of fault rupture by prohibiting the
location of structures for human occupancy across the trace of an active fault. The Act requires
the state geologist to delineate “earthquake fault zones,” which show evidence of Holocene
surface displacement along one or more of their segments and are clearly detectable by a trained
geologist. The boundary of an earthquake fault zone is generally about 500 feet from major
active faults, and 200 to 300 feet from well-defined minor faults. The Act requires cities and
counties to withhold development permits for sites within an Earthquake Fault Zones until
geologic investigations demonstrate that the sites are not threatened by surface displacement
from future faulting.
The California Division of Mines and Geology (DMG) has completed Alquist-Priolo Earthquake
Fault Zone mapping for the General Plan planning area, which includes a fault zone along the
Banning Branch of the San Andreas fault, as illustrated in Exhibit V-3. Although the DMG has
not delineated an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone along the trace of the Garnet Hill fault,
the City may wish to establish its own Fault Hazard Management Zone around this fault due to
the possibility of ground fracture.
Uniform Building Code
The primary tool used by the City to ensure seismic safety in structures is the Uniform Building
Code (UBC). The UBC describes the minimum lateral forces needed to resist seismic shaking,
which are based on the area’s seismic zone, type of structural system, building configuration and
height, and soil profile of the structure and site in question. The San Andreas and San Jacinto
faults are defined as Type A faults by the UBC. The UBC is updated roughly every three years,
and was last updated in 1997. In accordance with state law, the City has adopted the most recent
version of the UBC.
Until recently, three different Uniform Building Codes were used throughout the United States,
each addressing the prevailing geologic conditions in different geographic sections of the
country. Beginning in 1994, the International Code Committee (ICC) began consolidating the
three codes into one. The new code is known as the International Building Code (IBC) and is to
be used nationwide. The State of California is currently involved in efforts to modify sections of
the International Building Code. Until the IBC is adopted by the State, cities and counties in
California are precluded from adopting it. It is anticipated that the State and City of Cathedral
City will adopt the International Building Code within the next several years, and upon adoption,
it will completely replace the UBC.
California Building Code
The California Building Code (CBC) is a modified version of the UBC, which is tailored for
California geologic and seismic conditions. It is included in Title 24 of the California
Administrative Code and includes stringent earthquake provisions for critical structures,
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                            Geotechnical Element

including public schools and hospitals. The CBC was last amended in 1998 and adopted by the
City in 1999.
Seismic Retrofitting
Most injuries and loss of life associated with earthquakes are related to the collapse of buildings
and structures. Particularly hazardous buildings include unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings,
wood frame structures, pre-cast concrete structures, tilt-up buildings, and mobile homes. Soft-
story buildings, which lack adequate strength due to too few shear walls, may also be subject to
damage or collapse.
Although the City does not maintain a seismic retrofit ordinance, it has evaluated potentially
hazardous commercial structures throughout the City. In 1984, State Assembly Bill (AB) 537
required all cities in California to identify and evaluate the seismic integrity of large-occupancy
commercial structures built before 1976, and to retrofit them as necessary. Given that the City of
Cathedral City was not incorporated until 1982, and most commercial development in the City
occurred after 1976, only a few potentially hazardous structures were identified and retrofitted.
Most were located within the downtown area and have since been demolished as part of the
Downtown Redevelopment project. Only one adobe commercial structure, a restaurant on Cree
Road, is still standing. The structure is exempt from AB 537 due to its limited size and
occupancy; however, signs have been posted at all entrances to inform patrons that the building
consists of unreinforced masonry. In the early 1990s, several industrial warehouses on Perez
Road were retrofitted with steel straps at the property owner’s discretion.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Although it is impossible to prevent earthquakes and other geologic hazards from occurring, their
destructive effects can be minimized. Comprehensive mitigation measures include the
identification and mapping of potential hazards, prudent planning efforts, enforcement of
applicable building codes, and expedient retrofitting of weak or dangerous structures. The City
will also need to rely on the regulations and guidelines set forth in the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake
Fault Zoning Act, State CEQA statutes, PM10 control plans, and the Uniform/International
Building Code. The Planning Department must assure that development proposals are thoroughly
evaluated with regard to geotechnical and seismic safety, and that all necessary site-specific
geotechnical studies are conducted and thoroughly evaluated.

FLOODING AND HYDROLOGY ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Flooding and Hydrology Element establishes the goals, policies, and programs that provide
the City with protection from potential flooding hazards, thereby protecting the public health and
safety of residents, businesses and visitors. The desert environment creates unique conditions
relating to flood control and protection from the 100 and 500 year storm. These conditions are
described below, and methods to manage or eliminate them are provided also.
The preservation of lands constrained by topography or drainage, including steep slopes, areas
rich in vegetation and cover, and alluvial plains and drainage channels greatly reduce runoff and
preserve the capacity of downstream facilities. Furthermore, the planned integration of on-site
stormwater detention facilities, where possible and appropriate, significantly reduces the needed
size of downstream facilities, while creating opportunities for groundwater recharge, and
enhanced open space and/or recreation areas.
BACKGROUND
The Flooding and Hydrology Element is related to several other General Plan Elements,
including the Geotechnical Element, the Hazardous and Toxic Materials Element and the
Circulation Element, which address the need for, and availability of, adequate access and
evacuation routes in the event of a major disaster or threat to the community. Policies and
programs set forth in the Land Use Element also have some impact on flooding issues, as they
direct the location of open space, essential public facilities, and developed areas, which
potentially may be severely damaged by flooding.
Chapter 73 of the Statures of California, 1939, requires that adjoining jurisdictions plan for
regional flood control. In addition, Government Code Section 8401(c) requires that local
governments plan, adopt, and enforce flood plain management through land use restrictions
when necessary. This legislation, also known as the Cobey-Alquist Flood Plain Management
Act, establishes requirements for receiving state financial assistance for flood control measures.
Finally, California Government Code Section 8589.5 and 65302 (g) require the mapping of areas
subject to inundation in the event of dam failures.
Regional Climatic Setting
The City of Cathedral City is located in the northern Coachella Valley and is flanked by the San
Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountains on the west, and the Little San Bernardino Mountains on the
east.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                           Flooding and Hydrology
                                                                                                   V-24
                                                                                   City of Cathedral City
                                                                    General Plan/Flooding and Hydrology
Annual rainfall is very low from the desert floor into the foothills, ranging from 4 to 6 inches per
year and averaging about 5 to 6 inches along the Little San Bernardino foothills. Summer
temperatures can occasionally exceed 125°F and winter temperatures seldom fall below freezing.
The mountains and upper elevations of the planning area are cooler, with an approximate 5°F
drop with every 1,000-foot increase in elevation.
Rains fall in the desert generally during the months of November through March, although short-
duration, high intensity storms also occur during the summer months of July through September.
High intensity storms can result in too much water falling at too rapid a rate, so that the ground
cannot effectively absorb the rainfall, causing sheet flooding. The benchmark storms used by the
Army Corps of Engineers to determine credible storm data include the storm of 1939, which
occurred over Indio on September 24th of that year, which generated 6.45 inches of rain in 6
hours. Tropical storm Kathleen, in September of 1976 also generated high rain amounts,
resulting in about 3 inches of rain in Cathedral City.
Development also increases flooding hazards, insofar as more development reduces the
permeable surfaces into which water can penetrate, and concentrates flows in both volume and
velocity.
Local and Regional Flood Control
The generation and management of stormwater runoff are typically divided into two separate
categories, local and regional drainage, which are ultimately interrelated. Local drainage is either
defined by the limited size of the drainage area or to the generation of runoff and facilities
capturing and conveying runoff from over a larger geographic area. Regional drainage ultimately
picks up and conveys local drainage through the careful integration of these two systems.
Potential flooding problems in the City and its planning area are related to a rise in the water
level of Whitewater River and its tributaries, to storm flooding on the alluvial fans, and to runoff
associated with the foothills of the Santa Rosa and Little San Bernardino Mountains. Minor
flooding and ponding of surface water also occurs on the relatively flat valley floor if the flood
control channels draining Cathedral Canyon (the East, West and North Cathedral Channels)
overflow or are unable to withstand heavy precipitation. The southern portion of the City also
receives flow from Palm Canyon Wash and Tahquitz Creek to the west, and Tramview Wash to
the southwest.
There are four watersheds which affect the City’s flood control. Each of these is briefly
described below:
I-10 North Watershed
The area north of Interstate 10, and the drainage areas which contribute to it, constitute this
watershed. The watershed area is primarily undeveloped land. The Long Canyon Wash and
Morongo Wash both contribute to this watershed.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                            Flooding and Hydrology
                                                                                                    V-25

                                                                                    City of Cathedral City
                                                                     General Plan/Flooding and Hydrology
The Big and Little Morongo Creeks drain the western portions of the Little San Bernardino
Mountains. Big and Little Morongo Washes join south of Pierson Boulevard in Desert Hot
Springs to form Morongo Wash, which enters the General Plan area as a wide braided network
of washes approximately 3/4 mile wide. Flows from the Long Canyon Wash join Morongo Wash
near 20th Avenue and Palm Drive about 1 mile north of the General Plan planning area. The
wash flows due south and crosses I-10 and the railroad right of way, through three bridges and
some small culverts, where most of the flows join the Whitewater River. Additional flows
continue in a southeasterly direction between I-10 and the railroad tracks, to the Date Palm Drive
overpass, where flows are forced southerly, across the railroad tracks and into the Vista
Chino/Date Palm Drive intersection. Flows from the Long Canyon Wash also pass through
Willow Hole, cross Date Palm Drive north of I-10, then flow between I-10 and Varner Road in a
southeasterly direction to Thousand Palms and I-10, east of the planning area.
I-10 to Whitewater River Watershed
This watershed is bounded on the north by I-10, and on the west and south by the Whitewater
River. This area of the City is the most rapidly growing in terms of new housing units. Levees
along the Whitewater River, as well as concrete armoring on its east side, protect development to
the east, in the City. Areas of special concern within this watershed includes the area bounded by
McCallum Way, Avenida Maravilla, and Vista Chino; the area within the area bounded by Date
Palm Drive, Ramon Road and Tortuga; the intersection of Vista Chino and Landau Boulevard;
Dinah Shore Drive between Date Palm and Cathedral Canyon; and Gerald Ford at Plumley,
where poorly defined drainage areas cause nuisance flows. Most flood water in this watershed is
conveyed on existing City streets.
Eagle Canyon Watershed
This watershed is located west of the West Cathedral Canyon Channel, and south of Palm
Canyon Wash. Eagle Canyon and a number of other mountain drainages are the primary source
of flood waters in this watershed. The Eagle Canyon flows cross developed areas before
discharging into the Cathedral Canyon North Channel. A dam has been planned for Eagle
Canyon to control flooding, but has not been constructed. Preliminary engineering and right of
way studies have been completed. The Flood Control District has budgeted funds for additional
studies and engineering in this area.
Cove Area Watershed
This watershed is bounded by the Cathedral Canyon Channel East and West, and the Whitewater
River. The East and West channels convey flood waters on either side of the Cove, and discharge
into the Whitewater River. A number of culverts have been constructed through the channel
levees to convey flows from the Cove to the channels. The streets generally have no curb and
gutter, and are not sufficient, therefore, to contain the 100 year storm.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                             Flooding and Hydrology
                                                                                                     V-26
                                                                                   City of Cathedral City
                                                                    General Plan/Flooding and Hydrology
Regional Flood Control: the Coachella Valley Water District and the Riverside County
Flood Control District
The Coachella Valley Water District (CVWD) and the Riverside County Flood Control District
are responsible for the management of regional drainage within and in the vicinity of Cathedral
City, including rivers, major streams and their tributaries, and areas of significant sheet flooding.
Both Districts are empowered with broad management functions, including flood control
planning and construction of drainage improvements for regional flood control facilities, as well
as watershed and watercourse protection related to those facilities. To carry out their mandates,
the Districts also have powers of taxation, bonded indebtedness, land and water rights
acquisition, and cooperative partnerships with local, state, and federal agencies. An elected
Board acts as the official decision-making body of CVWD, while the Riverside County Board of
Supervisors is the official decision-making body of that District.
Cathedral City Regulation of Local Drainage
While CVWD and the County have the primary responsibility for regional facilities, in close
cooperation and coordination with the City, it is the City that remains directly responsible for the
management of local drainage. The effectiveness with which the City and Districts manage
drainage issues will have a direct effect on the scale, complexity and cost of future flood control
facilities. The cost-effectiveness of prevention and on-site management should be actively
integrated into community land use planning and regulation, recognizing significant physical and
financial constraints in many areas of the city.
FEMA and the Federal Flood Rate Maps
The Federal Emergency Management Agency maps areas of significant potential flooding for the
City and its planning area. The FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) serve as the basis for
determining the need for and availability of federal flood insurance. Exhibit V-7 is a compilation
of the data presented in three FIRM Community Panels (maps) currently dated July, 1999. Each
of the applicable flood zones is briefly described below.
A:       Areas of 100-year flood: base flood elevations have not been determined.
AE:      Areas of 100-year flood inundation; base flood elevations not determined.
AF:      Floodway areas in Zone AE (mostly contained by levees).
A?:      Estimated continuation of Zone A not mapped by FEMA.
X:       Areas of 500-year flood; areas of 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot
         or with drainage areas of less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from 100-
         year flood.
None: Areas determined to be outside 500-year flood plain or where flood hazards are
         undetermined.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                            Flooding and Hydrology

The FEMA maps for the City of Cathedral City planning area designate lands within the 100-
year flood plain (Zone A). These areas include washes, channels and areas subject to sheet flow
flooding. The maps do not cover the northern portion of the General Plan area and some of the
Agua Caliente tribal lands within the City limits.
The FEMA maps show that the 100-year flood zone for the Whitewater River is generally
confined to the area along the channel of the river and its tributaries.
Areas of 100-year flood inundation also occur locally in Cathedral Cove. The 500-year flood
limits cover a large portion of the central portion of the City, and the older residential and
commercial section in Cathedral Cove. Most of East Palm Canyon within the City limits is
located within the 500-year inundation area.
Flooding in the planning area consists primarily of shallow flooding associated with Morongo
Wash and the West branch of Salvia Wash. A significant amount of flow also emanates from the
Long Canyon wash, which separates Edom Hill from Flat Top Mountain, in the Willow Hole
area. Because of the confined nature of this canyon, floodwaters in these areas move at relatively
high velocities, with potential to do considerable damage.
Significant improvements in the northern portion of Cathedral City have been proposed by the
Coachella Valley Water District. Amendments have not yet been approved by FEMA, but
CVWD expects that these proposed changes, when implemented, will reduce the flooding hazard
in this area.
Cathedral City Comprehensive Storm Drain Master Plan
The current Cathedral City Comprehensive Storm Drain Master Plan, prepared in March, 1990,
is a strategy for the construction, maintenance and funding of storm drainage improvements in
the City for all four watersheds. The Plan analysis includes coordination with the plans of other
agencies having jurisdiction, including the Riverside County Flood Control District and CVWD.
Ultimately, the coordinated development of the City’s Plan and those of the two District will
result in a comprehensive approach to the protection of property in the City from flood waters.
The Master Plan has been implemented by the Master Drainage Plan ordinance and serves as the
operational tool for technical guidelines and developer requirements regarding site retention or
installation specifics. Financial plans for City sponsored projects, however, have not been
implemented.
Backbone Drainage Systems
Capital projects such as dikes, levees, channels, and debris and detention/retention basins have
been constructed to manage project-specific, community and regional drainage systems in the
community. Designing, financing and constructing these facilities are significant challenges and
important opportunities. Methods of flood controls and their costs are weighed against the
economic impacts likely to result from major flooding, in some areas, flood control

improvements are frequently necessitated by development itself, which creates its own runoff
management problems.
Whitewater River Channel
The Whitewater River Channel is the main drainage facility in the city and the Coachella Valley.
At Cathedral City, the Whitewater River drains approximately 720 square miles, and generates a
100-year storm discharge of approximately 37,000 cfs and a standard project discharge of
approximately 78,000 cfs. The Coachella Valley Water District is continuing its program of
channel revetment (concrete armoring of channel walls) to protect the channel from stormwater
erosion.
Cathedral Canyon Channel
The Cathedral Canyon Channel originates at the City’s western corporate limit, near Golf Club
Drive, and flows from west to east, draining into the Whitewater River at the City’s eastern City
limit.
East Cathedral Canyon Channel
The East Cathedral Canyon Channel flows eastbound along the Cove area directly into the
Whitewater River. Portions of the channel, which were originally lined by the County prior the
City’s incorporation, have recently (1999) been revetted by the City at East Palm Canyon Drive.
West Cathedral Canyon Channel
The West Cathedral Canyon Channel flows along the west boundary of the Cove area, slowing
from south to north and feeds into the Cathedral Canyon Channel. The Channel is under the
jurisdiction of the Riverside County Flood Control District.
Areas in the City that have received flood control improvements are those subject to potentially
destructive floods with a probable frequency of at least once every 100 years (100-year flood).
Significant capital investments have been made in the community where these threats occur,
including the revetment discussed above. Improvements have been completed over a long period
of time, and in the case of the West and East Cathedral Canyon Channels, date back to 1950.
Mid-Valley Stormwater Channel
The Mid-Valley Channel is a regional flood control facility, planned as a concrete-lined
trapezoidal channel along the foot of the northeastern facing slopes of the Palm Springs Sand
Ridge. The Coachella Valley Water District has completed the planning and design of the
project. The channel will have a sandy bottom wherever possible to enhance percolation of
runoff.
The proposed channel route will begin southeast of a retired landfill and septic tank disposal
field located at the northern extension of DaVall Drive, and will flow to Avenue 42 in Indio
between Washington Street and Country Club Drive.

                                                                   General Plan/Flooding and Hydrology
The “benefit area” portion of the City of Cathedral City is limited to the area south of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, east of Date Palm Drive, north of Ramon Road and west of the city
limits at DaVall Drive.
Specific Plan No. 89-40, which was approved by the City Council in April, 1990, requires the
provision of drainage easement to allow runoff to feed into the Mid-Valley Channel. The
Specific Plan provides a combination retention area/park site of approximately 15 acres to be
located at the eastern extreme of the planning area adjacent to the Southern Pacific right-of-way.
The Mid-Valley project area is not identified as a flood hazard zone by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA). However, analysis prepared by Bechtel Engineering for CVWD
indicates that development in the project area, without the benefit of the 100-year on-site
retention, would generate a storm discharge of 4,827 cfs (cubic feet per second) in the vicinity of
Ramon Road east of the City, and 7,201 cfs at Monterey Avenue in Palm Desert. Storm
discharge at the Coachella Valley Channel in La Quinta would total 20,837 cfs, indicating the
potential for the drainage area to generate significant stormwater runoff once development
occurs.
Testifying to the effectiveness of the City’s 100-year storm retention program for new
development in the project area, mitigation is expected to reduce the 100-year Stormwater
discharge at Ramon Road to 1,280 cfs, Monterey Avenue to 1,426 cfs, and Coachella Valley
Channel to 12,690 cfs.
A proposed addition to the Mid-Valley Channel would pick up portions of the Morongo Wash
drainage in the northeast sphere, north and south of I-10, as part of the Cathedral City
Comprehensive Storm Drain Master Plan.
Local Drainages and Facilities
Local drainages can pose a significant flood hazard to existing and future development in the
City. These include the Eagle Canyon wash and several unnamed washes on the southern end of
the City, which contribute to localized flooding along the East Palm Canyon corridor.
Currently (2001), only two true storm drains exist in the City. A small storm drain is located at
Landau Boulevard and Ramon Road, which feeds into the Whitewater River. The other, Line 1,
is located southeast of Rio del Sol, and is about 1/3 completed. The City’s Storm Drain Master
Plan includes a number of detention and retention basins, storm drain pipelines south of I-10 and
north of the Whitewater River, an Eagle Canyon debris basin, and several improvements in the
Cove. The City, CVWD and the Union Pacific Railroad are also working on the design of a
railroad bridge and Mogongo Levee, south of interstate 10, which will remove a large portion of
lands currently in flood zone “A” from the flood hazard north of Verona Road.
The Cathedral City Comprehensive Storm Drain Master Plan (1990) presents proposed drainage
systems, conceptual design and cost estimates and financial analysis for funding techniques for
future implementation.

                                                                                                   V-31

Land Use and Flood Control
Thoughtful and appropriate land use planning and development is one of the most effective and
direct methods of controlling flooding and limiting threats to lives and property. Consistent with
other primary goals of the community, land use planning can call for the preservation of natural
vegetation in the foothills and mountains, which function as natural water sheds for local
drainage and ground water recharge, and can affect the volume of stormwater and debris that
reach downstream facilities.
Land use decisions also impact the potential for damage to property, and injury to people in the
City. The analysis of development proposals to determine the appropriate type and location of
structures near major drainages and in areas subject to sheet flooding can reduce or eliminate
damage or injury. Development should be strictly regulated, and should include prohibitions on
the construction of structures for human habitation within drainage areas. Protection measures
may include raising the finished floor level about the flood depth projected for the surrounding
area and providing protection against scouring. Until such time as flood protection is provided
which removes areas from threats of flooding, development in these areas must be carefully
regulated and designed to FEMA standards.
Wildlife Habitat and Recreation in Flood Control Facilities
Stormwater facilities can also be viewed as an opportunity for multiple uses, including recreation
and wildlife habitat. Washes, detention/retention basins and channels should be designed to
capitalize on the open space and recreational opportunities they represent. In addition to
integrating hiking and equestrian trails into these facilities, these areas can offer meaningful
areas for passive enjoyment and habitat for a broad variety of desert animals and plants. They
can also serve as an effective buffer between the built and natural environment, and provide open
spaces for neighborhoods (please also see the Community Image and Urban Design Element).
NPDES Program -- National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
The Clean Water Act of 1972 set goals to restore and maintain water quality by reducing "point
source pollution" such as pollutants from industry and sewage treatment facilities. In 1987,
amendments to the Act shifted focus to polluted runoff, requiring states to reduce discharges into
our waterways. These amendments required the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to
formally regulate polluted runoff just as it regulates industry and sewage treatment plants - with
permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). The NPDES
program requires communities with populations exceeding 100,000 to apply for a municipal
permit. Municipal permits require cities and counties to eliminate or control "non-point source
pollution."
In most states, including California, the state administers the NPDES permitting program, rather
than the EPA. Nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards administer the program for
California. Portions of Riverside County fall under the jurisdiction of three of these Boards: the
Santa Ana, the San Diego, and the Colorado River Basin Regional Water Quality Control
Boards.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                           Flooding and Hydrology
                                                                                                   V-32
                                                                                     City of Cathedral City
                                                                      General Plan/Flooding and Hydrology
Recognizing that this regulation would affect them all, the Flood Control and Water
Conservation District, the County of Riverside, the 23 Riverside County cities and the Coachella
Valley Water District joined forces to apply for joint NPDES municipal permits, rather than
separate ones. This has allowed the "co-permittees" to share resources, eliminate duplicate
efforts, and minimize program costs to the public.
The District’s service area includes portions of three major river basins: the Santa Ana, the Santa
Margarita and the Whitewater, of which the City of Cathedral City is a part. The Colorado River
Regional Board has issued an NPDES municipal stormwater permit to the District and its
respective co-permittees, including Cathedral City.
The program emphasizes pollution prevention, control measure activities, utilization of existing
resources and programs, and coordination with regional and state compliance activities. The
goals of these activities include the following:
    •    Eliminate illicit connections and illegal discharges to the storm drain system;
    •    Promote public awareness and participation through the Program's education program -
         The StormWater/CleanWater Protection Program;
    •    Identify and control stormwater pollution created by industrial and commercial activities;
    •    Establish stormwater management programs for public agencies to reduce the amount of
         pollutants that enter and accumulate in storm drains;
    •    Identify and establish local regulatory control measures for activities that can pollute the
         storm drain system, such as new development and construction, and residential,
         commercial and industrial activities;
    •    Monitor wet and dry weather flows to identify the origin, types, and concentrations of
         non-point source pollutants;
    •    Increase existing municipal efforts to clean streets, collect solid waste, and prevent used
         oil and other hazardous wastes from entering storm drains;
    •    Develop local ordinances to establish legal authority for cities and counties to regulate
         stormwater discharges.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The enforcement and implementation of regional and City Master Drainage Plans will ultimately
represent the primary tools for the City in implementing the goals, policies and programs
contained herein. The improvement contained in the Master Plans will control the regional
drainage pattern so that it can be better managed. The Master Drainage Plans will also impact the
potential for development in areas subject to flooding. It is also important that regulations
contained in the Municipal Code, including the Zoning Ordinance and Public Works standards,
reflect the programs and projects included in the Master Plans.

NOISE ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Noise Element is to coordinate the community’s land uses with the existing
and future noise environment, and to design measures intended to minimize or avoid community
exposure to excessive noise levels. As the City grows, so does the potential for land use conflicts
which can result in an unacceptable noise environment. Through the implementation of the
policies and programs in this Element, current and future noise impacts can be greatly reduced or
avoided entirely.
BACKGROUND
The Noise Element is directly related to the Land Use and Circulation Elements. It also has a
direct relationship with the Economic and Fiscal Element, since low noise levels are a
fundamental characteristic of a resort residential community, and the City’s relatively quiet,
peaceful atmosphere can be considered a major community asset.
The noise environment can have a significant influence on the health and comfort of the
community. In general, the noise levels in Cathedral City’s residential neighborhoods are
average, typical of quiet rural areas. Motor vehicles are the major source of continuous,
excessive noise in the City. Primary noise generators include traffic on Interstate-10, East Palm
Canyon Drive, Date Palm Drive, Vista Chino, Palm Drive, Varner Road, Edom Hill Road and
Ramon Road. Freight rail service along the Southern Pacific Railroad, parallel to I-10, is also
responsible for generating excessive noise. High noise levels resulting from commercial aviation
at the Palm Springs International Airport also occasionally have an intrusive impact on the
community’s noise environment. However, recently completed expansion of airport runways to
the northwest is expected to reduce airport noise exposure in Cathedral City to acceptable levels.
Other noise generators include construction activities, industrial operations, lawnmowers, and
home appliances. Sensitive receptors within the planning area include schools, a library, and a
medical facility.
Issues to be addressed in the Noise Element are identified in subsection (f) of the California
Government Code Section 65032, which requires that the Noise Element define and evaluate the
community’s noise problems. Section 21083.1 of the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) requires the adherence to the State Guidelines and allows cities to determine whether a
development project will have a “significant effect on the environment,” ranging from traffic
noise in a residential neighborhood to unacceptable noise generated by the equipment at a
commercial shopping center. The State requires the adoption of a noise control ordinance be for
the resolution of local noise complaints.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                                  Noise Element
Amended June 24, 2009                                                                           V-37

                                                                                City of Cathedral City
                                                                           General Plan/Noise Element
The California Department of Health Services has prepared a Model Community Noise Control
Ordinance as a model for use by local jurisdictions. The City of Cathedral City has such an
ordinance in place (Chapter 11.96 of the City Municipal Code).
Community Noise Equivalent Level
The definition of Noise is unwanted or undesired sound. The combination of noise from all
sources near and far is known as the Ambient Noise Level. A very sudden change in air pressure
from the immediate “normal” atmospheric pressure results in airborne sound. For purposes of
this discussion, the ambient noise level at a give location is termed “environmental noise”.
In order to understand environmental noise, some familiarly with the physical description of
noise is necessary. Frequency range, intensity/loudness and temporal/time-varying aspects are
the primary physical characteristics of sound. The decibel (dB), A-weighted level (dBA), and
Community Noise Equivalency Level (CNEL) are all used to describe and numerically weigh
noise. Each of these measurement scales are briefly described below.
The decibel is the unit of measurement describing the amplitude, or strength of sound. The A-
weighted decibel approximates the subjective response of the ear to a noise source by
discriminating against the very low and very high frequencies in the spectrum. The Community
Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) is the average of the intensity of a sound over a 24 hour period,
with corrections for time of day. The time of day corrections results in the addition of five
decibels to sound levels in the evening from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m., and the addition of 10 decibels to
sound levels at night between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. It is necessary to make these adjustments
because of the decrease in background noise levels during the evening and night hours when
compared to daytime hours. People are therefore more sensitive to noise during these times, and
sounds are weighted accordingly. During evening and night hours, tolerable noise levels should
be 5 to 10 dBA lower, and the CNEL number is weighted accordingly.
Ranges and Consequences of Noise
Noise sources are classified as either “line source” (a busy street) or “point source” (a
commercial compressor). A number of factors affect the noise as it travels through the air,
including temperature, wind speed and direction, hard and soft ground surfaces, and landscaping
and walls. This is particularly important when considering the noise generated by a roadway,
insofar as these factors can mitigate or intensify the noise level.
Normal conversation is roughly 55 dB at five feet of separation, whereas a loud engine noise is
about 100 dB. Most everyday sounds occur in the range of 40 to 100 dB. Doubling the sound
energy of a noise source only increases the decibel rating by 3 dB, due to the logarithmic nature
of the sound measuring (decibel) scale; however, because of the internal mechanism of the
human ear and how it receives and processes noise, a sound must be nearly 10 dB higher than
another sound to be considered twice as loud. High noise levels can affect everything from
property values and economic productivity to psychological health.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                                   Noise Element
Amended June 24, 2009                                                                            V-38

                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                                            General Plan/Noise Element
When there is an increase in the difference between background or ambient noise and the noise
generated from a particularly intrusive source such as, traffic, a barking dog, aircraft or industrial
operations, adverse reactions to noise generally intensify. Noise control measures should reduce
noise by 5 to 10 dBA in most circumstances to effectively lower the perceived sound. Loud,
short duration noises from barking dogs and low-flying aircraft, for example, therefore generally
have little impact upon the CNEL levels, because of the averaging techniques used in this
measuring technique.
The Existing Cathedral City Noise Environment
Motor vehicle traffic in the City of Cathedral City is the primary source of noise. Aircraft traffic
also contributes negatively to the noise environment, to a smaller but occasionally significant
extent. Also, the northern portion of the City is substantially impacted by the U.S.
Interstate-10/Southern Pacific Railroad corridor. Other sources of community noise include
mechanical equipment serving commercial and industrial land uses.
Motor Vehicle Noise
Vehicular traffic, including automobiles, trucks, buses, and motorcycles, is the major noise
source measured (2001) within the City. Cars generate noise from engine vibration, the
interaction of tires and the roadway, and the exhaust system. Noise produced by traffic fluctuates
in relation to its volume, the percentage of trucks, and the average speed. Table V-2 lists the
existing noise levels at several locations. The table also shows the anticipated noise levels at
General Plan buildout.
Interstate-10 and Southern Pacific Railroad Lines
In addition to traffic along Highway 111 and the other major arterial roadways impacting the
City, both incorporated and sphere areas are impacted by rail and vehicular traffic associated
with the Southern Pacific Railroad line and U.S. Interstate-10, respectively. The passage of
trains, although an intrusive noise event, occurs only periodically and with limited duration.
More significant is the influence of Interstate-10 traffic noise, which increases at night due to
persistent truck volumes combined with an atmospheric nighttime temperature inversion. This
inversion tends to reduce the acoustic attenuation typical of distance over open terrain, making
noises seem louder. Train traffic currently (2001) results in 40 trains per day through the
planning area, with an average of 80 cars per train, and a train length of 5,200 feet.
On a CNEL basis, the calculated combined impacts associated with 2001 Interstate-10 and
Southern Pacific railroad traffic place the 59.7 dB and 75.1 dB contours at 800 feet and 100 feet
south of the railroad lines, respectively. The 65 CNEL contour is approximately 430 feet from
the tracks and the 60 CNEL contour about 770 feet from the tracks.
Aircraft Noise
Aircraft noises impacting the community come from commercial and general aviation operations
at the Palm Springs International Airport, located west of the City Limits. The updated Airport
Master Plan and Part 150 Noise Compatibility Study evaluated airport operations, monitored
portions of the noise environment, and projected future noise impacts from planned expansions
and increased operations. The flight tracks, or patterns, that aircraft are assumed to follow in the
abovementioned noise study indicate limited overflights in Cathedral City.

For year 1993 conditions, the peak season 65 CNEL noise contour extended into Cathedral City,
primarily between Ramon Road and Dinah Shore Drive, just past Cathedral Canyon Drive
(Exhibit V-9). A review of the noise sensitive receptor locations points out the potential for
current peak season aircraft noise impacts to existing residential receptors, but does not indicate
existing noise impacts to any schools, libraries, or health care facilities.
With the mandated changes to the noise standards for jet aircraft, the noise contours for 1999
conditions are substantially smaller (Exhibit V-9). The peak season 65 CNEL noise contour will
remain entirely within the City of Palm Springs, stopping short of the intersection of Sunny
Dunes Road and San Luis Rey Drive, without any change to the operation of the airport (other
than necessary to meet increased demand).
The Palm Springs International Airport noise contours to the south will decrease substantially
with the recently completed runway 13R-31L extension being 1,500 feet to the northwest. The
runway extension to the north will move the average location of the take-off and landing
operations northerly, away from Cathedral City. The peak season 65 CNEL noise contours for
2005 and 2025 are projected to remain entirely within Palm Springs.

Mechanical and Industrial Noise
There are other noise generators within the City, in addition to noise generated by automobile
traffic and aircraft, which could create significant noise related dissonance. Activities such as
construction and automotive repair and other related industrial operations can result in
unacceptable noise levels. Loading and materials transfers and other acoustically unscreened
operations will also raise issues of impact and compatibility.
 Significant noise can also result from the operation of mechanical equipment, including
refrigerator units and heating/air conditioner equipment in commercial centers. Noise from
roof-mounted equipment can travel to bordering neighborhoods and impact sensitive receptors.
Fans and compressors which emit a constant hum can adversely affect the quality of life in a
residential neighborhood. The design and location of equipment can mitigate this potential
impact, and should be included in the review of new development projects by the City.
The Community Noise and Land Use Compatibility Model
The standard used for maximum outdoor noise levels in residential areas in California and in the
City is a CNEL of 65 dBA. Within the City of Cathedral City, the applicable limit one-hour
average for outdoor noise levels in residential areas is 55 dBA (ordinance 11.96.030). The noise
impacts are “unmitigated” or represent the worst-case noise impact without any obstruction of
the noise. A number of tools are available to the City to substantially reduce noise impacts, as
discussed below.
Sensitive receptors include residences, schools, libraries, churches, hospitals and nursing homes,
and destination resort areas. Golf courses, parks, and other outdoor activity areas can also be
sensitive to noise levels. Less sensitive land uses include commercial and industrial centers,
hotels and motels, neighborhood ballparks and other outdoor spectator sport facilities. The least
sensitive uses are heavy commercial and industrial uses. Table V-3 depicts the CNEL ranges of
allowable exterior ambient noise levels for various land uses at buildout.

Cathedral City Noise Ordinance
The City has established noise standards by adopting an amendment to its Municipal Code.
Chapter 11.96 of the Cathedral City Municipal Code establishes community-wide noise
standards and emphasizes the value of an acceptable noise environment. It provides regulations
for noise measurement and monitoring and cites special provisions of, and exemptions to, the
ordinance. It is intended to regulate excessive noise from existing uses and activities, and to
serve as a references guide for identifying other pertinent noise regulations. The Cathedral City
Noise Ordinance provides definitions of key terms and establishes exterior noise level standards
on a time-of-day basis along with adjustments for intensity and duration. It also provides
regulations for noise measurement/monitoring. Violations of the Noise Ordinance are defined as
a nuisance and subject to the procedures, remedies and penalties for such nuisances. The Noise
Ordinance regulates existing uses and activities, while the noise standards in the General Plan are
intended to guide the location of future noise generators and sensitive land uses.
Noise Measurements and Computer Modeling: Existing and Projected Future Noise Levels
The noise levels at 100 feet from each road’s centerline were determined by modeling the
roadway with the Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (RD-77-108), developed by the
Federal Highway Administration. The model includes a number of parameters modifiers,
including traffic volume, vehicle mix and speed, and roadway geometry. The resulting noise
levels are then weighted, added for a 24 hour period, and output as a CNEL measurement. CNEL
contours are then located for the 60, 65 and 70 CNEL location. A detailed description of the
modeling done for this General Plan is included in the General Plan EIR and its appendices.
Increasing traffic volumes are expected to generate the leading future noise impacts to the
community. The Circulation Element Traffic Study was used to determine roadway volumes at
buildout. The average posted speed limits and a percentage mix of light and heavy truck traffic
along the roadways was included in the modeling data, making the projected traffic noise data
more accurate.
Project-specific site design will significantly reduce noise impacts below those projected, and
therefore, these estimates are considered conservative and unmitigated. Table V-4 lists the 1999
and preferred General Plan buildout noise contours along the City’s major roadways.

Mitigating Noise Impacts
Preserving a quiet noise environment can be accomplished through thoughtful transportation
planning, land use planning, project design mitigation, simple and sophisticated technology, and
acoustical barriers applied to community noise compatibility Site planning and design standards
should provide direct noise impact mitigation for areas particularly impacted by noise. The use
of buffer zones consisting of earthen berms, walls and landscaping between sensitive land uses
and roadways and other noise sources is an effective tool for noise mitigation. Building
orientation, particularly the placement of windows, can significantly mitigate impacts on
residential land uses. A number of materials are also available which can baffle noise sources,
and result in effective noise mitigation. When development proposals include sensitive receptors
planned next to the impacted roadways described in Table V-4 above should be required to
complete noise analysis, which will include mitigation measures, to ensure that the buildout of
the project will not result in unacceptable noise levels.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Consistent with its character as a resort residential community, the City of Cathedral City
benefits from an essentially quiet noise environment. Highway and major roadway noise sources,
however, clearly impact the City. Future efforts in this regard should focus on the preservation of
the peaceful and quiet atmosphere enjoyed presently by residents and visitors to the community.
The Land Use Element, and particularly the assignment of land use designations will have a
critical role to play in the City’s ability to control noise for sensitive receptors in the future.
Another level of land use control is provided by zoning designations, which provide
development standards that reduce impacts and enhance compatibility. The Circulation Element
has also been designed, where possible, to protect the City’s residential areas from excessive
traffic noise and to assure appropriate noise levels. The ongoing coordination of these two
elements of the General Plan must play a key role in the City’s consideration of development
projects, public works improvements, and City sponsored construction.

HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC MATERIALS
ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Hazardous and Toxic Materials Element describes methods to safely manage hazardous and
toxic materials in the community. This Element reinforces the City’s concern for the protection
of its residents and visitors from adverse health and other impacts associated with these
materials. Policies and programs are established which assure effective and safe use, storage, and
transport of hazardous and toxic substances in the City of Cathedral City.
BACKGROUND
The rapid and innovative development of new technologies and chemical processes has resulted
in the introduction of new and potentially hazardous materials. Accidental spills, illegal
dumping, and other uncontrolled discharges of these materials can pose a significant threat to the
community and its environment.
The Air Quality and Water Resources Elements are directly related to the Hazardous and Toxic
Materials Element in their efforts to preserve clean air and protect against water resource
contamination. This Element is also related to the Land Use Element, with the potential of
hazardous material use, storage, or disposal to undermine land use compatibility. The Public
Safety Element also plays an important role in establishing policies and programs to protect the
general public from adverse impacts associated with toxic and hazardous materials. The
Biological Resources Element may be negatively impacted by improper management of these
materials.
It is mandated by California Government Code Section 65302(g) that the General Plan of a
community address safety issues, including but not limited to hazardous materials.
Responsibility for regulating and monitoring the management, disposal, labeling, and use of
toxic and hazardous materials lies with a variety of federal. State, and local agencies, including
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California Office of Health Planning and
Development, and the Riverside County Department of Health. AB 2948 (Chapter 1504, Statutes
of 1986), commonly known as the Tanner Bill, authorizes counties to prepare Hazardous Waste
Management Plans (HWMP) in response to the need for sage management of hazardous
materials and waste products. The California Regional Water Quality Control Board
(CRWQCB), as well as the Coachella Valley Water District, maintains information concerning
contaminated water wells and groundwater. The state and federal Environmental Protection

Agencies (EPA) and the State Department of Health also provide information concerning
specific hazardous waste sites.
There are no large industrial or commercial users of hazardous materials in the City, only a few
identified hazardous/toxic material small quantity generators are associated with commercial,
and quasi-industrial and medical operations. These have the potential to be associated with
accidental spills, purposeful illegal dumping, air emissions, and other uncontrolled discharges
into the environment. Improper use and management of these materials pose a significant
potential threat to the community and its environment. The small quantity generators in the City
include gasoline service stations, auto repair shops, dry cleaners and medical clinics.
Products, chemical and purified chemical compounds, and elements that re considered hazardous
or toxic exist in wide variety and are used in households, commercial businesses and industrial
operations and processes. They range through home and pool related chlorine products, chemical
fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides, stored fuels and waste oil, chemical solvents and lubricants,
and a variety of medical materials.
Known or identified underground fuel storage occurring at locations in the City, where leakage
has occurred in the past has been mostly confined to gasoline service stations and commercial
operations which maintain on-site fuel tanks for their delivery vehicles. The Regional Water
Quality Control Board maintains listings for such sites, and monitors them as required. The U.S.
EPA requires all service stations to retrofit or replace underground storage tanks with double-
walled construction. In the City Sphere-of Influence various industrial activities, including
machining, wind turbine servicing, and materials research, also have the potential for
uncontrolled discharge of hazardous materials.
Hazardous Waste and Sewage Disposal
An area of recent concern in the Coachella Valley and the Cathedral City area has been the
impact of long-term septic tank use on groundwater resources. Contamination problems have not
been particularly evident, although impacts on the lower portions of alluvial cones with extensive
upslope residential development are areas of concern. Monitor wells in the Cove area show that
elevated levels of nitrate and viruses from subsurface septic systems have been detected, but do
not currently exceed County regulations (see also the Water Resources Element). The use of
septic tanks in these generally porous soils and on sloping gradients can result in concentrated
flows of seepage to the lower portions of these areas and can result in contamination of the water
table. Septic tanks are still commonly in use in Cathedral City and their use will continue to pose
varying threats to ground water.
Hazardous Waste Management Plans
The City of Cathedral City coordinates with appropriate county, state and federal agencies in the
identification of hazardous material sites, and their timely cleanup. In order to manage these
issues, the City may establish and maintain information on these sites, and periodically monitor
facilities and operations that produce, utilize or store hazardous materials in the city. By staying

involved in multi-agency monitoring of illegal dumping in the City, conferring in the regulation
of underground storage tanks and septic systems, and regulating the transport of hazardous
materials through the community, the City can better protect against potential hazards associated
with hazardous materials and wastes.
AB 2948 (Chapter 1504, Statures of 1986), commonly known as the Tanner Bill, authorizes
counties to prepare Hazardous Waste Management Plans (HWMP) in response to the need for
safe management of hazardous materials and waste products. The Riverside county HWMP was
adopted by the Board of Supervisors and approved by the California Department of Health
Services in 1990. The County HWMP identifies the types and amounts of wastes generated in
the County and established programs for managing these wastes.
To comply with Health and Safety Code Section 25135, the Riverside County HWMP assures
that adequate treatment and disposal capacity is available to manage the hazardous wastes
generated within the jurisdiction, and addresses issues related to manufacture and use. This plan
was developed jointly by the County, Cathedral City and other cities within the County, the
State, the public and industry to address the disposal, handling, processing, storage and treatment
of local hazardous materials and waste products.
Preparation of the HWMP included extensive public participation. Its policies require the
coordination of County efforts with state and federal agencies in the identification and
establishment of programs for managing these wastes. As an integral part of the County HWMP,
the City of Cathedral City hazardous waste management policies for the General Plan are
basically extensions of the County Plan and are hereby incorporated by reference. Currently
(2001), there are several sources of information concerning hazardous waste sites in the City of
Cathedral City area.
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB) and the Coachella Valley
Water District, maintain information concerning contaminated wells and groundwater, The state
and federal Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA) and the State Department of Health also
supply information concerning specific hazardous waste sites and their locations. The California
Department of Industrial Relations, Cal-OSHA Division, regulates the proper use of hazardous
materials in industrial settings. Private database screening and documentation services are also
available, which will search, extract, and summarize reports on contaminated site recorded in
various state and federal databases.
Household Hazardous Waste
Residential use of household chemicals, automobile batteries and used oil, paint and similar
materials result in hazardous waste. The County offers a number of services for the disposal of
residential hazardous wastes. These include the “ABOP” (Antifreeze, Batteries, Oil and Latex
Paint) site, located at the Palm Springs Fire Department Training Center in Palm Springs, which
will dispose of these materials for residential users. The facilities will take up to 5 gallons or 50
pounds of materials per trip, and all materials must be clearly marked and sealed. The site is
open every Saturday, and will only take materials from individuals. No business wastes are

permitted. The City’s Environmental Conservation Manager is working with the County to
establish an ABOP site in Cathedral City.
City residents may also dispose of their used motor oil by placing it next to their garbage or
recycling container at the curb on their regular collection day. Up to two gallons per pick up is
permitted. Waste Management of the Desert collects the oil, and disposes of it.
The County also organizes Household Hazardous Waste collection days throughout the year at
fire stations and city corporation yards across the Valley. The schedule is posted and advertised
periodically.
Residents may also dispose of waste motor oil at several Used Motor Oil Drop-Off Centers
located in Cathedral City, including Chief Auto Parts, Crystal Chrysler Center, Firestone Tires,
Pep Boys and The Lube Shop.
Hazardous Materials Response
Hazardous and toxic materials are determined critical by the County Department of Health, and
the County and the City can require property owners to test, temporarily close and/or remove all
hazardous liquids, solids or sludge located on the site. Leaking underground storage tanks must
be removed by contractors having Hazardous Waste Certification and a General Engineering
license. Between cessation of storage and actual closure, monitoring is generally required by the
site’s operating permit. When soils contamination is detected, the clean up procedure to be
followed, the degree or level of cleanliness required by the regulator, and the method of
treatment (if permitted) will be directed by the County Health Hazardous Materials Division
and/or the Regional Water Quality Control Board.
The City of Cathedral City has the opportunity to coordinate with appropriate county, state, and
federal agencies in the identification of hazardous material sites, and the active regulation of
their timely cleanup. The Cathedral City Fire Station #412, located within the city limits, has the
capacity of authority as a First Response Team; the agency responsible for the Hazardous
Response Plan is the County of Riverside Health Hazardous Materials Division and/or the
Regional Water Quality Control Board.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The City of Cathedral City has the responsibility to coordinate with the appropriate agencies in
the identification of hazardous material sites, and the active regulation of their timely cleanup.
This element can most efficiently be implemented through regular consultation with the
RWQCB and the County Health Department and by updating information on hazardous material
sites, monitoring facilities that utilize or produce hazardous materials within the City. The City
should also remain current regarding the monitoring and regulating of underground storage tanks
and septic systems, and regulating the transport of hazardous materials through the community.

will be essential. Regular consultation and coordination between the City Emergency
Preparedness Director and responsible county and state agencies is also appropriate. Processes
for determining appropriate levels of local, County and State personnel and facilities will also be
critical. The goals, policies and programs of this element help to direct the planning and

                                    PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES
This chapter of the General Plan addresses the public services and facilities needed to support development in the
City of Palm Desert. General Plan elements found in this chapter that discuss these services and facilities include
Water, Sewer and Utilities, Fire and Police Protection, Schools and Libraries, Health Services, Emergency
Preparedness, Public Building and Facilities, and Arts and Culture. The levels of service needed for residential,
commercial and industrial development is directly related to the intensity of development in the community. The
economic life of the City is tied to the level of services, the types and intensities of land use, and the levels of
demand for services and the revenue generating potential of urbanizing areas.

WATER, SEWER AND UTILITIES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Water, Sewer and Utilities Element establishes City policies and programs pertaining to
domestic water, sewage treatment, and utility services. The provision of these services is
essential for the orderly growth and development of the community. In addition to water and
sewer services, this element addresses natural gas, electricity, telephone, cable, and solid waste
management. The element identifies goals, policies and programs necessary to provide a
coordinated system of services to the City at full buildout.
BACKGROUND
The Water, Sewer and Utilities Element is directly related to the Land Use Element, in that new
development must be planned in conjunction with the extension and availability of essential
infrastructure. Other related elements include Water Resources, Energy and Mineral Resources,
and Flooding and Hydrology.
According to California Government Code Section 65302(d), the General Plan is required to
address the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources, including water.
Related to this is the availability and utilization of natural resources, such as natural gas and
electricity. This element satisfies, in part, the requirement for a Conservation Element, and
addresses other utilities as allowed by Section 65303. California Government Code Section
65103(c) requires that the City review its capital improvement program annually to assure
consistency with the General Plan. This Element provides an effective and meaningful
framework from which to comply with this law.
Domestic Water
Groundwater Resources
The primary groundwater repository for the Coachella Valley is the Whitewater River Subbasin,
which encompasses nearly 400 square miles. Most of the City of Cathedral City overlies the
Palm Springs subarea of the Whitewater River Subbasin, which contains an estimated 4.6 million
acre-feet of groundwater in storage in the first 1,000 feet below the ground surface. The easterly
portion of the City occurs over the Upper Thermal subarea, which extends as far east as the
Salton Sea. The entire Thermal subarea (including the Upper and Lower portions) contains
approximately 19.4 million acre-feet of groundwater in storage in the first 1,000 feet below the
surface. The northernmost portion of the planning area, north of Interstate-10 and south of the
Indio Hills, overlies the Thousand Palms subarea. This subarea contains approximately 1.8
million acre-feet of groundwater in storage.

The hydrological and geophysical characteristics of these subareas are discussed in greater detail
in the Water Resources Element of the General Plan, as are methods of groundwater
replenishment and consumption rates in the Coachella Valley.
Coachella Valley Water District
The Coachella Valley Water District (CVWD) provides domestic water to development north
and east of the Whitewater River Stormwater Channel. CVWD utilizes deep wells to extract
groundwater from the Whitewater River Subbasin. Within the planning area, CVWD’s domestic
water system includes 12 well sites, 2 booster stations, 3 water storage reservoirs, and water
mains up to 30 inches in diameter. Major water trunk lines serving the planning area include
those beneath Date Palm Drive, Vista Chino, 30th Avenue, Ramon Road, Dinah Shore Drive and
Gerald Ford Drive. Nearly all development in CVWD’s service area, south of I-10, is connected
to its water delivery system.
Land north of Interstate-10 in the planning area is also located within CVWD’s service area.
However, given that development in this vicinity is sparse and largely limited to scattered
residences, CVWD’s domestic water infrastructure in this area is minimal. With the adoption of
the North City Specific Plan in 2009, timing for construction of domestic water infrastructure
will need to be moved forward to accommodate anticipated development. Two water storage
reservoirs are located off Varner Road, approximately one-half mile west of Date Palm Drive.
The reservoirs are connected to development south of I-10 by a 30-inch water main, which
extends south along Varner Road and Date Palm Drive, then crosses beneath the interstate. Other
water mains north of I-10 are limited to those at the north of the planning area, on 20th Avenue
west of Mountain View Road. CVWD has indicated that it will be able to expand its water
delivery system to serve future development in this area, should the demand for such facilities
warrant it.
Desert Water Agency
The Desert Water Agency (DWA) provides domestic water to development south and west of the
Whitewater River Stormwater Channel. Nearly all development in DWA’s service area,
including development in the Cove and the downtown district, is connected to its water delivery
system. Within the planning area, DWA’s water delivery system includes 3 wells, 2 booster
stations, 4 water storage reservoirs, and water mains ranging in size from 2 to 24 inches in
diameter. Two of the wells are located at the Whitewater River and Ramon Roads, and the other
is located at Cathedral Canyon and Kieley Roads. Each is capable of producing between 1,800
and 2,400 gallons of water per minute. The booster stations are located in the Cove and are
capable of pumping between 200 and 400 gallons per minute. The reservoirs are located in the
immediate vicinity of the Cove, and their capacities range from 100,000 to 500,000 gallons.
Major trunk lines include those under East Palm Canyon Drive, Cathedral Canyon Drive, and
Perez Road.
Wastewater Collection and Treatment

Coachella Valley Water District
The Coachella Valley Water District provides wastewater collection and treatment services to
lands north and east of the Whitewater River Stormwater Channel. Wastewater is conveyed
through sewer lines ranging from 4 to 24 inches in diameter.
The major wastewater conveyance facilities in the planning area include 15-inch and 24-inch
sewer trunk lines, which extend along Date Palm Drive. From Date Palm Drive, the 15-inch line
continues east on Gerald Ford Drive, and the 24-inch line continues east along the Whitewater
River Stormwater Channel, where it feeds into the Cook Street Wastewater Reclamation Plant in
Palm Desert. The Cook Street Wastewater Reclamation Plant currently has a capacity of 20
million gallons per day (mgd). CVWD continually increases the capacity of its wastewater
reclamation facilities by constructing new treatment ponds, aeration plants and other structures.
Land north of Interstate-10 also occurs within CVWD’s service area. Development in this area is
sparse. All wastewater disposal in this area is currently accommodated through private septic
systems. However, with the adoption of the North City Specific Plan in 2009, timing for
construction of wastewater collection and treatment facilities will need to be moved forward to
accommodate anticipated development. CVWD operates wastewater collection and treatment
facilities in Thousand Palms, to the east of the City.
Desert Water Agency
DWA’s service area encompasses lands south and west of the Whitewater River Stormwater
Channel. DWA’s wastewater collection system utilizes sewer mains ranging in size from 8 to 18
inches in diameter. DWA does not operate a wastewater treatment plant. Instead, its wastewater
collection system is connected to CVWD’s sewer system by two lift stations at the following
locations: 1) Date Palm Drive and Buddy Rogers Drive, and 2) Cathedral Canyon Drive near
Kieley Road. Wastewater collected by DWA is gravity-fed to these lift stations, where it joins
CVWD’s sewer system and is conveyed to the Cook Street wastewater treatment plant in Palm
Desert.
All residential development in the Cove continues to rely on individual septic systems for
wastewater disposal. DWA has indicated that it has enough capacity available in its existing
sewer conveyance system to manage waste generated in the Cove, and limited development in
the area, including the recently restored St. Louis Church, has been connected to DWA’s sewer
conveyance system. The City and DWA are actively involved in planning future sewer
connections in the Cove and the Downtown Redevelopment Area, and are evaluating methods of
financing these improvements.
Septic Usage in the Planning Area
Although much development in the planning area is connected to the CVWD and DWA systems,
some development continues to rely on septic systems for wastewater disposal. Homes in the
Pioneer Ranch, Dream Homes and Cove neighborhoods, for example, are currently without
sewer service. Efforts are underway to connect older neighborhoods and other developed areas
that are currently served by septic systems. As mentioned above, the St. Louis Church, located in
the Cove, was recently connected to DWA’s wastewater collection system, and DWA has
indicated that it has sufficient capacity to serve other development in the Cove.

The greatest impacts to groundwater quality are expected to occur where poorly maintained
septic systems serve large populations in high densities. Community sewer systems provide
excellent protection of groundwater resources, since they provide for the swift removal of raw
sewage materials.
Tertiary Treated Water
In response to increasing demands for groundwater supplies in the Coachella Valley, CVWD has
implemented the use of tertiary (third-stage) treated wastewater for the irrigation of golf courses
and other landscaped areas. Traditionally, wastewater is treated to secondary levels and
reintroduced into the groundwater table through percolation ponds.
With tertiary treatment techniques, wastewater undergoes an additional stage of treatment, which
renders it suitable for irrigation and contributes to water conservation efforts. The Cook Street
wastewater treatment plant has a tertiary water capacity of 10 mgd, which is expected to be
expanded to 15 mgd in the next few years.
Other Utilities
Electricity
Southern California Edison (SCE) provides electricity to much of coastal, central, and southern
California, including the Cathedral City General Plan planning area. SCE derives its power from
a number of sources, including cogeneration, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar, and wind sources.
Its most important generating facilities are: 1) the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station
(SONGS), a jointly owned project with San Diego Gas & Electric and the cities of Riverside and
Anaheim, and 2) the Big Creek hydroelectric system, a complex of hydroelectric facilities
located on the western slope of the Central Sierra Nevada Mountains, which comprises
approximately 90% of SCE’s hydroelectric generation capacity.
SCE offers a wide range of programs which promote energy conservation and help residential
and business consumers reduce their electricity costs. These include rebates for customers who
install energy-efficient home appliances, air conditioners, insulation, and insulated windows.
SCE’s Design and Engineering Services department conducts technical analyses to encourage
and facilitate the creation and use of new energy-
efficient technologies. The company showcases a
variety of residential, business, industrial and
agricultural energy solutions at seven technology
centers, and offers training courses and special events
to present these solutions to the public. SCE also
provides a number of tools to analyze and improve
energy usage habits, such as home and small business
energy surveys, which evaluate energy usage and
recommend methods for reducing energy costs and
consumption. A series of low-income programs
provides qualified customers with energy-efficient

refrigerators, discounted cooling systems, and weatherization services.
SCE’s facilities include high-voltage transmission lines, lower voltage distribution lines, and
substations, which “step down” voltage so that it can be distributed to homes and businesses.
SCE’s transmission system includes high-voltage lines rated at 500, 230, 115, 66, and 55
kilovolts (kV). These lines connect substations and feed into the distribution network serving
businesses, homes, and other electric power customers. Distribution lines are those rated below
55 kV. Electric power is transported to individual homes and businesses from substations
through 33 and 12 kV distribution lines. Some distribution lines are supported by wooden poles,
while others may be underground.
Within the planning area, SCE’s facilities include four substations, major transmission lines,
(particularly along Date Palm Drive, Landau Boulevard, Dinah Shore Drive and north of
Interstate 10 diagonally from southeast to northwest) and distribution lines which carry
electricity to homes and businesses. An additional substation, located west of the planning area,
may provide service to Cathedral City residents.
SCE has indicated that it will be capable of serving future development in the planning area.
According to regulations established by the state and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, transmission systems must have sufficient capacity to maintain reliable and
adequate service to customers. Planning for future electricity infrastructure involves determining
the need for additional facilities, assessing potential environmental impacts, preparing
applications for necessary regulatory permits, and regulatory review and approval. SCE performs
annual five-year and ten-year growth and service forecasts to assure that its electrical
transmission system will be adequate to serve future populations.
Deregulation
In 1998, the State of California implemented legislation that deregulated its power industry. The
primary goal of deregulation was to enhance competition in the electric power industry and bring
a wider range of choices to consumers. The legislation mandated rate reductions from some
electric companies, allowed consumers of large, investor-owned utilities (like SCE) the option to
choose alternative electricity providers, and established a statewide Power Exchange where
electricity is bought and sold at wholesale prices. Under the current regulatory environment, SCE
is precluded from building electric power generation plants or selling any power it generates.
Instead, all electrical power generated by SCE is fed into the state’s power grid, and the
California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) regulates its day-to-day distribution.
The legislation froze rates charged by investor-owned utilities at 1996 price levels until no later
than March 31, 2002. By winter 2000, a significant price gap emerged between wholesale
electricity prices and maximum retail prices that utilities were permitted to charge, with
wholesale prices typically exceeding the maximum permitted retail prices. In essence, it became
cheaper not to provide electricity to consumers. As a result, many California communities have
experienced rolling blackouts to save on the state’s power grid. The ISO is responsible for
determining when blackouts are necessary. SCE makes every effort to implement blackouts on a
rotating basis so that the impacts of power service interruption are distributed geographically.
Rolling blackouts last no longer than one hour at each location.

An electric power supply problem exists in California, since the statewide demand for electricity
seems to be outstripping the combination of state and interstate supplies. Many interstate
suppliers who have sold electricity to California utilities in the past have experienced low winter
temperatures and precipitation in recent years, and hydroelectric and other power resources are
not as readily available as they once were. The construction of new power plants in California
also appears to be subject to regulatory barriers, including significant state and federal
participation in the environmental review process, which makes permitting difficult in some
cases. According to SCE staff, the California electric power crisis is expected to last through the
summer of 2002. The California Energy Commission and governor are expecting to approve
construction of enough new power plants to improve the situation by 2003.
Natural Gas
The Gas Company provides natural gas services and facilities to the City of Cathedral City. The
natural gas originates in Texas and is transported to the Coachella Valley through three east-west
trending gas lines, which cross the valley just north of Interstate-10 and continue west to Los
Angeles. These include one 30-inch line and two 24-inch lines, with pressures of 2,000 pounds
per square inch (psi).
High-pressure gas lines are typically steel pipes with pressures greater than 60 psi. Within the
planning area, major high-pressure gas lines are located within the rights-of-way of Date Palm
Drive, Vista Chino, Varner Road and Mountain View Road. Two high-pressure lines are also
located along East Palm Canyon Drive, one on the north side of the street and one on the south.
Medium-pressure distribution lines typically consist of plastic pipelines (older pipes may be
constructed of steel) with pressures less than 60 psi. Most residences are fed through pipelines
rated at 25 to 40 psi. The Cove and most other residential neighborhoods in the planning area are
connected to medium-pressure distribution lines.
Most development in the General Plan planning area is connected to the natural gas system;
however, several small pockets of development are not connected and use propane as an
alternative fuel source.
Telephone Service
Verizon, formerly GTE California, provides a wide range of residential and commercial
telephone services to the City of Cathedral City. Telephone services include local and long
distance services, calling cards, business 800 numbers, and voice mail. Verizon also provides
state-of-the-art data services such as internet and high-speed DSL data connections.
The backbone of Verizon’s communications system consists of central switching offices, which
are responsible for the connection of telephone and data transmissions. The City of Cathedral
City is connected to three central switching offices located outside the City limits, including the
following: 1) on the west side of DaVall Road, north of Gerald Ford Drive in Rancho Mirage, 2)

on the southwest corner of Sunrise Way and Amado Road in Palm Springs, and 3) on the east
side of Palm Drive at 1st Street in Desert Hot Springs. A smaller, unmanned sub-switching unit,
located on the east side of Date Palm Drive south of McCallum Way in Cathedral City, is fed by
the Rancho Mirage central switching office. All calls to the City are handled out of these
switching stations.
Cable Television
Cable television service is provided to the City through a franchise agreement with Time
Warner, which provides its customers with access to approximately 70 channels. The City also
has access to Channel 17, a public service channel, which it uses to broadcast City Council
meetings.
Access to this channel is not exclusive to Cathedral City, but is shared with other cities in the
Coachella Valley. The City is currently consulting with Time Warner to discuss the possibility of
having an exclusive public access channel in the future.
In March 2001, digital cable service, which produces high-quality digital pictures and sound,
became available in Cathedral City. Customers who lease digital converter channel boxes from
Time Warner have access to approximately 180 channels.
In May 2001, high-speed cable-modem data services were offered to customers in the northern
portion of the City. With cable-modem services, the computer modem is connected to the cable
line, rather than the telephone line. This state-of-the-art service offers numerous advantages to
customers: the cable-modem is always turned on and the time needed to connect to the internet is
eliminated, it operates at a significantly faster rate than the standard modem, and it does not tie
up the telephone line when in use. Time Warner expects to offer these services to the rest of the
City by the end of 2001.
Solid Waste Management
Waste Management of the Desert provides solid waste collection and disposal services to the
City of Cathedral City through an exclusive franchise agreement. Standard residential pick-up
occurs once a week, and commercial pick-up is offered up to six days per week. Additional
collection services are offered to large waste generators, such as restaurants and hotels.
Waste Management uses a two-cart automated collection system throughout Cathedral City.
Customers are provided with one bin for trash and one for green waste; the bins are lifted and
dumped into garbage trucks mechanically. Recyclables are placed in curb-side 18-gallon tubs,
which are lifted and dumped manually.
During 2000, a total of 38,974 tons of trash were collected in Cathedral City. Residential and
commercial trash collected in the City is stored in ”pods,” or large containers that function as
temporary transfer stations. When the pods are filled, they are transported by truck and dumped
at the Copper Mountain Landfill in Wellton, Arizona. The Copper Mountain Landfill receives an

average of 900 tons of solid waste per day. It has a remaining capacity of about 200 acres and a
future lifespan of approximately 50 years.
The Edom Hill Landfill closed in 2004. With the closure of this landfill, a transfer station has
been built and is operating. Solid waste is collected with automated compacter trucks, deposited
at the transfer station where it is sorted for recyclables, and then transported to the Lambs
Canyon or Badlands landfill. This landfill is prepared to accept solid waste from the Coachella
Valley immediately and is permitted to receive up to 4,000 tons of waste per day.
The Eagle Mountain Landfill and Recycling Center is planned for construction east of the
Coachella Valley, was approved by the Riverside County Board of Supervisors in 1997, and was
purchased by Los Angeles County. It is expected to have a total capacity of 708 million tons and
a life expectancy of 100 years; however, on-going litigation has delayed its opening. The
proposed Mesquite Landfill in Imperial County is expected to have a capacity similar to that of
the Eagle Mountain Landfill, but has also been delayed by litigation. Although both of these
landfills would be located in relatively close proximity to Cathedral City and may be available to
the City in the long-term, their futures remain unclear. A more viable, near-term alternative is the
Badlands Landfill, located northeast of the City of Moreno Valley off Highway 60.
Recycling
The City’s recycling program, mandated by AB 939, has proven beneficial in the preservation of
landfill space for non-recyclable materials. During 2000, a total of 3,590 tons of recyclable
materials were collected in Cathedral City. This includes 1,532 tons from residential curb-side
sources; 570 tons from commercial sources; and 1,488 tons of concrete and other debris from
construction sites. Green waste is recycled at BioMass in Thermal. Other recyclables, including
glass, plastic and newspaper are transported by a third party hauler to a recycling company in
Los Angeles.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The logical extension of public services is an integral component of land use planning. The
availability of high-quality services is also an important aspect of economic development, and
plays an important role in attracting commercial, industrial, hotel/motel, and other revenue-
generating development. To assure that public services and utilities meet the needs of the
community at buildout, it is essential that the City be actively involved in long-range facilities
planning, and routinely consult and coordinate with appropriate public and quasi-public agencies
and service providers.
In the near-term, the City will need to concentrate its efforts on pending service issues, including
the state-wide energy crisis and the potential connection of unsewered development to the sewer
system. The City recently adopted the North City Specific Plan, which, when implemented, will
guide the logical and cost-effective extension of water, sewer, and other utilities north of
Interstate 10. The City will need to keep abreast of technological advances, particularly in the
realm of digital and high-speed data transmissions, to assure that City residents and businesses
are offered the most state-of-the-art technologies.

FIRE AND POLICE PROTECTION ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The provision of adequate levels of fire and police protection is one of the most important and
essential functions of local government. It is the purpose of this Element to coordinate the
planning of the community with the demand for and availability of these services. The element is
also designed to define existing levels of fire and police protection services and to identify the
agencies which provide these services. The Element also provides policies and programs that,
through their implementation, are essential to in the continued provision of adequate long-term
public safety services for the entire community.
BACKGROUND
The Fire and Police Protection Element has a direct and important relationship to several other
General Plan elements, including Land Use, Circulation, Emergency Preparedness, Water
Resources, Health Services and Community Design Elements. The distribution and intensity of
land uses, accessibility, coordination of emergency responses, the availability of water to fight
fires and health services to treat the injured, and the provision of “defensible space” in urban
development are all tied to the effective provision of fire and police services.
Police and fire protection services are essential to the continued safety of this growing
community. The City of Cathedral City provides its own law enforcement and fire department,
and maintains cooperative/mutual aid agreements with other communities and agencies for
additional emergency response support.
A number of state regulatory codes focus on the importance of addressing the protection of the
community from natural and man-made hazards. Government Code Section 65302(g) requires
that a Safety Element or its equivalent be included in the General Plan to address measures
necessary to protect the community from risks associated with fire and other hazards and threats.
Public Resources Code 4125(a) states that the State Board of Forestry shall classify all lands
within the State for the purpose of determining hazards and addressing financial responsibility
for the prevention and suppression of fires. Unclassified lands fall under the jurisdiction of the
City or appropriate federal agency, such as the U.S. Bureau of Land Management or U.S. Forest
Service.
Cathedral City Fire Department
The City of Cathedral City operates its own fire and emergency services department, located at
32-100 Desert Vista Road. Fire Department staff includes 33 paid firefighters (including the Fire
Chief), 3 administrative personnel, 3 part-time fire inspectors, 10 to 15 reserve firefighters, and 4
code enforcement officers (plus one vacant position).
 Adopted July 31, 2002                                                   Fire-&-Police Protection Element
                                                                                                     VI-11

                                                                                     City of Cathedral City

Current staffing levels represent a ratio of about 0.77 firefighters to every 1,000 residents. The
International City/County Management Association (ICMA) recommends a target ratio of 1.89
firefighters per 1,000 residents. Because development in Cathedral City is predominantly low-
density residential, with limited light manufacturing facilities, the City has a relatively low fire
hazard risk. A ratio of 1.0 firefighters to every 1,000 residents would be adequate at this time;
however, the City should strive to increase its staffing level to approximately 1.5 staff members
to every 1,000 residents over the next 5 to 10 years. As development occurs north of Interstate-
10, the City can reallocate its firefighting staff, as necessary, based on demand for fire services
and an assessment of the population and risk hazards in the area.
Three fire stations are located within the City, including: 1) Station No. 411, at 36-913 Date
Palm Drive, 2) Station 412, at 32-100 Desert Vista Road, and 3) Station No. 413, at 27-610
Landau Boulevard. The stations contain a wide range of firefighting equipment and vehicles,
including three front-line engines, two reserve engines, one state Office of Emergency Services
(OES) vehicle, one water tender, four ambulances, and one hazardous materials (HAZMAT)
vehicle. One of the front-line engines is a 65-foot telesquirt, and one of the reserve engines is a
50-foot telesquirt. The Department maintains an automatic mutual aid agreement with the City of
Palm Springs and a county-wide agreement with the Riverside County Fire Department for
additional fire support, as necessary.
National Fire Insurance Organizations and the National Fire Protection Association formally
recommend a maximum emergency response time of five minutes. The City Fire Department
currently meets this standard. Within the last two years, the Cathedral City Fire Department has
been re-certified by the Insurance Services Office (ISO) as a Class 3 Department (Class 1 being
the top rating and Class 10 being the worst). The rating recognizes the department’s outstanding
communications system, the City’s high-quality water distribution system, an acceptable staffing
model, an excellent emergency response fleet, and the department’s ability to respond in a timely
and efficient manner. The last rating improved by one point, from a Class 4 to a Class 3. In order
to achieve an even better classification, the City will need to build a dedicated Fire Training
Center and increase staffing. If development occurs north of Interstate-10 without the
construction of a new fire station, the Class 3 rating would be potentially at risk due to longer
response times, inadequate staffing based on population, and potential risk hazards associated
with the area.
In addition to fighting fires, the Fire Department provides advanced life support and emergency
ambulance services, has code enforcement responsibilities, reviews development plans, and
performs construction inspections and fire investigations. It also sponsors community fire
prevention and public education programs, such as the installation and inspection of fire
detectors, and CPR and First Aid courses.
The Fire Department plays a key role in disaster preparedness and is responsible for
coordinating, in conjunction with other City departments, the City’s response to a wide range of
hazards and threats (please refer to the Emergency Preparedness Element for more information
about disaster preparedness).

Cathedral City Police Department
The Cathedral City Police Department was created in 1984 and is located in the Civic Center at
68-700 Avenida Lalo Guerrero. The Department is staffed by 55 sworn officers, 29 non-sworn
support and administrative personnel, and 6 reserve officers. Reserve officers are required to
serve a minimum of 24 hours per month and are usually assigned as the second officer in a patrol
car, although they may also transport prisoners or perform other assigned duties. Police vehicles
include 35 marked and approximately 15 unmarked cars.
With 55 sworn officers currently, the City currently provides approximately 1.4 officers for
every 1,000 residents, which is near the commonly recommended ratio of 1.5 officer for every
1,000 residents. The department anticipates filling approximately 13 additional positions,
ranging from police officers to a dispatch records supervisor, by the beginning of fiscal year
2001-02.
Community-Oriented Policing
The Police Department has adopted a Community-Oriented Policing philosophy, which is
founded upon a working partnership between the community and police to reduce and prevent
criminal activity and to identify neighborhood problems and their underlying causes. The City is
divided into three beat areas for the purpose of community-oriented policing. The North Beat
area generally extends from 30th Avenue to the northerly city limits, but also includes lands south
to Ramon Road between Date Palm Drive and Landau Boulevard.
The Central Beat area generally includes land between 30th Avenue and Dinah Shore Drive. The
South Beat area comprises all City lands south of Dinah Shore Drive. Each beat is further
divided into three sub-beats, and two police officers are assigned to each sub-beat. The officers
primarily function as emergency responders, but also address specific local policing problems,
such as traffic control and illegally parked or abandoned vehicles.
Within each beat is a satellite police office, known as a “Community Police Service Office,”
which is highly visible within the community and easily accessible to the public. The
Community Police Service Office for the North Beat is located at 68-100 Ramon Road. The
Central Beat office is located at 34-481 Date Palm Drive, near the intersection of Date Palm and
Dinah Shore Drives. The South Beat office is located at 69-038 East Palm Canyon Drive.
Each office is staffed by one sworn Community Alliance Officer and volunteer staff, and is
supported by six officers who are assigned to the sub-beat areas (described above). Each
Community Alliance Officer is responsible for developing a relationship with businesses and
residents in his/her beat area, and to be responsive to neighborhood problems and citizen
concerns.
Response times can vary significantly, depending on the nature of the incident and the location
of patrol cars at the time a 911 call is received. All calls are prioritized, and the response time is
contingent on the number of calls pending and their urgency. In 2000, the average response time
to a “hot” (emergency) call in Cathedral City, from the time the dispatcher contacted an officer

to the time the officer arrived at the scene, was approximately 4.2 minutes. The average response
time to an incident that “just occurred” was also 4.2 minutes.
Community-Based Policing
The Police Department sponsors and supports a variety of community-based policing programs
and other special community events. The Neighborhood Watch program educates residents about
implementing crime prevention strategies in their neighborhoods. Racing for Kids uses
motorcross racing to provides important activities for teenagers, while also serving as a forum
for educating vulnerable youth about alternatives to drugs and gangs.
The Police Explorers Program allows teenagers and adults ages 14 to 21 to learn about and
participate in a variety of law enforcement functions, including crime prevention support and
ride-along programs with officers. One officer is assigned to the D.A.R.E. program and brings a
message of drug resistance to school children. The Department also has assigned a School
Resource Officer.
The Citizens-on-Patrol (COP) program consists of volunteers who serve as the eyes and ears of
the police department and provide two patrols per day. Responsibilities include facilitating
towing abandoned vehicles, directing traffic at collision sites, looking for graffiti, and alerting
police to potential criminal activity. COPS volunteers also provide support to the Community
Police Service Offices and Community Alliance Officers. Volunteers are trained by sworn police
officers and attend monthly meetings. The program currently (2001) includes approximately 50
volunteers.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
As the City continues to grow, so will the need for additional police and fire protection. It is
difficult to predict exactly where and when new police and fire facilities will need to be
constructed, as this will depend upon the type, location and intensity of future development.
Nonetheless, the City will be responsible for monitoring growth patterns and responding to the
demand for additional public safety facilities and services. Considerations will include land use
and circulation patterns, the provision of water for adequate fire flows, the financing of future
fire and police stations, and the adequacy of emergency response times.

SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Schools and Libraries Element describes the City’s educational facilities, services,
resources, and the opportunities made available through the local school and library systems. The
Element also helps to anticipate and plan for future needs, and directs decision-makers to assure
that adequate and accessible educational facilities are provided to the community. The element
also identifies the City’s role in planning and siting new school and library facilities, and sets
forth policies and programs designed to enhance the educational experience of the City’s
residents.
BACKGROUND
The Schools and Libraries Element addresses the need for adequate and conveniently located
public lands for educational facilities, and therefore is directly related to the Land Use Element.
It is also related to the Circulation and Noise Elements, in the City’s efforts to protect schools
and libraries from excessive noise and traffic. This Element is also related to the Public Building
and Facilities Element in its definition and location of existing facilities.
California Government Code Section 65302(a) requires that, among other things, the General
Plan assess the general distribution, location and adequacy of educational facilities. Also
applicable is State legislation (AB 2926), effective January 1, 1987, which authorized school
districts to charge per square foot development fees to fund the construction and reconstruction
of public school facilities. The fees are paid by developers directly to the appropriate school
district prior to the issuance of building permits. In 2001, the fee for residential development was
$2.05 per square foot, and the fee for commercial development was $0.33 per square foot.
Public Education
The Palm Springs Unified School District (PSUSD) provides kindergarten through 12th grade
public educational services and facilities to the City of Cathedral City and other communities in
the western Coachella Valley. In 2001, PSUSD schools enrolled 21,505 students in 22 schools
and an independent study program. PSUSD operates eight schools within the Cathedral City
planning area, including four elementary, two middle, one high, and one continuation high
school. Many of the District’s schools are overcrowded and use temporary, portable buildings for
additional classroom space. The District plans to construct additional portable classrooms in
several Cathedral City schools over the next several years. The following briefly describes the
PSUSD schools located in the planning area.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                       Schools and Libraries Element

Library Facilities
The Cathedral City Public Library is a branch of the Riverside County Library System and is
located at 33-520 Date Palm Drive, at the southeast corner of Date Palm Drive and Dave Kelley
Road. The library, which opened in 1996, consists of a 20,000 square foot facility and contains
approximately 70,000 volumes. The library offers a full range of community programs and
services, including youth activities, computer facilities and workshops, literacy programs, a
community meeting room, and a comprehensive HIV/AIDS information center. An organization
known as “Friends of the Library” provides volunteer services and operates a bookstore within
the library.
Regional library facilities include
the College of the Desert Library
in Palm Desert, which is open to
COD students and the general
public, and includes a state-of-
the-art research system. The
medical library at Eisenhower
Medical Center in Rancho
Mirage (lending to non-hospital
staff is prohibited) and other
branches of the Riverside County
Library System are also available
for public use.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The City’s schools and library are important community assets and indicators of the
community’s social health and quality of life. These facilities are also important considerations
for many contemplating moving to the City. Schools and libraries are land use sensitive, and
their location requires consideration of many factors, including student safety, accessibility, and
impacts from excessive noise.
Public school districts are considered “responsible agencies” and have “lead agency” status for
the siting, planning and processing development plans associated with their own facilities. While
consultation with local jurisdictions is required, most decisions rest with the school districts.
Building, planning and design plans are processed and approved by the State Architect’s Office.
Nonetheless, the City of Cathedral City can assist and coordinate with the local school district
and state agencies to assure the provision of adequate educational facilities and services.
The General Plan provides the City with the opportunity to preserve and protect existing and
future school and library sites from excessive noise and traffic conditions, and to ensure
accessibility and compatibility with surrounding land uses.

HEALTH SERVICES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Health Services Element is to identify existing health care facilities and
services available to the citizens of Cathedral City. It is also designed to ensure that accessible
health care options are in place. Accessibility of health care relates not only to physical location
but also to affordability and the variety of services and their availability. Availability of high
quality health care options contributes greatly to the quality of life within a community, and to
the well-being and comfort level of its residents.
This Element also addresses issues associated with the location of new development and its
proximity to community health care facilities, which is especially important to the residents of
senior, group care or convalescent housing. The City has shown a particular interest in providing
accessible medical services and facilities, convalescent facilities and their services, as well as
facilities specializing in treatment of medical emergencies.
These include Home Health Care for those patients able to remain home but requiring
assessment and treatment by a skilled nurse or therapist; Continuing Care Centers offering sub-
acute (long-term) care or specialized intensive medical care for the seriously ill; and Hospice
services, including those in the home and caring for the terminally ill and their families.
It is also essential that accessibility to health care in emergency situations be considered, and that
land planning, emergency planning and circulation issues be taken into account so that even
under extreme conditions citizens can be assured that they will be able to reach, or be reached
by, health care and emergency medical professionals. For a more comprehensive discussion of
these issues, please see the Emergency Preparedness Element.
BACKGROUND
This element directly relates to other General Plan Elements including Public Buildings and
Facilities, Land Use, and Emergency Preparedness. It is also related to the Police and Fire and
Circulation Elements. As the City grows, land planning and circulation issues will determine
continued accessibility to health services, and the need for planning regarding expansion of these
services in order to serve all of Cathedral City’s neighborhoods is key.
Hospitals Serving Cathedral City
Cathedral City’s location in the upper Coachella Valley positions it between and near two of the
valley’s major health care providers. Each of these is briefly discussed below.

emergency room and is the only designated trauma center (Level II) serving the Coachella
Valley with a staff of specially trained trauma surgeons to offer their aid in the event of major
injury. Desert Medical also has a Home Health Care department providing in-home nursing and
household maintenance service. Hospice of the Desert has been incorporated into Desert’s
operations and provides specialized treatment and counseling for the terminally ill.
Eisenhower Medical Center
Eisenhower Medical Center is in neighboring Rancho Mirage and is located on a 90 acre master
planned campus. Eisenhower is comprised of a general acute care hospital with 261 beds, the
Barbara Sinatra Children’s Center, the Betty Ford Center, a well-known substance abuse
treatment center, and the Annenberg Center for Health Sciences, a conference and
communications center. Twenty-four hour emergency care facilities are also located at
Eisenhower, with at least one full-time physician on duty at all times.
A wide variety of outpatient and specialist services are provided by Eisenhower Medical Center,
which recently opened a birthing center. Other developments are currently planned, such as the
opening of a comprehensive cancer center (see discussion below). Long-term plans include
expansion of the emergency room facilities and seismic retrofitting of the main wing.
John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital, located in Indio, is an accredited community hospital with
a 24-hour emergency room and 130 beds, also owned by Tenet Health Care. It offers many
programs similar to those offered by Desert Regional Medical Center.
Comprehensive Cancer Centers
Currently, the Center of Excellence at Desert Regional Medical Center provides comprehensive
detection, diagnosis, treatment and follow up to cancer patients. It includes physician’s offices, a
pharmacy, surgical facilities, support services, and research facilities. It also encompasses and is
complemented by the Comprehensive Breast Center, which offers a range of breast health
services, including diagnostic and treatment services. Eisenhower Medical Center recently
purchased the Heart Institute of the Desert facility and is retrofitting the building for an “under-
one-roof” approach to cancer care. The Eisenhower Comprehensive Cancer Center is set to open
in early 2002.
Immediate Care Clinics
Two immediate care facilities serve Cathedral City. Centro Medico de Valle is located at Date
Palm Drive and Ramon Road. One physician and a physician’s assistant staff it during hours of
operation. The private clinic has entered into a relationship with Eisenhower Medical Center
whereby Eisenhower provides the clinic’s rotating staff of physicians. In addition to regular
medical services offered to insured and self-pay clients at a reduced rate, the clinic offers the
Healthy Beginnings Program for infants and new parents (see discussion below). It also provides

Canyon Springs, a licensed intermediate care facility serving developmentally disabled
individuals, admitted its first client in December of 2000. It is located just west of the Da Vall
Drive /Ramon Road intersection. This state-run facility is licensed for up to 63 clients. It offers
intermediate-level nursing care to adult individuals with mental retardation, autism, cerebral
palsy or seizure disorders. Clients are referred through a regional center and receive job and
other skills training, with the goal of moving them into less structured group homes or other
more independent-living settings. This facility allows clients with mild to moderate
developmental disabilities to be closer to their families in Southern California. Some of its
clients are from the Coachella Valley. It is the only such specialized facility in Southern
California.

members of the Center or not. Annual flu shots are provided at no cost. A variety of health and
fitness classes are also offered at nominal fees.
Hospice Care
Two providers of home-based hospice services have offices in Cathedral City. Trinity Hospice is
privately owned and funded. Hospice services, staff and equipment are delivered to patients in
their homes. The firm currently serves approximately 30 patients per day with a capacity of 75
per day. This provider has the largest capacity for delivery of hospice care in the low desert area.
The Trinity Hospice Foundation provides funding to assist patients without insurance coverage
for these services.
Vitas Healthcare Corporation, a large, national corporation with a regional office in San
Bernardino, maintains a small satellite office in Cathedral City. Services are delivered to patients
in-home or at other facilities where they are currently living. Most patients served are Medicare
insured. Also see the discussion above regarding the Hospice of the Desert program at Desert
Regional Medical Center.
Accessibility and Transportation

EMS vehicles, and American Medical Response (AMR), a private ambulance company based in
Palm Springs. For inter-facility transfers, AMR, Balboa and Bowers ambulance services are
available. For more information on emergency transport services, please refer to the Emergency
Preparedness Element.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Medical services located in the City tend to be grouped in one of three areas: near the Ramon
Road/Date Palm intersection; near Date Palm Drive and Dinah Shore Drive; and near the
Cathedral City downtown area, on Perez Road or on Highway 111 (East Palm Canyon Drive).
Residents of neighborhoods north of Ramon Road must travel outside their neighborhoods for
services.
The City should consider encouraging the establishment of a medical center complex in the
northern planning area, which could include general/family medicine, obstetrics/ gynecological
services, pediatrics, internists, dental and vision care in a “one-stop shopping” facility. Such a
facility could be housed in an existing commercial center or small office complex, as are many
of the existing clinic facilities, or within the mixed-use urban or business park areas of North
City as it develops.
Residents must travel outside Cathedral City to obtain some comprehensive and many very
specialized health services, such as MRI screenings, although distances to these services are not
great. Locating small satellite offices providing comprehensive breast care, cancer screening,
heart-care related fitness and wellness facilities, preventative medicine in some City
neighborhoods may be encouraged. While affiliated with the larger hospitals, these
“neighborhood health stores” would encourage utilization by near-by residents and also might
attract other valley residents who prefer to visit a more convenient site as opposed to a large
hospital campus.
The City may also wish to consider providing inter-facility transport service through the Fire
Department in the future, based on growth and economic conditions.

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Emergency Preparedness Element provides information on emergency response services and
plans currently (2001) in effect, outlines critical facilities and services necessary to respond
adequately to emergencies, and discusses potential impacts of natural and man-made threats
which could significantly affect the City. Finally, the Element sets forth the goals, policies and
programs that have been, or will be, developed by the City to ensure adequate preparation for
such emergencies. Its inclusion is also designed to provide the City of Cathedral City with
information, which it can use to plan responsively in order to minimize human and economic
losses.
BACKGROUND
This Element is included as part of the overall discussion and planning regarding general
environmental hazards, in accordance with Government Code Section 65302(g) which mandates
that General Plans address hazards such as seismic disturbances and their effects, “other geologic
hazards ... flooding; and wild land and urban fires.” The Emergency Preparedness Element is
related to other general Plan elements, including Health Services, Police and Fire protection,
Flooding and Hydrology, Circulation, Land Use, Hazardous and Toxic Materials, and Economic
Development Elements.
The northern portion of the City of Cathedral City is crossed by the San Andreas Fault, one of
the most active faults in California, and is vulnerable to seismically-induced ground shaking,
ground rupture, slope failure, rockfalls and landslides, ground subsidence and soils liquefaction.
These seismic hazards, as well as fires, flooding, and hazardous materials releases all require
emergency planning. The potential for man-made emergencies, such as power outages, major
accidents involving trains, motor vehicles or aircraft, also exists. Emerging concern over urban
terrorism, sparked by events such as the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing, and
increasing incidents of school shootings, may also necessitate an emergency response plan.
Cathedral City is a member of the Riverside County Emergency Services Organization. The City
has developed its own Emergency Operations Plan to anticipate and comprehensively plan for a
variety of man-made and natural disasters, which could potentially expose residents and property
to harm. The Plan utilizes the Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS), which
categorizes various activities necessary to prepare for or mitigate potential disasters, and assigns
responsibility for managing and implementing those activities to the appropriate City department
or entity.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                   Emergency Preparedness Element

                                                                                 City of Cathedral City
                                                          General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
By means of 15 separate but integrated planning documents, which function as area-specific sub-
component summaries and response plans, the Plan further details specific actions to be taken in
the event of each emergency and which agency or City entity would handle the action. Of these
summaries, the first, Emergency Management, which includes Emergency Operations Center
(EOC) management and operations, is complete.
Other summaries and response plans still to be completed will cover communications, mutual aid
functions between fire and police agencies, public health operations, communications, care and
shelter operations, and damage assessment and recovery, as well as other vital areas of
emergency operations. Although under development, the Plan in its entirety will remain a “living
document”, with on-going updates and improvements. The Cathedral City Emergency
Operations Plan is hereby incorporated by reference into this Element.
Critical Facilities
Critical facilities such as hospitals, police and fire departments, governmental operations,
communications centers and utility facilities form a vital network functioning to implement the
plan in the event of an emergency. Support facilities, such as fire and police communications,
auxiliary personnel and commercial radio stations, can support the primary critical facilities by
providing information and direction to the public during a crisis. The City also relies on the
Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Services (RACES) organization for amateur radio
communications county-wide during a disaster.
Access, including evacuation routes and transport of the injured, peak-load water supply and
delivery, and airport services must also be considered. It is important to take into account
transportation system constraints, which may hinder ground-based access or delivery of supplies
and emergency services to the affected areas.
Coachella Communications Group (COACHELLACOMM) comprises the Coachella Valley’s
arm of a network of seven regional committees mandated by Riverside County. This network
was formed to deal specifically with disaster preparedness. Coachella Valley cities’ Emergency
Managers or other designated representatives, as well as Safety Officers from at least two of the
area’s major hospitals, serve on this committee. The County’s Emergency Operations
Coordinator is the current committee chair.
Shelters must be available which are capable of handling large numbers of people and providing
basic services such as food, potable water and medical supplies. In the event of an emergency
involving Cathedral City, shelters would be set up and managed by the American Red Cross. In
addition, the City has been actively purchasing disaster support supplies as part of its Disaster
Medical Assistance Center (DMAC), which has been located at the intersecting corner of the Big
League Dreams and Cathedral City High School football stadium. When activated, the DMAC
is stocked to provide care to between 300 and 500 persons. Any necessary transport of injured
persons would be coordinated between the appropriate emergency transport provider, City and
County EOCs, and area hospitals.

In the past, many of the City’s private residential communities participated in the Neighborhood
Emergency Service Team (NEST) program and received preparedness, response and recovery
operations training. NEST has been replaced by the Community Emergency Response Training
Program (CERT), which is designed to help such communities prepare to be self-sufficient for a
period of at least 72 hours following an emergency. Such preparedness optimally includes
emergency stockpiles of food, water and other needed supplies. While some of the City’s
communities are believed to have such stockpiles, neither levels of preparedness nor
participating communities are documented.
CERT training is currently offered on a quarterly basis through a valley-wide, consolidated
training program. The City does not currently schedule training for individual communities but
is willing to do so if requested.
Emergency Accessibility and Transportation
Immediate access to impacted areas by emergency personnel and supplies is essential after a
disaster. East Palm Canyon Drive, Dinah Shore Drive (Mid-Valley Parkway), Ramon Road and
US Interstate-10 are major intercity and regional access routes serving Cathedral City. These
arteries could be blocked or damaged in the event of a major disaster, including major
earthquakes or floods, urban wildfires, major truck or rail accidents, or by other natural or man-
made disasters. The loss of freeway overpasses, bridging over the Whitewater River, or the
closing of roads due to rockfalls or landslides would each impede the delivery of emergency
services and supplies.
The City is generally well protected from major flooding by the extensive drainage channels
built through it and adjacent to the Santa Rosa Mountains. All-weather crossings over the
Whitewater River at Date Palm Drive, Ramon Road and Dinah Shore Drive, and where East
Palm Canyon Drive crosses the East and West Cathedral Canyon Washes are in place.
Other parts of the City and General Plan study area are susceptible to major flooding and
possible isolation from major transportation links and the rest of the community. Lands at the
west end, and north and south of East Palm Canyon Drive, are located in an AO flood zone, with
the possibility inundation at depths of one to three feet. In the northern portion of the City, lands
north and south of I-10 are also susceptible to major flooding, which could isolate these lands
from emergency services (also see the Flooding and Hydrology Element).
The City shall continue to coordinate with CalTrans, the Federal Highway Administration,
CVAG, adjoining cities and Riverside County, as well as Sunline Transit Authority, to provide
the highest functional reliability of major roadways and the public transportation system serving
the City and the region. The City shall also continue to coordinate with Riverside County Flood
Control, the Coachella Valley Water District and the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) to address continuing flooding hazards that threaten people and property, and which
may isolate portions of the community. Programs shall be developed to identify and address
weak links in the circulation system, in conjunction with the efforts of other Coachella Valley
jurisdictions.

Emergency Medical Facilities
Emergency medical services are provided by the City of Cathedral City Fire Department, which
can provide paramedic services on-site and during emergency transport. Backup services are
provided by American Medical Response, which maintains a ring-down communication line
with City Fire Department dispatchers and has ambulances staffed with Emergency Medical
Service personnel (paramedics). AMR can link with California Highway Patrol to provide airlift
capabilities based out of the Thermal Airport, and with Mercy Air, which operates out of
Banning. The Palm Springs International Airport is located within 5 miles of most portions of
Cathedral City and provides an important access point to the western Coachella Valley for
helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft.
There are three valley hospitals that can provide care and personnel in the event of an
emergency. Most notably, Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs is a 388-bed acute
care hospital and is a designated trauma center. Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage
includes a general acute care hospital with 261 beds and emergency medical facilities. A third
hospital, located in Indio, is the John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital, an accredited community
hospital with a 24-hour emergency room and 130 beds. (Please see the Health Services Element
for more information on these hospitals). Should an emergency occur, the designated Emergency
                                                      Services Coordinator will contact and
                                                      coordinate with these emergency medical
                                                      service providers.

Emergency Operations Center
The City of Cathedral City Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is located at Fire Station 412 at
32100 Desert Vista Road, just south of Ramon Road. As outlined in the City’s Emergency
Operations Plan, adopted in May, 2000, in the event of an emergency the EOC would be
activated and serve to coordinate the Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS), “to
organize response to the emergency or disaster, incorporating the functions, principles and
components of ICS (i.e., unified command, action planning, span of control, hierarchy of
command, etc.)” The City Manager is designated to serve as Director of Emergency Services.

Emergency Response & Organizational Structure
Cathedral City’s emergency entities, including Fire and Police services, cooperate with other
valley cities and the County on an on-going basis. In the event of a local or valley-wide
emergency, such cooperation becomes essential to provide continuity of basic services and to
manage large-scale emergency operations. While the City’s Emergency Operations Plan
addresses management functions of mutual aid, the hazard summary and response documents,
which specify mutual aid field responses and strategies, are still to be developed. The City places
development of these documents as a high priority. It is essential that coordination of mutual-
functioning responses between valley cities, Riverside County, and the State of California are
clearly defined and ready for implementation.
State and national organizations, such as the Red Cross and the National Guard, have specific
roles in emergency management. The Red Cross, as mentioned in the Critical Facilities section
of this Element, has primary responsibility for establishing and managing emergency shelters.
The State National Guard will primarily serve as a peace-keeping or security force, unless
required to function otherwise by an emergency declaration by the President of the United States.
Should a large-scale regional or state-wide emergency require airlifting of stable injured
individuals out of the State to make room for more severely injured, less mobile persons, the
National Guard has the capability to provide that service.
Implementation of a plan in accordance with State and County requirements, and documentation
steps followed in an emergency, are important to allow the City to recover costs associated with
emergency management. Therefore, planning becomes crucial in accessing funds available for
such emergencies and for safeguarding the City’s on-going financial resources after an
emergency has occurred.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
It is unclear whether private residential communities whose members previously received NEST
training have since become involved in CERT; it is also unclear how such communities within
the City would now be self-sufficient for a minimum of 72 hours following an emergency.
Therefore, in order to maximize critical facilities available to residents, the City should consider
a more systematic approach to implementing the CERT program in gated communities that
would allow it to quantify and readily identify participating and non-participating communities.
This approach should also focus on developing and implementing a public information campaign
targeting these communities, and should actively encourage their involvement in CERT training.
The Emergency Operations Plan implements the Emergency Preparedness Element. When
completed, the Plan will provide detailed organizational directives, scopes of responsibilities,
operational priorities, authority and powers, emergency communications protocols and, in
summary, the comprehensive framework for effective emergency response. The City has begun
the process of planning for a variety of contingencies and has in place a solid foundation for
emergency preparedness.

It is very important that this process continue, that remaining components are completed, and
that the Plan remain adaptable to all. Although the Emergency Preparedness Plan will remain a
living document, baseline information provides a valuable structure for refinement and
expansion of emergency preparedness efforts.

PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
ELEMENT
PURPOSE
This Element describes and provides background information on the various public and quasi-
public facilities and structures in the City. It is intended to provide sufficient information to
identify important structures and to assure that adequate facilities are provided to meet the
demands of the growing community. The element is also meant to provide sufficient information
to identify issues associated with these important and critical facilities. Implementation of the
element will help to assure coordinated planning and development. The Element also sets forth
goals, policies and programs, which address the City’s long-term planning needs.
BACKGROUND
The importance of coordinated planning, funding and operation of essential public facilities is
clearly recognized by state, county and local jurisdictions. Government Code Section 65103(c)
states that the planning agency is to “annually review the Capital Improvement Program of the
City or County and the local public works projects of other local agencies for their consistency
with the General Plan…” Furthermore, according to Government Code Section 65303, the local
jurisdiction may emphasize the importance of this issue by requiring an optional Public Facilities
Element in the General Plan
The Public Buildings and Facilities Element is directly related to the Land Use Element, which
assigns land use designations and assures that adequate and optimally planned lands are available
for existing and future public buildings and facilities. It is also related to the Circulation Element,
which is directed at providing efficient, safe transportation corridors throughout the City, and
especially to essential public facilities. The Community Design Element, which sets forth the
architectural and design criteria to be used throughout the community, is responsive to
occasional aesthetic issues that arise with the siting and construction of these buildings and
facilities.
The City contains a number of public buildings
and facilities, ranging from the Civic Center to
schools and libraries, fire stations, post offices
and other public buildings, as well as telephone
and cable transmission lines.

                                                                                      City of Cathedral City
                                                        General Plan/Public Buildings and Facilities/Element
City and utility maintenance yards and facilities, roads, bridges and traffic signals also fall into
this category. Advance planning for public facilities assures that they are built in time to
accommodate existing and anticipated future needs of the community. Some, most notably utility
infrastructure, play a key role in determining the location, intensity and timing of future
development. Most of these facilities are shown on the General Plan map included in this
element.
The location of public buildings and facilities is largely based on their function in the
community. These functional criteria should not preclude the logical and sensitive integration of
these facilities into the City’s existing and planned land use patterns. Fire and police stations, for
example, should be strategically located throughout the community so as to provide optimal
emergency response times. Public office buildings in which residents and City officials conduct
business should be conveniently located, with safe public access and adequate parking. Electrical
substations, water wells, and other utility infrastructure can be effectively screened from public
view and aesthetically and cost-effectively integrated into the natural and built environment.
Public Buildings and Facilities
Civic Center
The City has made a substantial commitment to the redevelopment of its downtown. The Civic
Center, which houses City Hall and the Police Station, is located at 68-700 Avenida Lalo
Guererro, and serves as an important civic monument and community focal point in the heart of
the downtown district. The building is designed on a grand scale with strong neo-classical
architectural features. It overlooks a public plaza, which showcases several art sculptures and a
fountain courtyard; this space serves as a dynamic and beautiful community-gathering place for
important civic and other community
functions.
The building opened in July 1998 and
encompasses        approximately       65,000
square feet. It houses the Police
Department        and     city   staff    and
administrative offices, including the
Mayor’s office and City Council
chambers. As part of the downtown
redevelopment effort, the City has
constructed a multi-level parking structure
immediately west of City Hall, providing
parking for theater-goers, shoppers and
other visitors to the downtown. This
structure opened in Spring, 2001.
                                                   The Cathedral City City Hall Building
Corporate Yard
The City’s corporate yard is located at 68-385 Kieley Road, near Cathedral Canyon Drive. The
facility includes two masonry buildings, which comprise a total of approximately 8,500 square
feet. One building serves as a vehicle maintenance garage/workshop, and the other includes staff

consists of an asphalt parking lot, which accommodates staff and City-owned vehicles. City staff
has indicated that additional parking space is needed and that the corporate yard may be
expanded in the future.
Cathedral City Community Center
The Cathedral City Community Center is fully funded and operated by the City’s Parks and
Recreation Division. It is located at 68-727 E. Palm Canyon Drive and occupies approximately
10,000 square feet in two buildings: the City-owned community center building, and the old
library building, which the City leases from Riverside County. The Senior Center, described
below, occupies an additional 3,000 square feet of the Community Center building.
The Community Center offers a wide range of community programs and activities, including day
camps, dance and tumbling programs, karate lessons, bridge clubs, and seasonal/holiday
festivities. Large and small meeting rooms are available to scouts, clubs and other community
groups.
City staff has identified the need for a new, larger community center in the northern portion of
the City. Proposed programs and facilities would include more adult and evening classes, a day
care program, and a gymnasium, swimming pool and/or other recreational facilities.
Cathedral City Senior Center
The Cathedral City Senior Center has been serving the City for more than 20 years and is located
at 68-727 E. Palm Canyon Drive. It is a private, non-profit organization, which is partially
funded by the City of Cathedral City, and is open Monday through Friday, with special events on
weekends and evenings. Programs include crafts, bingo, dancing, lectures and a variety of other
activities. The center also operates an Outreach Program, which recently acquired a van for
transporting seniors to and from the center.
Fire Stations
Cathedral City operates its own fire department and has made a concentrated effort to assure the
highest level of fire protection services for the community. The Cathedral City Fire Department
is responsible for fire suppression, fire prevention, paramedic services, disaster preparedness,
hazardous materials response and code enforcement. It operates three fire stations, including
Station No. 411 at 36-913 Date Palm Drive; Station No. 412 at 32-100 Desert Vista Road; and
Station No. 413 at 27-610 Landau Boulevard. The Department maintains mutual aid agreements
with neighboring communities for additional fire support. Please refer to the Fire and Police
Protection Element for more information about the City’s fire services and facilities.
Police Department
The Cathedral City Police Department is located within the City Hall Building at 68-700
Avenida Lalo Guerrero. The Department also operates three satellite offices, known as
“Community Police Service Offices,” at the following locations: 1) 68-100 Ramon Road, 2) 34-
481 Date Palm Drive, and 3) 69-038 East Palm Canyon Drive. The Department is staffed by
approximately 55 sworn officers, 6 reserve officers, and 29 support and administrative personnel.

Schools
The Palm Springs Unified School District (PSUSD) provides public education services and
facilities to the City of Cathedral City. Eight schools are located within the planning area,
including the following: Agua Caliente Elementary, Cathedral City Elementary, Landau
Elementary, Sunny Sands Elementary, Nellie N. Coffman Middle, James Workman Middle,
Cathedral City High, and Mt. San Jacinto Continuation High. Private educational facilities and
services are provided by the Calvary Bible Christian School and First School of the Desert in
Cathedral City, and other private schools in the Coachella Valley.
Three colleges and universities offer a wide range of certificate, degree and vocational programs
to residents of the Coachella Valley. The Coachella Valley Campus of Chapman University is
located on Cook Street in the City of Palm Desert. In 2001, College of the Desert (COD) enrolls
approximately 8,600 students, and the Coachella Valley Campus of California State University-
San Bernardino (CSUSB), which enrolls approximately 800 students. The new CSUSB campus
at Cook Street and Frank Sinatra Drive in Palm Desert will serve thousands of students.
Educational facilities and services are discussed further in the Schools and Libraries Element.
Cathedral City Public Library
The Cathedral City Public Library is located at 33-520 Date Palm Drive and is a branch of the
Riverside County Library System. The 20,000 square foot facility opened in 1996 and includes
approximately 70,000 volumes. It offers a full range of community services, including computer
workshops, literacy programs, youth activities, and an HIV/AIDS information center. Regional
library facilities include the College of the Desert Library in Palm Desert, the medical library at
Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, and other branches of the Riverside County
Library System. Please refer to the Schools and Libraries Element for more information about
these facilities.
Post Offices
A new U.S. Post Office opened in Cathedral City in January 2000. The Post Office is a full-
service facility located at 33-940 Date Palm Drive, at the intersection of Date Palm Drive and
Dave Kelley Road. It provides all the basic postal services offered in most other facilities,
including post office boxes, voter registration forms, mail boxes, shipping services and postage
stamp sales.
Utility Infrastructure
Utility buildings and facilities, including electrical substations and switching facilities and well
sites, can generate noise and also detract from the scenic value of an area. Landscaping and
architectural elements can be incorporated into the design of these structures to minimize their
visual and noise impacts, screen them from public view, and assure their compatibility with the
surrounding built and natural environment. Effective design elements include decorative block
walls, vegetative buffers, and the use of locally compatible architectural style and color. Some
utility transmission lines can be undergrounded to shield them from view.

The primary utility companies serving the City of Cathedral City are the Coachella Valley Water
District, Desert Water Agency (DWA), Southern California Edison (SCE), Verizon, Time
Warner, and Southern California Gas Company. Major utility buildings and facilities in the City
include a Verizon telephone sub-switching unit on the east side of Date Palm Drive, south of
McCallum Way, and DWA sewage pumping plants on Date Palm Drive and Cathedral Canyon.
SCE has three substations within the City limits, and one immediately outside the City limits
which may serve Cathedral City residents.
Drainage Facilities
The City’s primary drainage facility is the Whitewater River Stormwater Channel, which extends
from Vista Chino, southeast to East Palm Canyon Drive. Additional capital projects, such as
levees, channels and detention/retention basins have been constructed within the City to manage
local and regional drainage, particularly in the vicinity of the mountain cove areas of the City.
The planned Mid-Valley Stormwater Channel will be constructed immediately east of the City
limits and south of the Union Pacific Railroad lines.
Drainage is typically divided into two categories, local and regional drainage, which are
ultimately interrelated. Local drainage refers to limited drainage areas and the generation of
runoff associated with urban development. Regional drainage consists of high-volume runoff and
facilities capturing and conveying runoff from a larger geographic area. There is a mix of
responsibilities among the City, Riverside County Flood Control District, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Coachella Valley
Water District regarding the ownership and management of local and regional drainage facilities.
These agencies maintain close cooperation and coordination with one another regarding flood
control planning and the management of drainage facilities in the community. Please refer to the
Flooding and Hydrology Element for more information about local and regional drainage.
Critical Structures
The term “critical structure” refers to any building or facility that provides important and/or
essential emergency services following a major disruptive event, such as an earthquake, flood or
fire. Critical structures include fire and police stations, hospitals, major airports and roadways,
and primary communications facilities.
They may also include other civic structures, as well as school facilities. These structures should
be located, to the greatest extent practical, in areas that are the least susceptible to impacts from
seismic activity, flooding and other hazardous occurrences. Specifically, they should not be
located within or near the 100-year floodplain or a fault zone.
Given the City’s proximity to the Whitewater River, and the San Andreas and other fault zones,
special considerations should be made in the construction of critical structures. In particular, the
City and other responsible agencies should assure that thorough engineering analyses are
performed, to the extent necessary, prior to construction of future critical facilities. Building
design should include allowances for the offset of building foundations resulting from surface
displacements. These and other safety issues are addressed in more detail in the Geotechnical,
Flooding and Hydrology, and Emergency Preparedness Elements of the General Plan.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The continued funding of public services and facilities is crucial to meeting essential needs of the
community, and the construction and/or expansion of new facilities will be necessary as the City
continues to grow. Until December 1999, the City’s Community Services District (CSD)
provided a steady revenue stream to fund law enforcement, parks and recreation, street lighting
and other public services and facilities. In December 1999, the residents of Cathedral City voted
to terminate the CSD. With the loss of CSD income, the City will have to pursue other funding
opportunities, such as state and federal grants, General Fund revenues, and the expanded use of
volunteers, to meet increasing demands for public services.
Each year, local government agencies (including cities, counties, school districts and special
districts) planning the construction of capital facilities must submit to the planning agency a list
of proposed projects which they would like implemented. The City’s Capital Improvement
Program (CIP) identifies existing and proposed projects that require on-going and forward-
looking governmental funding, such as traffic signals, street widenings and repavings, parks and
recreation facilities, and public parking lots. It is essential that the City carefully review and
adjust its CIP, as necessary, to assure consistency with General Plan goals and policies and to
respond to the changing needs of the community.

ARTS AND CULTURE ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The City’s aesthetic values are reflected in, and provide the basis for, cultural identification
throughout the community’s planning efforts. The Arts and Culture Element presents policies
and programs that maximize the role the City can play in encouraging and supporting the cultural
development of the community. In addition to the direct support given to City-sponsored
activities and facilities, the City can and should play an important role in helping to encourage
and enhance the activities of public and private nonprofit enterprises supporting the arts. The
purpose and intent of this involvement is to further a better understanding, appreciation and
enjoyment of the cultural environment in Cathedral City.
BACKGROUND
Elements directly related to arts and culture include the Community Image and Urban Design
Element, the Archaeological and Historical Resources Element, the Open Space and
Conservation Element and the Schools and Libraries Element. The Parks and Recreation
Element plays an essential role in providing facilities and coordinated activities for sport and
recreation. In addition, the Biological Resources Element recognizes the community’s vested
interest in and dedication to the preservation of wildlife and habitat, and as the reason many have
chosen to live in the city.

In 1992, the city began the implementation of a Downtown Revitalization Strategy. A new Civic
Center and street improvements along the East Palm Canyon Drive corridor were completed in
1998. The first of a series of Downtown projects that have been completed include the City Hall
and Police Department, the Desert IMAX Theater, the Fountain of Life, the Mary Pickford
Theater and Experience, and various retail shops and restaurants.
Future Downtown projects will include more restaurants, shops, plazas and other public
gathering places, all of which will set the stage for increased opportunities for Art in Public
Places and cultural events
Within the City, the Downtown
Revitalization Strategy includes the
development of an Arts Program, which
focuses on providing a welcoming and
stimulating environment for practicing
artists to live, work and present their art to
the community. A concerted effort is in
place to make art a more integral part of
citizens’ lives by encouraging the
expansion of the arts in the school system,
establishing new educational activities,
inviting broader participation of students
and designers in local public arts
opportunities and creating venues for local
artists.
                                                      The Mary Pickford Theatre
An Arts in Public Places program has been established and fees are collected to support the
projects being developed. These and other arts and culture issues are discussed below.
Unlike many areas of community planning, which are relatively distinct in their application to
the city limits, the arts and culture focus is better viewed on a valley-wide basis. Residents of

APPRECIATION
Art in Public Places
The placement of art in public places is another significant opportunity to express and reinforce
the cultural cohesion of the community. Consistent with the principle of a low density resort
residential community that values its mountains and wild places, public art can integrate native
landscaping along major roadways to reflect the surrounding Santa Rosas and desert washes. It
can include the attentive design and placement of public buildings, as well as placement of
manmade monumental sculpture on public lands, or within the rights-of-way of major roadways.
The Art in Public Places Program has been created in order to promote the general welfare of the
city through balancing the community’s physical growth and revitalization of its cultural and
artistic resources. The city’s Art in Public Places ordinance has established a Public Art or In
Lieu Payment requirement collected at the time building permits are issued. New projects for this
program are developed on an ongoing basis.
Fountain of Life
The interactive Fountain of Life is one of the City’s initial responses to the concept of art in
public places. Located in the Civic Center Plaza, it is designed to encourage children and adults
to walk and play in the fountain, which has a soft surface made from recycled tires, a gift of the
Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians. Reflecting the nature and history of the desert, the
fountain features stone columns surrounded by sculptures of desert wildlife.
  The Fountain of Life located in front of
              the Town Square
Sites including Town Square, the City
Library, City Hall, The Mary Pickford
Theatre, and the Desert IMAX Theater are
all suitable locations for public art. A
bronze sculpture, Hollywood Hero, donated
by actor George Montgomery, has been
installed in Town Square, demonstrating the
beauty of such public art. Murals offer
various opportunities to convert blank walls
into interesting canvases. Also appropriate are the Fountain of Life, and City-owned parks and
open space areas, which offer important opportunities for local artists to display or perform their
work and hold workshops and classes.

Cathedral City Public Arts Commission
The Cathedral City Public Arts Commission (CCPAC) has been established to help the
community attain the benefits of the arts by making them more accessible, establishing specific
programs, securing funding and creating a clear policy and procedural guidelines. It develops
and presents concepts to the City Council and organizes and directs subcommittees to take
advantage of the special talents of individuals within the community. Comprised of seven
commissioners, its goal is to enhance the image of Cathedral City as being a magnet for the arts
and artists, by engaging in highly visible projects and programs which are designed for citizen
participation. Establishing temporary exhibit spaces for local artists, organizing performance arts
events, and joining with other Coachella Valley cultural leaders to discuss issues of mutual
concern and interest are also some of the core objectives of the Commission.
The Cathedral City Public Arts Commission has adopted an Arts Plan to carry out these and
other goals and concepts. This document sets forth Cathedral City’s vision of an arts program
and outlines strategies for implementing it.
Land Use Planning as a Strategy for Cultural Resource Preservation
Cathedral City’s resort residential lifestyle and a close association with wildlife and the
environment have been consistently recognized as integral parts of the community’s culture and
traditions. The development of the General Plan Land Use map has been based on several central
values embraced by the community. These include the desire to preserve open spaces to assure
the long-term enjoyment of wildlands and wildlife, and to preserve and protect the cultural
heritage of local Native Americans. The Land Use Element and various elements of the General
Plan take these and other special concerns into account and will play an active role in preserving
these community assets for future generations.
Adopted July 31, 2002                                                          Arts and Culture Element

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Part of the fabric of a community is woven by the resources for cultural enrichment that are
offered to its citizens. The goals and policies of the Arts and Culture Element are intended to
help foster a civic environment where artistic expression and cultural diversity can flourish. Like
the element devoted to Economic Development, the relation of arts and culture to the physical
environment is indirect, but both have decided influences on the quality of life offered in
Cathedral City.
There are several means available to implement the Arts and Culture Element, including the
integration of public art into main city entries and focal points. The City may also encourage
developers to include sculpture and cultural icons into major project corners, entries and parkway
treatments.
