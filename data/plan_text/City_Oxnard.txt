Purpose
                          The 2013-2021 Mid-Cycle Update Housing Element identifies and analyzes the
                          current and future housing needs of residents within the City of Oxnard (City) and
                          establishes housing goals, policies, and programs to meet the needs. The
                          statutory planning period is October 15, 2013 to October 15, 2021. The time frame
                          during which housing accomplishments towards the Regional Housing Needs
                          Allocation (RHNA) can be counted (RHNA cycle) is January 1, 2014 through
                          October 31, 2021. The housing requirements of lower-income households and
                          special needs groups are given particular attention. The City seeks to conserve
                          and rehabilitate existing housing as well as provide opportunities for new
                          development.
Updating the Housing Element
                          The California State Legislature identified the State’s major housing goal as the
                          attainment of a decent home and suitable living environment for every Californian.
                          Due to the critical role that local planning programs play in achieving this goal,
                          California State Legislature requires that all jurisdictions prepare and periodically
                          review and update a housing element.
Consistency with State Law
                          Government Code Section 65583 lists requirements of the housing element. Each
                          housing element must contain “an identification and analysis of existing and
                          projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives,

                       and scheduled program actions for the preservation, improvement, and
                       development of housing.” By law, the housing element must contain:
                           ▪    An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and
                                constraints relevant to meeting those needs;
                           ▪    A statement of the community's goals, quantified objectives, and policies
                                relevant to the maintenance, improvement and development of housing;
                                and
                           ▪    A program that sets forth a schedule of actions that the local government
                                is undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and
                                achieve the goals and objectives of the housing element.
                       The housing element must also:
                           ▪    Provide clear policy and direction for making decisions pertaining to
                                zoning, subdivision approval, housing allocations, and capital
                                improvements;
                           ▪    Identify adequate residential sites available for a variety of housing types
                                for all income levels;
                           ▪    Assist in developing adequate housing to meet the needs of extremely-
                                low, very low-, low- and moderate-income households;
                           ▪    Address governmental constraints             to    housing     maintenance,
                                improvement, and development;
                           ▪    Conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing
                                stock; and
                           ▪    Promote housing opportunities for all persons.
                       The Housing Element requires review and certification by the State of California,
                       Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). This element
                       received conditional certification on March 27, 2017.

2030 General Plan
                  The Oxnard 2013-2021 Housing Element is Chapter 8 of the Oxnard 2030
                  General Plan. Once this document is adopted by the Oxnard City Council and
                  certified by HCD, the page numbers will be reformatted to integrate with the 2030
                  General Plan Goals and Policies document format and “Chapters” are considered
                  “Sections.”
                  State law requires that “the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise
                  an integrated, internally consistent, and compatible statement of policies.” Internal
                  consistency is required to avoid policy conflict and provide a clear policy guide for
                  the future maintenance, improvement, and development of housing in the City.
                  The City adopted a 2030 General Plan in 2011, fully replacing the 2020 General
                  Plan. The City updated all elements of the General Plan concurrently and
                  submitted the 2006-2014 Housing Element for initial HCD review in 2009. The
                  2006-2014 Housing Element went through four revisions with final HCD
                  certification in July 2012. The HCD-certified element was adopted as a General
                  Plan Amendment in 2013. This Housing Element update for the subsequent
                  HCD-planning period of 2013-2021 remains consistent with the 2030 General
                  Plan and the City will continue to maintain General Plan consistency as needed
                  throughout the HCD planning period.

                  Sphere of Influence pursuant to SB 244, the City amended the Land Use element
                  per SB 244 requirements on December 13, 2016.

          REVIEW AND REVISE PREVIOUS POLICIES AND GOALS
                                                                                               A
A.1     Progress in Achieving 2013–2021 Housing Element Goals and Policies
                            State law requires all regional councils of government to determine the existing and
                            projected housing need for its region. The City of Oxnard (City) is in the region
                            covered by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). For each
                            housing element planning cycle, SCAG is required to determine the share of the
                            regional housing need to be allocated to each city and unincorporated county areas
                            within the SCAG region. This is called the Regional Housing Need Allocation
                            (RHNA).
                            To ensure each jurisdiction addresses the housing needs of various income levels,
                            the RHNA number is divided into income groups. To determine the allocation and
                            use of public subsidies, the California Department of Housing and Community
                            Development (HCD) created income categories based on the Ventura County
                            Median Household Income (MHI), which is calculated by the US Department of
                            Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The RHNA income categories are defined
                            as:
                                 ▪   Extremely low-income households earn a maximum of 30 percent of the
                                     Ventura County MHI
                                 ▪   Very low-income households earn between 31 and 50 percent of the
                                     county MHI
                                 ▪   Low-income households earn between 51 and 80 percent of the county
                                     MHI
                                 ▪   Moderate-income households earn between 81 and 120 percent of the
                                     county MHI,

The AAHOP Ordinance will be amended to allow
for-sale very low- and low-income units and rental
moderate income units. For rental projects a mix of
very low (including extremely low), low and
moderate units will be allowed at the same
percentage as is needed to address the remaining
regional housing need in those income categories.
A greater number of units than that reflecting this
percentage in the very low and low-income
categories shall also be allowed. Amendments will
also be made to clarify how AAHOP works with a
state density bonus. The AAHOP affordability term
will be proposed for extension to 55 years to mirror
new state density bonus law (AB 2222).

development of housing suitable for extremely low-
income households (i.e., single-room occupancy
units, transitional housing). Activities include
assisting with site identification and acquisition,
local financial resources, assisting and streamlining

                                                                                           B
                      The purpose of this chapter is to examine historic and current data that shape
                      current and near future housing needs in Oxnard and the 2014-2021 Regional
                      Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is presented. Selected data are updated
                      through 2016.
B.1      Data Sources
                      The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) developed a data
                      packet for jurisdictions in the SCAG region that contains much of the information
                      required for the Housing Needs Assessment of this Housing Element and is the
                      primary source of data for this document. To prepare the data packet, SCAG
                      compiled and analyzed data from the 2010 US Census, the 2005–2009 American
                      Community Survey, and other housing-related statistics from the California
                      Department of Finance (DOF).
                      Where additional information is required, the US Census, which is completed every
                      10 years, is the preferred data source, as it provides the most reliable and in-depth
                      data for demographic characteristics of a locality. This report uses the 2010 Census
                      for current information and the 2000 Census to assess changes since the year
                      2000. The DOF is another source of data that is more current than the Census.
                      However, the DOF does not provide the depth of information that can be found in
                      the US Census. Whenever possible, the SCAG data packet, DOF data, and other
                      local sources were used in the assessment of both Existing Housing Needs (Section
                      B) and Special Housing Needs (Section C) to provide the most current profile of the
                      community.

 Oxnard Housing Element
                                          The 2010 Census did not collect information in several categories that are required
                                          for the discussions of Existing Housing Needs and Special Housing Needs. Where
                                          this is the case, historical DOF data is used. Where DOF data is not available,
                                          information from the 2000 Census is retained. In cases where this is not feasible or
                                          useful, this assessment references US Census Bureau American Community
                                          Survey (ACS) data. The ACS provides estimates of numerous housing-related
                                          indicators based on samples averaged over a five-year period. Whereas the US
                                          Census provides complete counts of various demographic indicators, the ACS
                                          provides estimates based on statistically significant samples. Although the City of
                                          Oxnard provides a sample size of over 200,000, the estimates reported by the ACS
                                          have varying margins of error. Where ACS data is used, the numbers should not
                                          be interpreted as absolute fact but rather as a tool to illustrate a general
                                          characteristic, proportion, or scale.
B.2      Demographic, Employment, and Housing Characteristics
                                          DEMOGRAPHIC (POPULATION) CHARACTERISTICS
                                          The California Department of Finance estimated the population of Ventura County
                                          to be 836,153 in January 2013 [206,997 for January 2016]. Of that population, the
                                          county’s 10 incorporated cities, including Oxnard, account for 88 percent of the
                                          county’s population. Oxnard’s 2013 population (201,029) accounted for 24 percent
                                          of the county’s population. Tables B-1 through B-3 present the population estimates
                                          and growth rates for Oxnard, Ventura County, and California as a whole from 1990
                                          to 2013. Growth trends for Ventura County’s incorporated cities are listed in
                                          Table B-4.
                                          Oxnard’s population growth rate exceeded the growth rate in both Ventura County
                                          and the state between 2000 and 2013. Between 2000 and 2013, Oxnard had the
                                          fastest growth rate of all cities in Ventura County. While California and Ventura
                                          County grew from 2000 to 2013 at rates of 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively,
                                          Oxnard’s growth rate was approximately 18 percent. Since preparation of the
                                          previous Housing Element (2009), growth rates for Oxnard, Ventura County, and
                                          California have slowed with annual growth rates of less than one percent.

                                      Population Projections
                                      On April 4, 2012, SCAG adopted long-term growth forecasts for the 2012–2035
                                      Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy. These forecasts
                                      anticipate approximately 10 percent growth in Oxnard’s population from 2008 to
                                      2020, with an increase from 193,900 residents in 2008 to 216,700 residents in 2020.
                                      From 2020 to 2035, the city is expected to grow roughly at one percent a year for
                                      an additional 13 percent by 27,800 new residents to 244,500 residents. [see table
                                      B-5] These population forecasts are shown below in Table B-5.

                                      Age Characteristics
                                      Three age clusters are important in projecting growth: children and young adults up
                                      to age 20, adults between ages 20 and 65, and the senior population age 65 and
                                      older. As reported in the 2000 Census for Oxnard, the under age 20 population was
                                      35 percent (59,802), the adult population was almost 57 percent (96,726 people),
                                      and the senior population was just over 8 percent (13,830) (see Table B-6). From
                                      2000 to 2010, the median age of the Oxnard population increased from 28.9 to 29.9
                                      years old, yet the overall proportion of the population 20 years or older remained
                                      relatively unchanged. The senior population made up 8 percent of the population in
                                      both 2000 and 2010, while the percentage of adults between ages 20 and 65
                                      increased by just one percentage point from 2000 to 2010, to 58 percent of the total
                                      population. The proportion of the population 19 years or younger declined from 35
                                      percent in 2000 to 33 percent in 2010. Overall, the population distribution of Oxnard
                                      remained relatively stable from 2000 to 2010.

                                      Self-Reported Race and Hispanic Origin
                                      According to the 2010 Census, the Oxnard race/Hispanic Origin composition was
                                      74 percent Hispanic; 15 percent Non-Hispanic White; 2 percent African American;
                                      7 percent Asian and Pacific Islander; less than 1 percent Indian/Native American,
                                      and 2 percent all other races (see Table B-7). Race and Hispanic Origin are self-
                                      reported by the public in all Census Bureau data. The Hispanic Origin population
                                      includes a wide range of people in terms of their citizenship status, length of
                                      residency in Oxnard (temporary or permanent), linguistic isolation, income, and
                                      housing need.
                                      At 74 percent of Oxnard’s population in 2010, Oxnard’s Hispanic population was
                                      approximately double that of the population of Hispanics in Ventura County overall.
                                      Between 2000 and 2010, the Hispanic and Asian populations in Oxnard grew by 29
                                      percent and 15 percent, respectively, from 2000 to 2010. While the percentages of
                                      Hispanics and Asians in Ventura County increased from 2000 to 2010, these
                                      populations comprise a smaller percentage of the total population in Ventura
                                      County. The proportion of the total White population in Ventura County was more
                                      than triple that of Oxnard in 2010, at 49 percent of the Ventura County population
                                      compared to 15 percent in Oxnard. In the city, overall the population of Hispanics,
                                      Asians, and all other groups grew. Note that a person identifying as Hispanic may
                                      be of any one or combination of races.

                                        EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
                                        Projecting employment growth identifies the projected need for additional housing
                                        for employees. The assumption is that the labor force will match the number of jobs
                                        available. If the local labor force is not adequate, in-migration is assumed, which
                                        triggers additional demand for housing.
                                        Job-Generating Areas of Employment
                                        Between 2000 and 2009, the overall number of jobs in Oxnard increased by
                                        approximately 10,145 (see Tables B-8 and B-9). The largest decrease in jobs was
                                        in information (a decrease of 20 percent). There were significant increases in the
                                        construction industry and other services; both increased over 50 percent.

                                          Commute Patterns
                                          Commute distance, travel time, and direction of travel are important factors in
                                          housing availability and affordability and are also an indicator of jobs/housing
                                          balance. Communities with extended commutes generally have a poor jobs/housing
                                          balance, while communities with short average commutes tend to have a strong
                                          jobs/housing balance. The burden of the additional costs associated with extended
                                          commuting disproportionately affects lower-income households who must spend a
                                          larger portion of their overall income on fuel. This in turn affects a household’s ability
                                          to occupy decent housing without being overburdened by cost.
                                          As shown in Table B-12, the majority of residents in Oxnard work in or near the city.
                                          The commute time for 70 percent of residents is less than 30 minutes, while just
                                          over 30 percent of residents commute 30 minutes or more to work.

                                       HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
                                       Household characteristics are an important component to understanding growth
                                       and the changing needs of a community. The US Census Bureau defines a
                                       household as all persons who occupy a housing unit, which may include single
                                       persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, and unrelated
                                       individuals living together. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes,
                                       dormitories, or other group living situations are not considered households.

                                              Household Composition and Size
                                              As of 2009, Oxnard had 49,550 households, with an average household size of 3.65
                                              persons, [in 2016, DOF reports 51,298 households with average size of 4.01] higher
                                              than the Ventura County average size of 3.04 persons as well as the California
                                              average of 2.89 persons (see Table B-15). The majority of households in the city,
                                              57 percent (28,033 households), had 2 to 4 persons. In comparison to Ventura
                                              County and the state, the city has a larger proportion of households considered
                                              large with 5 or more persons. Nearly one-third of all households in the city are large,
                                              27 percent (13,517 households), in comparison to 15 percent of households in
                                              Ventura County and 14 percent of households in the state. Program 28 is proposed
                                              to assist in development of housing for large households.

                                            The number of households in Oxnard increased by a total of 14 percent
                                            (5,974 households) between 2000 and 2009 (see Table B-17), with an average
                                            annual change of approximately 2 percent. With an average annual population
                                            change of approximately 2 percent per year, both households and population grew
                                            at a consistent rate. The Oxnard trends saw a larger percentage change than
                                            Ventura County household growth trends during the same period. Unlike the city,
                                            the county experienced a 6 percent increase in total households and less than a 1
                                            percent annual increase. The proportions for subcategories of households in 2009
                                            are nearly identical to the 2000 proportions for both the city and the county, with the
                                            majority of households being composed of families. Married families account for the
                                            largest percentage of households for both the city and the county. In Oxnard,
                                            numbers of both non-family and singles increased over the nine-year period from
                                            2000 to 2009. Ventura County’s non-family and single households similarly
                                            increased but at lower rates of growth (11 percent and 15 percent, respectively).

  Notes:     1. “Family household” refers to the US Census Bureau definition of a family, which is a household that has at least one member
             of the household related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All persons living in family households are included
             in this total regardless of their relationship to the householder. This definition of family excludes one-person households and
             multi-person households of unrelated individuals. Although this definition is inconsistent with California state law, the Census
             definition is presented here for purposes of describing assumptions in the Census data. The City of Oxnard’s definition of family
             complies with state housing law.
             2. “Nonfamily household” refers to the Census Bureau definition of a non-family household, which is people living alone and
             households which do not have any members related to the householder. This Census definition is presented here for purposes
             of describing assumptions in the Census data.

B.3        Overpayment and Overcrowding
                                       OVERPAYMENT
                                       Overpayment occurs when all housing costs exceed a desirable maximum
                                       percentage of household income. When a household spends more than 30 percent
                                       of its gross income on housing, it is considered to be overpaying or cost burdened,
                                       according to US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) guidelines.
                                       When paying 50 percent or more, a household falls into the category of severe
                                       overpayment. It is important to view overpayment in terms of tenure because
                                       renters, especially lower-income renters, tend to pay a larger percentage of their
                                       household income toward housing, which leaves less income for other necessities
                                       such as food, clothing, transportation, and education. For owners, the cost of
                                       housing tends to be more stable and declines over time, as mortgage payments
                                       remain constant while income grows.

Oxnard Housing Element
                                 Table B-20 shows to what extent occupied housing units (households) are
                                 overpaying for housing costs by tenure and whether or not they were overpaying or
                                 cost burdened (30–50 percent of household income) or severely cost burdened
                                 (50+ percent of household income). Of all owner-occupied households, 45 percent
                                 were overpaying for housing costs in 2010, with 57 percent of renter-occupied
                                 households were overpaying. The most significant percentages in terms of
                                 overpayment in Oxnard were renters, with at least 10 percent of renters making
                                 between 31 and 80 percent of HUD Area Median Family Income (HAMFI)
                                 experiencing overpayment and nearly 20 percent of those making 30 percent or
                                 less of HAMFI being severely burdened by housing costs.

                                 According to the US Census Bureau, overcrowding is defined as more than one
                                 person per room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, porches, foyers, or half-
                                 rooms. When this figure reaches 1.5 or more persons per room, the condition is
                                 considered severe. One thing to note is that infants and young children are counted
                                 as equivalent to adults in calculating overcrowding.
                                 Various factors lead to overcrowding, but typically it is due to a lack of adequately
                                 sized housing units, high housing costs, or a lack of units affordable to all economic
                                 levels of household income. Households with lower incomes are usually more
                                 affected, as they may opt for overcrowding themselves as a means to afford decent
                                 housing.

                                   Renters are typically more heavily impacted by overcrowding than owners.
                                   According to the 2009 ACS, a total of 6,729 households experienced overcrowding
                                   in Oxnard, with 4,746 households considered overcrowded (1.01 to 1.50 persons
                                   per room) and 1,983 households considered severely overcrowded (1.51 persons
                                   or more per room). Of total overcrowded households, 4,441 were renter-occupied
                                   (66 percent). Of the severely overcrowded households, 1,441 (73 percent) of those
                                   were renter-occupied. Approximately 14 percent of all households in Oxnard were
                                   considered overcrowded in 2009. Data on overcrowding is shown in Table B-21.

                                   INCOME
                                   The income earned by a household directly impacts a household’s ability to acquire
                                   sufficient and affordable housing. Lower-income households are not only limited by
                                   the housing they can afford but also experience an increased incidence of
                                   overpayment and overcrowding as income levels decrease.
                                   To determine the allocation and use of public subsidies, the California Department
                                   of Housing and Community Development (HCD) created income categories based
                                   on the median family income (MFI), which is calculated by HUD. The 2014 MFI for
                                   a family of four in Ventura County is reported as $89,300. The income categories
                                   are defined as follows:
                                        ▪    Extremely low-income households earn between 0 and 30 percent of the
                                             county MFI
                                        ▪    Very low-income households earn between 31 and 50 percent of the
                                             county MFI
                                        ▪    Low-income households earn between 51 and 80 percent of the county
                                             MFI
                                        ▪    Moderate-income households earn between 81 and 120 percent of the
                                             county MFI
                                        ▪    Above moderate-income households earn more than 120 percent of the
                                             county MFI

  Notes:    1. “Family household” refers to the US Census Bureau definition of a family, which is a household that has at least one member
            of the household related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All persons living in family households are included
            in this total regardless of their relationship to the householder. This definition of family excludes one-person households and
            multi-person households of unrelated individuals. Although this definition is inconsistent with California state law, the Census
            definition is presented here for purposes of describing assumptions in the Census data. The City of Oxnard’s definition of family
            complies with state housing law.
            2. “Nonfamily household” refers to the US Census Bureau definition of a nonfamily household, which is people living alone and
            households which do not have any members related to the householder. This Census definition is presented here for purposes
            of describing assumptions in the Census data.
                                           HCD’s housing affordability limits for Ventura County in 2014 are shown in Table
                                           B-23. These limits identify income limits by household size and income level. Four-
                                           person households earning $26,800 annually or less would be considered
                                           extremely low income, while a four-person household earning between $26,800 and
                                           $44,650 would be considered very low income. In comparison, the threshold for
                                           low-income households of four persons is $71,200 annually, while the threshold for
                                           moderate-income households of four persons is $107,150.

                                           The 2014 median income for a family of four in Ventura County is $89,300. For
                                           extremely low-income households, this results in an income of $26,800 or less for
                                           a four-person household, or $18,800 or less for a one-person household. In Oxnard
                                           in 2009, 15.9 percent of households were in the extremely low-income category. A
                                           further breakdown indicates that 50 percent of owner-occupied households and 19
                                           percent of renter-occupied households are considered extremely low income.

                                  Based on the 2014 HCD income limits (Table B-23), a very low-income household
                                  of four could afford up to $1,116 a month for rent. An extremely low-income
                                  household of four could afford up to $670 a month for rent. A four-person household
                                  in the low-income category could afford up to $1,780 a month for rent. Affordable
                                  housing costs range from $99,766 for an extremely low-income household of four
                                  persons to $356,336 for a moderate-income household of four persons. According
                                  to DataQuick, the 2013 median home value in Oxnard was $339,000. A home of
                                  this value would be affordable to a moderate-income household of four, but
                                  unaffordable to low-, very low-, and extremely low-income households of four
                                  persons.

B.5         Extremely Low-Income Households and Housing Problems
                                   EXISTING AND PROJECTED EXTREMELY LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLD
                                   NEEDS
                                   To better characterize the housing needs and constraints of the lower-income
                                   category, the extremely low-income category is used. This is a subset of the very
                                   low-income category. Extremely low-income households will likely face housing
                                   problems such as overpaying, overcrowding, and/or accessibility issues as a result
                                   of their limited incomes. In addition, many extremely low-income households will fall
                                   within a special needs category (disabled, seniors, large families, or female-headed
                                   households) and require supportive housing services. In 2009, there were
                                   approximately 8,047 extremely low-income households in Oxnard, which
                                   represented approximately 16 percent of total households. In comparison, Oxnard
                                   had similar proportions of very low- and lower-income households, with 7,852 very
                                   low-income households (16 percent of total households) and 10,631 low-income
                                   households (21 percent).
                                   HOUSING PROBLEMS FOR LOWER-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
                                   Housing problems include overpayment (discussed earlier in this section) or
                                   households without complete kitchen or plumbing facilities. As shown in Table B-25,
                                   approximately 5 percent of total households have one or more housing problems.
                                   The majority of households with housing problems are renter-occupied, with 2,621
                                   total renter-occupied households experiencing one or more housing problems (86
                                   percent of all households with one or more housing problems). For households with
                                   housing problems, the majority of households lacked telephone service (2,160, or
                                   4 percent of total households).

B.6         Housing Stock Characteristics
                                       INVENTORY AND SUPPLY
                                       According to the 2010 Census, Oxnard added 7,589 housing units to its housing
                                       stock between 2000 and 2010, resulting in a housing growth rate greater than the
                                       overall Ventura County rate (see Tables B-26 and B-27). Between 2000 and 2011,
                                       however, Oxnard housing stock grew by 21 percent (see Table B-28). Both single-
                                       family detached homes and multifamily homes consisting of greater than 5 units
                                       (apartments or condominiums) increased at high rates (27 and 32 percent,
                                       respectively). Oxnard also saw an increase in the stock of duplexes, smaller
                                       multifamily complexes, and mobile homes. According to the 2011 ACS, Oxnard’s
                                       housing stock consists of 69 percent single-family and 26 percent multifamily
                                       homes. Mobile homes and other housing types (boats, vans, campers, etc.) are
                                       5 percent of the housing stock.

                                 CONDITION AND AGE
                                 Three measures useful in evaluating housing condition are the age of the structure,
                                 the incidence of overcrowding, and the lack of plumbing facilities. The 2000 Census
                                 included data on both overcrowding and the lack of plumbing facilities and identified
                                 the number of structures built in each decade for each jurisdiction. As of 2009, the
                                 largest proportion of buildings in Oxnard were constructed between 1960 and 1969
                                 at 24 percent, with buildings constructed between 1970 and 1979 following closely
                                 behind at just over 20 percent (see Table B-28).

                                 Most legally-permitted units in Oxnard have full plumbing and kitchen facilities,
                                 based on observations by the City’s building inspectors and Code Compliance staff.
                                 There are a handful of old small residences that were built before 1940 without what
                                 is now considered complete kitchen and bathroom facilities. There are an unknown
                                 number of unpermitted garage and internal subdivided homes that do not have
                                 complete kitchen and/or bathroom facilities, and sometime lack safe heating.
                                 Residents of these units probably have access to kitchens and bathrooms in the
                                 “parent” housing unit, or share with other boarders. Code Compliance responds to
                                 complaints of illegal units and initiates cases to bring the units into permit
                                 compliance if possible, or requires the units be removed.               There is no
                                 comprehensive illegal unit enforcement program that could provide reliable
                                 statistics on condition. Instead, the City relies on anecdotal information from
                                 inspector, Police and Fire department field personnel, and Code Compliance cases.
                                 An even stronger predictor of housing condition may be the concentration of
                                 overcrowding in a neighborhood. Overcrowding typically occurs when individuals

                                                                                              B. Existing Housing Needs
                                     (i.e., students, seniors, and other low-wage households) share dwelling units to
                                     offset high housing costs. Neighborhoods with multiple families living in one
                                     household are more likely to be in need of rehabilitation.
                                     OCCUPANCY/TENURE
                                     Housing tenure refers to whether the housing unit is rented, owned, or vacant.
                                     Tenure is an important indicator of well-being in a community, because it reflects
                                     the relative cost of housing opportunities and the ability of residents to afford
                                     housing. Vacancies are also important housing market indicators in that the
                                     vacancy rate influences the cost of housing and reflects the match between the
                                     demand for and availability of housing.
                                     The homeownership rate among Oxnard residents was 55 percent in 2000, slightly
                                     less than Ventura County as a whole. This difference was partially due to varying
                                     differences in household income and the type of housing available in jurisdictions
                                     throughout Ventura County. Since 2000, vacancy rates in the city increased more
                                     than in the county, with a 91 percent increase in the city and 74 percent increase in
                                     the county from 2000 to 2010 (see Table B-29). Overall, approximately 5 percent of
                                     housing units in Oxnard were vacant in 2010, or 2,975 households. In comparison,
                                     approximately 5 percent of households in Ventura County were also vacant in 2010,
                                     or 14,775 households.

                                            Oxnard experienced growth in housing supply in recent years of both single-family
                                            and multiple-family homes. Between 2006 and 2013, the city gained a total of 3,645
                                            new housing units, including 1,855 single-family attached or detached homes and
                                            1,790 multiple-family homes (see Table B-30). Any negative numbers reported may
                                            have resulted from more demolitions than units built in that year.

                                   According to DQNews, the median home price in Ventura County and Oxnard
                                   increased nearly by 20 percent from 2012 to 2013. The median home value in
                                   Oxnard was $339,000 in 2013, approximately $54,000 (19 percent) higher than the
                                   median home value in 2012. Median home value similarly increased for Ventura
                                   County, with a median home value of $429,000 in 2013, approximately 26 percent
                                   higher than the median home value in Oxnard. While both the city and the county
                                   experienced approximately a 5 percent decline in median home value from 2010 to
                                   2011, since 2012 median home value has grown for both Oxnard and Ventura
                                   County. Overall, from 2010 to 2013 the median home value in Oxnard increased by

                                     At-Risk Housing
                                     For the purpose of housing element law, assisted housing developments or at-risk
                                     units are defined as multifamily rental housing complexes that receive government
                                     assistance under any of the following: federal, state, and/or local programs (or any
                                     combination of rental assistance, mortgage insurance, interest reductions, and/or
                                     direct loan programs) and which are eligible to convert to market rate due to
                                     termination (opt-out) of a rent subsidy contract (e.g., Housing Choice Vouchers
                                     [Section 8]), mortgage prepayment (e.g., FHA), or other expiring use restrictions
                                     (e.g., state or local programs) within the current and subsequent 5-year planning
                                     period of the housing element. Loss of affordable and assisted housing can have a
                                     large impact on families with incomes below the average. The following is a list of
                                     assisted housing programs whose loss could reduce the number of affordable
                                     housing units.
                                     Based on information from the California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC),
                                     approximately 193 units are identified as potentially at risk, as defined above, during
                                     the time period identified. Table B-35 presents these two potentially at-risk projects
                                     in Oxnard. A total of 149 units receiving Section 8 assistance are potentially at risk
                                     of converting to market-rate housing.

                                     While the expiration date under the federal programs tracked by CHPC has passed
                                     for Channel Islands Park Apartments and is within 10 years of the beginning of the
                                     planning period for Casa Merced, both projects are guaranteed affordability beyond
                                     the 10-year time frame under local affordability agreements as detailed in Table B-
                                     34. Therefore, there are no units current at risk of converting to market rate in
                                     Oxnard.
B.8         Opportunities for Energy Conservation
                                     The California Department of Community Services and Development, in partnership
                                     with the network of local community services agencies that assist low-income
                                     households, administers the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
                                     (LIHEAP) that provides financial assistance to low-income households to offset the
                                     costs of heating and cooling dwellings. The department also manages the Energy
                                     Low-Income Weatherization Assistance Program (DOE-LIWAP) that provides
                                     installation and weatherization measures which increase the energy efficiency of
                                     dwellings occupied by low-income persons.
October 2017                                                                                                     Page B-29
Oxnard Housing Element
                       The Oxnard department in charge of LIHEAP provides energy assistance one time
                       per year for income-eligible households with current gas or electric bills with the
                       requirement that applicants attend an energy education workshop. Community
                       Action of Ventura County Inc. runs the local DOE-LIWAP and provides services
                       including minor home repair and infiltration measures to provide an energy-efficient,
                       safe, and hazard-free dwelling environment, improving the quality of life for income-
                       qualified households. Some of the measures (or services) that Community Action
                       of Ventura County Inc. installs are as follows:
                            ▪   Install weather stripping for all exterior doors, install new thresholds,
                                readjust doors for proper fit, and in some cases replace doors and lock
                                sets. These items alone could save 5 to 25 percent on heating and
                                cooling cost.
                            ▪   Low-flow showerheads and aerators can save up to 5 percent on water
                                heating cost. Electrical outlet and switch gaskets can save up to 3
                                percent on heating and cooling cost.
                            ▪   Insulate attics after inspection by Community Action installers. Ceiling
                                insulation is often the single most cost effective measure that can be
                                installed in the home. By installing insulation, up to 25 percent can be
                                saved on heating cost.
                            ▪   Provide and install energy-efficient light bulbs. These bulbs can provide
                                the same amount and quality of light as incandescent bulbs while using
                                up to 75 percent less energy.
                            ▪   Fix or replace broken windows and glass upon inspection. This reduces
                                the cost of heating a home in the winter and cooling a home in the
                                summer. Replacing broken glass in the home also improves both comfort
                                and safety in that home.
                            ▪   Inspect, test, and repair or replace broken or hazardous furnaces, stoves,
                                and water heaters upon inspection by installers after being deemed
                                hazardous by the gas company.
                            ▪   Provide and install carbon monoxide detectors. This measure protects
                                families against carbon monoxide buildup in the home.
                       In June 2013, the City approved a report on Energy Efficiency Programs and
                       adopted Resolution No. 14,371 approving the City and Community Energy Action
                       Plan (EAP) for the Southern California Edison (SCE) Energy Leadership Program
                       Platinum Level. The EAP corresponds to the policies in the City’s General Plan. The
                       EAP contains programs which when implemented earn the City levels of
                       achievement set out by SCE.
                       Listed below are Oxnard 2030 General Plan policies under Goal SC-3 that promote
                       the production of energy-efficient homes and commercial and industrial buildings.
                       Effective green building design maximizes the use of a development while
                       encouraging the cost effective use of materials by reducing the use of materials and
                       energy resources throughout the lifetime of the development. These recommended
                       standards will promote and place restrictions that ensure energy efficiency in the
                       construction and use of homes.

             expansions.
             Develop a City Energy Action Plan
             Develop an Energy Action Plan (EAP) that identifies feasible programs that reduce
             energy consumption within City government facilities and the City vehicle fleets by
             at least 10 percent below 2005 levels.
             Develop a Community Energy Action Plan
             Develop a Community Energy Action Plan that identifies feasible programs that
             reduce private sector and institutional consumption of energy.
             Alternative Energy for Public Buildings
             As part of the City and Community EAP’s, transition City and other semipublic and
             large energy users to solar and wind energy sources over a reasonable and feasible
             time period.
             Load Shifting Devices
             As part of the City EAP, consider installing devices on municipal buildings that
             reduce the power required to operate equipment and for shifting the equipment
             usage to off-peak hours.
             Targets for Zero-Emission Vehicles
             As part of the City EAP, meet or exceed state targets for zero-emission fuel vehicle
             miles traveled within the City by supporting the use of zero emission vehicles (low
             speed “neighborhood electric vehicles”, utility low range battery electric vehicles,
             mid-range “city electric vehicles,” full function battery electric vehicles, and fuel cell
             vehicles) within City departments and divisions.
             Renewable Energy Production Requirement
             As part of the City and Community EAP’s, require that master planned commercial
             and industrial developments incorporate solar, wind, and other renewable energy
             generation and transmission equipment unless demonstrated to the satisfaction of
             a qualified renewable energy consultant to be infeasible.
             Require Use of Passive Energy Conservation Design
             As part of the City and Community EAPs, require the use of passive energy
             conservation by building material massing, orientation, landscape shading,
             materials, and other techniques as part of the design of local buildings, where
             feasible.
             Promote Voluntary Incentive Programs
             Promote voluntary participation in incentive programs to increase the use of solar
             photovoltaic systems in new and existing residential, commercial, institutional and
             public buildings, including continued participation in the Ventura County Regional
             Energy Alliance (VCREA).

                       such as wind and tidal power into the regional existing power supply grid to reduce
                       reliance on GHG emission producing public utility and privately owned power plants.
                       Waste Conversion to Energy Facility
                       As part of the City and Community EAPs, evaluate the feasibility for the design and
                       construction of a conversion technology capable of converting municipal solid waste
                       into alternative sources of energy.
                       Encourage Natural Ventilation
                       Review and revise applicable planning and building policies and regulations to
                       promote use of natural ventilation in new construction and major additions or
                       remodeling consistent with Oxnard’s temperate climate.
                       The City of Oxnard also adopted an Energy Action Plan (EAP) on June 25, 2013.
                       This plan provides programs to achieve energy efficiency in government operations
                       and community-wide activities. The plan provides a goal of achieving a 10 percent
                       reduction in community-wide energy use. Community programs in the EAP are
                       anticipated to achieve annual energy savings of 34,114,100 kilowatt-hours of
                       electricity and 1,365.600 therms of natural gas by 2020, resulting in a reduction of
                       approximately 27,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Primary community
                       programs recommended in the EAP relative to households in Oxnard are listed
                       below, together with program descriptions:
                       Program C-2: Additional Outreach to Residents
                       The City would increase its education and outreach to local residents and owners
                       of residential buildings to raise awareness of local, utility, state and federal energy
                       saving programs.
                       Program C-3: Establish Partnerships between City Green Team and Local
                       Agencies
                       The City’s Green Team would coordinate and network with their counterparts at
                       local agencies, school districts, and non-profits to share best-practices towards
                       reducing energy consumption within the community and neighboring areas as well
                       as reduce first-costs associated with implementing energy reduction strategies.
                       Program C-4: Implement Alternative Financing Mechanisms
                       Beyond PACE programs, Oxnard should consider establishing additional financing
                       mechanisms for residential and/or commercial energy performance assessments
                       and system upgrades.
                       Program C-6: Promote Renewable Energy Generation
                       A possible barrier to installation of distributed renewable energy generation are
                       zoning and building code regulations, up-front and financing costs, long cost-
                       recovery periods, and access to information

                                                                     B. Existing Housing Needs
             Program C-7: Support Electric Vehicle Infrastructure
             Plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles (EVs) help reduce GHG emissions and other air
             pollutants and have the potential to take advantage of distributed sources of
             renewable energy, such as solar panels. A recent report by the Union of Concerned
             Scientists8 illustrates that EVs in California would produce lower GHG emissions
             than even the most fuel-efficient hybrids. EVs charged entirely from renewable
             sources like wind and solar power produce virtually no GHG emissions. California
             is actively promoting plug-in hybrid and EVs to reduce dependence on foreign
             imported oil and meet the AB 32 GHG emissions reduction targets
             Program C-8: INCF Neighborhood Vintage Assessment Program
             The City is divided into 75 residential neighborhoods distinguished by geography
             and, in many cases, similar size and style of residential construction, referred to as
             housing and commercial “vintage.” The City’s neighborhoods are supported by the
             Inter-Neighborhood Council Forum (INCF), which serves as a venue for information
             exchange and coordination at the neighborhood level. Most neighborhoods are
             largely single-family subdivisions and often represent one or two vintage California
             and Oxnard development periods, such as 1920s bungalows and wood frame
             homes, post-World War II small stucco homes, 1960s ranch-style homes, 1970s
             split foyer homes, and 1980s multifamily condominiums.
             Program C-10: Create Residential PACE Program
             Residential PACE programs are similar in concept to Commercial PACE programs
             (see EAP Program C-9), and are made possible through the same State Assembly
             Bill 811. Legal aspects, structure, and marketing of Residential PACE programs
             differ in several aspects. Residential PACE programs were delayed from 2010-2012
             due to a ruling that the program may violate federal lending practices. However,
             funding is now available through the 14-county CaliforniaFIRST financing district
             funded by the California Energy Commission with Ventura County as the lead
             agency. Financing is available up to $35,000 for homeowners in 20 year loans with
             interest rates from 7 to 8 percent.
             Program C-11: Expedite Permitting
             Expedited permitting is a strong incentive to increase the number of energy
             efficiency, conservation and green building measures in construction projects, since
             the extra money spent to improve building performance is often offset by a shorter
             development timeline. Many California cities offer expedited permitting for green
             building projects using a checklist of green building/energy efficiency and
             conservation measures that must be included to be eligible for the expedited
             process.
             Program C-15: Develop Renewable Energy Ordinance
             Renewable Energy Ordinance would require certain new developments in the City
             to incorporate clean renewable energy generation into their plans.

                                            Special Housing Needs
                                                                                C
             California state law requires under Government Code Section 65583(4)(D)(7) that
             the Housing Element include an analysis of special needs housing which is defined
             by the State to include the following:
                  ▪ Persons with Disabilities (including those with developmental disabilities)
                  ▪ Elderly
                  ▪ Large Families and Single-Parent Families
                  ▪ Farmworkers
                  ▪ Families and Persons in Need of Emergency Housing
             Other definitions of special needs population may apply relative to specific
             development standards or operating conditions, such as the Health and Safety
             Code Section 51312 definition of Supportive Housing for special needs populations.
             These special housing needs are associated with specific demographic or
             occupational groups and call for very specific program responses, such as the
             preservation of single-room occupancy hotels or the development of units with
             larger bedroom counts. Families or individuals that belong to any special needs
             group are likely to encounter more difficulties in finding housing within their means,
             spending a disproportionate amount of their income to secure safe and decent
             housing. Special needs groups are sometimes subject to discrimination based on
             their specific needs or circumstances.
             The Oxnard Housing Authority (OHA) currently (2014) maintains 1,659 Section 8
             vouchers for persons in need of assistance for housing. Approximately 114 of these
             vouchers are tenant protection vouchers. The tenant protection vouchers are for
October 2017                                                                              Page C-1

                                        residents of the Courts project that is being rebuilt. They can use the vouchers to
                                        move out during construction and then back in afterwards. These vouchers only
                                        apply to the Courts project.
                                        The following discussion evaluates the characteristics and most recent available
                                        quantitative data for the special needs groups identified in Oxnard.
C.1     Persons with Disabilities
                                        Persons with disabilities face unique problems in obtaining affordable and adequate
                                        housing, with living arrangements and housing needs that vary based on the
                                        severity of the disability. This portion of Oxnard’s population includes individuals
                                        with mental, physical, and developmental disabilities, with a need for affordable,
                                        conveniently located housing specially adapted to the individual’s physical needs.
                                        Many persons live at home in an independent environment with the help of other
                                        family members. To maintain independent living, disabled persons may require
                                        assistance. This can include special housing design features for the physically
                                        disabled, income support for those who are unable to work, and in-home supportive
                                        services for persons with medical conditions. Accessible housing can also be
                                        provided via senior housing developments.
                                        Many disabled persons live on a small fixed income, which severely limits their
                                        ability to pay for housing. Persons with disabilities often have a higher rate of
                                        unemployment relative to other groups, with the sole source of income for most
                                        being a fixed pension provided by Social Security Disability Insurance, Social
                                        Security Insurance, or Social Security Old Age and Survivor’s Insurance. This
                                        allowance alone does not cover the costs of rent and basic living expenses.
                                        Table C-1 summarizes persons with a disability in Oxnard by employment status,
                                        as well as elderly with a disability. Just over 20 percent of Oxnard’s population is
                                        registered as having a disability. As shown in Table C-1, 44 percent of the disabled
                                        population in Oxnard is employed. In comparison, 34 percent of the disabled
                                        population is within the working ages of 16 to 64 years old and not employed.

                                          Table C-2 offers a breakdown of disability types by age groups. Physical and mental
                                          disabilities are the two largest disability categories in Oxnard’s general population.
                                          Among those over the age of 16, employment and go-outside-home disabilities are
                                          the most prominent of the total disabled population at 32 percent and 25 percent,
                                          respectively. Go-outside-home disabilities are, by definition, disabilities limiting a
                                          person’s ability to leave his or her residence alone to do such activities as shop or
                                          visit the doctor’s office.

 Note:       1. A person can fall under more than one disability type; therefore, total disabilities exceed the total number of disabled persons.
                                          The US Census Bureau defines a physical disabled person as a person who is 5
                                          years of age or older who has a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting six
                                          months or more that substantially limits one or more basic physical abilities such as
                                          walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying. As shown in Table C-2,
                                          approximately 31 percent of the disabled population consisted of individuals with a
                                          physical disability. Approximately 20 percent of the disabled population consisted
                                          of persons with a mental disability, followed by 15 percent with a sensory disability.
                                          DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED
                                          Senate Bill (SB) 812 requires the City to include the needs of individuals with a
                                          developmental disability in the community in the special housing needs analysis.
                                          According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, a “developmental
                                          disability” means a disability that originates before an individual attains age 18
                                          years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a
                                          substantial disability for that individual which includes mental retardation, cerebral
                                          palsy, epilepsy, and autism.
                                          Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently in a
                                          conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a
                                          group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected
                                          individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention and

                                          adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is
                                          the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
                                          independence as an adult.
                                          The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides
                                          community-based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental
                                          disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four
                                          developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The Tri-Counties
                                          Regional Center is one of 21 regional centers in California that provides point of
                                          entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. The center is a private,
                                          nonprofit community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide
                                          range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.

                                          Table C-4 provides information about developmentally disabled residents by
                                          residence type. There are a number of housing types appropriate for people living
                                          with a development disability: rent-subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed
                                          single-family homes, Section 8 vouchers, special programs for home purchase, US

                                          homes. The design of housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services
                                          and transit, and the availability of group living opportunities represent some of the
                                          types of considerations that are important in serving this need group. Incorporating
                                          “barrier-free” design in all new multifamily housing (as required by California and
                                          federal fair housing laws) is especially important to provide the widest range of
                                          choices for disabled residents. Special consideration should also be given to the
                                          affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
                                          In order to assist in the housing needs for persons with developmental disabilities,
                                          the City will implement programs to coordinate housing activities and outreach with
                                          the Tri-Counties Regional Center. The City will seek to encourage housing
                                          providers to designate a portion of new affordable housing developments for
                                          persons with disabilities, especially persons with developmental disabilities, and
                                          pursue funding sources designated for persons with special needs and disabilities.
                                          Program 24 is proposed to address the needs of the developmentally disabled.

C.2     Elderly
                                         An elderly person is someone who is 65 years of age or older. Senior households
                                         have special housing needs primarily due to physical disabilities and limitations,
                                         income level, and health care costs. As shown in Table C-6, there were 7,542
                                         households in Oxnard in 2000 headed by a person who is 65 years of age or older.
                                         Of that number, the majority of senior households were owner-occupied, with
                                         approximately 45 percent of these households consisting of owner-occupied senior
                                         households 65–74 years in age, and 32 percent of consisting of owner-occupied
                                         senior households 75 years in age or older. From 2000 to 2010, total senior
                                         households in Oxnard increased by 17 percent. The majority of senior households
                                         in 2010 consisted of owner-occupied households (76 percent of total senior
                                         households), with 3,627 senior households 65–74 years of age, and 3,083 senior
                                         households 75 years or older.

                                         Elderly households also may experience higher burdens from housing costs due to
                                         limited or fixed incomes. While definitions of housing affordability can vary, in
                                         general a household should pay no more than 30 percent of its monthly income on
                                         housing costs. Households that pay more than this are considered cost-burdened
                                         and households that pay more than 50 percent are considered severely cost-
                                         burdened. Measuring the number of households paying more than these
                                         percentages helps define an area’s affordability problem.

Oxnard Housing Element
                                     Overpayment data for Oxnard’s elderly households by tenure is reported by the
                                     2007–2011 ACS Five-Year Estimates in the CHAS datasets. Table C-7 provides
                                     this information for each income category as well as for all households with lower
                                     incomes (extremely low-, very low-, and low-income households). The table is

                                     (AMI) spent more than 30 percent of its income on housing costs; approximately 17
                                     percent of total households. For elderly households earning between 31 and 50
                                     percent of AMI, 775 were also burdened by the cost of housing, approximately 13
                                     percent of total households. Lower-income (80 percent or less of AMI) renter and
                                     owner elderly households both experienced high rates of overpayment, with owner

C.3      Large Families and Single-Parent Families
                                     LARGE FAMILIES
                                     A large family is described by HUD as a family or household with five or more
                                     members. According to the 2000 Census, there were 43,630 households in Oxnard
                                     and 32 percent had five or more members. Of the owner-occupied units, 68 percent
                                     have three or more bedrooms, while 22 percent of rental units have three or more
                                     bedrooms.
                                     Table C-8 shows the distribution of large owner- and renter-occupied households
                                     in Oxnard from 2000 to 2010. The total proportion of large households with five or

                                    SINGLE-PARENT HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD
                                    Single-parent households, particularly female-headed households, generally have
                                    lower incomes and higher living expenses than other households. A female-headed
                                    household is defined as a female that is unmarried and living with at least one child
                                    under the age of 18. Single parents contribute more of their monthly income to the
                                    cost of maintaining and supplying a home, qualifying some female heads of
                                    household to be in need of special housing.
                                    Table C-9 compares the household demographics of Oxnard for the years 2000 to
                                    2010. There has been a slight increase (11 percent) in families from 2000 to 2010.
                                    The largest increase has occurred in female-headed households, which have risen
                                    22 percent from 2000 to 2010 to comprise 19 percent of total households, and these
                                    families may need assistance in housing. Female-headed households comprised
                                    22 percent of total households in Oxnard in 2010, with approximately 7,465 female-
                                    headed households. Of these female-headed households, 4,041 or 10 percent had
                                    children under the age of 18.

Oxnard Housing Element
                       COLLEGE STUDENTS
                       Some Oxnard residents may attend one of three public colleges in the immediate
                       area and may qualify as in need of housing based on low income or other criteria.
                       Ventura County Community College District (Oxnard College). Founded in 1975,
                       the college is accessible from the Ventura Freeway or the Pacific Coast Highway.
                       About 7,000 students are enrolled at Oxnard College for the 2014/2015 academic
                       year. Many Oxnard residents may enroll in classes at the Ventura Community
                       College, located at 4667 Telegraph Road in the city of Ventura, that are not
                       available at the Oxnard campus.
                       California State University, Channel Islands. California State University (CSU)
                       Channel Islands is the twenty-third campus of the CSU system and the first four-
                       year public university in Ventura County. The university offers baccalaureate and
                       master’s degrees in business, natural sciences, computer sciences, the arts, and
                       teacher education to a 2015 enrollment of approximately 6,000 students.
                       Students living in the City of Oxnard may also commute to colleges located outside
                       of Oxnard for class offerings not available locally. Other nearby colleges that may
                       serve students residing in Oxnard include Moorpark College, a community college
                       located approximately 30 miles east of Oxnard in Moorpark.
C.4    Farmworkers
                       Ventura County has year-round agricultural production and farmworkers are more
                       likely to establish permanent residences in Oxnard and Santa Paula where most
                       agricultural processing is located. Estimating the size of the agricultural labor force
                       is problematic, as farmworkers are historically undercounted by the US Census and
                       other data sources. Farmworkers are typically categorized into three groups:
                       permanent, seasonal, and migrant. Permanent farmworkers are employed year-
                       round by the same employer. A seasonal farmworker works, on average, less than
                       150 days per year and earns at least half of his/her earned income from farm work.
                       Migrant farmworkers are travelling seasonal farmworkers who “follow the crops”
                       and may not have a local permanent residence.
                       There are several estimates of the number of farmworkers in Ventura County,
                       detailed below.
                            ▪    The Ventura County Housing Element. Estimate of 35,181 workers based
                                 on the 2000 Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Enumeration Profiles
                                 Study (MSFES) conducted by the US Department of Health and Human
                                 Services. Of the 35,181 workers, 7,758 (22 percent) were estimated full-
                                 time workers, 14,726 (42 percent) were seasonal workers, and 12,697 (36
                                 percent) were migrant farmworkers.
                            ▪    August 2002, County of Ventura Farmworker Housing Study. The study
                                 was conducted by developing and distributing 9,000 English and Spanish
                                 surveys to agricultural workers, contractors, school districts, and
                                 farmworker advocate organizations. Nearly 17 percent (1,516) were
                                 completed and 918 (60 percent) of the respondents listed Oxnard as their

                                                                                                           C. Special Housing Needs
                                                  place of residence. The estimated annual farmworker income ranges from
                                                  $8,000 to $25,000, and 75 percent were classified as extremely low
                                                  income by HUD definitions.
                                             ▪    2007, Clinicas Del Camino Real. A total of 41,704 farmworker patients
                                                  were seen at all nine locations in the county. Of these, 25,241 (60.5
                                                  percent) were seen at the four Oxnard locations.

                                                  Fair Housing Choice (AI). This HUD-required multijurisdictional analysis
                                                  solicited input and participation from stakeholders, policymakers, and
                                                  housing advocates. As reported in the AI, according the 2012 American
                                                  Community Survey, the most significant concentration of those working in
                                                  the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining industry, which
                                                  includes farmworkers, is in Oxnard, with close to 62 percent of the county
                                                  employees for this industry sector.

                                                  Payroll, listed 30,172 workers: 17,120 worked 150 days or more, 13,052
                                                  less than 150 days. The total farmworker payroll was $364.4 million, or
                                                  about $12,075 each. Based on a total number of 2,150 farms in Ventura
                                                  County, 91 percent employed fewer than 10 employees. While small
                                                  farms are prevalent, 93 percent of farmworkers work on large farms with
                                                  over 10 workers. Data on farmworkers in Ventura County is presented in

                       these camps are located in the unincorporated area of the county, with the
                       exception of the Garden City camp in Oxnard. Camp Vanessa in Oxnard is also
                       included although it is not a State-licensed camp. Camp Vanessa is the only camp
                       on the list within the Oxnard city limits that was a Bracero Program camp
                       constructed during WWII for temporary Mexican labor. No new farmworker camps
                       have been built since the adoption of the previous Housing Element.

                                         their last place of known residence but who have nowhere to live.
                                         A shelter provides families and/or individuals a place to stay with facilities for a
                                         maximum of 180 days; a transitional housing facility provides shelter for a typical
                                         maximum of two years. The family or individual must put forward no more than 30
                                         percent of their adjusted gross income toward housing costs. Shelters and
                                         transitional housing are generally developed and managed by nonprofit and/or faith-
                                         based organizations that may differ in the populations served and how their facilities

                                   Homelessness is one of the more complex issues in Oxnard and Ventura County
                                   as a whole. The lack of income by many of the homeless combined with the
                                   changes in state and federal support programs for the mentally and physically
                                   disabled, veterans, and others have made homelessness a difficult issue. The 2014
                                   County of Ventura Homeless Count report is included by reference as the best
                                   available documentation regarding the homeless population.

                                                     PROJECTED HOUSING NEEDS
                                                                                                 D
D.1       Regional Housing Needs Allocation
                            California state law requires Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to
                            determine the existing and projected housing need for their regions. The County of
                            Ventura, and Oxnard, is part of the Southern California Association of Governments
                            (SCAG) MPO. For each housing element planning cycle, SCAG determines the
                            share of current and projected Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) for its
                            member jurisdictions. SCAG adopted the Final RHNA methodology on November
                            3, 2011. The adopted RHNA plan was approved by the California Department of
                            Housing and Community Development (HCD) on November 26, 2012.
                            SCAG’s RHNA process was consistent with the requirements of Senate Bill 375,
                            new since the previous Housing Element cycle. Additional details on the RHNA
                            methodology are available on SCAG’s website. In 2009, SCAG requested each
                            jurisdiction provide a projection of net added housing units likely to develop by 2021.
                            Oxnard provided a projection that was based on the draft 2030 General Plan that,
                            in 2009, included a proposed specific plan outside City limits of 2,500 units (Jones
                            Ranch). In 2011, the City Council adopted the 2030 General Plan after removing
                            the proposed specific plan. The SCAG RHNA continued to include the additional
                            2,500 units and the City appealed the RHNA allocation (Table D-1) in 2012. The
                            appeal was denied by SCAG on the grounds that the 2009 RHNA ‘process’ had to
                            be upheld despite the City’s subsequent adoption of the 2030 General Plan. The
                            City maintains that the 2014-2021 RHNA allocation is unfair, unrealistic, and too
                            high by 2,500 units. Furthermore, several SCAG jurisdictions submitted small
                            housing development projections compared to their historic and realistic
                            development activity, which results in a very small commitment to affordable

                                   Government Code Section 65583 was amended effective January 1, 2007,
                                   requiring that the housing needs assessment in a housing element include a new
                                   income category—extremely low income (30 percent or less of county median
                                   family income). Per HCD, the extremely low-income need can be calculated as 50
                                   percent of the very low-income need. This approach has been used to determine
                                   the extremely low- and very low-income numbers in Table D-1.

E.1        Land-Use Controls
                           State law requires the use of the term “constraints,” which generally implies forces
                           or efforts to restrain actions that would otherwise occur. Environmental review,
                           general planning, zoning, and related local land use policies, regulations and
                           development standards are extensions of local government police powers to protect
                           life and property, minimize nuisances, and achieve a desired quality of life as
                           expressed through a participatory democratic process. Local constraints are either
                           required by state law (such as preparing and adopting a General Plan and
                           conducting environmental review) or were enacted to remedy or prevent a specific
                           local issue (such as requiring landscaping to deter graffiti). The term “constraint”
                           should not be interpreted in the context that local development standards and
                           development review procedures are inhibiting the provision of quality affordable
                           housing which would otherwise be developed. Instead, this section should be
                           interpreted as a review of local development standards and development review
                           procedures to ascertain whether a development standard or procedure or other
                           regulation is no longer needed, has unintended and/or unnecessary negative
                           consequences, and/or could be improved so as to increase opportunities and the
                           feasibility of developing affordable housing (especially special needs and very low-
                           and low-income units), or any development. Periodic review and analysis of
                           constraints in this context is welcome.

                       TERMS
                       Density (net and gross). Density is calculated by taking the number of dwelling
                       units in an area and dividing it by the acreage in the area. Gross density is
                       calculated using the total acreage for the area. Net density is calculated by dividing
                       units by the net acreage, generally, exclusive of roadways.
                       Floor area ratio (FAR). The ratio of gross floor area of structures on a particular
                       parcel to the gross area of the parcel on which the structures are located.
                       Gross acreage. The total area of a site.
                       Lot coverage. The amount of a lot that is allowed to be covered by the footprint of
                       structures on that lot.
                       Net acreage. Calculated by taking the gross acreage of a site and subtracting
                       portions of the site dedicated to public improvements, such as streets.
                       Planned Development (PD). Land use zoning that allows the adoption of a set of
                       development standards which are specific to a particular project. PD zones usually
                       do not contain detailed development standards; those are established during the
                       process of considering proposals and adopted upon project approval. Also known
                       as a Planned Residential Group (PRG).
                       Zoning. The principal land use tool for implementing the General Plan; it translates
                       General Plan land use recommendations and standards directly into enforceable
                       regulations. A zoning ordinance divides a community into districts and specifies the
                       land uses allowed and the development standards that apply for each district.
                       Standards generally include minimum lot size, density, building height, lot coverage,
                       and setbacks.
                       RESIDENTIAL ZONING AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
                       The land use policies for residential development are discussed in detail in the
                       Oxnard 2030 General Plan and the Local Coastal Plan (LCP), in combination with
                       the City’s non-coastal and coastal zoning regulations (Chapters 16 and 17,
                       respectively). The general plan, LCP, and implementing zoning regulations
                       combined establish the amount and distribution of land to be allocated for different
                       housing densities. In October 2011, the City of Oxnard adopted the updated 2030
                       General Plan, with a planning horizon through 2030. The Oxnard LCP was initially
                       adopted in 1982. The City set aside funding for a comprehensive update to the LCP
                       in 2013 and applied for grants, then received grant award and retained consultants
                       in 2014, and began using State grants in 2015. The update will likely be completed
                       in 2017 at the earliest.
                       Housing supply and costs are partially affected by the amount of land designated
                       for housing and available within Oxnard city limits and within the Oxnard City Urban
                       Restriction Boundary (CURB) requiring annexation. Each residential zone, and
                       certain commercial zones allowing residential development, has a residential
                       density and development standards that regulate lot size, building height, setbacks,
                       parking, etc. Table E-1 summarizes residential densities by zoning category and

  Notes:
          1. Minimum lot area applies for lots that directly abut a waterway. Lots not directly abutting a waterway subject to a 6,000-square-foot
              minimum lot area.
          2. Minimum lot area of 2,400 square feet per dwelling unit.
          3. Oxnard Coastal Land Use Plan sets actual maximum allowed density based on then-existing Coastal zoning.
                                            Similar to many California cities that had a growth “boom” after WWII, a relatively
                                            high proportion of the residential districts allow only single-family housing at seven
                                            units per acre (R-1 zoning). Many of the single-family housing tracts in Oxnard were
                                            approved with the Planned Development (“-PD”) designation, which allows flexibility
                                            with the development standards through a Special Use Permit.
                                            The Oxnard Zoning Code allows second dwelling units to be developed in zones
                                            R-1 through R-4. Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU), which are also commonly called
                                            second units or “granny flats,” allow increased residential density while providing
                                            minimal impact on the character of low-density neighborhoods. These often
                                            detached, self-sufficient units are constructed on the property of a primary unit such
                                            as a detached house but are typically smaller in size. Oxnard’s ADU ordinance is
                                            recognized as relatively restrictive and staff is proposing to increase the allowed
                                            size of the ADU unit relative to land available (see Program 6).
                                            The Oxnard Zoning Code allows live/work units in the Limited Manufacturing (ML)
                                            zone. These units are limited to efficiency units that may only be used by the on-
                                            site business.
                                            RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
                                            The Zoning Code also serves to preserve the character and integrity of existing
                                            neighborhoods. The code sets forth residential development standards for each
                                            zoning district, as listed below and described in Table E-2.

             Allowed Height
             Allowed height in residential zones is generally capped at two and three stories,
             except for the R-4 (High Rise Residential) zone, which allows height up to 45 feet.
             Within the R-4 zone, buildings may be approved up to 11 stories or 100 feet with a
             Special Use Permit. Additionally, the 2030 General Plan allows six stories in all but
             R-1, R-2, and MHP zoning with no fixed height limit, but the zoning code has not
             been updated to reflect the change. The granting of additional height over six stories
             may require environmental review that includes shade and shadow and wind impact
             analyses and mitigation for these impacts.
             Lot Size and Density
             Lot size standards establish a minimum lot area through width and depth
             dimensions, and access to streets and utilities for orderly development of residential
             property. Density in a residential area is influenced by building height limits and lot
             size requirements. In Oxnard, lot size and height are well calibrated across all
             residential zones, such that one is not significantly more restrictive than the other.
             Setbacks are largely for fire safety and deference is given to Fire Department
             regarding the possibility to reduce setbacks distances.
             Setback Requirements
             Setback requirements define the minimum horizontal distance between the face of
             a structure and its lot line(s). Setbacks were initially developed to inhibit the ability
             of a fire to spread from building to building. They are still considered necessary to
             provide firefighting access between structures. Front yard setbacks are used to
             create a streetscape desired by the community. Similar to allowed heights, the
             effect of setback requirements is to define the massing and size of the development
             envelope rather than the number of units, even though these elements are
             intimately related.
             Using the R-3 (Garden Apartment) zone as an example, typical (slightly flexible)
             setback requirements would yield a structure that is set back 20 feet from the front
             property line, 5 feet from each side property line, and 25 feet from the rear property
             line. As an example, a quarter-acre parcel (totaling 10,890 square feet) would allow
             a building with a maximum footprint totaling 5,546 square feet, covering just over
             half the area of the property. Given that this hypothetical project could extend to a
             maximum of 35 feet in height, as established earlier, the total square footage of the
             project could conceivably reach 16,638 square feet (three floors), which would
             accommodate 12 units (four units per floor at approximately 1,300 square feet
             each). This size project would fit within the density ranges allowed in the
             designation.
             Setbacks do not seem to be a limiting factor impacting allowed density, housing
             supply, or affordability. This holds true across the R-1 through R-4 residential zones.
             It is important to note that setback requirements in each zoning district are constant
             regardless of the size of the parcel, so they impact development on smaller parcels
             to a greater degree than development on larger lots. Narrow parcels that could
             normally accommodate development may not, after applying setback requirements,
             be feasible for housing if the resulting buildable portion of the lot is too narrow or

                       awkward for efficient construction or functionality. The zoning variance is a standard
                       City procedure available to consider parcels with unusual shape or other
                       constraining attributes.
                       Open Space and Interior Yard Space Requirements
                       Oxnard maintains minimum open space requirements for all residential
                       development. Open space is an essential quality of life element in the city where its
                       moderate coastal climate does not typically include air conditioning in most housing
                       units. The interior yard open space requirements range from 15 percent of the lot
                       area in the R-1 zone up to 30 percent in the R-4 zone. Open space and yard
                       requirements affect site design and the layout of structures on the property.
                       Achieving the City’s desired open space provisions is usually accommodated
                       through minor project redesign and seldom prevents a development from gaining
                       City approval. Similar to the development standards previously identified in this
                       section, open space and interior yard space requirements play only a partial and
                       somewhat overlapping role in residential development in Oxnard. The amount of
                       interior yard space or open space required in a residential development is
                       expressed in terms of a percentage of the total lot area. Even if the area is achieved,
                       it also must meet minimum dimension criteria in order to make it usable. Therefore,
                       the total amount of required open space varies, depending on the size of the lot,
                       but the minimum dimensions of the open space remain fixed. As a result, smaller
                       lot developments or narrow lot developments are disproportionately burdened by
                       Oxnard’s open space requirements because they must maintain the same
                       percentage of open space as larger lot developments, but are more likely to have a
                       higher percentage of their lots set aside because the project fails to provide qualified
                       interior yard space. This condition exists because small, narrow, or elongated lots
                       are more likely to exhibit setbacks along portions of property line(s) that are less
                       than 10 feet in width, compared with lots that are larger or more regular in shape.
                       While it is understandable that Oxnard mandates minimum dimensions for open
                       areas so that they are usable, such a requirement may constrain development on
                       irregular lots. The City encourages applicants to assemble narrow lots into larger
                       parcels.
                       PARKING REQUIREMENTS
                       The City tries to balance real parking needs and avoid unnecessary parking
                       requirements. Parking requirements vary by residential type, lot size, and the
                       particular short-term vehicle storage needs associated with different types of
                       development, as shown in Table E-3. On-site, well-designed parking is an important
                       aspect of quality of life and property valuation in Oxnard. Several older
                       neighborhoods experience parking shortages because older residential units do not
                       have adequate space for off-street parking. This issue has been repeatedly raised
                       by the public at City Council meetings. Oftentimes in these areas, the problem of
                       parking is also an issue of multiple families living in one single-family unit or in the
                       garage. When homes become overcrowded, as is prevalent in Oxnard, additional
                       parking spaces might be required to accommodate all individuals, but not
                       necessarily available. According to the 2009 American Community Survey (ACS),

             approximately 14 percent of households in Oxnard were considered overcrowded,
             with more than one person per room.
             The 2013 Latinos Unidos v. Napa County First Appellant District ruling and
             subsequent HCD opinion letter that requires counting of affordable units under a
             local inclusionary ordinance to also count toward qualifying for the state density
             bonus (GC 65915 et seq.) supersedes City parking requirements, as any project
             over 10 units is subject to the City’s 10 percent inclusionary requirement which then
             automatically earns a 20 percent State Density bonus, reduced parking
             requirements per State density bonus law, and entitlement to one or more
             development standard concessions. The City is considering revising the City’s
             inclusionary ordinance to account for this unexpected reduction in parking that
             would likely impact neighborhoods with guest parking if a project were built with only
             State-required parking. To date, all residential projects are including guest parking
             in recognition of the need by their residents.

                                          Detached housing in Oxnard requires a minimum of two garage parking spaces for
                                          dwelling units up to six bedrooms, one additional garage space at seven bedrooms,
                                          and another space for eight or more bedrooms. In the case of apartments, only a
                                          single space is required, unless there are two or more bedrooms in the unit, in which
                                          case two are required. Adequate and appropriate on-site garage parking is a
                                          necessity that prevents impacts on public streets and neighborhoods and provides
                                          secure parking for vehicles.

                                                                                    E. Constraints
             Oxnard has an average of four persons per household, with about 8,000
             households of seven or more people (ACS 2013). Many households have three and
             four working adults, each with a car. Many neighborhoods are parking impacted.
             Parking requirements can be a constraint, as additional parking spaces may be
             required in order to add more rooms or an accessory dwelling unit to the property.
             In instances where a household is overcrowded and the addition of another room
             would alleviate this overcrowding, it is often infeasible to add an additional garage
             parking space to the property due to lack of space or for financial costs.
             Furthermore, every room that could be considered a bedroom is counted when
             determining the number of parking spaces required for a housing unit, even if the
             room is used as a den or office. However, several neighborhoods have requested
             permit parking because some occupants have more than the average number of
             vehicles and/or do not park in their garages and/or have RVs and boats on their
             driveways. Enforcement of parking requirements does not necessarily constrain the
             production of additional rooms that could help reduce overcrowding. The City
             currently allows common garage parking as well as tandem parking to provide
             flexibility in parking requirements.
             The City has an administrative relief procedure that is often approved to request
             reduced parking under certain circumstances (such as retirement housing, senior
             housing, and affordable housing) and the City’s density bonus ordinance is in
             compliance with state law to allow a lower parking requirement for projects that
             qualify for the density bonus (10 units or more). It is rare that affordable housing
             projects of fewer than 10 units are proposed in the city. In addition to these flexible
             ways the City addresses parking requirements the City has also included Program
             30 to evaluate the current parking requirements and explore alternative options to
             ensure parking requirements do not pose an undue constraint on the development
             of housing affordable to lower-income households.
             NONRESIDENTIAL ZONING OPTIONS
             The majority of housing opportunities in Oxnard are governed by its residential
             zoning districts. There is considerable opportunity for residential growth in both
             commercial zoning districts and in the Central Business District (CBD). Table E-4
             summarizes these opportunities by nonresidential zoning district. Oxnard will need
             to take into consideration the requirements of California’s Housing Accountability
             Act (Government Code Section 65589.5) when considering applications for Special
             Use Permits for the districts listed in Table E-4.

                                          Of the four districts listed above, the CBD zone comprising about 128 acres
                                          presents the largest opportunity for housing development because it allows a variety
                                          of housing types and densities that exceed those allowed in the R-4 (High Rise
                                          Residential) zone. The CBD also covers a fairly large amount of land relative to the
                                          R-4 zone and therefore could eventually provide for the construction of a relatively
                                          large number of housing units. The allowance of a mix of land uses within the same
                                          building allows greater project flexibility to developers, which could make the
                                          provision of housing in downtown feasible across a wider variety of market
                                          conditions.
                                          The CBD zone does not maintain explicit minimum lot sizes, has minimal setback
                                          requirements (no setbacks if commercial uses are included), allows small units of
                                          450 square feet, and allows 39 units per acre by right. While parking standards still
                                          apply, the provision of required spaces is more flexible and can be accommodated
                                          through a mix of on-street spaces located adjacent to the property, spaces located
                                          in nearby lots or parking structures, and spaces accommodated on-site.
                                          The C-2 zone covers 607 acres, located mainly along arterials and in several large
                                          shopping centers. The C-2 zoning district allows an all-housing development at the
                                          R-3 density (13–18 dwelling units per acre) and standards, although mixed use is
                                          the preference. A SUP is appropriate in C-2 because housing in the C-2 zone needs
                                          review as not all C-2 are appropriate for residential uses. City Council requires full
                                          cost recovery to evaluate, therefore the SUP process, which is a deposit account
                                          based on actual review costs, is appropriate.
                                          SPECIFIC PLANS
                                          Seven residential or mixed use specific plans adopted after 1980 account for most
                                          residential development over the past 35 years. The Northwest Community and
                                          Northwest Golf Course specific plans are traditional single-family detached
                                          subdivisions. The Seabridge, Mandalay Phase IV, The Village, Riverpark, and
                                          Northeast Community specific plans enable a wide range of single- and multi-family
                                          housing at various densities and varied development standards. The specific plan

                            process is available for medium and larger projects and allows flexibility in density

E.2        2030 General Plan
                            Oxnard’s existing land use patterns reflect the city’s unique coastal location and
                            agricultural history. With the exception of several high-rise buildings in north
                            Oxnard, the city is characterized by one- or two-story buildings, low- and medium-
                            density residential, and a large industrial area surrounded by agricultural land and
                            the Pacific Ocean and Santa Clara River. Most of the city’s higher-intensity
                            development lies along primary thoroughfares such as Oxnard Boulevard, Highway
                            101, Saviers Road, and Gonzales Road.
                            The adopted 2030 General Plan proposes development in three general ways:
                            (1) completion of development patterns envisioned by the 2020 General Plan and
                            within the CURB, (2) redevelopment within the CURB with an “urban village”
                            concept, and (3) incorporation of the Ormond Beach Wetlands Restoration Plan.
                            The urban villages would incorporate private redevelopment, mixed land uses,
                            affordable and workforce housing, and transit connectivity and are intended to be a
                            key strategy for meeting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.
E.3        Fees and Exactions
                            Development fees and exactions are either required or enabled by state law so that
                            development is orderly and infrastructure, utilities, and services are available for
                            new residents. Since 1978, when California voters approved Proposition 13, local
                            governments have had to rely on fees and exactions to provide mandated
                            infrastructure, utilities, and services to accommodate the constrained local tax base.
                            These improvements and services, while required, are not funded by the State.
                            Fees and exactions are an expected component of development along with land,
                            construction materials, and labor costs.
                            Fees, land dedications, and other exactions are charged directly to the developer
                            and are passed on to the ultimate end user in the form of higher prices and rents
                            unless there is a source of subsidy funding such as federal or state funding.
                            Table E-5 displays the most common fees associated with residential development
                            in Oxnard by housing type. In the case of applications, special use permits, planned
                            development permits, variances, maps, zone boundary changes, or changes of
                            zone classification, fees are due at the time of application submittal. In the case of
                            most permits, they are flat fees, but they can require supplemental amounts if it is
                            determined that unusual conditions trigger special study and evaluation. These
                            amounts are based on cost estimates provided by the City and require deposit
                            before work begins so that they may be billed against the project as the special
                            study process moves forward.
                            Oxnard also charges impact fees, the most common of which are also listed in Table
                            E-5. Capital fees and exactions are designed to reimburse the costs of public
                            utilities and services provided in the City to serve that project. Exactions, such as
                            land easements for infrastructure, can be required on a case-by-case basis, but all
                            developments are required to pay their associated infrastructure related fees. Infill

Oxnard Housing Element
                                             developments are located in areas with established infrastructure with available
                                             capacity and generally have lower fees.

                                                                                                                           E. Constraints
                                            Residential projects are required to pay a Growth Requirement Capital Fee of $1.16
                                            for each square foot of covered space constructed. The City established this fee
                                            upon the determination that development within its boundaries creates a need for
                                            additional public facilities and capital improvements. This fee is not directly tied to a
                                            specific infrastructure project related to a given new development, (such as new
                                            street) and was consequently challenged in court in 1990. It was determined,
                                            however, that a reasonable nexus exists between the fees charged and the needs
                                            created by new development, as required by the California Mitigation Fee Act. This
                                            fee is about $1,000 per dwelling unit.
                                            Based on fees associated with a typical single-family and typical multifamily
                                            residential unit, typical fees of $34,989 for a single-family unit and $33,215 for a
                                            multifamily unit have been calculated using the costs in Table E-5. Table E-6
                                            illustrates the total fee and exaction costs of a typical new single-family house and
                                            a multifamily development relative to their total costs. School fees have also been
                                            added to the totals in Table E-6. Based on a survey of vacant land costs detailed in
                                            Table E-10 a land cost of $200,000 has been added to the typical cost of
                                            development of a new single-family unit (at roughly 10 units per acre, small lot
                                            subdivisions) and a land cost of $100,000 has been added to the typical cost of
                                            development for a new multi-family unit in Table E-6 (at roughly 20 units per acre).
                                            The proportion of total housing costs attributed to fees and exactions is estimated
                                            at 7.5% for new single-family units and 14.6% for new multifamily units. Multifamily
                                            developments generally have a higher Quimby Act fee unless the projects provide
                                            public park space. As the total fees are relatively the same, the proportion differs
                                            due to the higher total development cost per single-family unit. Tax-credit financing
                                            and other sources of affordable housing financing cover fees, so fees are not
                                            passed on to the buyer or renter in projects receiving that financing. If fees are a
                                            constraint on a particular project the City Council has the ability now to remove,
                                            lower, or delay fees on a case-by-case basis, and has done so in the past.

E.4           Processing and Permit Procedures
                                            Obtaining a development permit for a residential project in Oxnard is a fairly
                                            straightforward process, but it can become more complex based on several factors.
                                            These include the size and nature of the project, environmental review, the zoning
                                            district, and whether final approval is required from the Planning Manager,
                                            Development Services Director, the Planning Commission, or the City Council.

Oxnard Housing Element
                       New development projects in Oxnard require a pre-application review with the City
                       Council if they propose a General Plan Amendment or apply to accommodate their
                       provision of affordable housing through the payment of inclusionary affordable
                       housing in-lieu fees. General Plan Amendments are necessary each time the text
                       or Land Use Diagram in the Oxnard General Plan is amended, not to exceed four
                       times per year. The pre-application review is conducted by City staff. This process
                       consists of reviewing site plans, elevations, and other preliminary information to
                       gauge their consistency with City development standards and other requirements,
                       as well as to determine the project’s appropriateness based on the community and
                       land uses surrounding the proposed site. The purpose of the pre-application review
                       is to identify significant compatibility and feasibility issues before the applicant
                       invests significant time and expense in drafting more detailed plans and submitting
                       a formal application. Developers are also encouraged to discuss preliminary
                       building plans with City staff for the same reason.
                       The next step (or the first step in the case of projects that do not require pre-
                       application) is the formal application. This process is similar to the preceding one,
                       except that it requires a more complete and comprehensive package of materials.
                       The plans submitted to the City in this step must be prepared by design
                       professionals and vary depending on the type of development and permit required.
                       Some residential projects will require special use permits reviewed by the Planning
                       Commission.
                       Table E-7 summarizes the residential development types allowed in the various
                       districts in Oxnard that permit residential uses. This table also shows whether they
                       are permitted, require a Special Use Permit (SUP), or are not allowed in a given
                       district.

             needed updates are in coastal zoning districts where transitional and supportive housing are allowed per state law but are not listed in the list of uses allowed in the zoning districts. All
             updates to zoning in the Coastal Zone will be completed during the comprehensive Local Coastal Plan (LCP) update recently initiated by the City. Program 6 includes the LCP update.
         4. Allows Congregate Living Health Facilities of no more than 15 beds.
         5. Allowed over commercial or office uses.
         6. Allowed as an accessory use

                                                                                        E. Constraints
             Residential zones generally do not require a Special Use Permit for their permitted
             types of residential development. The exception to this condition is the Central
             Business District, which requires a SUP with every project due to the wide variety
             of land uses that can be accommodated and the desire to ensure their compatibility
             on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, prominence of the CBD as a symbol and
             central feature of the city generally warrants the architectural and design review of
             all new projects.
             The materials submitted with the formal application are distributed to the
             appropriate City staff for review as described below. Each reviewer uses pertinent
             project information to recommend design changes and/or conditions of approval.
             ▪    The Planning Division coordinates the permit process and applies land use
                  regulations. It also oversees the environmental review process.
             ▪    Building and Engineering Services evaluates the non-transportation
                  infrastructure surrounding development proposals and evaluates both the
                  capacity of existing water, sewage, and drainage systems. Capital
                  improvement and other fees are collected by this division.
             ▪    Traffic and Transportation evaluates the impact that a proposal has on
                  surrounding traffic and transit circulation, and assesses traffic impact fees
                  against which qualifying portions of the project’s traffic improvements may be
                  credited.
             ▪    The Planning Division reviews project plans to ensure compatibility with state
                  fire codes and analyzes the project’s impact on crime according to its use and
                  design characteristics.
             Developers are required to notify and then present their projects to the public so
             that interested citizens may provide input. This process is intended to confirm the
             public’s issues and any concerns early in the development review process.
             The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires an environmental review
             process as part of the local planning process. For most small projects and
             structures, such as an accessory dwelling unit, up to three single-family homes, or
             multifamily projects totaling four units or less, the project will be determined to be
             categorically exempt from the CEQA process. For larger or more complex projects,
             staff will prepare an initial study for the project and determine if the project may pose
             a significant impact on the environment. If staff or a consultant concludes that there
             will be a significant environmental impact that can be mitigated through revisions in
             the project, and the developer agrees to the revisions, a mitigated negative
             declaration (MND) is prepared. Otherwise, an environmental impact report (EIR)
             must be completed. The EIR is a comprehensive report that assesses possible
             environmental impacts of a proposed project and actions to reduce or avoid
             possible environmental damage. If a project requires an EIR, it incurs significant
             administrative cost and may incur substantial costs to minimize environmental
             impact. CEQA is a state-mandated process to protect the public from environmental
             harm and while it is possible for members of the public to use CEQA to oppose
             affordable housing projects by raising spurious issues, CEQA itself is not a
             constraint to affordable housing development.

                       DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
                       Larger and more complex projects such as subdivisions, condominiums,
                       apartments, or projects that require other planning permits (i.e., Special Use
                       Permits) usually require design review.
                       After the determination of what type of environmental review will be required, the
                       project is scheduled for a Development Advisory Committee (DAC) meeting. The
                       purpose of the DAC is to identify only technical issues such as architectural and
                       landscape design issues and corrections and to work with the developer to revise
                       their plans. The DAC meets weekly, and the processing time for this step is
                       completely applicant-driven and varies according to how quickly the applicant
                       submits complete plans and then responds to concerns and corrections. The DAC
                       comprises an architect; landscape architect; fire, police, traffic engineering, and
                       public works staff; and the project planner, and may include the US Postal Service
                       (USPS), Gold Coast Transit, and one or more local school district representatives.
                       Concepts reviewed include the projects adherence to generally accepted principals
                       of good architecture and design, development standards, functionality, public
                       safety, and how well the project fits the context of surrounding and/or proposed
                       development.
                       When a project has completed its DAC review, it is ready for conditions of approval.
                       These conditions become part of the final report and draft resolution submitted to
                       the Planning Manager or Planning Commission recommending approval, approval
                       with conditions, or denial of the project. Conditions are required by state law to bear
                       a reasonable relationship to the public need. Conditions include environmental
                       mitigation measures identified by the CEQA process. The recommendation
                       provided to the Planning Manager or Planning Commission in the draft resolution is
                       as conditioned, meaning that if the project is approved, conditions will be met as
                       part of the project. Applicants may request changes to conditions as part of their
                       approval hearing or on appeal.
                       At this point, the public is notified of the hearing, and a legal notice is published in
                       the newspaper, as required. Neighborhood council chairpersons are also notified,
                       but ideally they are already familiar with the development proposal if the
                       development team engaged them and local stakeholders in early discussions.
                       Planning Commission meetings are held bimonthly, and the resulting action may be
                       appealed to the City Council within 18 calendar days. In the case of certain permits,
                       the Planning Commission’s decision is advisory to the City Council, and the final
                       decision is made by the City Council. A certified copy of the decision is transmitted
                       to the applicant. Once the planning permit is approved, building plans are reviewed
                       and, when issued, the project may begin construction. A brief synopsis and typical
                       timelines of various permits and applications is included in Table E-8. Note that the
                       processing times identified are average times for small and medium-scale projects
                       that do not have complex entitlements, environmental review, and/or engineering.

                                                                                       E. Constraints
             The typical findings of approval for residential projects are:
                  ▪   Roof and building rain gutters and downspouts to integrate as closely as
                      possible with building design elements, including matching adjacent
                      building colors as closely as possible.
                  ▪   Utility meters, mailboxes, and address directories shall be placed in
                      decorative cabinets and clustered for efficient access for residents and
                      service persons.
                  ▪   Automatic garage doors openers shall be installed for all garages.
                  ▪   Railings and enclosures for patios and balconies shall provide at least 50
                      percent enclosure for screening and privacy.
                  ▪   Walls separating the patio areas of different units shall be of solid
                      construction, such as masonry, stucco, or wood over wood.
                  ▪   All residential dwelling unit developments shall include architectural
                      articulation on all four sides of each unit.
                  ▪   Light standards illuminating interior walkways shall be no more than 8 feet
                      high.
                  ▪   Each dwelling unit shall have separate utility systems and meters.
             With regard to parcels with the proposed AH additive zone, the Development
             Review process is staff approved and does not require review by the Planning
             Commission or City Council.
             These concepts reviewed identify only technical issues such as architectural and
             landscape design issues and do not constrain development of housing affordable
             to lower-income households. Rather, they ensure functionality, public safety, and
             neighborhood compatibility.
             ATTACHED DWELLING UNIT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
             The purpose and intent of the Attached Dwelling Unit Development Standards is to
             implement the goals and objectives of the general plan to provide quality multiple-
             family housing with adequate on-site amenities and privacy.
             These provisions apply to the development of any new attached multifamily
             residential project of six or more units. Projects of five units or less are subject only
             to the development standards of the zone in which such projects are located and
             such other provisions of the Zoning Code as may apply.
             Development Standards
                  ▪   Minimum dwelling size: One bedroom: 700 square feet; two or more
                      bedrooms: 900 square feet except the minimum unit size in the CBD is 450
                      square feet.
                  ▪   Building separation: Minimum building separation between any two
                      buildings shall be a distance equal of the height of the taller structure.

                            ▪   Recreation facilities: Multiple-family attached dwelling units of 12 units or
                                more shall provide common recreational facilities with interior yard space
                                areas to include, but not be limited to, one or more of the following:
                                     Swimming pools
                                     Spa
                                     Tennis and/or basketball or volleyball courts
                                     Barbecues and outdoor picnic facilities
                                     Recreation buildings
                                     Exercise courses and stations
                                     Children's play equipment
                                     Other equivalent facilities as approved
                            ▪   Open area: Projects having 12 or more units shall provide at least one lawn
                                area of not less than 2,500 square feet and having a minimum dimension
                                of not less than 35 feet.
                            ▪   Distance to garage from dwelling unit: The maximum distance to a garage
                                from any dwelling unit entry shall be 75 feet.
                            ▪   Balconies and patios: All second-story dwelling units shall have at least
                                one patio or balcony, having a minimum dimension of 10 feet.
                            ▪   Balcony enclosures: All balconies and patios shall have railings or walls
                                which provide at least 50 percent enclosure.
                            ▪   Storage areas: Each dwelling unit shall have a storage area of at least 225
                                cubic feet. The storage area may be included in the garage area but may
                                not intrude into the minimum garage dimensions.
                            ▪   Garages: All garages shall have automatic garage door openers. All
                                garage doors shall have architectural treatment or detail.
                            ▪   Utility meters: Wall-mounted utility meters shall be screened or integrated
                                into the building design.
                            ▪   Refuse enclosures: Refuse enclosures shall be designed to reflect the
                                major design elements or details of the residential units and shall provide
                                an access for persons separate from the refuse vehicle access.
                       Program 6 calls for changes to the City’s Zoning Code to address constraints
                       associated with minimum dwelling sizes and building separation requirements.
                       Development Design Review
                       Attached multifamily developments of six or more units which are proposed for a
                       property not located in a planned development zone, or which do not otherwise
                       require a special use permit, may be approved by issuance of a development design
                       review permit.
                       These standards are to ensure conformance with surrounding neighborhoods and
                       do not constrain development of housing affordable to lower-income households.

                                                                                                                         E. Constraints
                                           Recently proposed affordable and density bonus housing projects at 24 units per
                                           acre have raised considerable concern over fire safety and quality of life for children,
                                           as the applicants wanted to crowd buildings on parcels and minimize open space.
                                           The City cannot compromise public safety and quality of life for everyone in the
                                           development as a trade offs for adding a marginal number of additional units. It
                                           should be noted that the goal for sites with the AAHOP designation is that they are
                                           at least 1 acre in size partially to address the types of concerns discussed above.

                                           A breakdown of typical permits and processes needed for three different types of
                                           residential development in Oxnard is given in Table E-9. The total typical processing
                                           time for each type of project only provides the general time frame needed in the
                                           approval of residential development projects in the city.

E.5       Building Codes and On-/Off-Site Improvements
                           BUILDING CODES
                           In 2010, the State of California adopted its Green California Building Code, and
                           state law mandates that all local jurisdictions adhere to the statewide regulations.
                           However, the law allows jurisdictions to create their own amendments to the Green
                           Building Code, as long as they are more stringent than the statewide code, rather
                           than removing or relaxing its provisions. The City has not adopted any local
                           amendments to the state building code.
                           Oxnard has adopted the 2013 California Building Code and it took effect on January
                           1, 2014. The Green Building Code recognizes the need for increased structural
                           standards to reinforce buildings in order to withstand seismic events.
                           CODE COMPLIANCE
                           Code compliance is administered by the Police Department’s Code Compliance
                           Unit with nine officers and a manager responsible for code compliance. The unit
                           primarily responds to resident-generated complaints.
                           The Code Compliance Unit conducts on-site inspections in cases where it
                           determines that a code violation may have occurred. If the inspection determines
                           that a violation exists, a verbal warning or a correction notice/notice of violation is
                           issued, depending on the severity of the situation. The notice will specify the
                           violation found and will identify a time frame for the violation to be corrected.
                           The Code Compliance Unit maintains a database for tracking violations, which is
                           updated every time a new violation notice is issued. The database then schedules
                           a follow-up site visit for each violation entered into the system. The code inspector
                           re-inspects the site on that scheduled date to determine if the violation persists or if
                           it has been remedied satisfactorily. If the violation remains, a civil citation may be
                           issued.
                           In cases of substandard housing where violations exist that require major repairs or
                           demolition, the California Health and Safety Code requires that local jurisdictions
                           give preference to rehabilitation rather than demolition, if less than 75 percent of the
                           building needs to be repaired. Oxnard’s Community Development Department
                           provides standards in the code include thresholds for rehabilitation; however, there
                           are no requirements that mandate rehabilitation. Ultimately, such decisions are
                           subjectively made depending on the specific circumstances of the case.
                           To encourage the prevention of substandard housing, Oxnard provides
                           rehabilitation funds in both the Southwinds Redevelopment Project Area and the
                           Historic Enhancement and Revitalization of Oxnard (HERO) Project Area from
                           CDBG and remaining redevelopment bond proceeds. The RDA successor agency
                           has bond proceeds from a 2006 bond available for projects to be determined by
                           City Council and there have been and will be more public input opportunities
                           available in the future for how these funds should be used. This is the last of the
                           money available from Redevelopment (RDA).

                                                                                 E. Constraints
             The funds available for rehabilitation are in the form of low interest loans,
             administered by the Oxnard Housing Department. In addition to single-family
             houses, apartment units are eligible for these funds. There is also a citywide
             matching grant program of up to $10,000 for single-family and mobile homes
             operated with City funds.
             Finally, Oxnard also has a mobile home replacement program administered by the
             Oxnard Housing Department that provides $120,000 annually for replacement
             mobile homes. This figure generally equates to one to four new mobile homes. The
             older homes are dismantled to ensure they do not become reused elsewhere as
             substandard housing.
             ON-/OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
             Like any city in California, Oxnard maintains infrastructure and improvement
             standards that must be met in new developments to offset the costs of maintaining
             public infrastructure serving private developments. These standards also ensure
             that traffic circulation; water, drainage, sewer, and other infrastructure do not
             become strained or overwhelmed by new growth.
             The required improvements for subdivisions of five or more lots mandate water lines
             to each parcel; sanitary sewer lines to each lot with necessary pumping stations;
             adequate drainage work; grading and surfacing for all streets, highways, and alleys;
             sidewalks, curbs, gutters, and bridges; street signs; and monuments for surveying
             purposes.
             During the subdivision process, the following standards must be observed with
             respect to property division:
                  ▪    Blocks should be between 400 feet and 1,200 feet in length
                  ▪    Pedestrian ways and drainage outlets may be required in blocks
                  ▪    Minimum lot sizes are 6,000 square feet.
             Standards govern the minimum number and type of utility connections that must be
             made as part of each new development. In general, Oxnard has the following
             requirements with regard to connections:
             The number of connection permits required in a development is based on the
             number of water service meters and sewer service connections. Generally one
             sewer connection is needed for each detached building, but a multifamily
             condominium may have multiple sewer connections depending on the building’s
             design. Because each permit has associated fees, the configuration of housing can
             have an impact on the development cost.
             Every project undergoing the permitting process must submit a plumbing and
             irrigation plan prepared by a registered engineer or project architect showing
             proposed line sizes and connections. This information is necessary for the City to
             charge the appropriate connection fees since its permit fees are based on a tiered
             system according to the diameter of piping needed for adequate service.
October 2017                                                                          Page E-27

Oxnard Housing Element
                       Sewer connections and extensions made to connect a private property to the
                       system automatically become dedicated to the City along with the necessary
                       easements. This type of exaction is quite standard across municipalities and does
                       not necessarily increase the cost of housing development.
                       When developing residential site and subdivision plans, Oxnard has standards for
                       street widths specific to the type of street proposed. They are generally consistent
                       with standards across the state.
                             ▪    Secondary and Primary typical arterial streets are 96 or 120 right of way.
                             ▪    Local street right are 56 feet wide right of way.
                             ▪    Dead-end streets such as cul-de-sacs have turnarounds with a radius of at
                                  least 50 feet.
                             ▪    Curved streets have a center line radius of at least 300 feet, and the center
                                  line radius for arterial and collector streets is determined by the Streets
                                  Director.
                             ▪    Street corners have radii of at least 25 feet if both streets are 60 feet wide.
                                  In the case of wider streets, radii are at least 35 feet wide.
                             ▪    Intersections are at approximately right angles.
                             ▪    Alleys are a minimum 20 feet wide, but are not required in R-1 zones. They
                                  may be required in a subdivision, if the Planning Commission recommends
                                  it to City Council, and the Council agrees. Many newer medium-density
                                  projects have internal driveways that are more than alleys but not quite
                                  streets. The City will consider various approaches to provide a well-
                                  designed internal circulation system.
                       The street standards established are reasonable and do not exceed what is needed
                       to maintain the health and safety standards of the community.
                       The approval of each residential development producing net additional vehicle trips
                       requires the payment of fees based on the plan. By California state law, there must
                       be a reasonable nexus between the fees charged and the cost of constructing the
                       traffic circulation facilities and infrastructure or portion thereof that is attributable to
                       the impact of the development project. Because of the nexus requirements imposed
                       by California, these costs can be assumed to be within the requirements of
                       maintaining the health and safety of the community and do not unnecessarily add
                       to development costs that constrain the provision of housing.
                       State law increasingly requires cities to reduce landscape water usage, which in
                       turn requires developments to use low-water and drought-tolerant materials
                       irrigated with high-efficiency irrigation systems. In order to implement state law,
                       landscape plans are required for all developments that include areas of lawns,
                       trees, planter boxes, garden beds, shrubs, irrigation, and other hardscape
                       amenities. Other features such as ponds, fountains, decks, and courtyards are
                       considered landscaping. In the case of residential planned developments,
                       landscaping is required around the perimeter of the project and in all common open
                       areas.

                                                                                                      E. Constraints
                             In all, these improvement standards are costs in the provision of housing, but the
                             standards do not exceed what would reasonably be expected to maintain and
                             provide for the health and safety of the public and implement various state laws.
                             Therefore, they are not considered unnecessary constraints in the provision of
                             affordable housing.
E.6        Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
                             PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES (SB 520)
                             California law requires an analysis of potential constraints to the development,
                             maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities. California
                             Government Code Section 65008 requires that cities and counties analyze the
                             potential and actual constraints on housing for persons with disabilities,
                             demonstrate efforts to remove any existing or potential governmental constraints,
                             and include programs in their housing elements to accommodate housing designed
                             for persons with disabilities. This analysis evaluates the City’s Zoning Code,
                             permitting procedures, development standards, and building code to determine
                             whether they would result in any possible barriers to either construction of housing
                             or retrofitting of existing housing to accommodate the special needs of disabled
                             persons.
                             Zoning and Land-Use Policies
                             The Oxnard Zoning Code is conscious of fair housing law and the housing needs
                             of the disabled. It contains provisions designed to accommodate the provision of
                             housing for residents with physical and/or mental challenges.
                             All non-Coastal Zone residential land use districts allow congregate living health
                             facilities serving six or fewer adults by right, including the MH-PD zone. Additionally,
                             congregate care facilities serving six or fewer adults are allowable by right in all
                             Coastal Zone districts that allow residential uses (R-B-1, R-W-1, R-W-2, R-2-C,
                             R-3-C, and MHP-C).
                             Congregate living facilities are defined in Oxnard’s Zoning Code as “State-licensed
                             residential homes with a non-institutional home-like environment that provides 24-
                             hour medical supervision and skilled nursing with services for persons who are
                             physically disabled...or are catastrophically and severely disabled...” Therefore,
                             provisions for these facilities in the code further the goals of Executive Order 13217,
                             which encourages community-based alternatives for individuals with disabilities.
                             Similar facilities, with up to 15 beds, are allowed under a Special Use Permit. Also
                             allowed in these zones are small residential health or care facilities, which are
                             defined as facilities that provide nonmedical health or care services to six or fewer
                             persons in a variety of capacities, including as a facility for the developmentally
                             disabled.
                             The R-3 (Garden Apartment) zone and the R-4 (High Rise Residential) zone permit
                             the same uses as the R-1, R-2, and MH-PD zones, but they also allow adult day
                             care facilities and congregate living facilities of more than 15 beds, with a Special
                             Use Permit.

Oxnard Housing Element
                       The C-2 (General Commercial) zone allows community care facilities for six or fewer
                       people. Such facilities are defined as providing nonmedical care for the physically
                       handicapped and mentally impaired. Congregate living health facilities serving
                       greater than 15 beds are allowable with a Special Use Permit in the C-2 zone.
                       The Oxnard Zoning Code does not explicitly limit congregate living facilities,
                       community care facilities, and small residential health or care facilities to only
                       disabled persons. It specifically lists them as included users of such housing. The
                       code also does not limit users of such housing to families. However, it equates
                       family with household, per state law. The Oxnard Zoning Code does not provide
                       explicit alternative residential parking requirements such as reductions in the
                       number of spaces for persons with disabilities. However, special types of living
                       arrangements such as those discussed above are not listed in the off-street parking
                       requirements table, in which case they can be determined by the appropriate
                       approval body on the basis of similar uses and parking studies. Having to provide
                       a parking study to justify reduced parking for atypical households and housing is a
                       cost that could be eliminated by an update to the Zoning Code.
                       The City’s Zoning Code defines family as “a group of residents whose members
                       jointly occupy a dwelling unit as a single housekeeping unit; have joint use of and
                       responsibility for common areas; share household activities such as meals, chores,
                       maintenance and expenses; but not including residents of commercial group living
                       such as hotels, dormitories and fraternities.” This definition is consistent with state
                       law.
                       BUILDING CODE
                       The City Building and Engineering Services division currently implements all of the
                       provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as a part of its required
                       review of building plans and building inspections. Building procedures are required
                       to conform to the California Building Code, as adopted in the City’s Municipal Code.
                       Standards in the code include provisions to ensure accessibility for persons with
                       disabilities. These standards are consistent with the ADA. The City also enforces
                       the provisions of the Fair Housing Act to ensure that disabled persons have fair
                       access to housing. The City has no requirements for distance between units that
                       would apply to housing for persons with disabilities.
                       Oxnard’s code is based on the California Green Building Code, which is periodically
                       updated by the State. Oxnard is up to date with the universal design elements that
                       assist persons who are disabled. Oxnard’s amendments to the statewide building
                       code do not add any notable provisions or design elements that are focused on
                       disabled access or amenities, but any such standards that apply across the state
                       are also applicable to Oxnard.
                       PERMIT PROCEDURE
                       In compliance with the California Health and Safety Code, the City of Oxnard
                       permits residential care facilities for the elderly by right. No Special Use Permit is
                       required for these types of licensed facilities in single-family zones as long as they
                       are designed to serve no more than six persons. Similarly, congregate living health
                       facilities are allowed in residential zones by right, which ensures that the City
Page E-30                                                                                       October 2017

                                                                                        E. Constraints
             provides the ability to consider these smaller types of dwellings for the elderly and
             disabled in its Municipal Code.
             Larger congregate living health facilities of 7 to 15 beds require a Special Use
             Permit in the R-1, R-B-1, R-W-2, R-2-C, R-3-C, and MHO-C zones, in addition to
             the C-2 and CBD zones. For congregate living health facilities of more than 15 beds,
             the R-2, R-3, and R-4 zones require a Special Use Permit. The R-1 zone only allows
             small residential care facilities, but the R-2 zone allows mid-size facilities up to 15
             beds with a Special Use Permit.
             Requirements for obtaining a Special Use Permit are detailed in Oxnard’s Zoning
             Code. The development of larger congregate living health facilities and mid-size
             residential care facilities require that the Planning Commission analyze various
             aspects of the proposed site and adjacent uses and make the following findings:
                   ▪    The nature, condition, and development of existing and approved
                        surrounding uses and buildings are not adversely affected, nor is the
                        proposed use materially detrimental to the public health, safety, or general
                        welfare.
                   ▪    The site must be adequate in size and shape to satisfy other provisions in
                        the Zoning Code, such as accommodating setbacks, parking, walls,
                        fences, drainage, landscaping, etc.
                   ▪    Roadway infrastructure serving the site must be adequate for the
                        anticipated traffic that the site would generate.
                   ▪    Other infrastructure serving the site such as stormwater, sewer, water, and
                        fire protection must be adequate for the proposed use.
             Because of the flexibility that the Planning Commission has with regard to assigning
             conditions to the granting of a Special Use Permit, the permitting procedure
             associated with larger congregate living facilities and mid-size residential care
             facilities has the potential to affect development costs to some extent. However, the
             ability to provide smaller facilities by right assists in mitigating this uncertainty, and
             offsets any constraints that Special Use Permits may present to the provision of
             housing for disabled persons.
             REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURE
             Recognizing that existing and future residents with disabilities may need extra tools
             and provisions to achieve housing equality, fair housing law in California provides
             local governments with an affirmative duty to make reasonable accommodations in
             their land use, zoning, and development standard requirements. Developers in
             California may request relaxation or flexibility in certain requirements when
             providing housing for the disabled in cases where such requests further equal
             opportunity in housing.
             However, fair housing law does not require explicit channels or mechanisms for
             accomplishing reasonable accommodation requirements. As a consequence, many
             local governments simply rely on Conditional Use Permit or Variance processes
October 2017                                                                                Page E-31

Oxnard Housing Element
                       when considering whether such requests should be granted to developers
                       proposing housing projects for the disabled.
                       The City of Oxnard has adopted a specific reasonable accommodation procedure
                       in its Municipal Code that allows changes to development standards. As a result,
                       the Special Use Permit or another permit is needed to obtain changes to zoning
                       and development standards, if needed.
                       The majority of reasonable accommodation requests in Oxnard are administered
                       through the Special Use Permit or similar permitting process. Modifications to
                       zoning requirements are usually accommodated. Oxnard adopted a Reasonable
                       Accommodation Ordinance on September 2011, which outlines a procedure for
                       persons with disabilities to request accommodations through a low-cost ministerial
                       procedure.
                       FARMWORKER HOUSING
                       Farmworkers are present year-round in Ventura County to support local agricultural
                       industries. As described in Section C, Special Needs, based on 2012 Census of
                       Agriculture data and other reports, approximately 18,103 farmworkers are
                       estimated to live in Oxnard.
                       Farmworker housing is allowable by right in the R-1, R-2, and MH-PD zones. In the
                       C-2 zone, farmworker housing is allowable with a Special Use Permit. Farmworker
                       housing is defined by the Oxnard Municipal Code as “deed-restricted housing for
                       agricultural workers that is available to and occupied only by low- and very low-
                       income farmworker households, and that is subject to standards that apply to other
                       residential dwellings of the same type and in the same zone.”
                       The City actively supports the development of farmworker housing, as identified in
                       Program 9. Program 9 also proposes to amend the Zoning Code to allow
                       Farmworker Housing in additional zones to comply with the state Employee
                       Housing Act (Health and Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6). Ordinance
                       2864 allows farmworker housing in R-1 to R-4 and by special use permit in
                       commercial zones.
                       OTHER SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING
                       The Oxnard Municipal Code addresses other types of special needs housing,
                       including adult day care facilities, adult health care centers, community care
                       facilities, emergency shelters, residential care facilities for the elderly, and
                       transitional housing, as required by the California Department of Housing and
                       Community Development (HCD).
                       Emergency shelters are allowable by Special Use Permit in the R-2, R-3, R-4, and
                       C-2 zones. Emergency shelters are allowed by right on over 440 acres zoned either
                       M-L or M-L-PD. There are 16 vacant parcels in the M-L and M-L-PD zoning districts
                       that total 32.49 acres. The parcel sizes in the M-L and M-L-PD zones vary and a
                       significant percent of the vacant parcels in the M-L and M-L-PD zoning districts are
                       in close proximity to transit and services making them suitable locations for
                       emergency shelters. Transitional housing is allowed by right in the R-3 and R-4
Page E-32                                                                                   October 2017

                                                                                                                     E. Constraints
                                              zoning districts. Supportive housing is allowable by right in the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4,
                                              and MH-PD zoning districts. Program 14 has been partially implemented and will
                                              be modified and continued to amend the Zoning Code to allow transitional and
                                              supportive housing in all zones that allow residential development. Figure E-1 maps
                                              the vacant and underutilized (non-vacant) M-L and M-L-PD parcels in the city.
E.7           Non-Governmental Constraints
                                              Non-governmental constraints are generally market-driven, originating from such
                                              factors as land costs, costs of development, supply and demand, and financing
                                              options and availability. While these constraints are outside of direct governmental
                                              control, they can be mitigated and influenced through various programs and
                                              policies, the most notable of which impact the availability of financing.
                                              LAND COSTS
                                              The cost of raw, developable land creates a direct impact on the cost for a new
                                              home and is considered a possible constraint. A higher cost of land raises the price
                                              of a new home. Therefore, developers sometimes seek to obtain approvals for the
                                              largest number of lots allowable on a parcel of land. Based on a survey of land for
                                              sale on Trulia.com, the cost of vacant residential land in Oxnard in October 2014
                                              ranged from $330,880 per acre to nearly $25 million per acre, with the highest costs
                                              for coastal properties. Some parcels include utility services and roads while others
                                              would need to develop this type of infrastructure in order to support residential
                                              development. The average cost for all surveyed properties, coastal and non-
                                              coastal, was $1,860,200 per acre. In comparison, the total sale cost of non-coastal
                                              residential lots less than an acre in size ranged from $215,000 to $600,000. Vacant
                                              land costs are provided in Table E-10.

                                           CONSTRUCTION COSTS
                                           Factors that affect the cost of building a house include the type of construction,
                                           materials, site conditions, finishing details, amenities, and structural configuration.
                                           An Internet source of construction cost data (www.building-cost.net), provided by
                                           the Craftsman Book Company, estimates the cost of a single-story four-cornered
                                           home in Ventura County in 2014 to be approximately $144 per square foot,
                                           excluding the costs of land. The total construction cost is estimated at $216,609 for
                                           average quality construction of a 1,500-square-foot home with four exterior walls,
                                           an attached garage, central heating and air, and average building materials. Table
                                           E-11 and Table E-12 show construction costs for single-family and multifamily
                                           construction, respectively, and reflect costs incurred in actually constructing a
                                           dwelling unit. As with other land development costs, construction costs vary.
                                           Important determinants of construction costs include the amenities built into the unit,
                                           materials used, the prevailing labor rate, and the difficulty of building on the site.

                                           FINANCING AVAILABILITY
                                           The availability of financing affects the market for housing and in turn, development
                                           and affordability. Fluctuating interest rates can eliminate many potential
                                           homebuyers from the housing market or render a housing project that could have
                                           been developed at lower interest rates infeasible. When interest rates decline, sales
                                           increase. The reverse is true when interest rates increase. Over the past decade,
                                           there was dramatic growth in alternative mortgage products, including graduated
                                           mortgages and variable rate mortgages. These types of loans allow homeowners
                                           to take advantage of lower initial interest rates and to qualify for larger home loans.
                                           However, variable rate mortgages are not ideal for low- and moderate-income
                                           households that live on tight budgets. In addition, the availability of variable rate
                                           mortgages has declined in the last few years due to greater regulation of housing
                                           lending markets. Variable rate mortgages may allow lower-income households to
                                           enter into homeownership, but there is a definite risk of monthly housing costs rising

                                             above the financial means of that household. Therefore, the fixed interest rate
                                             mortgage remains the preferred type of loan, especially during periods of low, stable
                                             interest rates.
                                             Table E-13 illustrates interest rates as of November 2014. The table presents both
                                             the interest rate and the annual percentage rate (APR) for different types of home
                                             loans. The interest rate is the percentage of an amount of money which is paid for
                                             its use for a specified time, and the APR is the yearly percentage rate that expresses
                                             the total finance charge on a loan over its entire term. The APR includes the interest
                                             rate, fees, points, and mortgage insurance and is therefore a more complete
                                             measure of a loan's cost than the interest rate alone. However, the loan's interest
                                             rate, not its APR, is used to calculate the monthly principal and interest payment.

                                             A report titled Ventura County: Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice (AI)
                                             published in May 2010 by the County of Ventura analyzes the impediments to
                                             financing in the county. A few items of note:
                                                  ▪    Approval rates are higher for upper-income applicants for mortgages than
                                                       lower-income applicants. Making financing more accessible to lower-
                                                       income groups remains an ongoing housing affordability issue. The report
                                                       found that the cities of Ojai, Oxnard, and Fillmore had among the lowest
                                                       approval ratings in the county, with approval rates ranging from 59 to 60
                                                       percent. Oxnard was also one of three cities with the highest rates of
                                                       application denial.
                                                  ▪    The racial and ethnic characteristics of applicants for home loans is not
                                                       directly reflective of the demographics of the county, with non-Hispanic
                                                       whites overrepresented at 64 percent of the applicant pool, compared to
                                                       the 57 percent of non-Hispanic whites that comprise the Ventura County
                                                       population.
                                                  ▪    Lack of understanding about the homebuying process was also identified
                                                       as another barrier to securing a home loan. Countywide, approximately 11
                                                       percent of applications were withdrawn or deemed incomplete in 2008.
                                                       Oxnard was one of several cities exhibiting a pattern of high application
                                                       withdrawal and closure rate, coupled with low loan approval ratings. Of all
                                                       home loan applications in Oxnard in 2008, approximately 17 percent
                                                       resulted in home purchase.
                                             The County is currently preparing a new AI, which will address current conditions

                           States brought increased awareness to the issues surrounding predatory lending.
                           However, support from nonprofit and government-sponsored programs is needed
                           to increase awareness of fair housing law and provide support for victims. The
                           Housing Rights Center currently provides services to Ventura County, including the
                           jurisdiction of Oxnard, in the form of education and advocacy. The center provides
                           investigations into complaints, landlord/tenant counseling, Fair Housing
                           Certification training for property managers, multilingual outreach for the public,
                           literature, and legal services. To minimize barriers and constraints to housing,
                           Oxnard and the Housing Rights Center should continue to promote their services
                           to the public at large.
E.8        Other Local Regulations
                           SOAR (SAVE OPEN SPACE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES)
                           Beginning in 1995, residents in Ventura County began enacting initiatives that
                           generally require voter approval for expansive outward growth with the goal of
                           preserving agricultural and open space resources. Oxnard adopted its SOAR
                           Initiative on November 3, 1998. This initiative created the City Urban Restriction
                           Boundary (CURB) around the city, preventing it from developing outside the line
                           without the approval of the voters until December 31, 2050. SOAR was extended
                           to 2050 by Oxnard voters in the November 2016 election. Several large
                           undeveloped areas were left within the Oxnard CURB that either have developed
                           or are likely to develop in the near future. Once these within-CURB areas are
                           developed, additional development would have to be largely redevelopment within
                           the CURB or by amending and expanding the CURB with voter approval. As a result
                           of this initiative, the City is limited in its response to demands for additional
                           development. Traditional accommodation techniques, such as outward expansion
                           of the city, are limited.
                           One notable exemption to development outside the SOAR boundary relates to the
                           provision of affordable housing. Areas outside the current CURB can be annexed
                           into the City of Oxnard using the Oxnard SOAR ordinance exemption that allows
                           annexation, under certain criteria and findings, of up to 20 acres annually for
                           affordable housing projects needed to meet the requirements of the RHNA for the
                           City.
                           SOAR preserves the employment opportunities for a large portion of the people
                           needing affordable housing. The SOAR affordable housing exemption has not been

                           LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM (LCP)
                           In accordance with state legislation, Oxnard has an adopted a Local Coastal
                           Program consisting of a Coastal Land Use Plan and a Coastal Zoning Ordinance.
                           A comprehensive LCP update is scheduled for City adoption in the next few years.
                           The boundary of the Oxnard Coastal Zone generally extends 1,000 yards inland
                           from the coast within the city limits. In Oxnard, the “coast” is measured from mean
                           sea level from the Pacific Ocean and Channel Islands Harbor and from the channel

                       edge along the Edison Canal and the channels associated with the inland waterway
                       development (see Figure E-2 for location).
                       The city’s Coastal Zone is divided into four areas: McGrath-Mandalay, Oxnard
                       Shores, Channel Islands, and Ormond Beach. In general, recreational uses are
                       predominant in the McGrath-Mandalay area, with adjacent residential uses
                       concentrated in the Oxnard Shores area. The Channel Islands area includes
                       Channel Islands Harbor and provides a variety of uses including residential,
                       recreation, visitor-serving commercial, and harbor-related industry. Separated from
                       the northern portion of the Oxnard Coastal Zone by Port Hueneme, Ormond Beach
                       to the south is a mixture of industrial, energy production facilities, wetlands, and
                       other sensitive natural habitats.
                       Building permit authority in the Oxnard Coastal Zone resides with the City of
                       Oxnard. However, local decisions on the following types of development can be
                       appealed to the California Coastal Commission:
                            ▪   Developments approved by the local government between the sea and the
                                first public road paralleling the sea or within 300 feet of the inland extent of
                                any beach or of the mean high tide line of the sea where there is no beach,
                                whichever is the greater distance.
                            ▪   Developments located on tidelands, submerged lands, public trust lands
                                within 100 feet of any wetland, estuary, stream or within 300 feet of the top
                                of the seaward face of any coastal bluff.
                            ▪   Any development which constitutes a major public works project or major

                                    Achieving the RHNA Allocation
                                                                                             F
F.1        Introduction
                        The purpose of this section is to comply with the requirements of California
                        Government Code Section 65583(b) by establishing the maximum number of
                        housing units that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved within the
                        2014–2021 RHNA cycle.
                        To ensure that Oxnard has enough opportunity sites suitable for residential
                        development and to meet the remaining RHNA affordable allocation of 2,497 (Table
                        D-4) lower income and moderate units and 53 (Table D-4) above moderate income
                        units, the City is relying on the following:
                             ▪    Continued use of 24/units per acre default density established by the
                                  record of developed affordable housing projects listed in Supplement 1,
                             ▪    The All Affordable Housing Opportunity Program (AAHOP) and Affordable
                                  Housing (AH) additive zone (see Supplement 2) with an inventory of 2,067
                                  units on 38 AAHOP sites,
                             ▪    66 Vacant and Underutilized Sites (see Supplement 2), and
                             ▪    The Teal Club Specific Plan.
                        Supplement 1 and Supplement 2 are incorporated by reference and provide
                        required parcel-specific information.
                        Goals and programs that achieve the 2013–2021 RHNA allocation are presented
                        in Chapter G.

Oxnard Housing Element
                       This section also provides information that:
                             ▪  Estimates the number of low- and moderate-income units converted,
                                demolished, and/or replaced in the Oxnard Coastal Zone and/or within 3
                                miles of the Coastal Zone, and
                             ▪  Documents the public outreach that occurred during the preparation of this
                                Housing Element.
                       As stated in Chapter D, the total 2014–2021 RHNA allocation of 7,301 housing units
                       for Oxnard was intended to accommodate current and projected growth housing
                       need based on population and economic analyses and projections.
                       Before presenting the approach to achieving the remaining RHNA allocation, the
                       City summarizes its Inclusionary Housing Program that continues to provide
                       significant numbers of affordable housing units. However, per the April 24, 2009,
                       comment letter from the California Department of Housing and Community
                       Development (HCD), inclusionary units may not be counted toward achieving the
                       RHNA allocation unless they are secured by a development agreement or condition
                       of approval.
                       OXNARD INCLUSIONARY HOUSING PROGRAM
                       The City of Oxnard has adopted several ordinances that establish inclusionary
                       affordable housing requirements for new developments. Relevant ordinances are
                       City Council Ordinances 2721 and 2615 and Community Development Commission
                       Ordinance 111. In this Housing Element, these are referred to collectively as the
                       Inclusionary Housing Program and summarized below.
                             ▪  All residential projects not within a redevelopment project area with 10 or
                                more units are subject to a 10 percent inclusionary requirement. In a
                                redevelopment project area, the inclusionary requirement is 15 percent
                                (consistent with state redevelopment law) where not less than 40 percent
                                of these units will be sold or rented at costs affordable to persons or
                                families with income in the very low-income category and the remainder
                                (60 percent) may be in low- or moderate-income categories.
                       Alternatives
                             ▪  The Inclusionary Housing Program provides for in-lieu fee payments that
                                can replace the on-site units within a development subject to approval by
                                either the City Council or Community Development Commission for
                                projects in a redevelopment area. In-lieu fees for projects not within a
                                redevelopment project area are:
                                For-Sale Units: If the in-lieu request is granted, the developer is required
                                to make a minimum payment of $5,000 for each unit with an additional
                                $500 based on increments of $50,000.
                                Rental Units: A payment of $4,590 is required for each rental unit. This
                                amount is adjusted annually.
                       In-lieu payment is made when the developer applies for a building permit for that
                       unit. The City Council generally prefers on-site affordable housing as opposed to
Page F-2                                                                                      October 2017

                                                                                F. Achieving the RHNA Allocation
                            payment of in-lieu fees. A project that is approved for in-lieu payments has usually
                            agreed to another public benefit through a Development Agreement that justifies
                            the in-lieu payment. The in-lieu fees are almost always leveraged with other funding
                            sources for affordable housing projects. Over $12,000,000 has been accrued in the
                            in-lieu fee fund since 2000.
                            Incentives
                            Possible incentives may include, but are not limited to, the following:
                                  ▪   Assistance with accessing and applying for funding (based on availability
                                      of federal, state, local foundations, and private funds)
                                  ▪   Mortgage-subsidy or down payment assistance programs to assist first-
                                      time homebuyers and other qualifying households, when such funds are
                                      available
                                  ▪   Expedited/streamlined application processing and development review
                                  ▪   Modification of development requirements, such as reduced setbacks and
                                      parking standards on a case-by-case basis
                                  ▪   Density bonus
                            The City anticipates significant numbers of inclusionary affordable housing to be
                            developed within several proposed specific plans (Northeast Community Specific
                            Plan Phase III “Maulhardt Parcel” and Teal Club Specific Plan) and other new
                            projects.
                            The Inclusionary Housing Program is included in Chapter G, Goals and Policies,
                            under Goal G-3 (Expanded and protected housing opportunities for lower-income
                            households and special needs groups), Policy 3.4 (Continue the Inclusionary
                            Housing Program that requires new housing developments to reserve a portion of
                            units for lower-income households or payment of in-lieu fees, and continue to prefer
                            development of on-site affordable units over the in-lieu housing fee), and Program
                            10 (Inclusionary Housing Program).
                            Based on a thorough review, the City does not believe that the current inclusionary
                            housing program is a constraint to the development of housing in addition to the
                            incentives and concessions currently being offered and conversations with local
                            developers who have be able to work within the requirement of the inclusionary
                            housing program and produce housing. To further ensure the program does not
                            pose a constraint, the City has included Program 10 to monitor this program.
F.2        The All-Affordable Housing Opportunity Program (AAHOP) and Additive
           Zone (-AH)
                            To provide realistic and certain opportunity for developers and the nonprofit sector
                            to develop the remaining RHNA allocation of 2,520 lower income and moderate
                            units by October 2021, the City will continue the All-Affordable Housing Opportunity
                            Program (AAHOP) and as its main implementation tool, the Affordable Housing
                            (“-AH”) additive zone designation.
October 2017                                                                                           Page F-3

Oxnard Housing Element
                       The 2006–2014 Housing Element, adopted in 2012, created the AAHOP program
                       with 15 provisions that acted as a temporary implementation code. In 2013, the
                       City adopted uncodified Ordinance 2870, the “AAHOP Ordinance,” amended the
                       15 provisions to 18 provisions, and adopted Ordinance 2689 that designated 36
                       AAHOP sites to which the “-AH” additive was applied to their respective zoning
                       designations. In 2016, the AAHOP ordinance was codified into the Municipal Code,
                       Chapter 16 “Zoning” and the implementing provisions were removed from the
                       Housing Element.
                       The following are statements intended to augment the application of Municipal
                       Code, Chapter 16, Division 7C, Section 16-420 et al.
                       1) Relationship to State Density Bonus
                       AAHOP is a City incentive that is separate, and in addition to, the State Density
                       Bonus authorized by Division 7A (commencing with section 16-410A). AAHOP
                       projects are intended to create a quality of life and appear substantially similar to
                       market rate developments of a similar size and architectural style.
                       2) Inventory Maintained for Extremely Low, Very Low, and Low Income
                       The City will maintain a “rolling inventory” of AAHOP-designated parcels through
                       the zoning additive designation “-AH.” The focus of the rolling inventory is for
                       extremely low, very low, and low income housing need established by the RHNA
                       process for the RHNA planning period. If the total AAHOP potential for extremely
                       low, very low, and low income housing units falls below the remaining extremely
                       low, very low, and low income need, the City will identify additional AAHOP sites
                       within the following year unless, during the subsequent year, the inventory of
                       extremely low, very low, and low income housing units exceeds the remaining
                       RHNA need. The Planning Manager shall maintain the AAHOP inventory.
                       3) AAHOP Designation Deemed Consistent with the General Plan
                       The AAHOP-established density and residential use is considered a non-
                       discretionary allowed use. In situations where the AAHOP site-specific residential
                       and density designation is not consistent with the underlying zoning and/or General
                       Plan land use designation, the AAHOP designation supersedes the underlying
                       zoning and/or General Plan land use designation and is deemed consistent with
                       the General Plan only for AAHOP permitting purposes. The City shall subsequently
                       change the underlying zoning and/or General Plan land use designation at its own
                       expense.
                       4) Moderate Income Units
                       While the greatest overall housing need is for extremely low, very low, and low
                       income housing, the optional inclusion of up to 25 percent moderate income
                       housing is intended to improve the financial feasibility of projects, encourage a
                       greater mix of household types, and discourage an overconcentration of any one
                       type of housing.
                       5) Codes and Standards
                       AAHOP projects are held to the same building codes, landscape requirements,
                       and exterior architectural standards as comparable and contemporaneous market-
                       rate developments.

                                                                            F. Achieving the RHNA Allocation
                       6) California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
                       The AAHOP DDR permit is not defined as ministerial within the meaning of CEQA
                       and Public Resource Code 21080(b)(1): the all-affordable residential use and
                       density of each AAHOP site is allowed by right. AAHOP projects not otherwise
                       exempt from CEQA shall comply with an appropriate CEQA review process. The
                       DDR review process applies a series of fixed standards and objective
                       measurements and does not intend to involve the use of personal or subjective
                       judgments in deciding whether or how the project should be carried out. However,
                       in a manner similar to allowed uses in the City’s industrial zones, there are implied
                       and explicit quality of life, public safety, and environmental performance standards
                       that may require interpretive judgement by professionals intended to ensure that
                       an AAHOP project is similar to comparable and contemporaneous market-rate
                       developments.
                       7) Community Meetings
                       An AAHOP project without a concurrent discretionary permit would not require a
                       Planning Commission hearing. Three community meetings are required so that the
                       AAHOP applicant may first present a concept design. Based on comments on the
                       concept, the AAHOP applicant prepares and files a formal DDR application and
                       has a second community meeting on the DDR project. After completing the City’s
                       DDR review process, the AAHOP applicant would present what should be a final
                       project at a third community meeting. The AAHOP applicant, working with City
                       staff, should make a good faith effort to contact the community through existing
                       neighborhood councils, the Inter-Neighborhood Community Organization, and the
                       City’s Community Workshop process.
                       Although the City does not see AAHOP acting as a constraint to meeting the City’s
                       RHNA, the City has included Program 26 to monitor the effectiveness of the -AH
                       additive zone and revise requirements as necessary.
F.3        AAHOP Sites
                       To determine areas that are suitable for the AH additive zoning, staff completed a
                       survey of potentially available sites generally of 1-acre size or larger throughout the
                       city using aerial photographs, site visits, and recommendations from City officials
                       and affordable housing providers and advocates.
                       These sites were evaluated for their potential compatibility with adjacent land uses
                       and the availability of public services and found to either be suitable or have the
                       potential to be suitable with careful design that provides buffers and transitions to
                       adjoining neighborhoods. Included in the site suitability analysis was a review of
                       both vacant parcels and underutilized parcels that have the potential for
                       redevelopment. These areas included commercial and industrial properties with
                       vacant buildings and a mix of built and vacant land.
October 2017                                                                                         Page F-5

Oxnard Housing Element
                          AAHOP sites are divided into four categories as follows:
                               ▪    Vacant. Land that is undeveloped (no structures) or is in agricultural use
                                    (but within the land area assumed developed by the 2030 General Plan
                                    and certified environmental impact report). These sites are largely ready to
                                    develop with minimal site preparation.
                               ▪    Largely Vacant. Minor structures and/or paving to be demolished, and
                                    homes and small business to be relocated.
                               ▪    Large Vacant Structure. Possibility of commercial and/or market-rate
                                    housing mixed use due to location opportunity and/or need to create
                                    financial feasibility to remove a large vacant commercial structure.
                               ▪    Constrained Sites. Sites with unique environmental or urban infill
                                    situations. These sites have challenges associated with their development,
                                    and their potential development was reduced accordingly, but none were
                                    considered significant enough to eliminate these sites as potential areas to
                                    provide affordable housing.
                          Program 3 proposes to designate additional AAHOP sites to meet a portion of the
                          lower-income RHNA and to allow for sale very low- and low-income units as well as
                          moderate-income rental units as part of AAHOP projects to accommodate some of
                          the moderate-income RHNA.
                          In 2013, a tax-credit financed 40-unit affordable apartments over commercial
                          mixed-use project was completed just north of the CBD along Oxnard Boulevard.
                          The project has 16,000 square feet of commercial space and is an example of an
                          AAHOP project, although it was not permitted under the AAHOP designation which
                          had not yet been adopted when the project filed for entitlement. The density is 20
                          units per acre with a ground floor commercial use and shared parking.
F.4    Realistic Capacity
                          The City considered and evaluated the implementation of its current multifamily
                          development standards and on-site improvement requirements (e.g., setbacks,
                          building height, parking, and open space requirements) to determine approximate
                          density and unit capacity.
                          Realistic capacity for vacant sites was determined by multiplying the number of
                          acres by the maximum density for the site, and then taking either 90 percent for
                          solely residential sites, 80 percent for Central Business District sites, or 60 percent
                          for sites allowing mixed use if that result was used as the final realistic unit number
                          to account for site and regulatory constraints. These percentages reflect building
                          trends in the City outside of specific plan developments in which development is
                          nearly 100 percent of allowed capacity for all uses. Realistic capacity for largely
                          vacant sites and underutilized sites took into account that these sites have already
                          accounted for development standards such as setbacks, parking, etc., and have
                          also accounted for additional site constraints (see the detailed site descriptions in
                          Supplement 2). Although mixed-use sites will most likely develop with ground-floor
                          commercial and second- and third-story residential and could use a realistic
                          capacity of 80 percent or 90 percent, the City took a conservative approach and
                          only assumed a 60 percent capacity.
Page F-6                                                                                            October 2017

                                                                               F. Achieving the RHNA Allocation
                             In addition, when determining mixed-use feasibility and capacity, the City looked at
                             past approved and developed projects in the city and projects in surrounding
                             communities. Based on the fact that mixed use is prevalent in the surrounding
                             communities of Ventura, Camarillo, and Santa Paula, that City staff has received
                             inquiries regarding mixed-use development, and to further the goals and objectives
                             of a Sustainable Community Strategy (SB 375) and related traffic reduction policies
                             and programs, it is likely that almost 50 percent all of the mixed-use sites included
                             will have a residential component. These factors have helped the City to determine
                             that mixed use is an appropriate way to achieve a portion of its lower- and moderate-
                             income RHNA and that a capacity of 60 percent is a suitable realistic capacity for
                             mixed-use developments.
F.5     Alternative Default Zoning of 24 Units for All-Affordable Housing
                             The -AH additive zone utilizes 24 units per acre as the default density wherein all
                             housing units on -AH additive zoned sites are counted toward meeting the City’s
                             very low and low RHNA allocation. Government Code Section 65583.2(3)
                             establishes 30 units per acre as the default density for cities such as Oxnard, and
                             Government Code Section 65583.2(3) allows a jurisdiction to establish an
                             alternative default density.
                             The City performed an analysis of market demands and financial feasibility and
                             concluded that 24 units per acre is an appropriate density to meet its lower-income
                             RHNA. The 24 per acre default density was approved by HCD in the 2006–2014
                             Housing Element and continues in this element.
                             It should also be noted that a lower density would also be more feasible and
                             appropriate due to the compatibility with the immediate neighborhood, the
                             environmental constraints that may exist, or where mixed-use development is
                             appropriate.
F.6     Moderate-Income Households
                             The median home value in Oxnard as of 2013 was $339,000. This is a slight
                             increase when compared to the previous three to four years, when the median sales
                             price was $265,582. The area median income for a household of four in Ventura
                             County, based on 2014 HCD income limits, is $89,300. Using that amount to
                             calculate the maximum purchase price, a moderate-income household of four can
                             afford a sales price up to $356,336. With market affordability at these levels, some
                             moderate-income households can be accommodated on sites the City has
                             designated as above moderate-income sites. However, more moderate-income
                             households will not be able to afford market-rate housing units. Therefore, the City
                             is not relying on any of the above moderate-income sites (Table S-1) to meet its
                             moderate- or lower-income RHNA, but rather it is relying on vacant, infill, and
                             underutilized sites, some of which are mixed use and better suited for these income
                             ranges.
October 2017                                                                                             Page F-7

F.7     RHNA Capacity Summary
                                   Table F-1 summarizes the City’s total site capacity compared to its remaining RHNA
                                   allocation. The Housing Element Supplement 2, provides parcel-specific
                                   information for all opportunity and all affordable sites as well as site-specific maps
                                   (see Figures S-1 and S-2).

                                   The Oxnard Zoning Code was updated in December 2016 and again in October
                                   2017 to be consistent with the state accessory dwelling unit (ADU) law that allows
                                   ADUs by ministerial approval in residential zones R-1 through R-4. Although the
                                   City is not relying on ADUs to meet a portion of its RHNA, these will provide for
                                   additional affordable units.
                                   As shown in Table F-1, after reviewing available sites for residential development,
                                   the City has an additional 264 lower income units to accommodate. Programs 3
                                   and 26 propose an annexation and rezoning to accommodate the remainder of the
                                   units. These programs include annexation of the Teal Club Specific Plan area,
                                   designating additional AAHOP sites, and allowing moderate-income units under
                                   AAHOP.
F.8     Teal Club Specific Plan
                                   The Teal Club Specific Plan is a pedestrian-oriented village plan on approximately
                                   174 acres located in the western portion of Oxnard, north of the Oxnard Airport. The
                                   plan proposes development of 990 residential units in a range of densities and
                                   housing types. There is a 15 percent affordability requirement of 148 units. The plan
                                   also includes a large community park, a pocket park, an elementary school, retail
                                   mixed use, and office use.
                                   Based on the Teal Club Specific Plan’s anticipated annexation and development of
                                   990 units, including at least 148 lower income affordable units, the City’s remaining
                                   lower income target of 264 units is reduced to 116 units and overall RHNA need is
                                   exceeded, although full development is not likely by 2021.

                                                                                 F. Achieving the RHNA Allocation
                           Currently the Teal Club site is not within the city limits but is with the City CURB and
                           does not require voter approval for annexation. The applicant has initiated an
                           application for annexation and development (Program 26). The environmental
                           impact report was prepared and circulated for public comment in late 2015. Once
                           annexed, these sites will have sewer and water capacity as part of the 2015 Urban
                           Water Management Plan and will be available for development within the planning
                           period. A minimum of 15% of the proposed 990 residential units are required to be
                           lower income affordable, or 148 units. The density in several areas within the
                           specific plan is over 30 units per acre, which could allow these units to be counted
                           towards the RHNA allocation, as it was in the 2006–2014 Housing Element.
                           The plan is in two phases. Phase 1 is proposed to include:
                                  ▪  13.0 acres – Community Park
                                  ▪  1.0 acres – Pocket Park
                                  ▪  5.2 acres – Mixed Use and Village Commercial
                                  ▪  8 units – Mixed Use Residential
                                  ▪  108 units – Low Density Residential (3–7 dwelling units per acre)
                                  ▪  232 units – Medium Low Density Residential (8–12 dwelling units per acre)
                                  ▪  192 units – Medium Density Residential (13–18 dwelling units per acre)
                                  ▪  230 units – High Density Residential (19–30 dwelling units per acre)
                           Phase 2 is proposed to include:
                                  ▪  8 acres – Community Park
                                  ▪  10.2 acres – Business Park
                                  ▪  130 units – Low Density Residential (3–7 dwelling units per acre)
                                  ▪  90 units – Low-Medium Density Residential (8–12 dwelling units per acre)
F.9        Environmental Constraints and Adequate Infrastructure
                           With the adoption of the 2030 General Plan on October 11, 2011, the Final
                           Programmatic Environmental Impact Report (FPEIR) was fully certified in
                           November 2011. The FPEIR is incorporated by reference. From the comprehensive
                           evaluation of impacts conducted for the 2030 General Plan, the AH additive sites
                           are within the range of development evaluated as part of the 2030 General Plan
                           FPEIR. The 2030 General Plan FPEIR provides a programmatic assessment of
                           impacts that will help focus the assessment of impacts associated with development
                           of residential projects. Several of the AH additive sites may qualify for the CEQA
                           infill exemption for projects under 5 acres. Development of the larger sites could
                           create localized impacts and may require additional tiered project-level
                           environmental review prior to development.
                           Below is a summary discussion of the major environmental topics.
                                  ▪  Environmental Features. No known environmental features (floodplains,
                                     protected wetlands, natural resource areas) have the potential to impact
                                     the development viability or density of the residential parcels or sites
October 2017                                                                                                Page F-9

Oxnard Housing Element
                         contained in this Housing Element.
                       ▪ Adequate Water Supply, Water Delivery, and Water Treatment
                         Facilities. As described in greater detail in the 2030 General Plan, the City
                         has a comprehensive multifaceted Water Management Program that
                         outlines how the City plans to provide an adequate water supply to meet
                         forecast water demands well into the future. The completed and adopted
                         its 2015 Water Master Plan and Urban Water Management Plan in 2016.
                         In addition to its internal water management program, the City is working
                         cooperatively with local groundwater managers such as the Fox Canyon
                         Groundwater Management Agency (FCGMA), United Water Conservation
                         District (UWCD), and Calleguas Municipal Water District (CMWD) (Las
                         Posas) on local groundwater management programs as well as with the
                         CMWD and the Metropolitan Water District (MWD) on regional imported
                         water supply issues. Together, these programs are intended to provide a
                         high degree of flexibility to provide a reliable long-term water supply under
                         a broad range of known (i.e., projected growth and planned water supply
                         projects) and unknown scenarios (i.e., global climate change). The
                         availability of local groundwater as augmented by existing groundwater
                         management programs (including groundwater recharge through the
                         Freeman Diversion project and the Las Posas Aquifer Storage Project),
                         imported state water, and the City’s planned water recycling effort through
                         its GREAT and Augmented M&I Supplemental Water Programs will help
                         to ensure that the City will be able to meet long-term water demands.
                         Relative to water delivery, all AH additive sites would be considered infill
                         or redevelopment and are within the City’s ability to serve. The 2030
                         General Plan includes policies and implementation measures that address
                         a range of water supply and groundwater resource issues. With
                         implementation of the applicable policies and implementation programs,
                         the 2030 General Plan EIR found impacts on water resources and services
                         to be a less than significant impact.
                       ▪ Adequate Wastewater Collection and Treatment. The Oxnard
                         Wastewater Treatment Plant (OWTP) has a current capacity of 31.7 million
                         gallons per day (mgd) with average daily flows of approximately 24.0 mgd.
                         The City anticipates expansion of the plant to 39.7 mgd by 2020. Sufficient
                         capacity exists to accommodate wastewater generated by the 2030
                         General Plan and the full development of the AAHOP sites. Localized
                         wastewater conveyance (including sewer lines and lift stations) may need
                         to be increased in order to accommodate wastewater flows associated with
                         AH additive sites development to be determined on a case-by-case basis
                         during technical development review.
                       ▪ Stormwater. Land uses and development proposed under the 2030
                         General Plan would increase peak drainage flow rates, erosion, and
                         downstream sedimentation in and around new development. Such
                         increases would reduce the capacity of drainages and could result in flood
                         flows that exceed existing downstream channel and stormwater system
                         capacities. The FPEIR found that the City had adequate system capacity
                         to handle future development and that the implementation of policies and
                         implementation measures contained within the 2030 General Plan would
                         result in a less than significant impact on these systems. The proposed (as
                         of July 2010) MS4 permit (Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System) could
Page F-10                                                                                October 2017

                                                                                F. Achieving the RHNA Allocation
                                     impact AAHOP project site design in an as yet unknown manner.
                                ▪    Solid Waste Facilities. The 2030 General Plan includes several citywide
                                     policies designed to continue to reduce Oxnard’s per person waste flow.
                                     With implementation of the 2030 General Plan and continued efforts to
                                     provide regional solid waste disposal solutions, this issue was not seen as
                                     a constraint to development of housing within the time frame covered by
                                     this Housing Element.
                                ▪    Adequate Electric, Natural Gas, Telephone, and Cable Service. The
                                     development of new residential, commercial, and industrial uses will
                                     contribute to additional energy supplies and utility infrastructure needs.
                                     However, future housing development would occur in an area currently
                                     served (or immediately adjacent to areas served) by adequate supplies of
                                     electricity and gas service, and both utility providers have the planning and
                                     capacity to serve future growth in the area. The provision of telephone and
                                     cable service is also within the planning parameters of local providers and
                                     can be provided to any of the areas being considered for housing.
                                ▪    Adequate Public Facilities. Implementation of the 2030 General Plan
                                     would increase the overall demand on City-provided community services
                                     (including libraries). Future growth in accordance with buildout of the
                                     Preferred Land Use Alternative (including the Circulation Diagram) is
                                     expected to generate the typical range of demands for community
                                     services. New facilities, equipment, and personnel will be required in order
                                     to provide adequate response times to serve future growth. Therefore, the
                                     City’s costs to maintain equipment, programs, and facilities would also
                                     increase. Compliance with existing requirements (i.e., impact fees, etc.)
                                     was considered adequate to ensure the continued provision of needed
                                     public facilities in the city.
F.10       Coastal Zone Housing
                           California Government Code Section 65588 requires that Housing Elements take
                           into account any low- or moderate-income housing provided or required in the
                           Coastal Zone pursuant to Section 65590 (the Mello Act). State law requires that
                           jurisdictions monitor and document the following four topics:
                                1.   The number of new housing units approved for construction within the
                                     Coastal Zone since January 1982.
                                2.   The number of housing units for persons and families of low or moderate
                                     income required to be provided in new housing developments within the
                                     Coastal Zone or within 3 miles.
                                3.   The number of existing residential dwelling units occupied by low- and
                                     moderate-income households required either within the Coastal Zone or
                                     within 3 miles of the Coastal Zone that have been authorized to be
                                     demolished or converted since January 1982.
                                4.   The number of residential dwelling units for low- and moderate-income
                                     households that have been required for replacement.
October 2017                                                                                            Page F-11

Oxnard Housing Element
                                               The Oxnard Coastal Zone contains housing around the Channel Islands Harbor
                                               northward to Fifth Street and eastward to Victoria Avenue and does not include
                                               Silver Strand or Hollywood Beach (unincorporated areas), Naval Base Ventura
                                               County, or the City of Port Hueneme. There are no housing units in the Oxnard
                                               Coastal Zone south of Hueneme Road. The area “within 3 miles of the Coastal
                                               Zone” is the approximately 75 percent of the city south and west of a diagonal line
                                               beginning at the Union Pacific Railroad bridge over the Santa Clara River and
                                               ending at the corner of Eastman and Rose avenues. Since 1982, all affordable
                                               housing and/or conversions and demolitions have occurred within this area, with
                                               the exception of affordable housing in The Village, Riverpark, and Northeast
                                               Community Specific Plan areas.

  Notes:
  1. Estimate based on 1980 and 2010 Census and permits issued since 2010.
  2. Since 2014, based on affordable housing completed or approved as a condition or approval within 3 miles of the Oxnard Coastal Zone.
  3. No housing inhabited by those of low or moderate income has been demolished or converted. Housing that was owned or rented by those
     with lower incomes has likely been demolished or converted since 1982 but it was not required (or guaranteed) affordable housing (i.e.,
     public housing, deed restricted, etc.).
  4. Since 2014, no low- and/or moderate-income units in the Coastal Zone have been required for replacement. Housing units occupied by
     low- and moderate-income households (retired, for example) have been replaced through private sector activities, and code enforcement
     activities have led to various types of repairs

Oxnard Housing Element
                       April 8), staff submitted the draft to HCD for review and certification, which was
                       obtained on September 20, 2015. During late 2015, staff focused on processing the
                       City’s first AAHOP application for the Skyview project, AAHOP site A-04 located at
                       1210 S. Oxnard Blvd for 240 units, and on identifying additional AAHOP sites for
                       Supplement 2. Staff also decided to codify the AAHOP and inclusionary ordinances
                       into the Municipal Code. The Housing Element and three implementing ordinances
                       were adopted on December 13, 2016.
                       Planning Commission
                       The City presented to the Planning Commission on October 16, 2014 to let them
                       know the City had begun on the 2013-2021 Housing Element update and to receive
                       any initial input.
                       On April 16, 2015, a study session was held with the Planning Commission on the
                       2013–2021 Housing Element. The commission and the public were invited to
                       propose or modify programs going forward.
                       Planning Commission Comments and Questions
                            •     Do second units count against the RHNA?
                            •     What is extremely low?
                            •     Does HCD require that units build by each Housing Element program in
                                  Section G be documented?
                            •     Program 18 – Density Bonus. How many density bonus projects have
                                  happened? City staff.: maybe 7 or 8 in the last 10 years
                            •     When was the growth capital fee last updated?
                            •     What is Program 10 (Inclusionary Housing Ordinance) calling for? City
                                  staff explained the reason for considering modifications to the IHO and
                                  some things that are being considered that we are looking for input on
                                       o Are the in-lieu fees sufficient to construct the 10% of Affordable
                                           Housing? City staff: Currently fee is generally $5,000/unit, so no.
                            •     Some people moved out of Oxnard historically because there weren’t
                                  enough homes for above-moderate households
                            •     Not all new housing should be smaller apartments
                            •     Should stick to the General Plan vision
                            •     Concerned about the impacts to property values when apartments are
                                  built next to bigger, more expensive homes
                            •      The housing market is cyclical
                            •     As a City Oxnard needs to be mindful of matching available
                                  resources/money to proposed programs
                                       o Market value houses replenish City coffers
                                       o Should have a variety of housing for all income groups
                            •     High density housing generates a good share of property tax
                            •     Concerned about water supply. The 2010 Urban Water Management Plan
                                  (UWMP) does not address the current drought.
                                       o It is tough to know as a Planning Commissioner what is
                                           reasonable in terms of allowing development and how much
                                           water there really is
                            •     It would be good to put residential/mixed use in the downtown
                                       o It would bring more people to downtown, bring investment
                                       o Would make downtown more lively

             Public Comments and Questions
                  •    Commenter provided an explanation of how second units can and can’t
                       be counted in the Housing Element
                  •    Commenter does not support in-lieu fees as part of the Inclusionary
                       Housing ordinance, units should be built.
                  •    Oxnard’s median income is approximately $60,000 (other Ventura County
                       jurisdictions skew the median up)
                            o There is an effort underway to renew SOAR. If we are to renew
                                 SOAR, there needs to be a commitment to high density
                                 housing—i.e. in the Teal Club Specific Plan
                            o The population of Ventura County is aging overall, but not of
                                 Oxnard
                            o Said several times that rents are too expensive/not affordable
                  •    626 homeless in Oxnard as of most recent point-in-time count
                  •    Extremely low income seniors have a high level of need
                  •    There are VASH HUD vouchers available for veterans
                  •    Commenter encouraged the Planning Commission to study the homeless
                       problem
             A public review period ran from March 26 to April 26, 2015. A press release

                       Comments also included parking for farmworker housing and how that would impact
                       the development of farmworker housing, and lastly, a new site was proposed to

                       City Council Hearing

                                     o A comment noted that the language in a few places in the
                                          document wasn’t clear that an extremely low-income household
                                          is one that makes 30 percent of less of area median income
                                          (AMI). This has been checked and clarifying edits made wherever
                                          needed throughout the document.

                                                         F. Achieving the RHNA Allocation
                   o   A comment noted that in several locations in the document the
                       Oxnard Housing Authority should be changed to City of Oxnard
                       Housing Department. These edits have been made.
                   o A comment noted that not all approvals of density bonuses are
                       administrative as stated in one place in the text. This language
                       has been change to note that Development Design Review is
                       required.
                   o A comment noted that three, not two farmworker only projects
                       have been built in the City since adoption of the previous Housing
                       Element in 2012. The language has been revised and Camino
                       Gonzalez farmworker housing has been added.
                   o A comment was made that the City’s evaluation of their
                       compliance with state density bonus law in Section A was
                       incorrect. The language in this section has been revised to
                       correct the evaluation.
                   o A comment noted that language about the demolition of the
                       Wagon Wheel Mobile Home park and construction of the Wagon
                       Wheel Family Apartments needed updating. The language has
                       been updated.
                   o A commenter asked whether it is correct that 326 three- and four-
                       bedroom units were constructed during the previous planning
                       period. This number was checked and it should have been 103
                       units. The number has been corrected.
                   o A comment asked about automatic eligibility for reduced parking
                       standards under state density bonus law. Language has been
                       added to clarify that any project is eligible if they request the
                       alternative parking standards, even without receiving a density
                       bonus.
             • Section B
                   o A comment noted that additional projects should be added to
                       Table B-34 “Oxnard Inventory of Assisted Housing.” Projects
                       have been added.
             • Section C
                   o A comment asked about tenant protection vouchers. Language
                       was added to clarify that the tenant protection vouchers currently
                       available in Oxnard are solely for residents of The Courts project
                       that is being rebuilt.
                   o A comment asked about language describing Table C-1 “Oxnard
                       Persons with Disability by Employment Status, 2000.” This
                       language was revised for clarity.
                   o A comment noted the Regional Center referred to was incorrect.
                       The name has been updated to the Tri-Counties Regional
                       Center.
                   o A comment asked about why inclusionary housing would be an
                       appropriate type of housing for those with disabilities.
                       Inclusionary housing can include many different housing types
                       and thus has been removed from this sentence.
                   o A comment noted that the information in Table C-5 “Agencies
                       Servicing Special Needs Populations” needed to be updated for
                       some of the facilities. The table has been updated.
                   o A comment noted the format/information included in Table C-7
                       “Oxnard Elderly Households Overpayment by Tenure” was hard
                       to follow. The language in the table was clarified and a statement
                       was added to the text describing the table that the content/format
                       of this table is that required by HCD.
October 2017                                                                    Page F-17

Oxnard Housing Element
                             o   A comment noted that the language describing single-parent
                                 households should be clarified. The language has been clarified.
                             o A comment asked why Moorpark College wasn’t mentioned
                                 under the College Students section. A paragraph about Moorpark
                                 College has been added.
                             o A comment asked about former prisoners as part of the homeless
                                 population. The language in the Families and Persons in Need of
                                 Emergency Shelter section has been revised to include “Those
                                 released from correctional institutions.”
                             o A comment suggested Habitat for Humanity be added to Table
                                 C-13 “Agencies Serving Homeless and Low-Income Persons.”
                                 Habitat for Humanity has been added to the table.
                       • Section D
                             o A comment asked why Wagon Wheel Family Apartments weren’t
                                 included in Table D-2 “Deed Restricted Affordable Units Built in
                                 Oxnard: 2014-2015” or Table D-4 “Remaining RHNA as of
                                 February 2015.” A footnote has been added to these tables
                                 explaining that that project’s units are not included because they
                                 are replacement units and don’t represent new affordable
                                 housing stock in terms of overall numbers of units.
                             o A comment noted that units in the Village Specific Plan may not
                                 be affordable or build out at as high of densities shown in Table
                                 D-3. A footnote was added to Table D-3 explaining that “The units
                                 counted under the areas of The Village Specific Plan zoning for
                                 development at 30 units per acre or greater were calculated
                                 based on the HCD standard approach to use the allowed density
                                 on sites that have not yet received building permits.”
                       • Section E
                             o A comment asked about the schedule of the City’s LCP update.
                                 Language has been added clarifying the schedule to date.
                             o A comment noted that Home Occupations are a permitted use in
                                 the R-1 zone and should be added to the “Permitted Uses”
                                 column of Table E-2 “Residential Development Standards by
                                 Zoning District.” Home Occupations has been added to the table.
                             o A comment noted that setbacks are a constraint. The following
                                 language has been added to the Lot Size and Density
                                 subsection: “Setbacks are largely for fire safety and deference is
                                 given to Fire Department regarding the possibility to reduce
                                 setbacks distances.”
                             o A comment noted that a Special Use Permit (SUP) can be a
                                 constraint to development of housing in non-residential zones.
                                 The following text has been added to the “Nonresidential Zoning
                                 Options” sub-section: “A SUP is appropriate in C-2 because
                                 housing in the C-2 zone needs review as not all C-2 are
                                 appropriate for residential uses. City council requires full cost
                                 recovery to evaluate, therefore the SUP process, which is a
                                 deposit account based on actual review costs, is appropriate.”
                             o A comment noted that fees are high and can be a constraint. The
                                 following text has been added to the Fees and Exactions section:
                                 “Tax-credit financing and other sources of affordable housing
                                 financing cover fees, so fees are not passed on to the buyer or
                                 renter in projects receiving that financing. If fees are a constraint
                                 on a particular project the City Council has the ability now to
                                 remove, lower, or delay fees on a case-by-case basis, and has
                                 done so in the past.”

                                                         F. Achieving the RHNA Allocation
                   o   A comment asked about reducing the amount of open space
                       required and setbacks. In response to that comment the City has
                       added the following text to the Development Design Review sub-
                       section: “Recently proposed affordable and density bonus
                       housing projects at 24 units per acre have raised considerable
                       concern over fire safety and quality of life for children, as the
                       applicants wanted to crowd buildings on parcels and minimize
                       open space. The City cannot compromise public safety and
                       quality of life for everyone in the development as a trade off for
                       adding a marginal number of additional units. It should be noted
                       that the goal for sites with the AAHOP designation is that they are
                       at least 1 acre in size partially to address the types of concerns
                       discussed above.”
                   o A comment asked about language in the Code Compliance
                       section about former Redevelopment Agency funds. The
                       following text has been added to clarify the section: “The RDA
                       successor agency has bond proceeds from a 2006 bond
                       available for projects to be determined by City Council and there
                       have been and will be more public input opportunities available
                       in the future for how these funds should be used. This is the last
                       of the money available from Redevelopment (RDA).”
                   o A comment noted that Save Open Space and Agricultural
                       Resources (SOAR) is a constraint. The following text has been
                       added to the Other Local Regulations section: “SOAR preserves
                       the employment opportunities for a large portion of the people
                       needing affordable housing. The SOAR affordable housing
                       exemption has not been requested in the 20 years SOAR has
                       been in place, showing SOAR has not posed a constraint.”
             • Section F
                   o A comment noted that the components of the AAHOP program
                       as described did not exactly match the AAHOP ordinance. This
                       language has been revised to match the codified language.
                   o Several comments were made that affected the units in Table F-1
                       “Comparison of Site Capacity and Regional Housing Need.” The
                       numbers in the table have been updated to reflect other updates
                       in Section D and elsewhere in the draft.
                   o A comment noted that a footnote in Table F-2 didn’t make sense.
                       The footnote has been revised for clarity.
             • Section G
                   o Several comments were made about Program 3: All-Affordable
                       Housing Opportunity Program (AAHOP) and “-AH” additive zone
                       designation. The language in the program has been revised to
                       reflect the current approach to the proposed program.
                   o A comment was made about the timing of Program 6: Fostering
                       Second Unit Development. The deadline for implementation of
                       the program has been changed to 2016 in response to the
                       comment.
                   o A comment was made about the timing of implementation and
                       language in Program 7: Housing Permitting Process Review.
                       Language in the program has been revised to address these
                       comments.
                   o Several comments were made regarding Program 9: Farmworker
                       Housing Program. In response to the comments the highly
                       qualified census tracts in the City have been listed in the program,
                       In addition, the City has added language to support inclusion of
                       the H2A Guest Farmworker Program in the City.
October 2017                                                                     Page F-19

Oxnard Housing Element
                                    o   A comment noted that the objective listed for Program 24: Special
                                        Needs Groups was incorrect. The language has been revised
                                        with an appropriate objective.
                                    o   Several comments were made about Program 30: Review of
                                        Parking Standards. Text had been added to the program to list
                                        another parking requirement to review and to clarify that any
                                        project eligible for a density bonus under state law may request
                                        alternative parking standards.
                       The remainder of the comments received were reviewed and no changes were
                       made either due to limited City resources to include additional programs, the
                       comment addressed an issue that is not within the City’s purview, the comment is
                       more appropriate to be addressed as part of other planning efforts, or because they
                       were already sufficiently addressed in the Public Review Draft Housing Element.
                       Response to 2015 HCD Review
                       Following HCD review of the draft Housing Element, additional revisions were
                       made. The City’s actions in response to HCD comments included the following:
                            •  Introduction
                                    o Additional information was added to describe City efforts to
                                        maintain consistency between the Housing Element and General
                                        Plan. New text also asserts the City’s commitment to maintain
                                        consistency of the 2013–2021 Housing Element with the 2030
                                        General Plan.
                                    o A new paragraph was provided to acknowledge the potential for
                                        future amendments to the Safety and Conservation Element
                                        pursuant to AB 162 and the Land Use Element or other General
                                        Plan Elements that would address disadvantaged communities
                                        in the City’s Sphere of Influence, pursuant to SB 244.
                            •  Section D
                                    o Table D-4 “Remaining RHNA as of February 2015” was amended
                                        with a new footnote to clarify that units in the table counting
                                        towards the lower income categories are affordable due to deed
                                        restrictions, conditions of approval, development agreements,
                                        and/or inclusionary ordinance.
                            •   Section E
                                    o Table E-1 “Residential Zoning and 2030 General Plan
                                        Compatibility” was revised to provide additional information on
                                        nonresidential zoning districts that allow residential uses,
                                        including zoning densities, 2030 General Plan densities, and
                                        permits required for the Commercial (CO) District.
                                    o New text was included to describe variations in parking
                                        requirements based on the number of bedrooms in a proposed
                                        project.
                                    o Additions were made to describe that neighborhood parking in
                                        the community is impacted by large households with multiple
                                        working adults that each often have a vehicle.
                                    o New clarifying text states that affordable housing proposals in the
                                        City typically consist of 10 units or more, thereby qualifying for
                                        the state density bonus law provisions that grant lower parking
                                        requirements.
                                    o The analysis of development costs was updated based on a
                                        survey of land costs for single- and multi-family development.

                       New information also describes the density assumptions used to
                       calculate the typical costs for these development types.
                   o Table E-7 “Housing Types Permitted by Zoning District” was
                       amended with additional information on permit requirements for
                       residential uses. New footnotes clarify current permit processes.
                       A new footnote also references a Housing Element program that
                       will achieve consistency with state law for transitional and
                       supportive housing.
                   o New text additions reference a Housing Element program that will
                       address constraints for attached dwelling unit development.
                   o A new sentence was included to state that the City has not
                       adopted any local amendments to the state building code.
                   o This section was amended to cite the current Zoning Code
                       definition of a family and its consistency with state law.
                   o New text additions reference a Housing Element Program that
                       would expand allowable zones for farmworker housing consistent
                       with the state Employee Housing Act.
                   o Text was added that describes allowable zoning districts (M-L
                       and M-L-PD) and current parcels that would accommodate
                       emergency shelters. A new figure showing the parcels in the M-L
                       and M-L-PD zoning districts has been added to this section.
             • Section F
                   o New text asserts that the analysis of realistic capacity for vacant
                       sites is consistent with current building trends in the City.
                   o Table F-2 “Coastal Zone Affordable Housing Documentation”
                       was amended with a clarifying footnote regarding lower income
                       housing in the Coastal Zone, which has likely been demolished
                       or converted since 1982 but was not required (or guaranteed) as
                       affordable housing.
                   o A new section was provided that summarizes the public outreach
                       efforts for the 2013–2021 Housing Element. This section includes
                       an overview of meetings held during Housing Element
                       preparation, key comments and questions from stakeholders,
                       and questions and input from elected decision-makers. The
                       section also identifies responses and updates completed to the
                       2013–2021 Housing Element based on this input.
             • Section G
                   o Updates were made to Table G-1 “Maximum Housing Units by
                       Income Category (Quantified Objectives): 2014–2021” for units
                       in the Rehabilitation Conservation Program and related
                       footnotes.
                   o Program 3 was amended to refine the City’s All-Affordable
                       Housing Opportunity Program (AAHOP), including commitments
                       to rezoning, timeframes, minimum density requirements,
                       minimum standards for residential uses, and requirements for
                       program participation.
                   o Program 6 was amended with additional direction to revise the
                       City Zoning Code related to the Density Bonus ordinance,
                       attached units, second units, multi-family development, and
                       standards for housing in the Local Coastal Zone.
                   o Program 9 was amended to fully commit the City to attaining
                       compliance with the state Employee Housing Act by amending
                       the Zoning Code.
                   o Program 14 was amended to identify the City’s commitment to
                       attain consistency with SB 2 related to transitional and supportive
                       housing as a result of Zoning Code amendments.
October 2017                                                                    Page F-21

Oxnard Housing Element
                                        o     Program 19 was amended to clarify the City’s commitment to
                                              provide information on fair housing information in both English
                                              and Spanish at multiple locations.
                                        o Program 22 was amended to commit to remove or revise
                                              processes for reasonable accommodation by 2017 that involve
                                              discretion.
                                        o Program 25 was amended to identify interim milestones for
                                              completion of annexations of the Teal Club site. Program 25 was
                                              also amended to include an alternative, backup approach to meet
                                              the remaining RHNA if annexation of the Teal Club site does not
                                              occur by 2017.
                                        o Program 28 was amended to identify an annual timeframe for
                                              developing or facilitating extremely low-income units.
                                        o Program 29 was amended to include revisions to parking
                                              requirements to remove constraints, with a commitment to
                                              complete amendments to the Zoning Code by 2017 and monitor
                                              and report every two years.
                              •    Supplement 1
                                        o Supplement 1 (“Part I”) in the 2006–2014 Housing Element is
                                              updated and renamed as Supplement 1 to the 2013–2021
                                              Housing Element. This section describes the City’s rationale for
                                              use of a default density of 24 units per acre to analyze capacity
                                              for affordable housing development. Prior to adoption of the
                                              2013–2021 Housing Element, additional research and
                                              information will be included in the supplement to address newly
                                              constructed and approved projects and further demonstrate
                                              affordability occurring at 24 units per acre or less in Oxnard.1
                       Planning Commission and City Council, Fall of 2016
                       Staff presented the 2013–2021 Housing Element to the Planning Commission on
                       October 20, 2016. At the hearing, the Planning Commission recommended that the
                       approval of a Density Bonus permit be with the Planning Commission as a non-
                       discretionary hearing. This change is consistent with moving density bonus permit
                       approvals “down” from the City Council. This recommendation is, however, a
                       change from the HCD-reviewed 2015 Draft wherein the density bonus approval was
                       to run with the underlying permit and could be at the Director level. Given that the
                       Planning Commission considers land use issues, the Commission concluded that it
                       is the appropriate body to determining if and when a State density bonus permit
                       may conflict with the City’s Local Coastal Plan (LCP) and the Coastal Act. And, as
                       the Planning Commission meetings are televised, the Planning Commission is a
                       more available and transparent public forum where the complexity of State density
                       bonus law and the City’s regulatory authority may be explained to the public.
                       On November 17, 2016, the Planning Commission voted unanimously to
                       recommend that the City Council adopt the Housing Element with two AAHOP site
                       changes and text changes within Section F.2 (Resolution 2016-17), and that City
                       Council adopt the four implementing zone code amendments regarding: 1) State
                       1
                         Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B) allows local governments to elect the option of
                       utilizing “default” density standards that are “deemed appropriate to accommodate housing for
                       lower income households.” With documentation, HCD may recognize a lower default density.
                       For Oxnard, the City requested and HCD agreed that a default density of 24/units per acre was
                       more realistic than the 30/units per acre default that would otherwise apply.

                                                              F. Achieving the RHNA Allocation
             Density Bonus, 2) Inclusionary Housing Program, 3) AAHOP, and 4) Accessory
             Dwelling Units (Resolution 2016-20).
             On December 13, 2016, the City Council held a public hearing, received and
             considered public comments from ten speakers, and voted unanimously to adopt
             the Housing Element with Planning Commission and staff-recommended changes
             (Resolution 14,982), and to approve three implementing zone code amendments
             regarding: 1) State Density Bonus, 2) AAHOP, and 3) Accessory Dwelling Units
             (Ordinances 2912, 2913, and 2914, respectively). The fourth proposed zone code
             text amendment ordinance regarding the City’s inclusionary housing program was
             removed from the agenda for reconsideration in early 2017. As no RHNA affordable
             units are credited to the City’s inclusionary program, the delay has no impact on
             achieving the RHNA in the 2013-2021 planning period.
             Response to 2017 HCD Review
             Following HCD review of the draft Housing Element, additional revisions were
             made. The City’s actions in response to HCD comments included the following:
                  •   Section A
                      Revisions were made to Table A-1 Program 5 to remove specific language
                      under to result column concerning the likely hood of a parcel assemblage
                      program
                  •   Section G
                          o Program 3 was amended to refine the City’s All-Affordable
                               Housing Opportunity Program (AAHOP), including commitments
                               to timeframes and consistency zoning, as well as providing more
                               discussion on the minimum number of lower income units the City
                               needs to address.
                          o Program 5 was amended to update the timeframe for reviewing
                               the effectiveness of the program and to add that the City will
                               pursue grant funding as it becomes available.
                          o Program 6 was amended to state that the City will continue to
                               evaluate Zoning Text Amendments to evaluate potential barriers
                               to zoning regulations which may impact the construction of
                               affordable housing.
                          o Program 9 was amended to revise the timeframe as to when the
                               City need to be in compliance with the state Employee Housing
                               Act by amending the Zoning Code.
                          o Program 14 was amended to update the timeframe for
                               completion.
                          o Program 25 was amended update the timeframe for approval of
                               the Teal Club annexation project.
                          o Program 31 is a new program that was added at the request of
                               HCD. This program was included to promote development of
                               AAHOP projects on City-owned sites and assist potential
                               developers with AAHOP projects.
                  •   Supplement 2
                          o Supplement 2 was revised to reflect removal of sites C-04, D-04
                               and lower capacity on site A-08.
October 2017                                                                         Page F-23

                       Planning Commission and City Council, 2017
                       Staff presented the Mid-Cycle Housing Element to the Planning Commission on
                       September 7, 2017. At the hearing, the Planning Commission recommended
                       inclusion of a vacant site at Graves and Santiago on the AAHOP inventory. They
                       also recommended some changes to the draft zoning amendment related to
                       minimum separation between multifamily structures. The Planning Commission
                       voted to recommend that the City Council adopt the Housing Element and six
                       zoning amendments with recommended changes mentioned above.
                       On October 10, 2017, the City Council held a public hearing, received and
                       considered public comments from five speakers on the housing element and six
                       speakers on the related zoning amendments. The Council considered the
                       recommended addition of the AAHOP site and revisions to the zoning amendments
                       from the Planning Commission. Based on public input received prior to the City
                       Council hearing City staff and members of the Council recommended several
                       changes to the proposed zoning amendments related to required replacement
                       parking when an existing garage is converted to an ADU, required parking for
                       Farmworker Employee Housing, and the definition of Farmworker Employee
                       Housing. The Council approved the Planning Commission’s recommendation
                       regarding minimum building separation as well as the three recommendations
                       proposed by staff and the Council. They did not approve the addition of the AAHOP
                       site. The City Council voted to adopt the Housing Element (Resolution 15,060), and
                       to approve the first reading the six implementing zone code amendments regarding:
                       1) Attached Dwelling Unit Development Standards (for six or more dwelling units),
                       2) Deletion of maximum of six dwelling units per building in the R-2 zone, 3)
                       Accessory Dwelling Units, 4) Reasonable Accommodation, 5) Lot merger fee
                       waiver, and 6) Farmworker Employee Housing.

                                                                                             G
                           The City’s overall housing goal is that every resident has a “decent home and a
                           suitable living environment,” first expressed in the National Housing Act of 1949.
                           This Housing Element chapter identifies goals (expressed as an “end state” or
                           “achievement”) followed by implementing policies (expressed as actions) followed
                           by specific implementing programs coupled to one or more goals and policies.
                           The City herein establishes five goals with corresponding policies and implementing
                           programs that address the maintenance and improvement of existing housing units
                           and their neighborhoods and provide opportunities for development for new housing
                           for all economic sectors and special needs populations. The five goal topics are:
                                 1.   Housing and Neighborhood Conservation
                                 2.   Development Opportunities
                                 3.   Housing Assistance and Special Needs
                                 4.   Appropriate Government Regulations
                                 5.   Fair and Equal Housing Opportunity
    G.1    Housing and Neighborhood Conservation
                           Housing and neighborhood conservation is an important component of maintaining
                           and improving the quality of life for residents. As a mature, developed community,
                           Oxnard is confronted with a wide range of community development issues,
                           particularly in its older and well-established neighborhoods where some private
                           properties have deteriorated and some public improvements and community
                           facilities are nearing the end of their design life. The following goal and its seven
October 2017                                                                                          Page G-1

                          H-1.4              Preserve Communities
                          Preserve the character and quality of established communities, with an emphasis
                          on single-family and transition neighborhoods.
                          H-1.5              Historic Preservation
                          Support the preservation and maintenance of historically and architecturally
                          significant residential buildings and neighborhoods.
                          H-1.6              Low-Income Housing Modernization
                          Continue to support the modernization of public housing, City-assisted housing, and
                          other homes affordable to lower-income households, and incorporate sustainable
                          building practices.
                          H-1.7              Mobile Home Parks

                          support the continued maintenance, affordability, and quality management of
                          manufactured and mobile home parks where feasible and desirable.
   G.2    Development Opportunities
                          Fostering a diversity of new housing development opportunities is an important
                          goal. Diversity is important to ensure that all persons, regardless of age, economic
                          resources, and household type, have the opportunity to reside in decent housing
                          suitable to their desires and needs. Part of this diversity is addressed through the
                          Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), which requires communities to
                          facilitate the construction of housing that is affordable to all economic segments of
                          the community. The following goal and its nine policies address this topic.

   G.3    Housing Assistance and Special Needs
                           Oxnard has residents with special housing needs: seniors, large families,
                           farmworkers, disabled persons, single-parent families, students, transitional,
                           homeless, parolees, and others. These groups often face greater difficulty in finding
                           suitable affordable housing. This goal and its six policies are identified below.
                             Expanded and protected housing opportunities for lower-income households and
                 Goal H-3    special needs groups.

                           Use federal, state, and local resources, to the extent available and feasible, to
                           provide affordable farmworker rental and for-purchase housing opportunities.
                           H-3.2              Public-Private Partnerships
                           Support collaborative partnerships of nonprofit organizations, affordable housing
                           builders, and for-profit developers to maximize the use of available affordable
                           housing funds.
                           H-3.3              West County RHNA Coordination
                           Coordinate with Ventura County and the Cities of Port Hueneme, Camarillo, and
                           Ventura on the distribution of RHNA units for affordable developments outside the
                           Oxnard City Urban Growth Boundary (CURB) but within the City’s Planning Area
                           Boundary.
                           H-3.4              Inclusionary Housing Program
                           Continue the Inclusionary Housing Program that requires new housing
                           developments to reserve a portion of units for lower-income households or payment
                           of in-lieu fees.
                           H-3.5              Homeowner Assistance

                           affordability, safety, and quality of housing and the achievement of the public’s
                           community vision. Although market conditions are typically beyond the direct
                           influence of any jurisdiction, efforts can be directed at ensuring the reasonableness
                           and effectiveness of land use controls, development standards, building and related
                           codes, permit processing procedures, fees and exactions, and related regulations.
                           The following goal and its three policies are designed to avoid unnecessary or

                           duplicative governmental regulations that could act as constraints to the
                           development of housing, especially affordable housing.
                             Appropriate governmental regulations that do not                 unnecessarily   or
                Goal H-4     unintentionally impede production of affordable housing.
                           H-4.1              Regulatory/Fee Constraints
                           Periodically review City regulations, building and related codes, ordinances, service
                           fees, and development impact fees to ensure they do not unnecessarily or
                           unintentionally constrain the production of housing, with an emphasis on affordable
                           housing.
                           H-4.2              Affordable Housing Incentives
                           Offer regulatory incentives and design flexibility for affordable housing, such as
                           relief from residential development standards, and/or fee waivers as appropriate
                           and consistent with state housing laws.
                           H-4.3              Processing
                           Provide for streamlined, timely, and coordinated processing of affordable residential
                           development projects so as to minimize land acquisition, holding costs, and/or
                           upfront project development costs.
    G.5    Fair and Equal Housing Opportunity
                           Ensuring fair and equal housing opportunity and educating residents about
                           purchasing and rental agreements are as important as production of an affordable
                           unit. Fair housing services such as working through mediated disputes,
                           investigating discrimination complaints, and providing education seminars are
                           important to ensure equal access to housing for all city residents. The following goal
                           and its eight policies are designed to continue implementation of applicable fair
                           housing laws, policies, and programs.
                Goal H-5     Ensure fair and equal housing opportunity.
                           H-5.1              Fair Housing Awareness
                           Provide or cause the provision of fair housing services to residents and ensure they

       G.6      Housing Programs
                                         Table G-1 quantifies the maximum number of housing units by income category
                                         that could be constructed, rehabilitated, and/or conserved over the 2013–2021
                                         planning period.
Table G-2 describes programs that implement the City’s five housing element goals and their respective policies. Not all
policies have a program but instead give general direction to the City. For each program, the table provides a reference to
policy or policies it implements (in brackets), the City department responsible for implementation, existing and potential
funding sources, and an implementation time frame.
                                         Table G-2 was modified to show 2-year periods for the remaining years in the 2013–
                                         2021 planning cycle, with 2017 marked for a mid-cycle update to HCD per the HCD

The Code Compliance Division enforces building and property maintenance regulations with a goal of compliance and safety. Code Compliance officers work
with neighborhood advisory groups and respond to complaints to identify violations, and then direct owners to appropriate City departments to achieve
compliance. The City may have loan and grant programs and works with other agencies to avoid unnecessary displacement. The Housing Department serves
as a liaison for Code Compliance in mobile home parks under HCD jurisdiction.

Time Frame: Seek funding annually
Part A – Loan Component: The Housing Department administers low-interest rehabilitation loans to assist homeowners in repairing plumbing, electrical, roofing,
painting, and other systems. The program applies to single-family homes, condominiums, and mobile homes and can be used for room additions. Rehabilitation
loans can range up to $75,000 with a 15-year repayment schedule.
Part B – Grant Component: The City of Oxnard offers a matching grant for 50 percent of privately funded exterior work. Grants are typically issued for relatively
minor repairs. The City will provide up to $5,000 in grant funding. Eligibility is limited to qualified low-income households who are homeowners and plan to
continue living in their home. If the homebuyer stays in the home for five years, the grant is forgiven; otherwise, the seller must repay the grant with interest to
the City.
Funds for this program are less abundant than before the dissolution of the Community Development Commission (CDC), and the City will maintain this program
as feasible due to available funding. The City will also explore additional sources of funding such as Cap and Trade and economically disadvantaged set-aside.

The -AH additive zone has an allowable density of 24 to 50 units per acre for all-affordable housing projects (with the exception of Site A-10 with a density of 18
units per acre) or mixed-use projects with all-affordable housing (with the exception of one manager’s unit). The -AH additive zone does not change the
underlying General Plan or zone designations for all other uses and development review but acts as an optional use. The City utilizes established underlying
development standards and multifamily development standards to ensure quality development with appropriate amenities.
The -AH project applicant is eligible for one development concession such as side yard setback and may also qualify for additional density bonuses, waivers,
and/or incentives available consistent with state density bonus law. An -AH additive zone project permits a 100% affordable housing development with a
Development Design Review Permit which does not include discretionary review of the residential use. AAHOP sites may be deleted or added as long as
capacity remains to meet the remaining RHNA target.
The AAHOP sites added to the AAHOP list in December 2016 will be rezoned during the City’s 2030 General Plan consistency rezoning program initiated in
2017. Additional AAHOP rezonings will occur as part of the comprehensive 2030 General Plan consistency rezoning program to address the need for a
minimum of 264 additional higher density units (11 acres) to facilitate the development of housing for lower income households. Additional AAHOP rezoning may
also occur as opportunities arise during the remainder of the housing element planning period. The consistency rezoning will be completed by 2018.

The Urban Village Program (UVP) is part of the 2030 General Plan. The UVP is described in the 2030 General Plan in Goal Cd-7 and Policies CD-7.1 to CD-
7.13. The UVP initially designated seven villages that are envisioned as mixed-use areas designed to encourage persons to live near their place of employment
and/or support services and readily accessible to transit. Urban Villages should occur in the designated areas but may be proposed in others as a General Plan
Amendment. The integration of land uses is intended to provide and promote a pedestrian orientation to reduce trips and vehicle miles traveled in order to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Urban Villages are implemented with a specific plan. A minimum of 15 percent of the UVP housing would be affordable. The
UVP would consider the rezoning and reuse of commercial and industrial land for housing, the consolidation of parcels, and mandating a local preference
program for affordable housing. The City will also consider renaming this program “Transit-Oriented Development Neighborhood, District, or Corridor.”

In an effort to create additional opportunities for redevelopment and affordable housing and for the AAHOP, the City will help facilitate lot consolidations to
combine small residential lots into larger developable lots by meeting with local developers to discuss development opportunities and incentives for lot
consolidation to accommodate affordable housing units, as well as consider additional incentives as brought forth by developers.
As developers/owners approach the City interested in lot consolidation for the development of affordable housing, the City will reduce setbacks and/or parking
requirements, could defer certain fees, consider waiving lot merger fees for certain small contiguous lots, and concurrent/fast tracking of project application
reviews to developers who provide affordable housing. By 2019 review the effectiveness of this program and revise as appropriate. The City will also pursue
grant funding for parcel assemblage land banking when it is available.
Program 5 would also work in tandem with Program 3 to assemble parcels for AAHOP projects.

In order to comply with recently adopted state law and address identified constraints to residential development the City will address the following issues and
make needed Zoning Code amendments.. Amendments to Chapter 17 (Coastal Zoning) of the code will occur as part of the Local Coastal Plan (LCP) update in
progress.
    •   The City adopted updates to the ADU ordinance in December 2016 to comply with state law and implement this program. Development Services
        Department staff will meet with local developers and homeowners and review ADU development standards and guidelines and initiate several ‘clean up’
        and clarification amendments in 2017. Beginning in 2018, staff will research and evaluate the feasibility of additional modifications to ADU standards to
        allow larger ADU’s proportional to the available space on a parcel.
    •   In 2019, the City anticipates beginning to update the Coastal Zoning Chapter 17 of the Zoning Code to address updates called for in this Housing
        Element in Programs 9 and 14. (Chapter 17)
    •   In 2017,amend the Zoning Code to remove the requirement limiting multi-family development to six units per building in the R-2 zoning districts.
        (Chapters 16)
    •   In 2017, amend the Zoning Code to decrease the minimum dwelling size for attached dwelling units, with certain findings. (Chapter 16)
    •   In 2017, amend the Zoning Code to reduce the required building separation between attached dwelling units to a distance required for adequate fire
        safety and privacy as determined by the Oxnard Fire Department and those required to review and evaluate development proposals. (Chapter 16)
    •   Continue to evaluate Zoning Text Amendments to evaluate potential barriers to zoning regulations which impact the construction of affordable housing

The Development Services, Public Works, Housing, and Economic Development departments will continue to jointly review their development review and
entitlement processes with the goal of identifying incentives, unnecessary and/or duplicative regulations and/or procedures related to development of housing
with an emphasis on AAHOP housing projects (i.e., sites listed in the Housing Element Supplement, Supplement 2), Accessory Dwellng Units, lot merger fee
waiver for AAHOP projects, and manufactured housing. As the City budget and staffing allows, and by City Council direction, Development Services is managing
permit reviews to implement State Building Codes as efficiently and accurately as possible to ensure public and property safety.The City has established a “one-
stop” or “concierge” program to assist applicants with the entitlement process.

The Oxnard Save Open Space and Agriculture Resources (SOAR) Ordinance was adopted in 1998 and extended in 2016 and established a City Urban
Restriction Boundary (CURB) line beyond which urban development is subject to a majority approval of Oxnard voters until December 31, 2050. SOAR provides
for a CURB line amendment exemption for all-affordable residential projects consistent with the current Oxnard Housing Element, provided a series of findings
are made and that no more than 20 acres of land are brought within the CURB for this purpose in any calendar year. This CURB amendment provision is
generally known as the SOAR 20-Acre Exemption. This program would have the City develop guidelines for the possible use of the SOAR 20-Acre Exemption
including, but not limited to, possible sites, provision of infrastructure and services, and conceptual site plans. Because this program has not been adopted and
will require additional development, no affordable units are anticipated by the end of the RHNA planning period. This program may not be needed during this
RHNA planning period as long as opportunity for affordable housing exceeds RHNA allocations.

Agricultural activities in the Oxnard area are in year-round production. Most of the farmworker labor force is permanent and lives in traditional housing units or
mobile homes, although many of these units are overcrowded and/or have converted garages to additional rooms. The Housing Department will continue to
seek development partners and funding that focus on affordable farmworker housing development. In addition, the City will provide assistance to the farming
community and housing developers in obtaining loans and grants and processing applications for the rehabilitation and/or establishment of new farm labor
housing under USDA Rural Development and California Department of Housing and Community Development programs and the new SGC AHSC Grant (Cap
&Trade) EDC set-aside for five highly-qualified Oxnard census tracts. The five highly qualified tracts are 6111004902, 6111009100, 6111004715, 6111004704,
and 6111003900.
The City will develop by 2018 an informational brochure explaining options, the permitting process, and possible funding sources for the development of a range
of farmworker housing uses. The City will continue to work with farmworker stakeholders and the nonprofit community to discuss possible options for locating
suitable and available sites for farmworker housing. The City’s zoning, development standards, and processing requirements encourage and facilitate all types
of housing for farmworkers (i.e., multifamily, single-room occupancy, second units, manufactured homes, migrant centers, etc.). In order to fully comply with the
state Employee Housing Act (Health and Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6) the City will amend its Zoning Code to allow farmworker employee
housing in the C-R, M-L, M-1 and M-2 zones because those zones allow agriculture in that manner. The zone text amendment will also document that
farmworkers may live together as a household in all zoning districts where single-family is allowed in the same way single-family housing is allowed.
The City will work with farmworker housing proponents to develop housing and permit processes that meet the requirements of H2A Guest Farmworker
program. The City will also conduct a historic evaluation of the Camp Vanessa “Bracero” farm labor facility and investigate the merits and environmental issues
related to changing its land use designation in order for the camp to become a legal use and thus eligible for rehabilitation and continue use .

In 1999, the Inclusionary Housing Program was established to generate affordable housing in proportion with the overall increase in market-rate residential
units. City Council Ordinances 2721 and 2615 require developers with 10 or more units to provide 10 percent affordable units. Developers of rental projects with
10 or more units are required to provide 5 percent for very low-income households and 5 percent for low-income households. Developers may request City
Council approval in advance for payment of in-lieu fees, which are periodically adjusted.
The 2013 Latinos Unidos v. Napa County First Appellant District ruling and subsequent HCD opinion letter that requires counting of affordable units under a
local inclusionary ordinance to also count toward qualifying for the state density bonus (SB 1818) supersedes City parking requirements, as any project over 10
units automatically earns a 20 percent density bonus, reduced SB 1818 parking requirements, and is entitled to one or more development standard
concessions. To date, housing projects continue to provide satisfactory parking. Staff will monitor the inclusionary program to see if projects are being
underparked and creating quality of life issues in neighborhoods.
In addition, to ensure the Inclusionary Housing Program does not pose a constraint to the development of all housing affordability levels, the City will annually
monitor the implementation of this program, evaluate the impacts on the costs and supply of housing, and make necessary revisions to the program. If revisions
are made to the Inclusionary Housing Program, they will be codified as an ordinance in the City’s Zoning Code. Prior to any revisions to the Inclusionary Housing
Program, the City will also conduct an analysis of the in-lieu fee and whether it is sufficient.

Continued assistance is provided for lower-income households to buy single-family units, condominiums, and mobile homes. Under this program, a matching
grant of $5,000 is provided for down payment assistance and closing costs. Grants are allocated as follows: (1) residents of Oxnard; (2) persons employed in
Oxnard; and (3) all others. If the homebuyer remains in the home for five years, the grant is forgiven. The City extends this program for households purchasing
in a designated historic neighborhood.

Oxnard participates with a consortium of cities in the Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) program administered by Ventura County. MCCs are available for
income-qualified, first-time homebuyers and provide a federal income tax credit up to 20 percent of the annual mortgage interest paid. Since the mortgage
payments repay the bonds, no City guarantee is required. MCCs can be used with City homebuyer programs to assist persons to qualify for private mortgage
financing.

Time Frame: Pursue AHSC funding annually beginning in 2015
The City of Oxnard has a strong record of providing financial and/or regulatory incentives to facilitate the development of affordable housing. Through direct City
assistance, over 100 units have been assisted in the previous two years through financial assistance or relief from regulations in return for deed restrictions
requiring the units to remain affordable to low- and very low-income households. CDC is no longer a funding source due to the dissolution of redevelopment
agencies in California. The City will target other funding sources for this program, in particular the Strategic Growth Council’s Affordable Housing and
Sustainable Communities program.

Time Frame: Amend Zoning Code to fully address SB 2
requirements for transitional and supportive housing by 2019
The City identifies developing a plan to address homelessness as Objective 4 of Goal 1, of Strategic Priority Area C, “Quality of Life.” Departmental priorities by
funding year will cotninue to address this need. Consistent with SB 2, the City amended its Zoning Code (see Zoning Code Section 16-504) to define and permit
supportive and transitional housing as residential uses and to allow emergency shelters with a Special Use Permit in the R-2, R-3, R-4, and C-2 zoning districts.
Emergency shelters are allowed without discretionary review in the M-L and M-L-PD zoning districts. Properties with these zoning designations are generally
located near the city center, allow for these structures with minimal setbacks, consist of vacant lots and buildings with adequate space for emergency shelter
operations, and are accessible to public transportation and medical and commercial services as appropriate for permanent emergency shelters to be allowed by
right. Currently, there are a total of 32.49 acres in the M-L and M-L-PD zoning districts made up of 16 vacant parcels. The City has set in place development and
operational standards consistent with SB 2 (see Zoning Code Section 16-504).
Further amendments to the Zoning Code will be made to allow transitional and supportive housing in all zoning districts that allow residential uses in the same
way other residential uses are allowed in those zoning districts. The City will continue to work with homeless services stakeholders toward developing a year-
round emergency shelter in Oxnard.

The City’s Homeless Assistance Program is modeled after the federal government’s continuum of care program. The Homeless Assistance Program contains
the following phases: (1) intake and assessment; (2) provision of emergency shelter at year-round and winter shelters to provide temporary housing;
(3) provision of transitional facilities and supportive services to help the homeless gain skills for independent living; and (4) permanent supportive housing. Local,
state, federal, and private donations provide funding.

The City currently contains no deed-restricted units and therefore there are no “at-risk” units at this time. Should the City have any at-risk affordable units in the
future, the City will contact all state and federal agencies that might provide affordable housing funds to determine whether any funding is available for future
preservation of assisted housing developments. The City will work with not-for-profit housing providers to apply for affordable housing subsidies that may be
available for this use, if necessary in the future.

The City will continue to aid private nonprofit entities to develop programs that move individuals or households from homelessness to permanent housing
including job assistance. The programs should assist extremely low- to low-income persons or households to achieve economic independence from
governmental assistance through a network of human services, including job training and placement, education scholarships, childcare scholarships, rental
assistance, transportation, and emergency services. The program may be a public/private partnership. Participants may be required to attend school or
occupational skills training, maintain employment, and work to achieve a career that will support their family. Participants may also work to define their goals and
develop strategies through education and skills training to achieve them. The City will meet at least once annually with nonprofits.

The Section 8 program subsidizes very low-income households who expend over half their income on rent. Prospective renters secure housing from HUD-
registered apartments, and HUD pays the difference between what the tenant can afford and the negotiated payment standard. HUD regulations require that 75
percent of new leases be made to households earning below 35 percent of median family income, provided less than 40 percent of their income is spent on
housing. In an inflating rental market, this standard is often exceeded, resulting in denial of a certificate. To protect housing opportunities for very low-income
households, the rental payment standard must keep pace with the market. The City regularly seeks to increase Section 8 vouchers from HUD.

The City of Oxnard provides services to ensure fair and equal housing opportunity. To implement these policies, the City periodically prepares a Fair Housing
Assessment, provides fair housing services free of charge to home seekers as well as fair housing training, and coordinates processing and resolution of
complaints with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, when deemed necessary. The City will also make brochures and other fair housing
information available in English and Spanish at the Development Services Department, on the City’s website, and at public libraries. In recognition of the need
for continued service provision, the City will continue to provide fair housing services.

The City will continue to post and distribute information on currently available weatherization and energy conservation programs to residents and property
owners through annual mailings in City utility billings, distribution of program information to community organizations and at municipal offices, and the City’s

projects and will encourage residential developers to employ additional energy conservation measures for the siting of buildings, landscaping, and solar access
through programs in the Energy Action Plan. The City will encourage development of affordable housing units that utilize passive or active energy saving
features (e.g. solar panels, efficient appliances, efficient building materials) and will assist developers in pursuing funding for these types of developments.

demonstrated, the City will give preference in its funding decisions to projects addressing special housing needs.
Through the Continuum of Care, the City will continue to cooperate and work with other governmental and non-governmental organizations to encourage,
promote, and facilitate the provision of emergency shelters, transitional housing, and housing to meet other special housing needs. Through the collaborative
efforts of the Continuum of Care, the City will continue to assess the magnitude of the homeless problem and to coordinate and promote housing assistance
programs for the homeless. The City will promote the use of community facilities and continue to work with service agencies to provide short-term emergency
housing for the homeless. The City will continue to encourage and work with and assist nonprofit housing development corporations to promote, assist, or
sponsor housing for the homeless. The City will also explore the feasibility of using its CDBG to provide seed money to assist nonprofit agencies in these efforts.
Through its Zoning Code, the City will continue to provide opportunities for sites to accommodate emergency shelters and transitional housing.

Time Frame: Annually
State law regulates the conversion of mobile home parks to condominium ownership. To approve a conversion, the City must determine that the proposed
conversion conforms to state law and that the conversion has resident support, per state law. Several park-conversion court case decisions are available that
could impact the City’s conversion process and application of state law. The City will review conversion case law and modify the conversion code and/or
administrative procedures as necessary.

If development and annexation is approved by the City, annexation approval by LAFCo in 2019The Teal Club Specific Plan will allow the development up to 990
housing units in a range of densities and affordability. Although affordability has not yet been determined; there are 230 units in planning areas that allow up to
30 units per acre, which may be counted toward meeting the RHNA.
If the Teal Club site is not approved by City Council by 2018, in 2019 the City will pursue other options to meet the remaining RHNA. The following are options
the City may consider:
     • Development and annexation of up to 20 acres per year of 100 percent affordable housing without requiring voter approval (SOAR exemption)
     • Development of the Northeast Community Specific Plan Phase III Urban Village
     • Additional sites to receive AAHOP zoning identified during the comprehensive 2030 General Plan consistency rezoning program.

affordability requirement, and ensure consistency with the intended use of the program.
Based on the outcome of the review, the City will revise the program as necessary. The City will also maintain a list and map of AAHOP sites, updating it
annually or in conjunction with project entitlements that remove AAHOP sites from the inventory and reduce the available opportunities below the remaining
RHNA target.

To address the housing needs of extremely low-income households, the City will encourage the development of housing suitable for extremely low-income
households (i.e., single-room occupancy units, transitional housing). Activities include assisting with site identification and acquisition, local financial resources,
assisting and streamlining entitlements, and providing concessions and incentives. The City will meet with local nonprofit developers throughout the planning
period. The reuse of shipping containers will be evaluated as a means to create temporary or permanent affordable small housing units.

and report every two years.
The City will continue to allow reduced parking requirements for senior and affordable housing projects as well as pursue the following revisions to the City’s
parking standards to more easily accommodate higher densities on multifamily and mixed-use sites in all zoning districts. Further study of these revisions will be
conducted before changes to the Zoning Code are made.
    ▪    Reductions in the number of spaces required for affordable or senior housing projects, if it can be demonstrated that the expected tenants will own fewer
         cars than the regular standards anticipate, or if spaces will not be “pre-assigned” to specific units in the project.
    ▪    Allowances for some of the spaces to be tandem or uncovered, provided that none of the spaces extend into the front yard setback.
    ▪    Standards for “shared parking” when uses with different peaking characteristics (such as offices and apartments) are combined in a single structure.
    ▪    Reductions to the space requirements for studio and one-bedroom apartments (presently 2 spaces per unit).
    ▪    Review of off-street covered parking requirements, including garage requirements for second units.
When parking studies are required for congregate living facilities, community care facilities and small residential care facilities for disabled persons, the City will
conduct the study with the goal of encouraging these uses and monitoring any constraints to allowing resulting from the parking study and resulting requirements.
The City will also monitor the impacts of these parking studies and report every two years on any constraints identified in their annual Housing Element report to
HCD.
By 2018 the City will establish fixed parking requirements for congregate living facilities, community care facilities and small residential care facilities for disabled
persons so that a parking studies are no longer needed or required for these uses. By 2018 the City will also make revisions to parking requirements to remove
constraints based on the issues studied, as described above.
As part of the research into Program 9, Farmworker Housing, the City may consider revising parking requirements for the range of farmworker housing uses that may be
defined by the program, leading to zoning code amendments in late 2017 or early 2018.
In addition, the City should explore the feasibility of an ordinance that would prohibit the long-term storage of cars in designated parking spaces in multifamily
complexes, thereby ensuring that the spaces may remain available for tenant use.
The City will also evaluate the associated costs with the current parking requirements to ensure they are not a constraint on development.
In addition, under Government Code 65915(p), any project that is eligible for a density bonus is entitled to use the alternative parking standards set forth in the
statute, regardless of whether the applicant applies for a density bonus. The applicant has to request that the City apply the statutory parking standards.

The City will provide for the inclusion of mixed-income housing in future new growth areas of the city through development agreements and other mechanisms.
To facilitate the development of affordable housing on smaller parcels (50 to 150 units in size), the City will routinely give high priority to processing subdivision
maps that include affordable housing units. Also, an expedited review process will be available for the subdivision of larger sites into buildable lots where the
development application can be found consistent with the General Plan, applicable Specific Plan, and master environmental impact report.

AAHOP sites and provide assistance to applicants on an
ongoing basis; disseminate information on technical

The City’s list of sites with the –AH (AAHOP) designation includes 25 parcels that are owned by the City, totaling 4.17 acres. These parcels make up a portion or
all of five of AAHOP sites A-03, A-08, B-04, B-14, and B-18. Four of these sites are in former Redevelopment areas and are administered by the Successor
Agency. Successor Agency parcels are subject to disposition in connection with the Long Range Property Management Plan. City-owned parcels not
administered by the Successor Agency are generally subject to the California Surplus Lands Act. The City would consider other alternatives for the use of City-
owned parcels within AAHOP projects. One alternative would be for applicants to work with Development Services, Economic Development, and the Housing
Departments to facilitate the application process on City-owned and other AAHOP sites.
Through website promotion of the City’s Affordable Housing Ordinances/Programs and collaboration with the aforementioned departments the City will ensure
information and assistance is provided about opportunities to develop affordable housing on AAHOP sites. Specifically, the City would include information about
opportunities for affordable housing on AAHOP sites, assistance developing AAHOP projects on City-owned land, and/ or for projects with State Density
Bonuses, in one place on its website. Contact information for the Housing Department and Planning Division would also be include in the same place on the
website for interested parties to contact for further assistance. The City would also disseminate information about this available assistance annually to local
affordable housing developers and advocates.

INTRODUCTION
This document is Supplement 1 to the Oxnard 2013 - 2021 Housing Element establishing the 24 units
per acre as an appropriate default density for all-affordable housing projects. Supplement 2 provides
sites to meet the City’s 2013 – 2021 RHNA as well as further analyzes each of the sites intended to
meet the lower and moderate allocation.
ESTABLISHING AN APPROPRIATE DENSITY OF 24 PER ACRE FOR ALL-
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS
Government Code section 65583.2(3) allows jurisdictions to provide an analysis demonstrating how
the adopted densities in that jurisdiction’s Housing Element accommodate need, or default to density
established by the State.
       (3) For the number of units calculated to accommodate its share of the regional
       housing need for lower income households pursuant to paragraph (2), a city or county
       shall do either of the following:
          (A) Provide an analysis demonstrating how the adopted densities accommodate this
       need. The analysis shall include, but is not limited to, factors such as market demand,
       financial feasibility, or information based on development project experience within a
       zone or zones that provide housing for lower income households.
For the City of Oxnard, the State default density is 30 units per acre, meaning any potential affordable
housing site that allows 30 units may count all the units on the site towards meeting the RHNA
affordable housing need.
    1. The City exercises Government Code section 65583.2(3) and documents the following
         evidence that a density of 24 units per acre is also feasible for all-affordable housing projects
         (note that state density bonus is allowed on top of the 24 units per acre): There have been
October 2017                                                                                 Supplement 1

  Oxnard Housing Element
           several projects completed within the past 20 years (see Table S-1) which demonstrate the
           City’s ability to develop affordable housing at densities below 30 units per acre and, in some
           cases, even below 24 units per acre.
       2. The City has researched neighboring cities who have completed a feasibility analysis’ of
           development potential which indicated that density in the 20 to 25 unit per acre range is
           sufficient to allow for the development of affordable, moderate income and market rate housing.
           Data shows that higher densities often require more expensive construction materials and
           structured parking, which impacts affordability and the feasibility of the project.
       3. Interviews were conducted with housing developers and affordable housing developers in
           Ventura County; Cabrillo Economic Development Corporation, Habitat for Humanity, McCarthy
           Companies and Todd Temanson, ED2, LLC to determine what density ranges were
           appropriate for the development of affordable housing.
           •   Cabrillo Economic Development Corporation was excited to learn about the flexibility of the
               City’s proposed All Affordable Overlay Zone Program. Their major concerns were regarding
               the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance and making sure the City is incompliance with SB 1818,
               and the associated parking requirements. Density Bonus Law allows one unit for one
               bedroom units and does not require garages. Cabrillo has found that the addition of a
               garaged unit can add up to $60,000 to a project.
               Cabrillo is also interested in the City providing incentives to defer payment of fees until the
               conversion of the loan process occurs. They have found that It is difficult for non-profits to
               secure the funding for the fees upfront in a project. Cabrillo also commended the City for
               working with them to allow tandem parking as part of a project and looks forward to working
               with the City again.
           •   Habitat for Humanity was most concerned with the fees associated with affordable housing
               developments. Habitat for Humanity understands that during this economy it is not possible
               for cities to waive fees but if the City of Oxnard could defer fees until later in the
               development phase or spread out the cost of fees this would help non-profits pencil out
               their projects.
           •   McCarthy Companies indicated that they have developed several affordable projects in the
               City and that 24 units per acre was sufficient.
           •   Todd Temanson, ED2, LLC indicated that they would work within the City’s density
               requirements. And that they already have a 25 unit per acre project in Oxnard. This project
               is an all affordable (with the exception of the managers unit) 53 unit apartment project (3
               story buildings) with garages and recreation facilities.
   PAST PROJECTS
   Table S-1 below provides a track record for the City, showing that 24 units to the acre is appropriate.
   These projects range from infill to the reuse of a former hospital building. The projects utilized a full
   range of financing tools including the use of the City’s inclusionary housing in lieu funds, Community
   Development Commission set-aside funds and/or land write-downs, land donations, State and Federal
   grants and loans, and tax credit financing. Most projects were developed by several local professional
   affordable housing non-profits that specialize in infill sites and/or farmworker occupied housing. The
   City is committed to providing more high-quality affordable housing through market rate inclusionary
   requirements, traditional publically-owned housing and programs, redevelopment projects, and
   partnering with and fostering community based non-profit projects.

      Table S-2.1 All Affordable Housing Opportunity Program Sites and Vacant Sites
      This supplement provides detailed descriptions of all AAHOP-designated sites with the “ –AH” zoning additive designation that could be available for low-income
      housing development in the City. The AAHOP sites in Table S-1are generally a minimum of one acre in size and are in four categories:
          1. Vacant. Never developed, or in agricultural use. These sites are largely ready to develop with minimal site preparation.
          2. Largely Vacant. Minor structures and/or paving to be demolished, small business to be relocated, less than five existing residences.
          3. Large Vacant Structure. Possibility of commercial and/or market-rate housing mixed use due to location opportunity and/or need to create
              financial feasibility to remove a large commercial structure.
          4. Constrained Sites. Sites with unique environmental or urban infill situations.
      The Figure S-1 pages provide a detailed site by site description for the AAHOP sites listed in Table S-1. Each site description includes the following information:
          ▪   Reference number
          ▪   Parcel(s) numbers and selected ownership information
          ▪   Gross acreage of the entire site
          ▪   Net acreage after subtracting for probable road widenings or other development requirements
          ▪   2030 General Plan land use designations
          ▪   Zone designation as of December 13, 2016 adoption
          ▪   Assumed density per acre for an all-affordable housing development or for the all-affordable portion of a mixed use development
          ▪   Estimated total potential affordable units net of demolition of existing unit(s), which are assumed affordable
          ▪   Whether the site is in a redevelopment project area
          ▪   Other assumptions and information relevant to feasibility
          ▪   An aerial photo with the site outlined and an image of a previously approved project site plan that has expired or is no longer active.
      Table S-1 provides a summary of the AAHOP sites with the estimated number of Very Low and Low Income affordable units.
      AHHOP sites from the 2006-2014 Housing Element are included.
      AAHOP potential affordable units is 2,067 units.
      AAHOP projects may include Moderate income units, not to exceed 25% of the project, and only until remaining Moderate RHNA need is satisfied.
      The Teal Club Specific Plan annexation, if approved, would add at least 149 lower income affordable units.
      Table S-2 lists 62 single family parcels that would likely be counted towards meeting the RHNA “above moderate income” target when developed.

 This site is currently largely vacant with a Church located on a portion of the site. The site would be suitable for
 more intense residential development and a higher density would be compatible with the surrounding
 neighborhoods. The owners of this site have expressed interest in developing a church affiliated low income
 senior housing development.

 These sites are within the draft Meta District Plan which calls for more medium density housing. The 24-unit
 Meta Street farmworker housing project, completed in 2007, is on the NEC of Meta and Sixth Streets.
 The four-parcel south area is publically owned. Two of the north area parcels are in a private trust, the
 southernmost parcel is owned by the Oxnard Redevelopment Agency. The north area has two small buildings;
 one may be a small residence.
 Housing Element Program 5 states that the City will help facilitate lot consolidation to provide for the
 development of affordable housing.

 The site was reduced in size due to the widening of Rice Avenue/Rte 1 on-ramps. The site is in active
 agriculture and owned by the Nishimoto Trust. About 3 acres would be needed to buffer a residential use from
 the Rice Avenue ramps and agriculture to the south. The former ramp and interchange ROW to the immediate
 north of the site is public and could be utilized for access to Pleasant Valley Road and convenience
 neighborhood commercial uses. Mobile home parks are located to the immediate west.

 This site is essentially a large parking lot for RV storage and auto sales. The rear half of the site is not paved.
 There are two garage and sales office buildings that would have to be demolished. Several former auto
 dealerships along this portion of Oxnard Boulevard have redeveloped into housing since the opening of the
 Oxnard Auto Mall along the 101 Freeway. The site has low density housing to the west, a RV park to the north,
 and a shopping center and medium density housing to the south. A frontage road is included in the parcel of
 about 0.75 acres. Because the site is mostly undeveloped it makes it an ideal candidate for redevelopment.

 This block long site is in the southern end of the central business district. Five of the parcels are vacant and
 four contain older small commercial buildings. The nine parcels are a parcel assembly opportunity as the City
 currently owns two of the parcels and the site is within a redevelopment project area that allows for eminent
 domain. Two additional parcels on the northeast corner of the block (southwest corner of Oxnard Blvd and 8 th
 Street) are also largely vacant. Housing Element Program 5 states that the City will help facilitate lot
 consolidation to provide for the development of affordable housing.

 The Birch and Saviers site is privately owned. Surrounding uses are low-density residential property to the
 east, south and west, with single family homes and apartment buildings; and commercial property to the North.
 Demolition of small commercial structures and possible relocation of automotive businesses would be required
 or there is also a possibility of a mixed use complex. These buildings are older, built in the 1030s and 1940s.
 As the site faces a commercial arterial, mixed use development (first floor commercial, 2 or 3 floors residential,
 joint use parking) could feasibly supplement costs involved with demolition. Mixed-use development would
 produce 20 units of affordable housing. Housing Element Program 5 states that the City will help facilitate lot
 consolidation to provide for the development of affordable housing.

 These two parcels are currently occupied by greenhouses and related facilities. Demolition of the structures
 would be required. Both parcels are owned by the same private party. The adjacent railroad tracks are
 infrequently used and at low speeds and a 20 foot wall and buffer setback reduces the site to 5.0 acres. This
 site was approved for 48 single family homes (Westwinds II) but is now available and would be best suited for a
 density of 24 units an acre.

 These two parcels are largely vacant and currently occupied by a group quarters for farmworkers under one
 owner. The opportunity is to redevelop the site for regular housing units at 24 units an acre. The adjacent
 railroad tracks are infrequently used and at low speeds and a large buffer wall reduces the site to 1 acres.

 These five parcels are largely vacant with two homes and two businesses on site. Demolition of the two homes
 could be avoided by a ‘wrap-around’ site plan which reduced the site area to 5 acres. The site faces two major
 commercial arterials, suggesting a mixed use development (first floor commercial, 2-3 floors residential, shared
 parking) that could supplement costs involved with demolition. The two middle parcels that have been removed
 from the aerial photo parcel map and the list of APNs above have a pending application for 40 units with a
 Density Bonus of 21%, requiring 7 low-income for-sale units.

 These five parcels are vacant with the exception of a restaurant (formerly Uncle Herbs). The site faces two
 major commercial arterials strongly suggesting a mixed use development that could include the existing
 restaurant. Mixed-use development at 24 units per acre would produce 12 units of affordable housing. The lot
 facing Pleasant Valley Road was previously approved for 18 units but approval has now expired, thus making
 this a candidate for at least a 12 unit project site.
 Housing Element Program 5 states that the City will help facilitate lot consolidation to provide for the
 development of affordable housing.

         Surrounding uses to the North, East and South are commercial, with residential uses to the
         west. A developer proposed 1,200 units on this site in three mixed-use towers, but the
         proposal was withdrawn. Mixed-use development at 24 units would produce 128 units of
         affordable housing. Demolition of the former Levitz building increases costs, suggesting the
         possibility of ground level commercial use. Hi-rises are due east and approved nearby in
         The Village project.

 This ¼ mile stretch along the north site of Hueneme Road is a series of older strip marginal commercial
 buildings (cinderblock boxes) with medium-high density immediately to the north. This site could be
 redeveloped as mixed use with replacement 1st floor retail with 2-3 residential stories above, and utilize shared
 parking. With other new residential projects located nearby this site would make a prime candidate for a mixed
 use development, with the possibility of keeping the existing commercial businesses.

 This is one of several auto dealerships that remain along Oxnard Blvd. still in business. The large site could be
 a mixed use development producing 121 units. Several former auto dealerships along this portion of Oxnard

 Demolition and possible business relocation could present feasibility challenges. The site may currently be for

  !"! Introduction
                   The City of Oxnard is located about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles
                   along a beautiful stretch of the Pacific Ocean coastline (Figure 1-1). The
                   largest city within Ventura County, Oxnard is the center of a regional
                   agricultural industry and a progressive business center while, at the same
                   time, a relaxed seaside destination with a variety of neighborhoods and
                   community services. Bordered by mountains and the Pacific Ocean, West
                   Ventura County provides a seaside environment with expansive mountain
                   views. Oxnard incorporates both of these attributes through its pattern of
                   relatively compact urban development focused on the downtown,
                   coastline and harbor, and the Highway 101 corridor. The moderate
                   Mediterranean climate, fertile topsoil, and generally adequate groundwater
                   supply lead to year-round agricultural production in the surrounding
                   Oxnard Plain.
                   Adjacent communities are the cities of San Buenaventura (Ventura),
                   Port Hueneme, and Camarillo. Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC),
                   consisting of Naval Air Station (NAS) Point Mugu and Construction
                   Battalion Center (CBC) Port Hueneme is located to the south of Oxnard.
                   The Oxnard Plain is bordered by mountains with numerous public
                   recreation areas while the Channel Islands National Park frames the
                   western horizon.

  !"# Oxnard Planning Boundaries
                     Formal planning and jurisdiction boundaries described below define
                     geographic aspects of the 2030 General Plan. The City continues the
                     same Planning Area from the 2020 General Plan that includes
                     surrounding unincorporated county areas “which in the planning agency’s
                     judgment bears relation to its planning” (Government Code Section
                     65300). The Planning Area and other relevant geographies are depicted
                     on Figure 1-2.
                         •  Oxnard Planning Area. Established by the City of Oxnard, the
                            Planning Area includes unincorporated areas surrounding the City
                            that have a relation to the City’s existing and future development.
                            It is the same area as used in the 2020 General Plan and the
                            same as the Area of Interest, with the addition of the Point Mugu
                            Naval Air Station area.
                         •  Oxnard Area of Interest. Areas of Interest were adopted by the
                            Ventura County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to
                            define major geographic areas where only one incorporated city is
                            permitted.     Significant  development       proposals      in   the
                            unincorporated areas of the Oxnard Area of Interest are referred
                            by Ventura County to the City of Oxnard for review.
                         •  Oxnard Sphere of Influence. The Oxnard Sphere of Influence
                            (SOI) was determined by the Ventura LAFCO on June 8, 1983
                            (amended June 2000) as the probable future physical boundaries
                            and service areas of the City. The SOI is 29.9 square miles. The
                            SOI may be amended with the approval of LAFCO.
                         •  City Urban Restriction Boundary (CURB) and City Buffer
                            Boundary (CBB). In 1998, the voters of the City of Oxnard
                            adopted the SOAR (Save Open Space and Agricultural
                            Resources) initiative establishing the City Urban Restriction
                            Boundary (CURB) and re-designating as “Agriculture (AG)” all
                            land previously designated “Agricultural Planning Reserve
                            (AG/PR).” CURB defines the urban development boundary for the
                            City of Oxnard until December 31, 2020. The SOAR initiative also
                            established a City Buffer Boundary (CBB) which lies outside of the
                            CURB line and is coterminous with the Oxnard Area of Interest.
                            Change to the CURB line or an agricultural land use designation
                            within the CBB generally requires majority approval of Oxnard
                            voters, with certain exceptions, including but not limited to an
                            exception to allow up to 20 acres per year to be brought into the
                            CURB for affordable housing needed to meet the City’s Regional
                            Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) target production. This
                            Oxnard 2030 General Plan expressly preserves these SOAR
                            requirements.

                           •   Oxnard City Limits. As of 2009, the City of Oxnard incorporates
                               and has land use jurisdiction of 26 square miles. Annexations
                               and/or de-annexations are possible as part of the 2030 General
                               Plan, subject to review by the Ventura County Local Agency
                               Formation Commission (LAFCO).
                           •   Oxnard Coastal Zone. Established by the 1976 Coastal Act, the
                               boundary of the Oxnard Coastal Zone generally extends 1,000
                               yards inland from the Pacific Ocean and includes the Channel
                               Islands Harbor and the Edison Canal. Land uses in the Oxnard
                               Coastal Zone are governed by the Coastal Land Use Plan (CLUP)
                               and its zoning regulations adopted pursuant to the California
                               Coastal Act and certified by the California Coastal Commission.
                               Selected General Plan land use designations and related policies
                               will not be effective in the Coastal Zone until certified by the
                               California Coastal Commission and are included to indicate the
                               City’s intent and direction leading to future CLUP amendments.
                           •   Oxnard Airport Sphere of Influence. The Oxnard Airport
                               Sphere of Influence is a designated area for the coordination and
                               review of land use proposals which may affect or be affected by
                               the operations of the Oxnard Airport.
  !"# General Plans in California
                      State law requires each county and city to prepare and adopt a
                      comprehensive and long-range general plan for its physical development
                      (Government Code Section 65300). A city may adopt a general plan in
                      the format that best fits its unique circumstances (Government Code
                      Section 65300.5). In doing so, the city must ensure that the general plan
                      and its component parts comprise an integrated, internally consistent, and
                      compatible statement of development policies. The choice of the planning
                      horizon is up to each city, but is usually at least 20 years. Oxnard’s
                      planning horizon is the year 2030, 10 years beyond 2020 that was used
                      by the previous general plan adopted in 1990.
                      The 2030 General Plan includes the seven State-required elements (land
                      use, circulation, housing, open-space, conservation, safety, and noise
                      (Government Code Section 65302)) within five chapters, each divided into
                      two parts: 1) Background and 2) Goals and Policies. The 2006-2014
                      Housing Element, and subsequent housing elements as directed by State
                      Law, are incorporated by reference into the 2030 General Plan document
                      as Chapter 8. This plan also includes a separate chapter on sustainable
                      community development that addresses recently emerging topics of
                      climate change, alternative energy, and the implementation of Senate Bill
                      (SB) 375. General plans may also include other topics that reflect the
                      city’s concerns (Government Code Section 65303). This plan is formatted
                      differently than the 2020 General Plan (adopted in 1990) and readers

                           should read the corresponding chapters of the Background Report (2006)
                           and Goals and Policies (2011) in tandem, as shown in Table 1-1.
                           The land use element (within Chapter 3) designates the general
                           distribution and intensity of land uses within the planning area. The
                           circulation element (within Chapter 4) identifies the general location and
                           extent of existing and proposed transportation facilities. The housing
                           element (Chapter 8) is a comprehensive assessment of current and future
                           housing needs for all segments of the city population, as well as a
                           program for meeting those needs. The open-space element (within
                           Chapter 5) describes measures for the preservation of open space for the
                           protection of natural resources, the managed production of resources, and
                           for recreation and public health and safety. The conservation element
                           (within Chapter 5) addresses the conservation, development, and use of
                           natural resources. The safety element (within Chapter 6) establishes
                           policies to protect the community from risks associated with natural and
                           human-made hazards such as seismic, geologic, flooding, wildfire
                           hazards, and air pollution. The noise element (within Chapter 6) identifies
                           major noise sources and contains policies intended to protect the
                           community from exposure to excessive noise levels.
                           A comprehensive general plan provides a city with a consistent framework
                           for land use and other decision-making. The general plan has been called
                           the “constitution” for land use development to emphasize its importance to
                           land use decisions. The general plan and its maps, diagrams, and
                           development policies form the basis for city zoning, subdivision, and
                           public works actions. Under California law, most local government
                           development, public works, and related decisions are required to be
                           consistent with the adopted general plan.
 !"#        2030 General Plan Documents
                           OPERATIVE DOCUMENTS
                           The City of Oxnard 2030 General Plan includes two Operative documents:
                                1. Background Report (2006). This report provides a detailed
                                    description of the conditions and trends that existed within the
                                    Planning Area during the development of the 2030 General Plan,
                                    generally as of 2005. It also serves as the existing conditions for
                                    California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review.
                                2. Goals and Policies (2011). This document contains goals and
                                    policies that will guide future decisions within the City and the land
                                    use and circulation diagrams. Many goals and policies are
                                    continued from the 2020 General Plan. Goals and policies are
                                    assigned to City departments and/or divisions for implementation.

  SUPPORTING BACKGROUND DOCUMENTS
  The 2030 General Plan is supported by three background documents:
      3. Map Atlas (2007). This document is a series of maps and images
          with accompanying explanation, excerpted from the Background
          Report.
      4. Issues and Alternatives Report (2006). This report discusses
          the major planning issues facing the City and presents three
          alternative approaches and land use scenarios, reflecting the input
          of the public, staff, Planning Commission, and City Council.
          Alternative B was defined as the project for purposes of CEQA
          environmental review.
      5. Program Environmental Impact Report (2010). The program
          environmental impact report (PEIR) prepared for the 2030 General
          Plan meets the requirements of the CEQA. The Planning
          Commission, City Council, community, and public agencies refer
          to the PEIR to identify and understand potential CEQA
          environmental impacts.
  VISIONING REPORT
  The results of a citizen survey, workshops, and public hearings        were
  summarized in the Visioning Process for the 2020 General               Plan
  Update (2002) as the vision that guided subsequent planning. The       2020
  General Plan Update was subsequently changed to become a new           2030
  General Plan.
  2006-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
  The Housing Element has a State-mandated content, format, and specific
  time horizon for periodic updates. To meet these mandated State
  timelines, the Housing Element was prepared for separate adoption by the
  City Council on a separate schedule and then will be incorporated as
  Chapter 8 of the 2030 General Plan. State Law may require one or more
  subsequent housing elements within the 2030 planning period which
  would respectively replace the preceding element as Chapter 8.
  GENERAL PLAN FORMAT
  The 2030 Oxnard General Plan sets out a vision to guide future
  development in the City to the year 2030. A visioning program was
  completed in 2002 that was based on updating the 2020 General Plan.
  During the subsequent planning steps, the City Council decided to extend
  the planning period to 2030 to coincide with regional planning and in
  recognition that development of major public works projects would extend
  past 2020.
  The Background Report was completed in 2006 and presented a detailed
  description of the City and the Planning Area in a wide range of topic
  areas. The report serves as the existing conditions for the PEIR. In other
  general plans, background information is often included with the goals and
                   !"#$%&'(%
!"#$%&'%()*+,-%                                                                              %
                policies in one document. In this case, the background information was
                prepared separately and may be combined with the Goals and Policies
                into one document after final adoption.
                The Goals and Policies document contains the actions (i.e. policies)
                needed to achieve the vision expressed in terms of specific goals. The
                Goals and Policies document is divided into nine chapters. Each chapter
                contains an introduction, definitions, and goals and policies numbered
                according to the topic they address. An abbreviation or acronym is given
                for each element to identify which policy and implementation measures go
                together. For example, the Safety and Hazards abbreviation is “SH” and
                used to subsequently identify Safety and Hazards goals and policies.
                The Goals and Policies document is intended to be used as a decision

                emergence of global warming, climate change, and renewable and
                alternative energy production and conservation as critical issues related to
                long-term sustainable development. This chapter includes background
                information as these topics were not anticipated when the 2006

                Chapter 3, Community Development, establishes goals and policies for
                the distribution and intensity of land use types. The focus of this element
                is on revitalization of existing neighborhoods and new development within
                the community, and continued greenbelt and agriculture uses within the
                surrounding Planning Area.
                Chapter 4, Infrastructure and Community Services, sets goals and
                policies for traffic and circulation, long-term water supply, parks, public
                safety, schools, and other public and semi-public facilities and services.
                Chapter 5, Environmental Resources, addresses the conservation,
                development, and use of natural resources, and also explores the
                managed production of resources, significant buildings and historic sites,
                water resources, biological, and agricultural resources.
                Chapter 6, Safety and Hazards, addresses seismic and geologic
                hazards, flooding, tsunami, hazardous materials and wastes, emergency
                preparedness, and other hazards.
                Chapter 7, Military Compatibility, is a State-recommended element
                focused on the City’s geographic and functional relationship to the NBVC
                facilities and operations.

  !"# California Environmental Quality Act Review
                       As required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA, Public
                       Resources Code Section 21000, et seq.), the Planning Commission and
                       City Council must consider the findings of a Program Environmental
                       Impact Report (PEIR) prior to adopting the 2030 General Plan. Both
                       documents were prepared concurrently, as allowed under Section 15166
                       of the State CEQA Guidelines, with common organization and numbering.
                       The Background Report is the environmental setting for the 2030 General
                       Plan PEIR, the Goals and Policies is the PEIR project description, and the
                       PEIR discusses impacts and mitigation measures as well as other CEQA
                       required content. PEIR mitigation measures are incorporated as policies
                       and programs within the 2030 General Plan. A new CEQA Thresholds
                       Guidelines document derived from the 2030 General Plan PEIR will be
                       used for future CEQA reviews.

                Each chapter is organized using the following structure.
                GOAL
                A goal is a statement that describes, in general terms, a desired future
                condition or end state. A goal serves as a general direction-setter. In this
                update, goal statements will be formatted in a blue box with the goal’s
                reference number: “ER” refers to an Environmental Resources topic and
                the “2” means this is the second goal under this topic. Each topic area will
                have one or more goal.
                POLICY
                A policy is an active tense statement that sets a specific course of action
                for decision-makers to achieve its respective desired goal (policies may
                contribute to more than one goal but are placed under their principal
                objective). The letters and first number (e.g., “ER-2.1”) show which goal
                the policy primarily supports.

  !"# City Overview
                    History. This section is a brief summary of the history of Oxnard taken
                    largely from the 2006 Background Report. There are four general periods:
                        •    Pre-European (11,500 BC to 1542 AD). The earliest residents of
                             the region were the Chumash Indians, known for their well
                             constructed canoes, fine basket work, and one of the most
                             complex hunter-gatherer cultures. The Ventureno Chumash
                             occupied the area from Topanga Canyon northwest to San Luis
                             Obispo. The Chumash achieved a high degree of social
                             complexity, including at least two major chiefdoms, and a
                             population size without dependence on the need for agriculture.
                        •    The Spanish and Mexican Era (1542 to 1850). European
                             presence began in 1542 when Portuguese explorer Juan
                             Rodriquez Cabrillo sailed into Point Mugu lagoon and described
                             the area as “the land of everlasting summers.” After a number of
                             Spanish explorations, Mission San Buenaventura was established
                             in 1782 as a midway point between the San Diego and Monterey
                             Missions. By 1822, the Mexican government gained control of
                             California. Ranchos created by the Mexican government in the
                             Planning Area ranged from north of the Santa Clara River to the
                             coast and down to El Rio in the southern portion of the Planning
                             Area, which included the Rancho el Rio de Santa Clara o la
                             Colonia, Rancho San Miguel, Rancho San Pedro, and Rancho
                             Santa Clara. Many of the place names have been preserved. In
                             addition, the original name for the City of Oxnard, La Colonia, still
                             remains as a neighborhood within the city.
                        •    Statehood and Emergent Commercial Agriculture (1850 to
                             1903). With the addition of California to the United States in 1850
                             and the Gold Rush, immigrants flocked to the west coast from the
                             eastern states and Europe. Agriculture quickly became the
                             dominant local industry, with lima beans and barley the major
                             crops produced. By the early 1860’s, many non-Hispanics began
                             purchasing rancho lands for the first time. When plans to build the
                             terminus for the Southern Pacific Railroad in western Ventura

                                                irrigation development, the increasing economic importance of
                                                agriculture, and the cultivation potential of the area, many of the
                                                new settlers to the region became farmers.
                                                By the late Nineteenth Century, the agriculture potential of the
                                                Oxnard Plain became more and more evident. More crops were

(Courtesy of Oxnard Library)                    citrus. In addition, this success in the sugar beet industry led to the
                                                construction of the American Sugar Beet Factory in La Colonia.
                                                The local farming industry quickly reoriented to focus on the sugar

                                                town quickly developed in close proximity to the beet factory to
                                                provide services for the factory and its workers. The Oxnard
                                                Improvement Company was created in 1898 to design the town
                                                site, focused around a town square called “the Plaza” (presently
                                                Plaza Park). Businesses and residences were constructed around
                                                the town square, followed by schools and churches.
                                           •    Incorporation to Current Period (1903 to Present).
                                                Incorporated in 1903, the City of Oxnard took its name from the
                                                Oxnard Brothers who founded the local sugar beet factory.

(Courtesy of Oxnard Library)                    conjunction with the arrival of Chinese, Japanese, and Mexican
                                                workers attracted to the area by the numerous job opportunities.
                                                Major crops of the day included beans, beets, and more recently,
                                                strawberries. Businesses in town expanded to include general
                                                merchandise, restaurants, laundries, saloons, and banks. By the
                                                early 1920’s, lemons outstripped lima beans and sugar beets as
                                                the number one crop. As urbanization and economic growth
                                                increased, the demands on the river and the land around it also
                                                grew. Agriculture in the region became agribusiness. During the
                                                1930's, commercial shipping increased with formation of the

                                                experienced its greatest growth during World War II, with
                                                establishment of the U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Center.
                                                The establishment of military bases at Port Hueneme and Point
                                                Mugu, coupled with the rise of electronic, aerospace, and other
                                                manufacturing, led Oxnard to experience a period of intense
                                                growth during and after World War II. In more recent years, the
                                                attraction of Oxnard’s coastal location led to the development of
                                                tourism as a significant industry. Oxnard is now the largest city in
                                                Ventura County and lies in the center of 180 square miles of some
                                                of the richest prime agricultural land in the State of California.
                                        Population. On April 1, 2010, Oxnard had a population of 197,899 and

    Housing. The DOF estimated the city had 52,185 housing units as of
    January 1, 2009. Of this total, 29,446 were single-family detached
    (56.4%), 4,633 were single-family attached (8.8%), 4,558 were in
    structures with 2 to 4 units (8.7%), 10,602 were in structures with five or
    more units (20.3%), and 2,946 were mobile homes (5.6%). This 2009
    estimate is an increase of 7,019 units from Census 2000 data, an increase
    of 15.5%. This nine-year change occurred almost entirely with the
    addition of 4,537 single-family detached units and 2,213 units in

    a very small increase. About two percent of the population lives in Group
    Homes, such as nursing homes. Population and housing growth between
    2000 and 2009 occurred at about the same rate, and persons per
    household remained stable at 3.8.
    Land Use. Oxnard’s historic land use pattern reflects the City’s central
    location in the Oxnard plain with surrounding agriculture, as Oxnard grew
    in all directions from the original small town. Land within the City limits is
    currently classified into one of five broad categories: residential,
    commercial, industrial, open space, and other. Each of these categories is
    further subdivided into uses correlated with specific standards. With the
    exception of several high rise buildings in north Oxnard, the City is
    characterized by one or two story residential and commercial buildings
    and several industrial areas.         Most of the City’s higher intensity
    development lies adjacent to primary thoroughfares such as Highway 101,
    Gonzales Road, Rose Avenue, Rice Avenue, Oxnard Boulevard,
    Hueneme Road, Ventura Road, Victoria Avenue, Saviers Road, and in the
    central business district.
    Specific Plans. Beginning in the 1980’s, the City planned its larger
    expansions by use of specific plans. Several specific plans are in
    development and continued over from the 2020 General Plan. Specific

                Streets and Highways. Initially, transportation planning efforts within
                Oxnard focused on moving agricultural produce to market by rail. As the
                City grew, a grid system of neighborhood and major streets developed to
                serve residents and businesses and connect to other areas of the county.
                Alternative transportation modes, including public transportation, bicycling,
                and passenger rail facilities, are becoming more important as the City
                focuses on reducing dependency on the automobile.
                Oxnard builds, operates, and maintains arterials, collectors, and local
                neighborhood streets. Many recent developments have private streets
                and driveways that are not maintained by the City, although the City sets

                highways, and the 101 Freeway connect Oxnard to agricultural fields,
                surrounding cities, and the Southern California and Central Coast regions.
                Level of Service (LOS). The purpose of Level of Service (LOS) is to
                determine how much traffic during rush hours is acceptable at our major
                intersections and on segments of major streets. As shown in Table 1-5,
                LOS is identified by letter grades A through F. LOS A represents the best
                driving conditions, while LOS F represents the worst conditions. LOS A, B
                and C indicate conditions where traffic moves without significant delays
                over periods of peak travel demand. LOS D and E are progressively
                worse peak hour operating conditions, and LOS F is where demand
                exceeds the capacity of an intersection. As in the 2020 General Plan, the

  Public Transit. The City of Oxnard has two public transportation transfer
  centers where transit and rail passengers can access local bus lines,
  commuter buses or trains: the C Street Transfer Center at the Centerpoint
  Mall and the Oxnard Transportation Center (OTC). The OTC includes rail
  service provided by Metrolink and Amtrak. There are also a number of
  locations where commuter buses meet local transit services.
  In 2011, there were six public transit operators operating in the City (Gold
  Coast Transit, Oxnard Harbors and Beaches Dial-a-Ride, Intercity
  Express Service, VISTA, Conejo Connection, and Clean Air Express) and
  three private bus operators (Greyhound, Transportes Intercalifornias, and
  Ventura County Airporter). Oxnard also offers Paratransit, a local service
  for people who are unable to use fixed route bus service. In 2009, Gold
  Coast Transit ACCESS was the sole operator of Paratransit within the City
  of Oxnard.
  Bicycle Routes. Oxnard has approximately 66 miles of designated bike
  paths, lanes and routes for work, school, recreation, and sport. Team and
  special event bicyclists frequently pass through Oxnard as they travel the
  Pacific Ocean coast between Malibu and Santa Barbara.
  Air Transportation. Air transportation service in the City of Oxnard is
  available for commuter commercial travel, general aviation and
  agricultural users. The County owned and operated Oxnard Airport
  operates as a commuter service airport. The Oxnard Airport is presently
  FAA certified.
  Goods Movement. Freight is moved within and through Oxnard by both
  rail and commercial vehicles. The goods movement function is essential
  for Oxnard and the continued economic development of the City and the
  region.     Rail lines within the City include the Union Pacific Railroad
  (UPRR) connecting Oxnard to all major west coast destinations and
  markets, and the Ventura County Railroad which serves to transfer freight

                    areas expanded, truck routes expanded to include most of the major east-
                    west and north-south arterials. As the Port of Hueneme expanded its
                    operations, the City designated Victoria Avenue, Hueneme Road, and
                    Rice Avenue for port-related trucking access to the 101 Freeway.
                    Water Supply. The City of Oxnard owns and operates its own municipal
                    water supply system which relies on local groundwater and imported
                    water supplies. Groundwater is purchased from the United Water
                    Conservation District (UWCD) and imported water is purchased from the
                    Calleguas Municipal Water District (CMWD) which obtains the water from
                    the State Water Project.
                    The City’s water system includes five blending stations where imported
!                   water from CMWD is blended with local water, either from UWCD or City
%                   wells. Based on the draft 2010 Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP),
                    the City of Oxnard had available 2010 water supplies of 41,658 acre-feet
                    of water from all sources, including 5,500 acre-feet from the Ferro Pit
                    program. The estimated 2010 demand distribution is detailed in Table 1-6
                    below. The City had 11,393 acre feet of additional water supply available
                    in 2010.

                    Wastewater Systems. The City of Oxnard provides wastewater collection
                    and treatment services through the Public Works Wastewater Division.
                    The Oxnard Wastewater Treatment Plant (OWWTP), located in southwest
                    Oxnard, serves the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme, Naval Base
                    Ventura County, and some adjacent unincorporated areas. The City owns,
                    operates, and maintains over 425 miles of sewer pipeline and 15
                    wastewater lift stations. Three additional pumping stations owned and
                    operated by other entities also discharge to the City’s system. The
                  ! OWWTP has an average design capacity of 31.7 million gallons per day

  Storm Drainage System. Oxnard’s relatively flat topography has a major
  bearing on the drainage needs of the area. The City is located in the
  Ventura County Watershed Protection District (VCWPD) Flood Zone 2.
  This drainage area includes the City and surrounding environs. Currently,
  the City uses storm drainage facilities maintained by the Public Works
  Department Operations Division and the County of Ventura to
  accommodate storm water runoff. In addition, it is a common practice for
  agricultural operations to use private underground lines to drain perched
  water from shallow soil zones. These lines empty into storm drains or
  natural drainage courses.
  Fire Prevention and Response. The Oxnard Fire Department provides a
  full range of emergency and non-emergency services to the community
  and is staffed by 103 personnel, which include 9 civilians and 94 safety
  positions. Eighty-seven of the safety positions are assigned to the
  Suppression Division which provides emergency services to our residents.
  The mission of the Oxnard Fire Department is to serve the public and
  safeguard the community by preventing or minimizing the impact of
  emergency situations to life, the environment, and property by responding
  to both emergency and non-emergency calls for service.
  In 2000, the City had a staffing ratio of 0.48 firefighters per 1,000
  residents. Currently, the ratio is 0.46 per 1,000 residents, below the
  national average of 1.5 firefighters per 1,000, and below the California
  average of 1.0 per 1,000 residents. The department prepared a 10-year
  strategic plan in 2003 which indicated that it would need an additional 17
  firefighters to equal the ratio of comparable cities within the state. In 2011,
  with a population of just under 200,000, the department would require an
  additional 106 firefighters to equal the California average of 1.0 firefighter
  per 1,000 residents.
  The Oxnard Fire Department is currently rated as a Class 2 fire
  department by the Insurance Services Office (ISO). The ISO rating
  evaluates the fire department, the City’s water system, and the fire
  departments communication capabilities. ISO rating is important to
  communities since most property insurance companies determine the fire
  risk portion of property insurance premiums on the City’s ISO rating.
  Oxnard was last rated by the ISO in 1994. Although commercial
  businesses might see benefits in a Class 1 rating, residential structures
  would not.
  Law Enforcement. Within the City limits, law enforcement and police
  protection services are provided by the Oxnard Police Department. In the
  unincorporated area, the Ventura Sheriff’s Department provides patrol
  services and the California Highway Patrol provides traffic control on SR
  101. In 1990, the City had a staffing ratio of 1.22 officers per 1,000
  residents. Currently, the ratio is 1.3 officers per 1,000 residents, below the
  national average of 1.9 officers per 1,000. In 2005, there were 237 sworn
  officers and over 150 civilians providing law enforcement services for the
  City of Oxnard. The Oxnard Police Department’s Five Year Staffing Plan

                  projected additional calls for service based on the City’s increasing
                  population and desired service levels.
                  Marine Safety. The Ventura County Harbor Patrol provides rescue and
                  emergency services within the Channel Island Harbor and Mandalay Bay
                  water areas. Services provided include first response, fire suppression
                  assistance for maritime incidents, boating and safety education, vessel
                  inspections, limited law enforcement, and management of all commercial
                  activity permits. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) Channel Islands
                  Harbor Station provides maritime safety, security, homeland security, and
                  preservation services in order to protect the public, environment, and
                  national economic interests in the nation’s ports, waterways, and coastal
                  areas.
                  Environmental Resource Management. The City of Oxnard currently
                  collects and disposes in excess of 203,000 tons of refuse annually
                  through the City-owned Del Norte Regional Recycling and Transfer
%                 Facility (MRF). In 2005, Oxnard exceeded the state-mandated diversion
!                 rate with a 67 percent diversion rate. The MRF accepts refuse from
%                 Oxnard and several other cities and areas in western Ventura County and
                  is capable of recycling 50 to 80 percent of the refuse. Refuse incapable of
                  being recycled is presently hauled to other landfill sites in Ventura County.
                  Approximately 80 percent of Oxnard’s non-recycled waste goes to the
                  Simi Valley landfill with the remaining 20 percent to the Toland Road
                  landfill. The Environmental Resources Division has a vision to develop a
                  material recovery facility next to the MRF that would expand its current
                  recycling capabilities. In addition, the City is in discussions with the
                  Ventura Regional Sanitation District to design and construct a conversion
                  technology capable of converting municipal solid waste into alternative
                  sources of energy.
                  The County of Ventura Countywide Integrated Waste Management Plan
                  estimates that approximately 12,609 tons of hazardous waste per year is
                  generated within the City of Oxnard. These Class I wastes are currently
                  exported from the county and taken to disposal, treatment, or recycling
                  facilities in other counties.
%                 Library. The Oxnard Public Library operates three facilities: the Main

                view corridors include local waterways, agricultural open space, beaches,
                and mountains, in addition to a variety of urban landscapes.
                    •    Local Waterways. The primary waterway in the Planning Area is
                         the Santa Clara River, which forms part of the northern boundary
                         of the City. Over 4,000 acres of high-quality riparian habitat are
                         present along the entire length of the river, whose large sediment
                         deposits contribute to Pacific Ocean beaches. Smaller waterways
                         and drainage channels traverse the Planning Area, providing
                         natural scenery and wildlife habitat.        Many of these local
                         waterways are visible from several view points along local
                         roadways.

          •    Agricultural Greenbelts. The Oxnard-Camarillo Greenbelt and
               the Oxnard-Ventura Greenbelt largely define the City’s north, east,
               and western boundaries. These areas are intended for long-term
               agricultural use and generally cannot convert to urban
               development without voter approval.
          •    Beaches and Coastline. Oxnard’s beaches and coastline are
               recognized as the City’s primary natural scenic resource, with two
               State beaches located within the Planning Area: McGrath State
               Beach and Mandalay Beach State Park. City, County, and State
               beaches provide views of the Pacific Ocean and the offshore
               Channel Islands on clear days. Other visual resources in the
               Coastal Zone include tall sand dunes near Mandalay Beach and
               the wetlands in the Ormond Beach area. In order to preserve the
               aesthetic quality of the Planning Area’s coastline, the City’s
               Coastal Land Use Plan guides development along the Coastal
               Zone.
      Cultural Resources. Two historic districts have been designated in the
      City in order to honor significant historic periods and persons of
      significance. These are:
          •    The Henry T. Oxnard National Historic District is a residential
               neighborhood located west of the central business and
               commercial center of Oxnard. The neighborhood is comprised of
               mainly Bungalow and Craftsman style homes along with
               Mediterranean/Spanish Revival styles.
          •    The Leonard Ranch Historic District consists of 3.45 acres of what
               remains of the original ranch building: the Ranch House, the Main
               Residence, and a Cook’s Cabin.
      Agriculture. The City of Oxnard lies in the Oxnard Plain, which contains
      some of the most fertile land in California. Agricultural areas are found in
      the northeastern and eastern edges of the City, and the northwestern
      portion of the Planning Area. About half of the Oxnard Planning Area is
      designated for agricultural use.
      Farming in Ventura County has always been a major contributor to the
    %
  %   nation’s food supply, as well as an important part of the rural lifestyle,
  %   which exists throughout much of the County. Agriculture also generates a
      substantial number of jobs ranging from crop production to processing,
      shipping and other related industries. Ventura County is recognized as
      one of the principal agricultural counties in the State, with gross revenues
      from the sales of agricultural commodities in the billions of dollars.
      Mineral Resources. Important mineral / sand / gravel deposits are
      primarily located along the Santa Clara River channel, along Route 101
      (Ventura Freeway) corridor and along the eastern edge of the City
      extending as far west as Oxnard Boulevard in several areas.

                  Seismic Hazards. The Planning Area is located within Seismic Risk Zone
                  4. Earthquakes occurring in Seismic Risk Zone 4 have the potential to
                  create the greatest impacts compared to other risk zones. Areas within
                  Seismic Zone 4 have a one in ten chance that an earthquake with an
                  active peak acceleration level of 0.04 g (4/100 the acceleration of gravity)
                  will occur within the next fifty years. Peak ground accelerations in the
                  Planning Area could range from 0.50 g to 0.80 g (California Geological
                  Survey, 1998). There are several active or potentially active faults that
                  affect the Planning Area. An active fault is one that has had surface
                  displacement within the last 11,000 years (Holocene period) and a
                  potentially active fault is one that has experienced surface displacement
                  during the last 2 million years (Quaternary period).
                  Military Bases. The City of Oxnard is located near Naval Base Ventura
                  County (NBVC), which is comprised of three facilities: 1) Naval Air Station
                  (NAS) Point Mugu, 2) Naval Construction Battalion (Port Hueneme), and
                  3) San Nicolas Island. Since the establishment of these facilities during
                  World War II, the City has served as the home community to the U.S.
                  Navy and their dependents stationed at the NBVC bases. Currently, there
                  are about 19,000 military, civilian, and contract personnel working or
                  stationed at NBVC. As a result, there are strong physical, economic, and
                  social ties between NBVC and the City of Oxnard.

  !"# Vision
             The Oxnard 2030 General Plan sets out a vision to guide future
             development in the City to the year 2030. This chapter, Sustainable
             Community, was added to better understand and address the cutting
             edge environmental and energy issues of climate change mitigation and
             adaptation, sea level rise, and energy conservation and generation
             (“green” buildings). This chapter also states the City’s commitment to
             supporting implementation of Senate Bill 375 (Sustainable Communities
             Strategy Bill), the State’s primary legislation related to local planning that
             implements Assembly Bill 32 (“California Global Warming Solutions Act”).
             Background information on these topics is included below as there is no
             corresponding chapter in the Background Report for this chapter.
             Oxnard faces both challenges and opportunities related to sustainable
             development as we work to fulfill a vision of responsibly living with Nature,
             rather than living off of Nature.
                 •    Our moderate climate reduces our need for energy for heating
                      and cooling. We should push ourselves to further reduce our
                      need for traditional carbon-based power and utilize renewable
                      local sources of energy when feasible.

                    •   Our local groundwater, water conservation practices, and
                        increasing reuse of wastewater should greatly reduce our reliance
                        on imported water.
                    •   Our relatively compact development pattern lends itself to a much
                        greater use of local transit, small electric or similar urban
                        vehicles, and bicycles.
                    •   Our flat terrain and predictable periods of rain favor a much
                        greater use of bicycles and walking, leading to better health as
                        well as reduced traffic congestion, energy consumption, and air
                        pollution.
                    •   Our agricultural economy suggests we may increasingly reduce
                        the carbon footprint of our food consumption by eating what we
                        grow locally, and growing what we eat locally.
                    •   Oxnard’s large industrial parks and industrial areas yet to be
                        developed is an opportunity to not only develop “green” industrial
                        parks but also create jobs in the green economy.
                Taken as a whole, Oxnard is uniquely poised to take a leading role in
                sustainable living and development. This chapter presents goals, policies,
                and an implementation program that bring leading edge and innovative
                sustainable topics into one place, leading to a coordinated approach to a
                healthy, humane, and harmonious way of life that respects and preserves
                the environment.
                The Sustainable Community chapter is related to the Environmental
                Resources chapter as they share some issues. The Sustainable
                Community chapter focuses on the ‘big picture’ of achieving a sustainable
                community. Its purpose is to explore, analyze, and promote new and
                innovative sustainable growth and energy practices that will help the City
                of Oxnard flourish today and well into the future. In contrast, Chapter 5 is
                more the “day-to-day” environmental activities of programs and polices
                largely already in place and being implemented by appropriate City
                departments.
                Furthermore, this chapter addresses intent and objectives outlined in
                recent state legislation and planning initiatives, such as the California
                Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32 and the follow-up SB 375)
                and “green building” practices. This section should be used in conjunction
                with the other chapters in formulating future land use decisions affecting
                the City.
                The Sustainable Community Chapter is organized under the following
                categories:
                    •   Background addresses current environmental circumstances
                        and state laws not included and/or updated since the Background

                     •   Goals and Policies direct the City in various ways to research,
                         evaluate, demonstrate, implement, and monitor various new and
                         more innovative ways to achieve a sustainable community.
  !"! Key Terms
                The following are key terms and their definitions:
                AB 32. The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, requires that by
                2020 the state's greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to 1990 levels, a
                roughly 25 percent reduction compared to business as usual estimates.
                Agrifiber. Any fibrous material generated from agricultural / bio-based
                products. Agrifiber may be used with binders to create bio-composite
                agriboard. Generally wood is not included in this definition.
                Average Dry Weather Flow. The Average Dry Weather Flow is the
                average non-storm flow over 24 hours during the dry months of the year
                (May through September). It is composed of the average sewage flow
                and the average dry weather inflow/infiltration.
                California Air Resources Board (CARB). The California Air Resources
                Board is the State's lead air quality agency consisting of an eleven-
                member board appointed by the Governor and several hundred
                employees. CARB is responsible for attainment and maintenance of
                the state and federal air quality standards, and is fully responsible for
                motor vehicle pollution control. It oversees county and regional air
                pollution management programs.
                California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 24. The California Code of
                Regulations, Title 24 is also known as the California Building Standards
                Code. This code dictates the building standards and design requirements
                for structures in California.
                Carbon Dioxide (CO2). Carbon Dioxide is a naturally occurring gas, and
                also a by-product of burning fossil fuels and biomass, as well as land-use
                changes and other industrial processes. It is the principal greenhouse gas
                that affects the Earth's radiative balance.
                Fossil Fuel. Fossil fuels are fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas; so-
                called because they are the remains of ancient plant and animal life.
                Fossil Fuel Combustion. Fossil fuel combustion is the burning of coal, oil
                (including gasoline), or natural gas. This burning, usually to generate
                energy, releases carbon dioxide, as well as combustion by-products that
                can include unburned hydrocarbons, methane, and carbon monoxide.

                Carbon monoxide, methane, and many of the unburned hydrocarbons
                slowly oxidize into carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Common sources of
                fossil fuel combustion include cars and electric utilities.
                Global Warming (Climate Change). Global warming is an overall
                increase in the temperature of the Earth's troposphere. Global warming
                has occurred in the past as a result of natural influences, but the term is
                most often used to refer to the warming predicted by computer models to
                occur as a result of increased emissions of greenhouse gases. The
                various models show that climate and weather patterns will change as the
                earth warms, resulting in more severe weather behavior in many areas.
                Green Building. A green building, also known as a sustainable building,
                is a structure that is designed, built, renovated, operated, or reused in an
                ecological and resource-efficient manner. Green buildings are designed
                to meet certain objectives such as protecting occupant health; improving
                employee productivity; using energy, water, and other resources more
                efficiently; and reducing the overall impact to the environment.
                Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG). Greenhouse gas emissions are the
                release of any gas that absorbs infrared radiation in the atmosphere.
                Generally, when referenced in terms of global climate, they are
                considered to be harmful. Greenhouse gases include, but are not limited
                to, water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide
                (N2O),        hydro      chlorofluorocarbons     (HCFCs),      ozone     (O3),
                hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur
                hexafluoride (SF6).
                Groundwater. Groundwater is water in the saturated zone beneath the
                land surface.
                Megawatts. Megawatts are a unit of power equal to one million watts. A
                watt is a unit used to measure power, equal to one joule per second. In
                electricity, a watt is equal to current (in amperes) multiplied by voltage (in
                volts).
                Mixed-Use Development. Mixed-use development incorporates a range
                and variety of uses within a single development site, for example, retail,
                residential and business.
                Permeable Surface. A permeable surface is a surface that allows water
                to infiltrate into the ground instead of blocking it and causing runoff.
                Power Plant. A power plant is a generating facility that produces energy.
                Publicly Owned Utilities. Publicly Owned Utilities are utility services and
                companies that are owned by customers and better cater to needs and
                satisfaction of customers than Investor Owned Utilities. Publicly Owned
                Utilities provide approximately 25 percent of California’s electricity.

                      SB 375. The Sustainable Communities Strategy Bill, passed in 2008,
                      builds on AB 32 and the regional “blueprint plan” developed in the
                      Sacramento region. The bill’s core provision is a requirement for regions
                      and cities to develop a “Sustainable Communities Strategy” in order to
                      reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks.
                      Sustainability. Sustainability refers to development that meets the needs
                      of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to
                      meet their own needs.
                      Tidal Power. Tidal power is a renewable energy source that uses water
                      and ocean tides to generate electricity.
                      Urea Formaldehyde. Urea formaldehyde is a transparent thermosetting
                      resin or plastic used as an adhesive for wood products and other building

                      humans, ranging from difficulty breathing to cancer.
                      Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Volatile Organic Compounds are
                      carbon-containing compounds that evaporate into the air (with a few
                      exceptions). VOCs contribute to the formation of smog and / or may
                      themselves be toxic. VOCs often have an odor, and some examples
                      include gasoline, alcohol, and the solvents used in paints.
  !"# Existing Conditions
                      GLOBAL WARMING / CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION
                      Global warming and the resulting climate change have occurred many
                      times throughout the course of Earth’s existence caused naturally or, as is
                      the current argument, by human “anthropomorphic” actions. Global
                      warming is occurring to some degree regardless of the natural and/or
                      human cause and must be considered in long range planning.
                      Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions refer to
                      a group of emissions that are generally believed to affect global climate
                      conditions. Of all the GHG emissions, CO2 is the most abundant climate
                      change pollutant. CO2 resulting from fossil fuel combustion comprised
                      81.0 percent of the total GHG emissions in California in 2002, and non-
                      fossil fuel combustion CO2 comprised 2.3 percent.             California is
                      considered the second largest emitter of GHG in the United States next to
                      Texas. California generates about half as much in CO2 emissions as
                      Texas. However, when considered at the individual’s level, California is
                      second lowest per capita CO2 emitter in the nation; only the District of
                      Columbia’s per capita emissions are lower.
                      The State of California has adopted several GHG laws, regulations, and
                      policies. For example, State Law mandates development and adoption of
                      regulations to achieve the maximum feasible reduction of GHG emitted
                      from vehicular and other mobile sources to accomplish the attainment of

                emission standard on private electric utilities (SB 1368). The California Air
                Resources Board (CARB) is required to adopt regulations for the reporting
                and verification of statewide GHG emissions and to enforce compliance
                with a GHG emissions limit equivalent to 1990 levels (AB 32).
                Sea Level Rise. The National Research Council (NRC, 2012) projects
                that by 2100, sea level in California may rise 17-66 inches (42 to 167 cm)
                for areas south of Cape Mendocino. The actual amount of land lost to a
                rising sea level varies based on geography, since the land mass itself may
                be changing its relative elevation. The effects of rising sea level and
                warmer water include loss of beachfront, larger and more powerful
                coastal waves, relocation and/or migration of wildlife, and possible loss
                and/or damage of waterfront properties, including docks and piers.

                ENERGY EFFICIENCY
                The California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 24, also known as the
                California Building Standards Code, is a compilation of three types of
                building standards from three different origins:
                     •   Building standards that have been adopted by State agencies
                         without change from building standards contained in national
                         codes.
                     •   Building standards that have been adopted and adapted from the
                         national model code standards to meet California conditions.
                     •   Building standards, authorized by the California Legislature, that
                         constitute extensive additions not covered by the model codes
                         that have been adopted to address particular California concerns.

                Most buildings can reach energy efficiency levels far beyond California
                Title 24 standards, yet many meet only the standard. Energy demands
                can be greatly reduced through encouraging the use of green building
                design, including materials, equipment, lighting, alternative energy
                sources, and structure maintenance. The building design should also
                consider building shape and site orientation to take advantage of solar
                power and natural lighting to boost energy-efficient heating and cooling
                systems.
                By using and encouraging alternative forms of energy and energy usage,
                the community can be an active participant in the reduction of GHG
                emissions that contribute to global warming.
                POWER GENERATION
                A large source of GHG emissions is electricity generation. A shift from
                conventional power generation methods, such as fossil fuel power plants,
                would have a positive impact on sustainability. Governor Brown signed a
                bill (SBX1-2) in April 2011 that sets a renewable source goal of 33 percent
                by 2020. Publicly Owned Utilities (POU) are offering incentive programs
                to their customers to install solar panels.
                HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE BY DRIVING LESS
                Another large source of CO2 emissions comes from gasoline-powered
                automobiles. There are many ways to move to a more sustainable
                automotive community, since we are likely to be relatively dependent on
                automobiles for the near future. The first step is to emphasize pedestrian-
                friendly environments. Many cities around the country have already
                adopted this type of development by designating pedestrian
                thoroughfares, wider sidewalks, and mixed-use development that allows
                people to walk to and from destinations. Similarly, another idea is to
                promote bicycle use. This can be done similarly to the pedestrian zones,
                and if executed properly will encourage bicycle usage and decrease auto
                dependency. Educational materials can also be prepared and distributed
                about the benefits of biking and walking, as well as the effect of cleaner air
                as a result.
                OCCUPANT HEALTH AND SAFETY
                Recent studies have revealed that buildings with good overall
                environmental quality can reduce the rate of respiratory disease, allergy,
                asthma, and sick building symptoms; and enhance worker performance.
                The potential financial benefits of improving indoor environments have
                been proven to exceed costs by a significant factor. Providing adequate
                ventilation and a high-efficiency, in-duct filtration system ensures a
                dramatic and positive impact on indoor air quality. Air contaminant
                sources can be greatly minimized by the use of green building materials
                that feature low solvent adhesives and caulking, composite wood with no
                urea formaldehyde, and agrifiber products. Paints, stains and finishes
                containing lower levels of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC’s) also
                improve indoor air quality for building occupants and should be utilized.

  Volatile Organic Compounds are chemicals that out-gas to form smog and
  pollute the indoor air.
  MATERIALS EFFICIENCY
  Materials efficiency is a hallmark of sustainable development. The reuse
  of existing buildings and building materials conserves land and limited
  natural resources. The reuse and recycling of construction and demolition
  materials reduces construction costs while keeping additional materials
  out of landfills. Some common materials that can be reused for new
  construction products include concrete, asphalt, and steel. Also, the use of
  recycled-content products helps develop markets for recycled materials
  that are being diverted from California’s landfills.
  WATER EFFICIENCY
  Water quantity, quality, availability, and wastewater treatment for current
  and future development are addressed in Chapter 5. The Groundwater
  Recovery Enhancement and Treatment (GREAT) program recycles
  wastewater for irrigation and industrial use that then frees up existing
  potable water for long term reliable water supply.              The Oxnard
  Wastewater Treatment Plant is capable of treating 39.6 million gallons per
  day (mgd) Average Dry Weather Flow and 75.4 mgd Peak Wet Weather
  Flow. The newly completed adjacent Advanced Water Purification Facility
  will further treat 6.25 mgd to replace potable water use and/or inject into
  the aquifer to create withdrawal credits. These facilities service the cities
  of Oxnard and Port Hueneme, the Naval Base Ventura County, and
  several unincorporated areas.
  Another water conservation-related method is the use of permeable
  surfaces whenever possible for paved areas required with development.
  In addition to helping maintain underground water resources, permeable
  surfaces help to naturally filter storm water, and reduce run-off to catch
  basins and flood channels. Encouraging the use of green building
  standards, recycled water, and permeable paving materials within
  residential, commercial and industrial project designs would aid
  immensely in increasing the reliability of Oxnard’s water supply.
  LANDSCAPING EFFICIENCY
  Trees and other non-woody vegetation are a natural air filtering system,
  which clean the air by filtering pollutants and producing oxygen. Strategic
  planting and conscientious stewardship of the existing tree cover allows
  for natural absorption of precipitation, and prevents rain from washing oil,
  auto coolant, pesticides and other chemicals into storm drains, wetlands,
  and the Pacific Ocean. Proactive planting and maintenance of trees
  lowers energy cost by providing shade and cooling the air, vehicles and
  structures. Open space and landscaping required by the City Code for
  public and private facilities is intended to create functional and hospitable
  settings for the building occupants. Green infrastructure is a public asset
  that must be strategically planned, encouraged and maintained by the City
  and its citizens.

                          Landscaping efficiency is also directly related to water efficiency when
                          certain types of plants and trees are selected and landscapes are
                          designed with Oxnard’s climate and water supply in mind. Oxnard’s mild
                          Mediterranean climate allows for a large variety of plants and trees to
                          grow, and choosing water efficient varieties that do not require large
                          amounts of water will further add to City’s sustainability. In southern
                          California, 40 to 60 percent of residential water use is applied outdoors to
                          irrigate landscapes. Without proper design and maintenance, landscape
                          irrigation is notoriously inefficient, wasting up to 30 percent of all water
                          applied. Fortunately, there are many new technologies and techniques
                          available to greatly increase irrigation efficiency, providing an opportunity
                          to reduce water consumption, protect the reliability of the City’s water
                          supply, and, in turn, increase overall sustainability.
                          PROJECT DESIGN EFFICIENCY
                          Of the total expenditures an owner will make over the course of the
                          building’s service lifetime, design and construction expenditures, the so-
                          called “first costs” of a facility, will account for 5-10 percent of the total life-
                          cycle cost of the structure. In contrast, operations and maintenance costs
                          will account for 60-80 percent of the total life-cycle costs, with land
                          acquisition, conceptual planning, renewal or revitalization, and disposal
                          accounting for the remaining 5-35 percent.
                          Key elements of design pertaining to green building are performance
                          standards, cost issues, materials selection, and building placement.
                          Through implementation of the Improvement Measures noted below, the
                          City intends to actively inform, encourage and guide the use of green
                          building standards in remodeling and designing new and existing
                          developments and public facilities within the city.
                          SOLID WASTE
                          Solid waste management, waste prevention, and recycling services goals
                          and policies are addressed in Chapter 5. The City utilizes a Three Cart
                          System for household solid waste. Every single-family residential
                          household is allocated a recycling bin, a refuse bin, and a yard waste bin.
                          Certain hazardous waste materials, such as paints and electronics, are
                          prohibited from being placed in refuse carts and must be picked up
                          separately by appointment or taken to designated drop-off locations. This
                          new Three Cart System replaces the previous split carts with individual
                          refuse and recycling bins. The former program also included a separate
                          yard waste bin. The new system is geared to better promote recycling to
                          encourage sustainability.

   Vision
             The Oxnard 2030 General Plan sets out a vision to guide future
             development in the City. The 2002 visioning program includes community
             development concerns and direction that are incorporated in this chapter,
             taking into account the 2006 Background Report which presents a
             detailed description of community development topics (land use, design,
             growth management, and economic development). Implementation and
             determination of internal consistency with the remainder of the general
             plan is presented in Chapter 9.
             Oxnard’s existing land use patterns reflect the City’s unique coastal
             location and agricultural history. With the exception of several high rise
             buildings in north Oxnard, the City is characterized by one or two story
             buildings, low and medium density residential, and several industrial areas
             surrounded by agricultural land, the Pacific Ocean, and the Santa Clara
             River. Most of the City’s higher intensity development lies along Highway
             101 and primary arterials.
             Beginning in 1995, residents within Ventura County began enacting
             initiatives that generally require voter approval for expansive outward
             growth with the goal of preserving agricultural and open space resources.
             Oxnard adopted the Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources
             (SOAR) Ordinance on November 3, 1998 that created a City Urban
             Restriction Boundary (CURB) around the City until December 31, 2020.

                Several large undeveloped areas were left within the Oxnard CURB that
                either have developed or are likely to fully develop by 2030. Once these
                within-CURB areas are developed, additional development would have to
                be largely redevelopment within the CURB or by amending and expanding
                the CURB with voter approval.
                Proposed land use changes and related regulations that directly or
                indirectly affect properties and/or activities in the Oxnard Coastal Zone
                may be subject to the Local Coastal Program (LCP) and may not be
                effective until certified by the California Coastal Commission.
                The 2030 General Plan has four major themes: 1) development within the
                CURB anticipated by the 2020 General Plan, 2) development or
                reinvestment within CURB with an “urban village” concept, 3) transition of
                the area south of the Oxnard Transit Center from industrial to mixed use
                (Downtown East Transit Oriented District), if feasibility studies support the
                concept, and 4) participation in the restoration of the Ormond Beach
                wetlands. The urban villages would incorporate private and public
                redevelopment, mixed land uses, affordable and workforce housing, and
                transit connectivity and are intended to be a key strategy for meeting GHG
                emission reduction targets and implementing the Southern California
                Association of Governments regional Sustainable Community Strategy
                (SB 375). The Urban Village theme replaces the 2020 General Plan Infill
                Area and Major Study Areas approach.
                This chapter replaces and augments the Growth Management, Land Use,
                Economic Development, and Community Design elements of the 2020
                General Plan.

         Key Terms
                      The following are key terms used in this chapter:
                      Downtown East Transit Oriented District (DETOD). An approximately
                      100-acre area generally bordered by Oxnard Boulevard, the Oxnard
                      Transit Center and Fifth Street, Richmond Avenue, and Wooley Road.
                      Floor Area Ratio (FAR). A floor area ratio is often used to describe the
                      intensity of commercial, office, and industrial land usage. The FAR is a
                      ratio created by dividing the total gross square footage of the building by
                      the net square footage of the lot. FAR is a macro-level tool used to
                      estimate traffic generation and municipal service demand and is not
                      intended to be used as a strict development standard.
                      Gross Acreage. The total area of a development site expressed in acres,
                      usually including the area to be devoted to streets.
                      Net Acreage. The gross area less the area required for roadway or other
                      dedication to public use.
                      Height Overlay District. A designation in additional to other land use
                      classifications with supplemental regulations that may modify the
                      underlying designation and/ or introduce additional height regulations.
                      Live/Work. A residential unit, part of which may be used as an accessory
                      commercial use by the occupant.
                      Local Coastal Program (LCP). Two documents, Coastal Land Use Plan
                      and Coastal Zoning (Chapter 17 of the City Code), apply in selected
                      regulatory areas in the Coastal Zone and are subject to the Coastal Act
                      and certification and review by the Coastal Commission.
                      Mixed Use. Mixed-use development incorporates a range and variety of
                      uses within a single development site, for example, retail, residential and
                      business.
                      SOAR. Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources (SOAR). An
                      uncodified ordinance adopted November 3, 1998 that created a City
                      Urban Restriction Boundary (CURB) around the City until December 31,
                      2020.
                      Urban Village. A mix of transit and pedestrian oriented residential,
                      commercial, and/or other uses, with a sense of place and identity.
                      Work/Live. A commercial or industrial use that includes a small apartment
                      for optional residential use by the business owner or employee.
                      Zoning. Zoning is the division of a jurisdiction into districts (zones) within
                      which permissible uses are prescribed and development standards are
                      defined. Zoning is the principal tool for implementing the goals and
                      policies of the general plan by translating land use categories and
                      standards into regulations.

   Land Use Map
                            The 2030 Land Use Map (Figure 3-1) classifies and displays envisioned
                            community land uses and intensity. The 2030 Land Use Map depicts the
                            CURB line established by the 1998 SOAR ordinance. Proposed land use
                            changes within the Coastal Zone are not effective until an updated LCP is
                            certified by the California Coastal Commission.
   City Urban Restriction Boundary
                            In 1998, the voters of the City of Oxnard adopted the SOAR (Save Open
                            Space and Agricultural Resources) initiative establishing the City Urban
                            Restriction Boundary (CURB) and re-designating as “Agriculture (AG)” all
                            land previously designated “Agricultural Planning Reserve (AG/PR).” The
                            CURB defines the urban development boundary for the City of Oxnard
                            until December 31, 2020. The SOAR initiative also established a City
                            Buffer Boundary (CBB) which lies outside of the CURB line and is
                            coterminous with the Oxnard Area of Interest. Change to the CURB line or
                            an agricultural land use designation within the CBB generally requires
                            majority approval of Oxnard voters, with certain exceptions, including but
                            not limited to an exception to allow up to 20 acres per year to be brought
                            into the CURB for affordable housing needed to meet the City’s Regional
                            Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) target production.
                            This Oxnard 2030 General Plan expressly preserves these SOAR

                  D. OXNARD CITY URBAN RESTRICTION
                  BOUNDARY
                  Introduction
                  The voters of the City of Oxnard have, through the initiative process,
                  established and adopted an urban growth boundary line denominated
                  the Oxnard City Urban Restriction Boundary (CURB) as an
                  amendment to the Oxnard 2020 General Plan. Its purpose,
                  principals, implementation procedures, and methodologies for
                  amendment are set forth in this this subsection of Chapter IVSection
                  3.4 of this Oxnard 2030 General Plan.
                  1. PURPOSE
                   The City of Oxnard and surrounding area, with its unique
                   combination of soils, micro-climate and hydrology, has become one
                   of the finest growing regions in the world. Agricultural production
                   from the County of Ventura and in particular production from the soils
                   and silt from the Santa Clara River, Calleguas Creek, Conejo Creek
                   and Revolon/Beardsley Wash, and alluvial plains adjacent to the City
                   provides beneficial food and fiber to local inhabitants and to the
                   world at large and has achieved international acclaim, enhancing
                   the City's economy and reputation.
                   The purpose of this CURB is was and remains to ensure that the
                   development policies, and underlying goals, objectives, principles
                   and policies set forth in the Oxnard 2020 General Plan relating to
                   Growth Management (Chapter IV), Land Use (Chapter V) and Open
                   Space and Conservation (Chapter VII) are inviolable against
                   transitory short-term political decisions and that agricultural,
                   watershed and open space lands are not prematurely or
                   unnecessarily converted to other non-agricultural or non-open space
                   uses without public debate and a vote of the people.
                  2. PRINCIPLES
                   Continued urban encroachment into agricultural and watershed
                   areas will impair agriculture and threaten the public health,
                   safety and welfare by causing increased traffic congestion,
                   associated air pollution, and potentially serious water problems,
                   such as pollution, depletion, and sedimentation of available
                   water resources. Such urban encroachment would eventually
                   result in both the unnecessary, expensive extension of public
                   services and facilities and inevitable conflicts between urban
                   and open space/agricultural uses.

  The unique character of the City of Oxnard and quality of life of
  City residents depend on the protection of a substantial amount
  of open space, natural resource and agricultural lands. The
  protection of such lands not only ensures the continued viability
  of agriculture, but also contributes to flood control and the
  protection of wildlife, environmentally sensitive areas, and
  irreplaceable natural resources. As importantly, adopting a
  CURB will promote the formation and continuation of a cohesive
  community by defining the boundaries and by helping to prevent
  urban sprawl. Such a CURB will promote efficient municipal
  services and facilities by confining urban development to
  defined development areas.
  3. IMPLEMENTATION
      a.) The City of Oxnard hereby establishes and adopts a
      CURB. The CURB is established generally coterminous with
      and in the same location as the Sphere of Influence line
      established by the Local Agency Formation Commission as
      it existed as of January 1, 1998 except (1) that certain
      property of approximately 247 acres at the northwest corner
      of the City bounded on the South by Gonzales on the west
      by Victoria, adjacent to the Northwest Community, and (2)
      that certain property of approximately 79 acres of the west
      edge of the City bounded by the South by 5th Street on the
      west by Harbor Avenue, and generally southwesterly of the
      Edison Canal, generally referred to as "North Shore" and
      and (3) that certain property of approximately 41 acres
      located within the City limits west of Victoria Avenue at the
      northwest corner of 5th Street directly west of the Oxnard
      Airport are additionally encompassed with the CURB. The
      Sphere of Influence line and the CURB line are illustrated in
      Figure 3-2 IV-4, Exhibit "A" and the parcels outside of the
      Sphere of Influence line but within the CURB line described
      herein are shaded for illustration purposes on said Figure IV-
      4, Exhibit "A". Figure III-1 inaccurately reflects the current
      location of the LAFCO Sphere of Influence line. While it is
      not the purpose of this General Plan Amendment to correct
      such errors, the Sphere of Influence references on said map
      are noted to be in error.
  b.) Until December 31, 2020, the City of Oxnard shall restrict
      urban services (except temporary mutual assistance with
      other jurisdictions) and urbanized uses of land to within the
      CURB, except as provided herein. Other than for the
      exceptions provided herein, upon the effective date of this
      Oxnard 2030 General Plan amendment, the City and its
      departments, boards, commissions, officers and employees
      shall not grant, or by inaction allow to be approved by
      operation of law, any general plan amendment, rezoning,
      specific plan, subdivision map, special use permit, building
      permit or any other ministerial or discretionary entitlement
      which is inconsistent with the purposes of this Oxnard 2030
      General Planamendment, unless in accordance with the
      amendment procedures of the SOAR Ordinance. this
      General Plan amendmentSection 3.4 herein.


                c.)  "Urbanized uses of land" shall mean any development which
                     would require the establishment of new city sewer systems
                     or the significant expansion of existing city sewer
                     infrastructure; or would create residential lots less than 10
                     acres in area per primary residence; or would result in the
                     establishment of commercial or industrial uses which are
                     neither exclusively related to agriculture nor exclusively
                     related to the production of mineral resources.
                d.) Until December 31, 2020, all land designated as "Agriculture
                     Planning Reserve (AG/PR)" is hereby re-designated as
                     "Agriculture (AG)", as shown on Figure 3-2, V-5 (amended),
                     Exhibit "B", must not be re-designated unless in accordance
                     with the amendment procedures of this Section 3.4 herein.
                4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS
                 SOAR Ordinance conforming amendments to the 2020 General
                 Plan have been incorporated into relevant provisions of this 2030
                 General Plan.
                 5. CITY BUFFER BOUNDARY (CBB)
                The CBB is established outside the CURB and within the
                Oxnard Planning Area, as shown on Exhibit I Figure 3-3. The
                 CURB may be amended to include land within the CBB as
                 provided in this ordinance. Until December 31, 2020, th City of
                 Oxnard shall not change the designation of land within the CBB
                 that is designated “Agriculture” in the 202030 General Plan,
                 unless the change is approved by the voters of the City of
                 Oxnard pursuant to Article 1, Chapter 2 of Division 9 of the
                 Elections Code, or as set forth below:
                1. The City Council may change the designation of land that is
                 placed within the CURB.
                2. The City Council, following at least one public hearing for
                 presentations by an applicant and the public, and after
                 compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, may
                 redesignate land within the CBB if the City Council makes each
                 of the following findings:
                       a. Failure to change the designation of a specific parcel
                       of land would constitute an unconstitutional taking of a
                       landowner’s property for which compensation would be
                       required, and
                       b. The redesignation will allow new land uses only to the
                       minimum extent necessary to avoid an unconstitutional
                       taking of the landowner’s property.

  6. EXEMPTIONS
      The provisions of this ordinance otherwise requiring a vote of

                 Until December 31, 2020, the foregoing Purposes, Principles and
                 Implementation provisions may be amended only by a vote of the
                 people commenced pursuant to Article I of Chapter 3 of Division 9
                 of the Elections Code, or pursuant to the procedures set forth
                 below:
                     1. The City Council may amend the CURB described herein if
                        it deems it to be in the public interest, provided that the
                        amended boundary is within the limits of the CURB.
                     2. The City Council, following at least one public hearing for
                        presentations by an applicant and the public, and after
                        compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act,
                        may amend the CURB to comply with state law regarding
                        the provision of housing for all economic segments of the
                        community. For that purpose the City Council may amend
                        the CURB as described herein on Figure 3-2and as
                        designated on Figure IV-4, Exhibit "A", in order to include
                        lands to be designated for residential uses, provided that no
                        more than 20 acres of land may be brought within the CURB
                        for this purpose in any calendar year. Such amendment
                        may be adopted only if the City Council makes each of the
                        following findings:
                        a) The land is immediately adjacent to existing compatibly
                            developed areas and the applicant for the inclusion of
                            land within the CURB has provided to the City evidence
                            that the Fire Department, Police Department,
                            Department of Public Works, the Community Services
                            Department, applicable water and sewer districts, and
                            the school districts with jurisdiction over such land have
                            or will provide adequate capacity to accommodate the
                            proposed development and provide it with adequate
                            public services; and
                        b) That the proposed development will address the highest
                            priority need identified in the analysis by which the City
                            has determined it is not in compliance with state law,
                            i.e., low and very low income housing; and
                        c) That there is no existing residentially designated land
                            available within the CURB to accommodate the
                            proposed development; and
                        d) That it is not reasonably feasible to accommodate the
                            proposed development by redesignating land within the
                            CURB.
                     3. The City Council, following at least one public hearing for
                        presentations by an applicant and the public, and after
                        compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act,
                        may amend the CURB, if the City Council makes each of
                        the following findings:
                        a) The land proposed for inclusion within the CURB is
                            immediately adjacent to areas developed in a manner
                            comparable to the proposed use;

     b) Adequate public services and facilities are available and
        have the capacity and capability to accommodate the
        proposed use;
     c) The proposed use will not have direct, indirect, or
        cumulative adverse significant impacts on the area's
        agricultural viability, habitat, scenic resources or
        watershed;
     d) The proposed use will not adversely affect the stability
        of land use patterns in the area (i.e., the land affected
        will not introduce or facilitate a use that is incompatible
        with adjoining or nearby uses);
     e) The land proposed for inclusion within the CURB has
        not been used for agricultural purposes in the
        immediately preceding two years and is unusable for
        agriculture due to its topography, drainage, flooding,
        adverse soil conditions, inaccessibility to appropriate
        water or other physical reason;
     f) The land proposed for inclusion within the CURB does
        not exceed 40 acres for any one landowner in any
        calendar year, and one landowner's property may not
        similarly be removed from the restrictions contemplated
        by this Section 3.4 of the Oxnard 2030 General Plan
        amendment more often than every other year.
        Landowners with any unity of interest are considered
        one landowner for purposes of this limitation; and
     g) Including the land within the CURB will not result in
        more than 160 acres being added to the CURB in any
        calendar year.
  4. The City Council, following at least one public hearing for
     presentations by an applicant and the public, and after
     compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act,
     may amend the CURB if the City Council makes each of
     the following findings:
     a) Application of the provisions of subsections 1, 2, or 3
         of these amendment procedures are unworkable as
         applied to a specific parcel and failure to amend the
         CURB would constitute an unconstitutional taking of a
         landowner's property for which compensation would be
         required; and
     b) The amendment and associated land use designations
         will allow new land uses only to the minimum extent
         necessary to avoid an unconstitutional taking of the
         landowner's property.
  5. The City Council, following at least one public hearing for
     presentations by an applicant and the public, and after
     compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act,
     may place any amendment to the CURB or the provisions
     of this initiative Section 3.4 on the ballot in the manner
     provided by state law.
  6. The City Council may amend the CURB to include land
     contemplated for construction of public potable water
     facilities, public schools, public parks or other government
     facilities, or to include any development project that has

                          designations (Government Code 65302[a]). The 2030 General Plan
                          establishes new land use designations as follows:

      • Reinvestment in the existing community
      • Mixture of land uses
      • Mix of residential densities and housing types
      • Providing a minimum of 15 percent affordable housing
      • Location along or near corridors, downtown, and transit nodes
      • Transit, pedestrian, and bicycle circulation given high priority
  1. CHANNEL ISLANDS HARBOR MARINA VILLAGE
      • Location. South of Channel Islands Boulevard along Victoria
        Avenue.
      • Land Use. Visitor serving commercial and medium/high density
        mixed use residential.
      • Overview. Building on the area’s existing assets, this urban
        village is intended as a “seaside” village capitalizing on the harbor
        assets, including the visitor serving uses such as restaurants,
        retail and other activities centered on the harbor.
    2. DOWNTOWN EAST TRANSIT ORIENTED DISTRICT (DETOD)
      •  Location. Area bounded by the Oxnard Transit Center, Oxnard
        Boulevard, Fifth Street, Wooley Road and Richmond Avenue.
      • Land Use. Transit-oriented medium to high density residential;
        Central Business District uses; offices; open space; possible
        school.
      • Overview. Planned in cooperation with property owners and
        businesses and if found feasible by expert review, the DETOD
        could evolve into an expansion of the CBD to take advantage of
        the transportation opportunities provided by its proximity to the
        Oxnard Transit Center, meeting SCAG objectives for the
        development of transit-oriented development, and phase out
        older industrial uses that would then reduce truck traffic in and
        near the CBD. Residential development will be encouraged at
        sufficient densities to provide feasibility for transit services and
        private redevelopment. Both horizontal and vertical mixed use
        development is encouraged. Existing affordable housing and
        designated historic structures would remain with possible
        adaptive reuse. The existing mobile home park could possibly be
        relocated and/or closed with appropriate compensation and
        relocation for all residents. Until and unless the DETOD is found
        to be financially feasible and the City Council adopts a DETOD
        specific plan, existing uses are considered conforming uses,
        current zoning would remain, and uses may expand and reinvest.
        A Meta District Plan may be adopted within the DETOD that
        would be incorporated into a subsequent DETOD specific plan.

                      with neighborhood commercial and other supporting uses. As a
                      gateway entrance to the City, this urban village has a unique
                      opportunity to define not only its own identity, but the City as a
                      whole. As a gateway, consideration should be given to ensuring
                      distinctive design features, especially along Highway 1, are
                      incorporated into the overall design theme.

                      creating entry component facing Ventura Road. A central focus of
                      this development will be in the provision of balanced community
                      with jobs, school, recreation, shopping, and affordable and

                      undeveloped area within the City limits and represents an
                      opportunity to provide remaining public uses needed for the
                      Northeast Community along with an urban village. This area is
                      within the Northeast Community Specific Plan (NECSP) which
                      could be amended instead of creating a new specific plan. For
                      purposes of annexation, the NECSP land use designations for
                      this area as of July 2011 are deemed consistent with this 2030
                      General Plan.

                        WATER: Potable water is provided to Nyeland Acre’s approximately
                        1,100 residents and 300 connections by the Nyeland Acres Mutual Water
                        Company (NAMWC) which draws about 60 acre feet per year from two
                        wells. Water quality generally meets State standards. In 2011, NAMWC
                        completed installation individual flow meters, promoted conservation, and
                        adopted tiered rates. Additional facility improvements are being planned
                        to increase storage and fireflow pressure.
                        WASTEWATER: Public sewer service is provided by Nyeland Acres
                        County Service Area #30. Trunk lines and laterals are generally in
                        acceptable condition and capacity is adequate for current and anticipated
                        development given the County low-density residential zoning and existing
                        development. There are no septic systems.
                        FLOOD CONTROL: There are no storm drains. Minor street flooding
                        occurs during periods of heavy rain. Rain is generally retained within the
                        relatively large lots with more open ground than typical urban areas.
                        FIRE PROTECTION: The current water system serving the subject

                        the Ventura County Fire Department (VCFD). The NAMWC is planning
                        storage and pressure improvements to meet VCFD requirements. The
                        City of Oxnard has a water line in Ventura Boulevard immediately
                        between Rice Avenue and Almond Drive with hydrants that is available

                        sidewalks, water, and wastewater lines into compliance with City Public

                        assumptions that:
                            •  There are 3.5 miles of streets within and adjoining Nyeland Acres.
                            •  All streets require new curbs, gutters, and sidewalks.
                            •  All streets need to be repaved, but not rebuilt.
                            •  All street and trunk water and wastewater lines need to be replaced.
                            •  Individual parcel water and wastewater laterals are not included.
                            •  The NAMWC will connect to the Oxnard water system to provide
                                    emergency pressure and water supply.
                            • The City could provide wastewater treatment, if needed.
                        The following are estimates using 2016 estimates per linear foot:
                                $ 925,260 curbs and gutters ($50.24 per linear foot)
                                $ 925,260 sidewalks ($50.24 per linear foot, 5 feet wide)
                                $ 2,652,048 street paving ($144.00 per linear foot, 35 ft wide)
                                $ 2,210,040 replacement potable water lines ($120.00 per linear
                                foot)
                                $ 2,578,380 replacement wastewater lines ($140.00 per linear
                                foot)
                                $ 9,290,988 TOTAL
                        The total estimated cost of $9.3 million would be funded by a combination
                        of grants and by forming a Nyeland Acres Community Facility District
                        (CFD) that would amortize the costs not covered by grants over a long-
                        term bond paid by an assessment on landowners.

  !"# Vision
              The 2030 General Plan sets out a vision to guide future development in
              the City.      The 2002 visioning program includes infrastructure and
              community services concerns and direction that are incorporated in this
              chapter, taking into account the 2006 Background Report which presents
              a detailed description of infrastructure and community services topics
              (circulation, public works, police and fire protection, libraries, schools,
              and related uses).        Implementation and determination of internal
              consistency with the remainder of the general plan is presented in
              Chapter 9.
              The City of Oxnard is implementing progressive projects and programs
              that ensure infrastructure and community services keep pace with the
              public’s needs and quality expectations.
              Oxnard is a full-service city, providing water, wastewater, and solid waste
              disposal services. Natural gas, electricity, transit, and communications
              are provided by utility companies, and Ventura County operates the
              Oxnard Airport. Oxnard maintains its own Police and Fire Departments.
              The City owns and operates parks and several specialized residential
              facilities and maintains miles of medians, waterways, and other areas.
              The single largest infrastructure is the public streets and arterial network.

                      One challenge is to continue to gain more control and assurance over the
                      present and future supply of water, both for human and industrial uses.
                      The Groundwater Recovery Enhancement and Treatment (GREAT)
                      Program is the City of Oxnard's adopted and active long-range water
                      supply strategy to combine wastewater recycling, groundwater injection,
                      and groundwater desalination to make more efficient use of existing local
                      water resources to meet projected water supply needs of the City. This
                      program is under construction and represents a major investment and
                      move towards sustainable development (also see Chapter 5).
                      The Del Norte Regional Recycling & Transfer Station (Del Norte) is a
                      $25 million regional transfer station and materials recovery facility that is
                      owned by the City of Oxnard and operated by contract. In August 1996,
                      Del Norte opened its doors when the Bailard landfill closed. The facility
                      was developed in order to support the solid waste reduction and disposal
                      needs of the community and has exceeded the AB939 mandate of
                      diverting solid wastes from landfills.
                      The Police and Fire Departments continue to improve their service,
                      expertise, equipment and facilities while fostering increased community
                      outreach.      The City has two state-of-the-art emergency operations
                      centers (EOC) and city personnel are regularly receiving EOC training
                      and drills.
                      Many of Oxnard’s streets have been recently repaved. The City Council
                      has adopted a Traffic Mitigation Plan that includes an Intelligent
                      Transportation System (ITS) that connects most signals to a central

  !"# Vision
             The Oxnard 2030 General Plan sets out a vision to guide future
             development in the City.        The 2002 visioning program included
             environmental resources concerns and direction that are incorporated in
             this chapter, taking into account the 2006 Background Report which
             presents a detailed description of environmental resource topics
             (agriculture, biology, hydrology, and so on).        Implementation and
             determination of consistency with the remainder of the general plan is
             presented in Chapter 9.
             The vision for the Environmental Resources Chapter is that the City
             increases its responsible stewardship of the environment in full
             compliance with state and Federal laws, and strives to exceed in a
             position of leadership in these areas. The Environmental Resources
             chapter is closely related to Chapter 2, Sustainable Community, as both
             chapters address primarily environmental issues. This chapter contains
             well-established goals and policies that have long been required by State
             law and routinely included in general plans such as preventing oil spills
             and regulating underground storage tanks. In contrast, Chapter 2
             includes new goals and policies related to climate change and developing
             mitigations to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to sea level rise and

                      chapters should be used in tandem when reviewing environmental issues.
                      This chapter replaces and augments the Open Space and Conservation
                      chapter of the 2020 General Plan.
 !"#        Key Terms
                      The following are key terms used in this chapter:
                      Aquifer. An aquifer is an underground layer of permeable rock, sand, or
                      gravel that contains water, and is sometimes referred to as a water table.
                      Groundwater Basin. A groundwater basin is an area underlain by
                      permeable materials capable of furnishing a significant supply of
                      groundwater to wells or storing a significant amount of water.
                      Overdraft. Overdraft is a condition of a groundwater basin or aquifer in
                      which withdrawals exceed inflow (i.e., more water is removed than put
                      back in).
                      SCAG. The Southern California Association of Governments, the regional
                      planning agency for Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino,
                      Riverside, and Imperial counties.
                      Sensitive Natural Community. A sensitive natural community is a plant
                      and/or animal community that is rare in this area, provides important living
                      and breeding for wildlife, are structurally complex, and are special concern
                      to local, state, or federal agencies. The California Department of Fish and
                      Game (CDFG) tracks sensitive natural communities in the California
                      Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) and the California Environmental
                      Quality Act (CEQA) identifies the elimination or substantial degradation of
                      such communities as a significant impact.
                      Special-Status Species. Special-status species are those plants and
                      animals that, because of their recognized rarity or vulnerability to habitat
                      loss or population decline, are recognized by federal, state, or other
                      agencies. Some of these species receive specific protection that is
                      defined by federal or state endangered species legislation. Others have
                      been designated as "sensitive" on the basis of adopted policies and
                      expertise of state resource agencies or organizations with acknowledged
                      expertise, or policies adopted by local governmental agencies such as
                      counties, cities, and special districts to meet local conservation objectives.
                      These species are referred to collectively as "special status species" in
                      this report.
                      VCOG. The Ventura County Council of Governments, consisting of the
                      ten city governments in the county and the County of Ventura
                      government.

                       View Corridor. A view corridor is a designated highway, road, or trail that
                       offers travelers a view of significant natural landscape or man-made
                       features.
                       Viewshed. A viewshed is the area that can be seen from a given vantage
                       point and viewing direction. A viewshed is composed of foreground items
                       (items closer to the viewer) that are seen in detail, and background items
                       (items at some distance from the viewer) that frame the view. As a person
                       travels along a roadway (a view corridor), the viewshed changes, with the
                       foreground items changing rapidly and the background items remaining
                       fairly consistent.
                       Wetlands. Wetlands are ecologically complex habitats that support a
                       variety of both plant and animal life. Examples of wetlands include
                       saltwater or brackish marsh, seasonal wetlands, and vernal pool
                       complexes that have a hydrologic link to other waters.

  !"# Introduction
                   The Oxnard 2030 General Plan sets out a vision to guide future
                   development in the City. The 2002 visioning program included military
                   compatibility concerns and direction that are incorporated in this chapter.
                   There is no corresponding chapter in the 2006 Background Report, but
                   military compatibility topics are listed in several chapters. Implementation
                   and determination of internal consistency with the remainder of the
                   general plan is presented in Chapter 9.
                   Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) consists of the Naval Construction
                   Battalion (CBC, Seabees), Naval Air Station (NAS) Point Mugu, and San
                   Nicholas Island.        NBVC is a key facility in the Nation’s defense
                   infrastructure providing for the development and testing of new systems,
                   joint warfare experimentation, engineering support, shipping and home-
                   porting, and training and readiness missions. Both facilities are located
                   south of Oxnard and have operational needs and issues that impact
                   Oxnard residents and future development. Development decisions may
                   result in land use conflicts that may have negative impacts on community
                   safety, economic development, and sustainment of military readiness
                   activities. Nationwide, incompatible development has been a factor in
                   curtailing training operations, moving (realigning) mission-critical
                   components to other installations, and, in extreme cases, closing
                   installations.

                      The purpose of the Military Compatibility chapter is to demonstrate the
                      City’s commitment to and support of current and future missions at NBVC,
                      especially as related to noise generated by aircraft operations mobilization
                      routes, and facility perimeter security. This element sets goals and
                      established policies that consider the impact of Oxnard’s development
                      decisions on military readiness activities.
                      Many of the issues related to military sustainment are covered as part of
                      other elements in the General Plan. For instance, the location of future
                      development is controlled by policies in the Chapter 3, Community
                      Development, and noise level thresholds are covered in the Chapter 6,
                      Safety and Hazards.
 !"#        Key Terms
                      Avigation Easement. An easement that grants one of the following
                      rights: the right of flight; the right to cause noise, dust, etc. related to
                      aircraft flight; the right to restrict or prohibit certain lights, electromagnetic
                      signals, and bird-attracting land uses; the right to unobstructed airspace
                      over the property above a specified height; and the right of ingress/egress
                      upon the land to exercise those rights.
                      Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC).                                 A
                      Congressional process whereby military facilities are examined for
                      possible closure or realignment of their missions and activities.
                      Encroachment. The intrusion of a building, use, or object from one
                      property onto another property, possibly creating a nuisance or possible
                      limitations on one or both of the properties.
                      Joint Land Use Study (JLUS). A multijurisdictional study that examines
                      compatibility between existing and potential land uses near military
                      facilities and existing and potential military aircraft operations.
                      Military Influence Area (MIA). In general, a MIA covers the areas where
                      military operations may impact local residents and municipalities and,
                      conversely, where local activities may affect the military’s ability to carry
                      out its mission.
                      Suitability Map. A graphical manner for the suggestion of development
                      limitations, notification requirements, or other compatibility requirements
                      based on the geographic proximity to the installation. The acceptability of
                      certain criteria is displayed using areas depicted on a map by the colors
                      red, yellow, and green.
                      Special Use Airspace (SUA). This special designation is designed to
                      alert users about areas of military activity, unusual flight hazards, or
                      national security concerns and is used to segregate that activity from other
                      airspace users to enhance safety. Special Use Airspace is established by
                      the FAA.

                              as the area in which current or future airport-related noise, overflight,
                              safety, or airspace protection factors may significantly affect land uses or
                              necessitate restrictions on those uses. The intent of the legislation is to
                              notify buyers that they could experience airport noise, vibration, odor,
                              annoyances, or other inconveniences at some time in the future as a
                              result of the normal operation of an existing or proposed airport.

                              OVERVIEW OF NBVC
                              Each of the three NBVC installations and their respective missions are
                              highlighted below.
                                    •   NAS Point Mugu. NAS Point Mugu is located in the
                                        unincorporated County of Ventura and has real-time control of all
                                        air traffic within its coastal area, enabling the 36,000 square mile
                                        Pacific Sea Test Range to operate non-encroached. The range is
                                        a crucial asset in the testing, training and operational readiness of
                                        sub surface, surface and aerial weapon systems in the DOD
                                        strategic and tactical inventories.
                                        Located adjacent to the installation, Point Mugu State Park
                                        serves as a popular area for bird watching, marine mammals, and
                                        wildflowers. This park consists of approximately 15,000 acres of
                                        protected land including beaches, riparian areas, coastal hills and
                                        canyons. The protected nature of this valuable resource provides
                                        an additional buffer to operations occurring on NAS Point Mugu.
                                    •   CBC Port Hueneme. Located in the City of Port Hueneme and
                                        includes the only deepwater commercial harbor between Los

                             between San Diego and Puget Sound. CBC Port Hueneme is a
                             key mobilization facility and the home base of the Seabees
                             (Construction Battalions of the U.S. Navy), the Navy’s equivalent
                             of the Army Corps of Engineers.
                         •   San Nicolas Island. San Nicolas Island is located 65 miles south
                             of Point Mugu, the most remote island of the Ventura County
                             Channel Islands. It is uninhabited except for Navy personnel at
                             their training facility.

                          development in the City. Subsequent amendments, revisions, updates,
                          repeals or other changes to this Oxnard 2030 General Plan may be made
                          by the City Council except as required by the SOAR ordinance.
                          The 2002 visioning program included implementation concerns and
                          direction regarding determining consistency with the general plan in future
                          City actions.
                          The provisions of this Oxnard 2030 General Plan are severable. If any
                          provision of this General Plan or its application is held to be invalid, that
                          invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given

                               implementation of the goals and policies guides the day-to-day and the
                               strategic long term activities of these offices.           City officials and/or
                               departments responsible for goals and policies may be changed by the
                               City Manager unless otherwise directed by City Council.
                               Specific implementation actions are listed in Section 9.4. Not all goals
                               and programs have a corresponding specific implementation action, as
                               they are not yet developed. It is the intent and direction of this general
                               plan that within two years from the adoption of this general plan,
                               responsible offices will have developed subsequent implementation
                               programs that are directly linked to the goals and policies assigned to that
                               office by this chapter. In this manner, the public is assured that all goals
                               and policies have been assigned to a specific City office and that each
                               office has integrated their respective general plan goals and policies into
                               their planning programs, capital improvement programs, and /or
                               operations as appropriate and as approved by the City Manager with
                               review of the progress of achieving assigned goals and policies on a
                               biennial schedule in coordination with the regular budget process.
 !"#        Consistency Procedure
                               When the City considers certain types of public policies, projects, or
                               programs and/or is required to approve a private project, a finding of
                               consistency with the General Plan is often required. California General
                               Plan Guidelines state, “An action, program, or project is consistent with
                               the general plan if, considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives
                               and policies of the general plan and not obstruct their attainment” (2003,
                               page 164). Furthermore, to be consistent, a policy, project, or program
                               must be “in agreement or harmony” (Friends of Lagoon Valley, 154 Cal.
                               App. 4th at 817). Consistency is required in the context of approvals for
                               future development.
                               This section outlines a three-level procedure for determining consistency.
                               The Development Services Director, Planning Commission, or the City
                               Council will make the final finding of consistency depending on the nature
                               of the decision.
                               The three levels are defined by the relationship between the 2030 General
                               Plan goal and its respective implementing policies and the proposed
                               policy, project, or program under consideration. The three consistency
                               classification levels are:
                                        I.      Direct Applicability to a Proposed Policy, Project or
                                                Program
                                        II.     Related or Indirect Applicability to the Proposed Policy,
                                                Project, or Program

           III.     No or Distant Applicability to the Proposed Policy, Project,
                    or Program
  A 2030 General Plan consistency analysis shall start by categorizing all
  2030 General Plan goals into one of the three consistency levels as they
  relate to the proposed Policy, Project or Program. It is possible that no
  goal may be classified as Level I or II. Each Level I classification shall be
  supported by a narrative of appropriate length explaining the relationship
  between the 2030 goal and the proposed Policy, Project, or Program.
  Level II classifications shall be listed into one or more groups with a
  summary narrative explaining the relationship between the 2030 goal and
  the proposed Policy, Project, or Program. Level III goals are assumed to
  be all goals not classified as Level I or Level II and do not have to be
  individually listed in a general plan consistency analysis or finding, in
  supporting documents, or in the administrative record.
  After the Level I and II 2030 General Plan goals are identified, consistency
  is found (or not found, as the case may be) for each identified goal as
  follows:
           LEVEL I GOAL CONSISTENCY TEST
           At Level I, the consistency standard is that the proposed policy,
           project, or program furthers at least one of the goal’s implementing
           policies and otherwise does not inhibit achievement of remaining
           policies. The proposed policy, project, or program shall make
           progress towards achievement of at least one directly related
           implementing policy of a Level I goal. If there is no directly related
           implementing policy, then the proposed policy, project, or program
           shall be in general harmony with the majority of the implementing
           policies. In either case, the proposed policy, project, or program
           shall not significantly inhibit achievement of any of the
           implementing policies. A narrative shall be provided that
           demonstrates the Level I consistency finding.
           LEVEL II GOAL CONSISTENCY TEST
           The proposed policy, project, or program shall not significantly
           inhibit achievement of any of the Level II goals or their
           implementing policies.      A narrative shall be provided that
           demonstrates the Level II consistency finding.
  When a proposed policy, project, or program is found to be consistent with
  Level I or II goals, all implementing policies for the Level I and II goals
  shall also be found consistent and need not be individually listed or
  justified as part of a finding and/or CEQA or NEPA document at the
  discretion of the Development Services Director or designee.
  When a proposed project is found to be an implementation of and
  consistent with an adopted Specific Plan or similar previously-approved

                           entitlement for purposes of CEQA, a general plan consistency analysis
                           may be waived by a finding by the Development Services Director who
                           determines that the previous entitlement was approved and found to be
                           consistent under this general plan, as amended, and that no general plan
                           amendments have occurred since that entitlement that are related to the
                           proposed project.
                           CONSISTENCY EXAMPLE
                           Proposed Project: Adoption of an Ormond Beach Wetlands Plan
                           Goal CD-22: Environmentally sound Ormond Beach wetlands with
                           appropriate public access.
                           Consistency Finding: Level I Consistency.           The project and Goal CD-
                           22 speak to the same geographic area and the project furthers
                           achievement of the goal by adopting a plan that achieves goal CD-22.
                           Goal SC- 2: Sea level rise is routinely considered relative to coastal
                           areas and other City decisions, as relevant.
                           Consistency Finding:          Level II Consistency. Goal SC-2 requires
                           awareness of sea-level rise in City decision making. Since the Ormond
                           Beach wetlands plan acknowledges sea-level rise and will not inhibit
                           consideration of sea-level rise in other areas or decisions, the proposed
                           project is found consistent.
                           General Plan Consistency Audit (GPCA)
                           A General Plan Consistency Audit may be requested by the Planning
                           Commission and/or City Council that would require the evaluation of a
                           policy, project, or program under consideration against each 2030 General
                           Plan goal and implementing policy and the preparation of an audit
                           document that may be prepared by staff and/or a qualified consultant. A
                           GPCA fee may be established by resolution of the City Council.
