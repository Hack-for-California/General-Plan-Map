Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                                                          4
      LAND USE ELEMENT
      A.      Introduction
      The land use section is the broadest in scope and most comprehensive element of the
      General Plan. The objectives and policies contained herein were the last to be
      formulated, and reflect the general policy direction contained in all the other sections of
      the plan. As a result the Land Use Element by design brings the array of thought and
      direction contained throughout the plan together to create a consistent and harmonious
      statement.
      The intent of the land use section is to match the plan's policies related to natural
      resource, environmental constraint, recreation, open space, and community design
      policies with the urban land needs derived from the population, housing, circulation, and
      economic objectives of the plan.
      The Land Use Element defines and shows graphically the general spatial distribution of
      all uses of land within the Town of San Anselmo. Furthermore, the land use section
      stipulates the density and intensity of development for all the land area covered by the
      plan.
      B.      Existing Land Use
      The Town of San Anselmo is situated in a series of small valleys created by streams
      which are bordered by moderate to steep hillside slopes and ridge tops. The vegetation
      in the area is a mixture of grass and woodland. Due to their orientation, the north-facing
      slopes are more heavily wooded than the south-facing slopes. The sunnier south-facing
      slopes do, however, have stands and pockets of woodland. The stream courses along
      the valley floor are bordered by residential and commercial structures and remnants of
      riparian woodland.
      San Anselmo is an established residential community which is near buildout in terms of
      its maximum residential development. New housing construction can be expected to be
      limited to infill on existing vacant single-family lots. Many of these undeveloped lots are
      small and located on steep sites. However, there are some larger parcels of land
      situated on the higher, and more visible, slopes and ridge tops in the area which are
      designated for residential development in the current general plan.
      There are an estimated 1,720 acres of land within the corporate limits of the Town of
      San Anselmo. The Available Lands Survey which was conducted in 1984 as a part of the
      Housing Element update found that there was approximately 288 acres of land available
      for potential development. While the undeveloped land represents 17 percent of the total
      acreage in the Town, this undeveloped land is most often found in remote and hillside
      areas of the Town which are difficult to develop. Accordingly, while the Town can be
      described as being more than 80 percent built out from an acreage standpoint, it is 95
      percent built out from a housing standpoint.
      The Available Lands Survey also did not consider the development potential of surplus
      public lands and buildings. Red Hill School is an example of a site which has been
      deemed surplus by the School District, and alternative land uses may be of
      consideration to the agency in ownership.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                  5
      1. Residential Character
      San Anselmo can be characterized as a small residential community of primarily older
      neighborhoods and subdivisions that were established prior to 1945. Since 1945,
      residential development has been comprised of single-family home construction within
      established neighborhoods, and smaller new residential subdivisions. San Anselmo has
      not experienced the post-World-War-II construction of large tracts of single-family
      detached homes. Although San Anselmo is still a predominantly single-family home
      community, there was a shift in the last decade to the construction of more multi-family
      structures. The increase in the number of multi-family units was a result of the
      construction of new multi-family structures on some vacant lots, the conversion of large
      single-family homes to multi-unit structures, and the demolition of older single-family
      homes to construct multi­family units. As of 1983 the ratio of single-family units to multi-
      family units townwide was 77% to 23%.
      Additionally, San Anselmo has experienced a large increase in the number of second
      units which have been added to existing single-family homes in established single-family
      neighborhoods. The Town has adopted a second unit ordinance designed to regulate
      the number of second units in any given neighborhood in the community. However, there
      is no current accounting of the number of second units which have been constructed
      without benefit of the entitlements required by the Town's zoning code. Second units do
      comprise a significant use of residential land in the community, and are addressed by
      policy in the General Plan.
      2. Commercial and Industrial Character
      San Anselmo does not have a strong commercial or industrial base which would classify
      the community as a major employment area in Marin County. Most of the jobs available
      in San Anselmo are in the retail and residential services sector of the economy. There is
      no detailed commercial land use study available in the Town, but the employment data
      available from the 1980 census and the Association of Bay Area Governments pretty
      much describes commercial land use in the community. The Town's commercial
      enterprises are normally classified as "residential support" commercial by planners.
      These types of uses include food and drug stores; restaurants; automobile service shops
      and stations; personal service stores including barber shops, beauty shops, and dry
      cleaners; and retail outlets which depend on local residents as their primary clientele.
      The antique and other furniture stores are an example of local retail outlets which are
      more of a "base industry" drawing dollars from outside the community into the town, and
      are not dependent on local residents as their primary clientele.
      The total square footage associated with the "residential support commercial" activity is
      totally dependent on the population of the residential community to be served. In other
      words, the smaller the local population, the less land which needs to be set aside for
      local residential support commercial uses.
      Base commercial industries are not dependent on the size of the local population for
      their success, but are more affected by competition outside the community, and the
      ability of similar use to conglomerate in the community in which they are located. The
      amount of traffic through an area and the functionality of the roadway network are prime
      factors in the location of base retail commercial activities.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                   6

      Industrial and manufacturing uses are almost nonexistent in San Anselmo, and the
      community does not offer the types or size of land parcels which would attract these
      types of industry in the future.
      The Town does offer some potential for small business and professional offices. These
      offices would be occupied by professionals serving the community or local professionals
      who desire office space close to home.
      C.      Land Use Goals
      The primary land use goal for San Anselmo is the conservation of the small town
      character of the community and its close relationships with the natural beauty of its
      setting. The desire to retain and enhance these qualities was voiced over and over in the
      workshops and community meetings on the 1976 General Plan as well as at the meeting
      on the 1987-88 General Plan review.
      The objectives and policies set forth in Section D were formulated to achieve the
      following goals:
      1.      The small town character, scale, and pace of life in San Anselmo shall be
              preserved, as shall the Town's close connection with the natural beauty of its
              setting.
      2.      Maintain the economic viability of the Town's commercial core.
      3.      New developments shall be integrated harmoniously in to San Anselmo's existing
              neighborhoods and commercial areas.
      4.      New developments in the Town's open hillside and ridge areas will be regulated
              to protect the natural beauty of these areas.
      5.      Accommodate the housing needs of a socially and economically diverse
              population.
      The Land Use Map was developed on the following four principles:
      1.      Current land use in San Anselmo is to be the basis for determining the
              distribution of future land use in the community.
      2.      In situations where current zoning of a parcel or parcels of land is inconsistent
              with the existing land use of the greater surrounding area, and development has
              already occurred, said existing development will be grandfathered into the
              predominant land use planned for the area.
      3.      The current mixture of residential densities immediately west of the Town's
              downtown area is to be maintained.
      4.      All lands located above the 150 foot mean sea level elevation warrant special
              protection because of their high visibility potential, natural resource setting, and
              physical development constraints. Therefore, these lands are to be placed in a
              special conservation zone. (See pages 16 and 17.)

      D.        Issues, Objectives, and Policies
      The following is a listing of major community conservation and development issues
      facing San Anselmo, and the Town's objectives and policies related to these issues. The
      issues have not been prioritized in this plan. However, the issues will be prioritized when
      the Town Council adopts its planning work program and budget during the upcoming
      and each subsequent fiscal year.
      ISSUE: Growth Management
      Objective 1:
      To manage future growth to ensure the orderly development of the community, the
      logical extension of urban services, preservation of the area's natural and cultural
      resources, and protection of the area's environmental setting.
      Policies:
      1.1       Future growth through the year 2000 will be limited to the Town's present
                adopted urban service limit line. (See Map 2.)
      1.2       Future growth will be managed based on the ability to provide needed public
      services, the constraints associated with development of the site, the costs and
      revenues associated with new development, and the effects of growth on local traffic
      conditions.
      1.3       Ensure that new growth does not create intolerable traffic conditions.
      ISSUE: Preservation of Community Character and Image
      Objective 2:
      To preserve and enhance the unique natural and urban characteristics of the community
      while accommodating suitable new growth.
      Policies:
      2.1       All land use decisions within the Town and the planning area will take into
                consideration the protection and preservation of the area's surrounding hillsides,
                ridges, water courses, and any unique natural habitats.
      2.2       New development will be required to preserve some of the natural and cultural
                characteristics of their respective development sites.
      2.3       Undeveloped and agricultural lands outside the urban service area boundary
                should be protected from urban expansion.
      ISSUE: Residential Densities
      Objective 3:
      To establish residential densities which are compatible with the environmental
      constraints of the area, and sensitive to adjacent land uses.
      Policies:
      3.1       Very low density (hillside and ridge) and single family conservation residential
                development should be located in areas of (1) relatively high visibility, (2)
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                   8
             environmental hazards, (3) sensitive environmental resources, or (4) areas which
             are established as high priority open space lands.
      3.2    Single-family residential development is most appropriate within and adjacent to
             existing single-family areas, and in areas easily served with water and sewer
             lines. Such areas should also serve as transition zones between mixed density
             and very low density areas.
      3.3    Mixed residential and housing opportunity development is most appropriate
             where sites have few environmental constraints, and have adequate facilities,
             such as water, sewer, transit, and access to commercial services.
      3.4    Mixed residential and housing opportunity development is also appropriate along
             major traffic arterials and adjacent to commercial and office areas.
      ISSUE: Maintain a Sound Commercial Base
      Objective 4:
      Maintain the existing size and intensity of commercial businesses in the Town.
      Policies:
      4.1    Commercial land uses in the Town shall be divided into four categories: central
             commercial, general commercial, limited commercial, and neighborhood
             commercial.
      4.2    Retail commercial is best suited for the central area.
      4.3    General commercial is best suited for both retail and service commercial.
      4.4    Neighborhood commercial should be located on collector streets within a short
             distance of residential areas.
      4.5    Limited commercial uses shall be located along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard
             west of the Hub. Low intensity uses are low traffic generators.
      4.6    Before the Town will consider a proposal for commercial expansion or
             intensification, the Town first needs to resolve current parking problems in the
             commercial areas of the community. Any commercial proposals which would
             compound the parking problem will not be approved.
      Objective 5:
      To establish parking standards and a parking program for the central commercial area.
      (Also see Circulation Element Policies 9.1 and 12.1.)
      Policies:
      5.1    To revise the parking standards in the Town's Zoning Ordinance recognizing that
             most businesses in the central area cannot provide parking onsite.
      5.2    To establish a parking district or other mechanism in the central commercial area
             to generate the monies needed to develop sufficient parking in the area to

              prezoned by the Town shall be annexed into the Town prior to any decisions on
              the development proposal.
      8.5     All lands annexed into the Town will be zoned no less restrictively than the
              current County of Marin zoning. The Town will not consider annexation for
              purposes of increasing the density over that allowed by the County of Marin.
      ISSUE: Protection of Hillside and Ridge Properties
      Objective 9:
      To regulate future development on hillside and ridge parcels so as to protect, maintain,
      and enhance the natural characteristics of the land which contribute to the open space
      qualities of the parcel. (Also see Open Space Element Policies 2.1-2.8.)
      Policies:
      9.1     The density on ridge and hillside properties shall be no greater than the number
              of dwelling units specified in the "Table of Hillside and Ridge Density Parcels"
              (Ordinance No. 890).
      9.2     No development including structures, roads, and public facilities shall be allowed
              on visible ridges and hillsides unless it has been demonstrated that development
              outside of these areas is not feasible for geologic, soils, or hydrologic reasons, or
              development would impact a unique natural habitat.
      9.3     Should there be no other option but to allow development on a visible hillside or
              ridge, the Town may limit the size of development (i.e., square footage allowed
              within any structure), if such a limitation would reduce the visual impact of a
              development.
      9.4     Development on hillside and ridge parcels shall be located so as to be screened
              by existing woodlands or by portions of the site where existing topography
              provides screening. Development within existing woodland may be allowed if tree
              removal is minimal.
      9.5     New roads or extensions of existing roads which provide access to hillside and
              ridge parcels shall be limited in paved width to the minimum necessary to provide
              for adequate public safety.
      9.6     New or existing roads serving hillside and ridge parcels shall remain rural in
              character and appearance.
      9.7     Development on hillside and ridge parcels shall be so designed as to minimize
              grading and disruption of natural contours.
      9.8     Lands above the 150 foot mean sea level elevation warrant special design review
              considerations; accordingly, the Town will review the building location, building
              design, and access of development in these areas.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                    11
      Objective 10:
      To regulate the design of residential units, roads, and public facilities in hillside and ridge
      areas in order to protect and maintain the existing visual image and character of these
      lands. (Also see Circulation Element Policies 10.1-10.6.)
      Policies:
      10.1 The Town will not allow the attached cluster form of condominium development
              on lands designated as Very Low Density Single Family-Conservation in the
              General Plan.
      10.2    Within a subdivision, single-family detached homes may be located on lots
              smaller than one acre, provided that said location of single-family detached
              homes attains the desired open space objectives or reduces the visual impact of
              the proposed development, and providing the overall subdivision density does
              not exceed the maximum gross density allowed by the designated land use.
      10.3    Residential units shall be designed and located so as to minimize their visual
              mass. The Town will require exterior materials and colors which soften the
              appearance of the building and allow it to blend with the natural landscape.
      10.4    The only materials to be used for road construction shall be those which soften
              the visual appearance and impact of the road. All road materials shall be
              approved by the Town Engineer.
      10.5    Street lighting on hillside and ridge parcels shall be kept to the minimum
              necessary for safety. Light standards which minimize the dispersal of light shall
              be used in these areas.
      ISSUE: Preservation of Neighborhood Character, Image, and
      Quality of Life
      Objective 11:

              scale, intensity, and design that integrates with the existing character of the
              surrounding neighborhood.
      11.2    Medium- and large-scale development projects in both single-family and mixed
              residential areas shall provide for a variation in building heights and exterior wall
              and roof articulation to avoid monotonous structures with a large, blank visual
              bulk and mass.
      11.3    New developments of five or more units which overcrowd the local residential
              street network, and cannot make the necessary road way improvements to
              mitigate the impact, will be required to be phased over a period of time or
              possibly be reduced in density. All roadway improvements will be paid for by the
              development creating the need for the improvements.

      ISSUE: Reuse of Surplus School District Lands
      Objective 18:
      To keep surplus School District lands in public ownership, while allowing some interim
      use of the property to allow the School District some financial return on its land holdings.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                   14
      Policies:
      18.1 The Town shall meet with the School Districts to determine the appropriate future
              use of surplus school sites whenever Districts contemplate reuse of these lands.
      18.2    To encourage the School District to retain public ownership of surplus school
              sites because of the recreation and other physical assets that they provide for the
              greater community.
      18.3    Ensure that reuse of public school sites is compatible with adjacent land uses
              and intensity of development in the immediate area.
      18.4    To adopt an ordinance which would allow the School District to lease surplus
              school sites for possible educational, light commercial, office, or other use which

      20.2    To protect the unique natural and architectural features which make these sites a
              visual resource within the Town of San Anselmo.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                  15

                                                       Elevation 150--Very Low Density
      E.       Land Use Categories
      Listed below are the basic land uses provided for in the General Plan. Each land use
      category includes a description of the type, density, and intensity of land use expected
      therein. The category descriptions also contain some of the criteria used in assigning
      their relative location within the planning area, and the objectives which each category is
      expected to achieve. The Planned Land Use Map shows the planned distribution of
      general land uses within the planning area.
      Each residential land use category includes a population density range expressed in
      dwelling units per gross acre. The actual number of dwelling units permitted for any
      given residential parcel will be dependent on the environmental constraints of the site,
      and traffic safety characteristics of the roadways which provide access to the site,
      community design issues, and the housing objectives to be achieved.
      The term 'gross acre' as used in the General Plan refers to all the land within the
      property lines of a given parcel or all the land within the boundary line of a given
      development proposed. The only land to be excluded in the calculation of gross acreage
      is any land within an established public right-of-way or adopted plan line.
      The ultimate structural form and physical character of San Anselmo will be determined
      by the density and intensity of development allowed on existing undeveloped lands
      within the Town limits. The Town has decided that its visual image and character will be
      that of a small-town detached single-family residential community which provides for a
      more dense and intense form of development on lands adjacent to its central
      commercial core. The flatter lands of the valley floor, and lower hill slopes, will be
      predominantly detached single-family neighborhoods. The density, and the intensity of
      residential development, will decrease rapidly to a very low level on the upper slopes
      and ridges of the hills and mountains which bound the community.
      1. Residential
      The categories of residential land use provided for in the San Anselmo General Plan are
      formulated so as to protect the visual character and quality of life in most of the Town's
      existing residential neighborhoods. However, the general plan does provide for some
      transition in residential character and form in and around the Town's central commercial
      area. Vacant lands within other established residential neighborhoods will be regulated
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                   16
      so as to maintain and continue the existing character of development in the immediate
      area.
      The density and intensity of residential development on existing vacant parcels of land
      on the upper slopes and ridges of hills in the planning area will be severely limited so as
      to protect the open space character and visual image of these areas. The following sets
      forth the permitted land uses, building types, and concentration of use in each residential
      category contained in the General Plan.
          a. Very Low Density—Hillside and Ridge (1 Unit/Gross Acre or Less)
      The very low density residential category is applied to those lands which constitute the
      Town's hillside and ridge areas. This land use category is intended to provide a density
      and intensity of residential development which will maintain the natural features of the
      land and associated landscape, and protect the visible ridges in the community from
      development.
      The lands designated on the Land Use Map as very low density are to be improved with
      single-family detached homes on various lot sizes. Many of the parcels within this
      category are large, and it is therefore possible to cluster detached dwelling units on
      individual lots to avoid environmental constraints and to further open space objectives.
      The number of units to be allowed on each parcel of land within this category will be
      based on the environmental constraints (e.g., slope, unstable soils, stream courses, etc.)
      and open space objectives associated therewith. The Town of San Anselmo has
      reviewed the development potential of each parcel in the hillside and ridge area. From
      this review emerged the maximum number of dwelling units to be allowed on each
      parcel. The maximum number of dwelling units to be allowed is designated in the official
      "Table of Hillside and Ridge Density Parcels" adopted by the Town Council. The
      Town Council may review and amend this table from time to time if such amendment
      would further the objectives of the General Plan.
      The population density in the hillside and ridge areas associated with this land use
      category will not exceed a maximum of four (4) persons per gross acre. The only land
      use to be allowed within this category include single-family detached dwellings,
      roadways, driveways, public uses similar to public parks, and public playgrounds, trail
      access easements, utility installations, state licensed small alcoholism and/or drug
      treatment facilities, small family day care homes, small pediatric day health and respite
      care facilities, small residential care facilities including those serving the elderly and
      persons with chronic life-threatening illness, and any other residential facility mandated
      by state or federal law, foster homes, and home occupations which are incidental and
      accessory to the allowed residential use. Other uses which are permitted by use permit
      include: large family day care homes and a limited number of second units.
          b. Single-Family Residential-Conservation (1 Unit/Gross acre or Less)
      The Single-Family Residential-Conservation designation is assigned to those residential
      properties that are one acre or more and are located at or above the 150 foot mean sea
      level elevation in the Town of San Anselmo, but outside of the land designated as Very
      Low Density (Hillside and Ridge). Much of the land above the 150 foot mean sea level
      elevation is visible from the Town's major roadways and established residential
      neighborhoods, and as such forms the major visual backdrop to the Town. In order to
      preserve the unique visual qualities of these lands, development is to be limited to a
      density of one unit per acre or less.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                  17

      In order to maintain the visual quality of the lands above the 150 foot mean sea level
      elevation, the Town intends to review the building location, access, and exterior design
      of structures proposed for vacant lots in this area. The Town may also consider the
      effects of new development in this area on the public health and safety issues related to
      site improvements.
      Design review may also apply to existing developed properties within the conservation
      area, if said review is necessary to protect the visual character of the hillside and the
      size of the proposed addition is large enough to warrant said review.
      The population density in the single family residential-conservation area will not exceed
      18 persons per gross acre. The only land uses to be allowed within this category include
      single-family detached dwellings, roadways, driveways, public uses similar to public
      parks, public playgrounds, trail access easements, utility installations, state licensed
      small alcoholism and/or drug treatment facilities, small family day care homes, small
      pediatric day health and respite care facilities, small residential care facilities, including
      those serving the elderly and persons with chronic life-threatening illness, and any other
      residential facility mandated by state or federal law, foster homes, and home
      occupations which are incidental and accessory to the allowed residential use. Other
      uses which are permitted by use permit include: large family day care homes and a
      limited number of second units.
          c. Single-Family Residential (1-6 Units/Gross Acre)
      The Single-Family Residential category is assigned to those residential areas with
      established neighborhoods which are characterized by single-family detached homes on
      a typical suburban residential lot. The majority of the parcels (lots) in this category would
      have a lot size of 7,500 square feet or less. However, some lots larger than 7,500
      square feet may be found in this area due to environmental conditions or topography.
      Much of the land above the 150 foot mean sea level elevation is visible from the Town's
      major roadways and established residential neighborhoods, and as such forms the major
      visual backdrop to the Town. In order to maintain the visual quality of the lands above
      the 150 foot mean sea level elevation, the Town intends to review the building location,
      access, and exterior design of structures proposed for vacant lots in this area. The Town
      may also consider the effect of new development in this area on the public health and
      safety issues related to site improvements.
      Design review may also apply to existing developed properties at or above the 150 foot
      mean sea level elevation, if said review is necessary to protect the visual character of
      the hillside and the size of the proposed addition is large enough to warrant said review.
      The majority of the land within this residential category has already been subdivided and
      improved with single-family homes. However, there are existing vacant parcels of land
      dispersed throughout these low-density residential areas. Future subdivision of vacant
      land within this category shall conform to the existing pattern of lot sizes within the
      neighborhood in which the land is located. New lots created through the subdivision of
      land shall be the same size as, or in some situations larger than, the existing lots in the
      immediate neighborhood.
      The population density in the single-family residential category shall not exceed a
      maximum of eighteen (18) persons per gross acre. Land uses to be permitted include
      single-family detached dwellings, public uses similar to public parks, public schools,
      public playgrounds, trail access easements, utility installations, state licensed small
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                     18
      alcoholism and/or drug treatment facilities, small family day care homes, small pediatric
      day health and respite care facilities, small residential care facilities, including those
      serving the elderly and persons with chronic life-threatening illness, and any other
      residential facility mandated by state or federal law, foster homes, and home
      occupations which are incidental and accessory to the allowed residential use. Other
      uses which are permitted by use permit, include: churches, large family day care homes
      and a limited number of second units.
                    d.      Medium Density Residential (6-12 Units/Gross Acre)
      The Medium Density Residential category is assigned to residential lots adjacent to Sir
      Francis Drake Boulevard and residential lots which abut or face commercial land uses.
      These properties will be developed with duplex-type residential units, but some triplex
      units may be allowed provided the form of the triplex unit is compatible in design with the
      surrounding single-family duplex neighborhood.
      The population density in the Medium Density Residential category shall not exceed a
      maximum of twenty-eight (28) persons per gross acre. The only land uses to be allowed
      within this category include single-family detached dwellings, duplex and triplex
      residential units, public uses which are similar to public parks, public schools, and public
      playgrounds, state licensed small alcoholism and/or drug treatment facilities, small family
      day care homes, small pediatric day health and respite care facilities, small residential
      care facilities, including those serving the elderly and persons with chronic life-
      threatening illness, and any other residential facility mandated by state or federal law,
      foster homes, and home occupations which are incidental and accessory to the allowed
      residential use are permitted. Other uses permitted by use permit include: churches and
      large family day care homes.
      Higher densities may be considered within these areas if such developments implement
      to a significant degree the social housing objectives of the General Plan. The Housing
      Opportunity section describes how this can be done.
                    e.      High Density Residential (13-20 Units/Gross Acre)
      The High Density Residential category is primarily assigned to residential lands near
      commercial areas outside the Town's Central Commercial core. The predominant form
      of residential development is expected to be attached multifamily apartment and
      condominium dwelling units. Multi-family housing is to be located within walking distance
      of commercial and employment areas in order to reduce the need for, and dependence
      on, the automobile for daily shopping trips.
      Multiple family units are to reflect in design the single-family character of the Town and
      will therefore be limited in height to two stories, but not to exceed thirty (30) feet in
      height.
      The population density in the High Density Residential category is not to exceed a
      maximum of forty-two (42) persons per gross acre. Land uses to be permitted in this
      area include: single-family detached homes, duplexes, triplexes, apartments,
      condominiums, public uses which are similar to public parks, public playgrounds, and
      public schools, public parks, trail access easements, utility installations, state licensed
      small alcoholism and/or drug treatment facilities, small family day care homes, small
      pediatric day health and respite care facilities, small residential care facilities, including
      those serving the elderly and persons with chronic life-threatening illness, and any other
      residential facility mandated by state or federal law, foster homes, and home
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                     19
      occupations which are incidental and accessory to the allowed residential use. Other
      uses permitted by use permit, include: churches, convalescent homes, bed and
      breakfast, and large family day care homes.
      Higher residential densities may be considered within these areas if such developments
      implement to a significant degree the social housing objectives of the General Plan. The
      Housing Opportunity Section describes how this can be done.
                     f.     Downtown Mixed Residential (6-20 Units/Gross Acre)
      The Downtown Mixed Residential category is assigned to the residential lands west of
      the Town's Central Commercial area. These properties are planned to be improved with
      a mixture of single-family, duplex, triplex, and multi-family apartments and
      condominiums. The intent is to have a mixture of residential densities on every street
      and block in the area so designated. Furthermore, there will be design review of all multi-
      family buildings to ensure visual compatibility with existing development in the area. The
      planned mixture of residential densities by block is shown on Map 4.
      The population density in the Downtown Mixed Residential category shall not exceed a
      maximum of forty-two (42) persons per gross acre. Land uses to be permitted in this
      area include: single-family      detached homes; duplexes, triplexes; apartments, and
      condominiums, public parks, public schools, and public playgrounds, utility installations,
      state licensed small alcoholism and/or drug treatment facilities, small family day care
      homes, small pediatric day health and respite care facilities, small residential care
      facilities, including those serving the elderly and persons with chronic life-threatening
      illness, and any other residential facility mandated by state or federal law, foster homes,
      and home occupations which are incidental and accessory to the allowed residential
      use. Other uses permitted by use permit, include: churches, rooming houses,
      convalescent homes, bed and breakfast, professional offices, and large family day care
      homes, and a limited number of second residential units.
      Higher residential densities may be considered within these areas if such developments
      implement to a significant degree the social housing objectives of the General Plan. The
      Housing Opportunity section describes how this can be done.
                     g.     Housing Opportunity Areas/Apartments (14-28 Units/Gross Acre)
      The Town has found over the years that zoning land to allow for higher densities of
      development has not resulted in rental or sales prices that meet the needs of the
      community's low and moderate income households. The only result has been a change
      in the physical appearance and character of the community, and increased traffic.
      The Town recognizes the needs of low and moderate income families, and will provide
      within the Land Use Element an incentive to provide housing for these income groups.
      The Town will consider higher density for both rental and For Sale projects which
      provide at least forty (40) percent of the total dwelling units within the development for
      low income families. Rental and For Sale unit projects which meet the objective will be
      considered in specified areas within the Mixed Housing areas of the General Plan. The
      areas which will be considered for higher densities will be designed in the future by the
      Town Council. The population density of these parcels will not exceed a maximum of fifty
      (50) persons per gross acre.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                  20
      2. Commercial
      San Anselmo does not have the type of a strong commercial or industrial base which
      would classify the community as a major employment area in Marin County. Most of the
      jobs available in San Anselmo are in the retail and residential services sector of the
      economy.
      A report prepared by the Association of Bay Area Governments entitled "ABAG
      Projections—87" projected a decreasing population in San Anselmo, combined with a
      relatively small increase in the number of jobs available in the community, and the
      number of households in the community. Slight job increases are projected in the retail
      and service sector over the next 20 years.
      The jobs projections for San Anselmo do not indicate a need to plan for a large amount
      of commercial expansion in the community. Growth in jobs, though small, will be in
      service and office type uses, with some limited retail expansion.
      The San Anselmo Chamber of Commerce supports policies which will encourage the
      expansion and attraction of nonresident-supported business enterprises. It appears that
      the primary businesses which can be encouraged to expand to implement this objective
      are restaurants, antique and other furniture stores, and specialty retail item stores.
      These enterprises would have to operate in conjunction with one another to first attract
      visitors to the area and to encourage visitors to have an extended stay (two or more
      hours) of browsing, shopping, and eating.
      The Town appears to have adequate existing and planned commercial floor space to
      achieve this objective. Furthermore, the historic commercial core and commercial
      development along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and Red Hill Boulevard are within
      reasonable walking distance from one another. A factor which hinders the expansion of
      nonresident-supported business enterprises is the size of streets, and high volume of
      automobile traffic thereon, which tends to serve as a strong barrier to easy pedestrian
      circulation. Steps the Town could take to improve upon the environment for nonresident
      dependent business include improving pedestrian circulation and traffic movement, and
      to provide adequate and easily accessible parking for longer shopping trips into the
      community.
      One of the primary concerns of commercial business in the historic core and along Red
      Hill Road and Greenfield Avenue is the need for additional convenient customer parking.
      The Chamber of Commerce has requested that the Town consider adopting policies
      which will address the need for more convenient parking.
      The commercial area along San Anselmo Avenue is planned to remain the retail core of
      the community. Uses are expected to be a mixture of visitor and local serving
      commercial business. The Central Commercial area should incorporate open space, a
      strong pedestrian element, and convenient parking to maintain its image as the hub of
      the community. The Town may consider special parking provisions for the area in order
      to reduce the time and trouble new businesses have with leasing commercial space in
      the area. The incorporation of a residential element into the variety and fabric of the
      commercial core could improve its function and vitality.
      The older commercial structures located along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard west of the
      Hub present a potential traffic circulation and congestion problem. Most of these
      structures were constructed without offstreet parking. Furthermore, the heavy vehicular
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                               21

      traffic volume along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, combined with the inability to
      structurally expand the boulevard means that left turns onto business property in this
      area creates an unacceptable problem for vehicular circulation within the Town. As a
      result, commercial uses which generate significant amounts of traffic, if located in these
      structures, will cause further traffic congestion in an existing congested area. The Town
      intends to consider regulating businesses in this area to prohibit enterprises which are
      high traffic generators (e.g., fast food outlets and quick stop and shop stores).
      The Town wants to maintain the small town scale and character of its commercial areas.
      This will be attained by creative conservation of older buildings and close attention to
      new buildings to ensure that they are at a scale which is compatible with the existing
      character of the area. Trademark designed buildings associated with many retail, food,
      and beverage service business will not be allowed in the Town's commercial areas.
      Development is to be consistent with Objective 6 and Policies 6.2-6.3 of the Land Use
      Element.
      Limited commercial enterprises will be allowed at some points along major arterials and
      collector streets, provided these businesses primarily serve the residential areas in
      which they are located. The Plan recognizes the existing limited number of small
      neighborhood commercial and administrative professional offices along Center and Sir
      Francis Drake Boulevard.
      The categories of commercial land use provided for in the General Plan recognize the
      diverse functions and roles each of the commercial areas will play in the community. The
      following describes the permitted land uses, building types, and concentration of use in
      each commercial category found in the Plan.
                       a.     Central Commercial
      The Central Commercial area can be found along portions of San Anselmo Avenue and
      Sir Francis Drake Boulevard between the Hub and Tunstead Avenue. This commercial
      area is expected to be the retail core of the community. Commercial enterprises in this
      area are expected to provide a continuity of commercial frontage and attractive area for
      pedestrian movement. Parking is not anticipated onsite, but would be provided in public
      or common parking lots within walking distance of all downtown businesses.
      Two types of businesses are expected in this area. The first type are primary attractors.
      These are businesses that draw customers from outside of the community. Such
      commercial activities include restaurants, specialty stores (antiques), fashion stores,
      variety stores, and apparel stores. The second type of uses are satellite businesses
      which rely on pedestrian movement generated by the primary attractors. These include
      such uses as small specialty shops, small food service outlets (ice cream and coffee),
      personal services (barber and beauty shops), and small boutiques. Offices would also
      be allowed, but in order to promote commercial activity in the area are encouraged to
      locate above the ground floor.
      Residential use in the form of multi-family housing will be allowed in the central
      commercial area. Residential uses can be provided for in a single structure, or may be
      mixed with commercial activity in a single structure; the ground floor of every building
      should be utilized for commercial or commercial-related uses. However, the Town will
      consider the entire use concept for a building before determining the appropriate use of
      the ground floor. Commercial activity in the central area is expected to be quite
      concentrated to encourage pedestrian movement. Although commercial development
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                 22
      will be concentrated, the intensity of commercial development on individual lots or
      development sites could have floor area ratio (FAR) up to 2.0. The term "floor area ratio"
      as used in the General Plan is the total floor area of a building relative to the total area of
      the lot or development site. A 5,000 square foot lot with a floor area ratio of 1.5 could
      have 7,500 square feet of floor space in a building. Furthermore, the height of buildings
      in the central commercial area is to be compatible with surrounding buildings, but shall
      not exceed 30 feet in height.
                      b.       General Commercial
      The General Commercial land use designation is expected to provide for a wide range of
      commercial activities. These types of activities include supermarkets, food stores, retail
      activities, automobile service and repair, laundries, offices, restaurants, nurseries, and
      commercial services. Businesses in these areas would not rely on foot traffic for their
      customers, but would be expected to draw from and accommodate automobile traffic.
      The majority of the businesses in these areas should be required to provide onsite
      parking for their customers. However, in some situations, common parking facilities or
      special parking on street programs may be authorized.
      Residential use will be allowed in the general commercial areas. Residential uses can be
      provided for in a single structure, or may be mixed with commercial activity in a single
      structure; the ground floor of every building should be utilized for commercial or
      commercial-related uses. However, the Town will consider the entire use concept for a
      building before determining the appropriate use of the ground floor.
      The concentration of commercial development in the General Commercial area will not
      be as great as it is in the commercial core. Commercial buildings in these areas may be
      more spread out and separated by off street parking spaces. Floor area ratios within the
      General Commercial could have FAR up to 1.5. The height of buildings in this category
      is to be compatible with surrounding buildings, but shall not exceed 30 feet in height.
      The only exception would be existing buildings which are greater than 30 feet in height.
                      c.       Limited Commercial
      The areas designated as Limited Commercial on the General Plan Land Use Map will be
      regulated as to the intensity of commercial development allowed thereon. It is intended
      that commercial development allowed for on these properties will be low traffic
      generators, or generate an equal or lesser number of trips during the a.m. and p.m. peak
      hours than the existing uses as of July 22, 1997, (the determination for vacant buildings
      will be the most recent use between February 26, 1991, and July 22, 1997, on Sir
      Francis Drake Boulevard). Examples of uses which are expected to be low traffic
      generators include specialized enterprises such as furniture and antique stores,
      specialty boutiques, book stores, art galleries, and personal services such as barber
      shops and beauty shops. The types of commercial activity which will not be allowed in
      the Limited Commercial area include fast-food restaurants, convenience food stores
      (when not in combination with a gasoline station), and medical office types of uses and
      services.
      The determination as to whether or not a commercial use would be allowed within this
      Limited Commercial area will be based upon the total number of traffic trips typically
      generated by that business. Commercial uses which will disrupt the flow of traffic on Sir
      Francis Drake Boulevard, or uses which would have a detrimental effect on the
      residential neighborhoods adjacent to Sir Francis Drake Boulevard will not be allowed.
      The intent of this Limited Commercial area is to ensure that the businesses which
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                      23
      operate within this area will not be disruptive to the flow of traffic on the boulevard or the
      nearby residential neighborhood.
      Residential use will be allowed in the limited commercial area. Residential uses can be
      provided for in a single structure; the ground floor of every building should be utilized for
      commercial or commercial-related uses. However, the Town will consider the entire use
      concept for a building before determining the appropriate use of the ground floor.
      The concentration of commercial development in this area is expected to be lower than
      in the Central and General Commercial districts. Floor area ratios could be up to 1.0
      within this area, and building heights are to be compatible with buildings in the
      surrounding area, but shall not exceed 30 feet in height.
           d. Neighborhood Commercial/Mixed Residential
      The Neighborhood Commercial/Mixed Residential designation is intended to allow very
      limited commercial uses on certain properties within predominantly residential areas of
      San Anselmo. The land use designation will allow properties so classified to either be
      improved with residential units (predominantly single family) or limited commercial uses
      which are compatible with the residential area. Commercial uses which are compatible
      with residential areas would not result in traffic impacts any greater than if the property
      were improved residentially. Compatibility implies that limited commercial uses would
      also not result in noise, light, glare, or aesthetic impacts that would conflict with a
      residential environment.
      Neighborhood Commercial areas provide convenience goods and services to local
      residents without disrupting the residential character of the area. They are necessarily
      small in size, and oftentimes may consist of a single mom-and-pop store. Other typical
      uses include barber shops, beauty shops, cleaners, shoe repair, hardware stores, and
      small pharmacies. Small professional offices may also be allowed in this category.
      Neighborhood Commercial uses are considered desirable when located at intersections
      and developed in areas where residents can walk rather than drive to do business.
      Additional neighborhood centers may be needed beyond those shown on the map,
      depending upon the desires of residential communities within the town.
      The concentration of commercial development within the area will be quite limited. Most
      often, commercial development will be limited to one or two parcels, but in some
      situations there may be more parcels devoted to this use. Floor area ratios up to .65 will
      be most appropriate within this area, and the height of the commercial structures must
      be compatible with those of the residences in the area, but shall not exceed 30 feet in
      height.
                        e.      Professional
      It is the intention for the uses permitted within the Professional act as buffers between C-
      2 Central Commercial and Residential Districts. It is further intended to allow
      professional uses which are reasonably compatible with adjacent residential uses, and
      particular emphasis shall be given to avoid problems of traffic, noise production, and
      other detriments to a residential neighborhood.
      3. Parks and Open space
      This land use category is intended to designate existing and planned parks, recreation
      facilities, and natural open space areas. The open space areas identified as contributing
      to the Town's natural setting and community image fall into this category, and are shown
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                     24
      on the open space map. The open space land use issues are dealt with in more detail in
      the Open Space Element of the General Plan. Areas designated as parks on the
      Planned Land Use Map are not intended to be developed with anything other than small
      structures which accommodate the citizens of the community as it relates to recreation.
      Commercial structures will not be allowed in the parks. The parks will only be improved
      with facilities for which the park was intended (e.g., tennis courts, baseball diamonds,
      and open playfields).
      It is the objective of the General Plan to have all areas identified as "open space parcels"
      on the Open Space Map to remain in their natural state without any development at all.
      However, should the Town be unable to acquire, or set aside these areas as permanent
      open space parcels, a very limited form of residential development would be allowed.
      Development is to conform to Objective 3, Policy 3.1 of the Open Space Element.
      Residential development within the current Town limits would be no greater than one
      unit per acre, and in many instances may be even less dense for those properties listed
      on the Table of Hillside and Ridge Density Parcels. Building coverage on these
      properties would be no greater than 15 percent per gross acre.
      Policies
      LU-E.3-1:         Memorial Park may not be utilized as a flood detention basin, nor may
                        any non-recreational uses be permitted that adversely affect or reduce
                        the recreational amenities at the Park.”
      LU -E.3-2:        No public land parcel occupied by Memorial Park may be sold or
                        transferred by the Town without approval by the citizens of San Anselmo
                        as part of a general election.”
      4. Public Facilities
      This category is a catch-all for all public land uses not included in the afore-described
      categories. Examples include the Town Hall, Police Department, Fire Service buildings,
      the Public Library, parks, public parking lots, public schools, and water tank sites.
      The intensity of development allowed on the public facilities parcels will be determined
      by the function or purpose these facilities were designed to serve. As an example, the
      Town Hall would have a greater intensity of use than a water tank located on a nearby
      hillside in the town.
      5. Community Facilities
      This category is applied to certain Town-owned properties and allows for private use of
      said properties when appropriate. Examples include the Isabel Cook Community Center
      and Robson Harrington House.
      The hierarchy of use for Community Facilities parcels shall be in the following order,
      assuming substantially comparable lease terms.
               1.       Public use by the Town.
               2.       Rental to non-profit community organizations.
               3.       Rental to other private entities.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                   25

      F.      Implementation
      The California Government Code Section 65860 requires that a "county or city zoning
      ordinance shall be consistent with the general plan of the county or city by January 1,
      1974. A zoning ordinance shall be consistent with a city or county general plan only if:
      (1) the city or county has officially adopted such a plan, and (2) the various land uses
      authorized by the ordinance are compatible with the objectives, policies, general land
      uses, and programs specified in such a plan." In a related action, the legislature
      amended the state Subdivision Map Act, requiring that tentative and final maps not be
      approved unless the design and improvement were found to be consistent with
      applicable specific and general plans (Govt. Code Sec. 66473.5).
      Uses must be consistent with all elements of the general plan and not just the land use
      element and map. (The law is unclear whether the uses must be consistent with only the
      seven required elements.) For there to be a finding of consistency the plan must be
      complete. In addition, the plan must be "an integrated, internally consistent and
      compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency" (Govt. Code Sec. 65300.5).
      Consistency is measured by three parameters: use, boundaries, and time.
      1.      The zoning ordinance should be considered consistent with the general plan
      when the allowable uses and standards contained in the text of the zoning ordinance
      tend to further the policies in the general plan and do not inhibit or obstruct the
      attainment of these articulated policies.
      2.      The boundaries of land use areas on the land use map are intended to be
      ambiguous in order for the Planning Commission and Town Council to adjust land use
      regulations to factors that are too localized to be reflected on the general plan. Thus
      boundaries are intended to be flexible and land uses not shown on the map may be
      consistent if they are small in area and if they are consistent with the written goals and
      policies of the plan.
      3.      As discussed, a use must not preclude ultimate achievement of the goals and
      policies at the planned time. A use may not be permitted prematurely in an area
      reserved for future development even if it is consistent with the land use map. It must
      also be consistent with the objectives and policies as well.
      Code Revisions
      1. Zoning Ordinance and Map
      The top priority for implementation would be the revision of San Anselmo's Zoning
      Ordinance and Zoning Map to be consistent with the revised general plan. Ordinance
      amendments would include rewriting the residential and commercial sections of the code
      to incorporate the density and intensity provisions of the revised general plan. Updating
      the parking requirements of the code, and providing a Housing Opportunity section in the
      Code. Special provisions could be written into the code to provide that existing uses with
      a density or intensity of use greater than the revised plan could continue as legal
      permitted uses.
      2. Subdivision Ordinance
      The subdivision ordinance should be reviewed and updated to conform with the
      Subdivision Map Act. In addition, the ordinance can be modified to require a developer
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                 26
      to pay certain impact fees to cover the costs to the community that are directly
      attributable to the development.
      Future Planning
      1. Housing Opportunity Areas Map
      The Town will conduct a more detailed study of existing land uses and parcel sizes in
      the designated Mixed Residential, Commercial, and Public Facility areas to determine
      which sites are most appropriate as housing opportunity areas. The objective of the
      study is to map parcels which are considered appropriate Housing Opportunity sites.
      2. Central Commercial Circulation and Parking Study
      The Town will conduct a study of the traffic circulation and parking activity in the Central
      Commercial area. The purpose of the study is to develop a program to improve traffic
      circulation, parking opportunities, and evolve a method to finance any needed
      improvements. Businesses in the area will be invited to participate in the study.
      3. Design Review in the Single-Family Residential-Conservation Category
      Prior to enacting an ordinance to implement the objectives of the Single­Family
      Residential-Conservation area the Town will conduct studies and hold workshops to
      determine when and where the discretionary power of design review will be used for new
      development on vacant lots, and when design review will be required for proposed
      expansion or reconstruction of existing buildings in the area. The staffing requirements
      to implement these objectives will also be studied. The purpose of the study is to
      determine the degree of flexibility which will be incorporated into the ordinance.
      4. Historic Preservation Ordinance
      The Town will prepare a historic preservation ordinance which will not only protect the
      visual and design character of existing historic buildings in the community, but will
      establish a procedure and guidelines for new building construction in areas of the
      community which contain examples of San Anselmo's architectural heritage.
      5. Park Land Zoning Ordinance
      The Town shall prepare a park lands zoning ordinance, which shall apply to all park
      lands so designated on the General Plan land use map. The ordinance will implement
      and be consistent with the General Plan land use criteria for Parks set forth in Section
      E.3 of the Land Use Element.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                   27

      CIRCULATION ELEMENT
      A.      Introduction
      The Circulation Element of the General Plan is the most closely aligned with the Land
      Use Element. State law mandates that the Circulation Element contain the general
      location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes,
      terminals, and other public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the Land Use
      Element of the General Plan. The term "correlation" in the planning law means the
      Circulation Element must set forth standards and proposals for roadway modifications
      and improvements which are related to the existing use of land in the community, and
      changes in demand on the various roadways as a result of changes in the use of land
      associated with the Land Use Element. Furthermore, correlation includes a workable
      program for funding anticipated and planned roadway improvements.
      B.      Existing Conditions
      1. Roadway Network and Classification
      San Anselmo's roadway network is comprised of arterial, collector, and local residential
      streets. There are no freeways or expressways within the Town limits. However, due to
      the Town's location in the upper Ross Valley, the major arterial streets serve as
      thoroughfares for regional traffic moving to and from Fairfax, Sleepy Hollow, and central
      and west Marin. The traffic on the Town's arterials is not only weekday traffic, but
      includes weekend recreation traffic to state and national parks located in central and
      west Marin.
      The major arterial streets in San Anselmo include:
          •   Sir Francis Drake Boulevard – a four-lane arterial street which traverses the
              community between the Towns of Fairfax and Ross.
          •   Center Boulevard – a two-lane arterial street which passes between Fairfax and
              the Hub.
          •   Red Hill Avenue – a four-lane arterial street which connects the Hub with the City
              of San Rafael.
          •   Butterfield Road – a two-lane arterial which connects the unincorporated com-
              munity of Sleepy Hollow with Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.
      Residential collector streets include San Francisco Boulevard, Broadmoor Avenue,
      Forbes Avenue, San Anselmo Avenue, Ross Avenue, Bolinas Avenue, Greenfield
      Avenue, Sequoia Drive, Hillsdale Drive, Barber Avenue, and Saunders Avenue.
      All other streets and roads in the community are classified as local residential streets.
      No new major roadways are planned or envisioned in the Town's foreseeable future.
      2. Operational Characteristics
      The following is a summary of the findings of the Corridor Study prepared by DKS
      Associates and the findings of the traffic data collected by John Roberto Associates.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                 28

                       a.      Arterial Roads
      The studies conducted by DKS Associates in 1985 found that daily traffic volumes along
      Sir Francis Drake Boulevard ranged between 18,800 trips at the west end of Town to
      34,300 trips near Madrone Avenue. Eastbound traffic was found to peak sharply
      between 7:00 am and 9:00 am, and eastbound traffic remained relatively high until after
      3:00 pm. Westbound traffic was found to have a broad peak period which started around
      3:00 pm and extended beyond 6:00 pm.
      Daily traffic volumes along Center Boulevard ranged between 11,900 trips to 12,500
      trips. Eastbound traffic was found to have a strong peak between 7:30 and 9:00 am, and
      then diminishes throughout the remainder of the day. The westbound peak occurs
      between 5:00 and 7:00 pm, but is less dramatic than the am peak.
      At the time the traffic counts were taken, Sir Francis Drake Boulevard was a two lane
      road between Butterfield Road and San Francisco Boulevard. The one eastbound lane
      on Sir Francis Drake at the intersection with Butterfield Road was not capable of
      handling the peak-period demand. As a result, cars backed up on Butterfield Road
      because they could not adequately access Sir Francis Drake due to the cars already
      occupying the eastbound lane from Fairfax. The result was that many drivers sought
      alternative routes to access Sir Francis Drake by passing through local residential
      streets in the area, placing unacceptable levels of vehicle traffic on the residential
      streets.
      San Anselmo has added an additional east-and westbound lane on Sir Francis Drake
      Boulevard, thereby eliminating one of the factors which contributed to congestion on the
      roadway. While the beneficial effects of the improvements on roadway level of service
      and impacts on nearby residential streets has not been documented through formal
      traffic studies, the number of complaints related to excessive traffic from people on
      residential streets has decreased substantially. Prior to the installation of the additional
      lanes on Sir Francis Drake, the roadway was found to be operating at level of service 'F'
      during the peak am and pm hours.
      Peak-period traffic on Center Boulevard was found to result in significant congestion at
      the all-way STOP intersections at Forest/San Anselmo Avenue, Redwood/ Saunders,
      and at Madrone/Grove. The am peak period congestion was quite severe and exceeded
      roadway capacity design. The result was a calculated Level of Service 'F' during the am
      peak period. Eastbound am congestion resulted in traffic seeking alternative routes
      through adjacent residential areas to points east which were less congested. No
      improvements have been made to Center Boulevard since the DKS study. However,
      improvements on Sir Francis Drake may have shifted some trips away from Center. No
      studies have been undertaken to verify this assumption.
      It is clear from the foregoing that local and regional traffic impacts on many of San
      Anselmo's local residential streets is a result of the inability of some of the major
      arterials· in the Town to adequately accommodate this traffic during the peak periods.
      The traffic problem is not only a local problem, but one which must be shared by other
      communities in the upper Ross Valley and the unincorporated communities in Sleepy
      Hollow, and west and central Marin.
                       b.      Local Streets
      The traffic counts taken on local residential streets by John Roberto Associates in
      August 1986 did not result in any significant adverse findings. Traffic counts were taken
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                   29

      during the pm peak hour on weekdays. The Goodrich Traffic Group calculated the
      vehicle/capacity ratio and corresponding Level of Service for the ten worst intersections.
      The calculated Level of Service for all ten intersections during the pm peak hour was 'A'.
      However, individual movements within any leg of these intersections may experience a
      worse than average Level of Service. The intersections analyzed were San Rafael/San
      Anselmo Avenues, Tamalpais/San Anselmo, San Anselmo/Tunstead, Pine/San
      Anselmo, San Anselmo/Woodland, Woodside/Butterfield, Carlson/Butterfield,
      Rutherford-Meadowcroft/Butterfield, Butterfield/Suffield, and San Anselmo/Scenic.
      Operational characteristics of roadways involve more than the number of lanes and
      volume traffic counts. Many of San Anselmo's residential collector streets and local
      residential streets were improved years ago when many homes in the hills were
      designed for seasonal use only and not envisioned for full-time occupancy. As a result,
      many of the residential roads are narrow, circuitous, and improperly sloped and drained
      and have associated traffic circulation and safety problems due to the level of local traffic
      they carry today. These operational characteristics have not been quantified, but are of
      common knowledge in the Town.
      3. Adequacy of Existing Roadway Systems and Needed Improvements
      Based on the finding of the DKS Corridor Study, Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, Center
      Boulevard, and Butterfield Road are not adequately designed to handle current levels of
      peak-hour traffic. Furthermore, future projected growth within and outside San Anselmo
      will add to the existing problem. The calculations of future urban growth contained in the
      DKS study found that San Anselmo will only contribute 12-17 percent of the new growth.
      Current projections of future dwelling units which will add traffic to San Anselmo's arterial
      streets are as follows:
                                                       Number of
                        Location                       Dwelling Units
                        Marin County                   500
                        Fairfax                        470-920
                        San Anselmo                    200
                                                       1,170-1,620
      Additionally, the conversion of marginal residential and commercial land in San Anselmo
      to more intensive types of use could increase the number of trips on the Town's arterial
      streets. Land use policies adopted relative to reuse of marginal sites and surplus public
      lands will have an effect on future traffic projections and needed roadway improvements.
      The citizens of San Anselmo have been clear in the past that they do not want to provide
      new or highly improved roads which may, by adding capacity, stimulate growth in other
      communities or the county, thereby increasing the number of automobile trips passing
      through the Town. The consensus has been that more automobile trips will only reduce
      the quality of residential life in San Anselmo.
      Accordingly, the only means of correlating the Land Use and Circulation Elements of the
      General Plan is to provide for the types of improvements in the roadway system which
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                    30
      will accommodate existing and planned future development. These types of
      improvements include such things as intersection widening, installation of traffic signals,
      improvements to traffic signal operations, sight distance improvements, provisions of on
      street parking bays, and possibly some roadway realignment and traffic rechannelization
      via restriping and minor lane additions.
      These types of improvements apply to all streets in San Anselmo, not just the arterial
      streets. Furthermore, San Anselmo will look to regional awareness of the Town's traffic
      circulation problems, and regional participation in terms of land use development policy
      and funding support for needed improvements.
      4. Parking Adequacy
      San Anselmo is a community which was laid out and subdivided prior to the post World-
      War-II period. At that time, families were fortunate if they had one car, and there was no
      need or foreseeable need for two-car garages or abundant parking requirements for
      commercial businesses. As a result, many, if not most of, San Anselmo's homes,
      residential streets, and older business districts do not have adequate space to
      accommodate the increasing number of automobiles owned and used by people today.
      The Town's current policies are to encourage the use of transit to reduce dependence on
      the automobile, and to limit roadway expansion to discourage use of the automobile.
      Unfortunately, these policies have not had a significant impact on the desires of people
      to own and operate automobiles.
      5. Bicycle and Pedestrian Systems
      The San Anselmo General Plan encourages the improvement of bicycle and pedestrian
      systems which will reduce the reliance on the automobile for local trips. The Town will
      continue its efforts to identify the areas which should be linked by bicycle and pedestrian
      paths, and will pursue opportunities such as grants and conditions of development
      approval to achieve a viable bicycle and pedestrian transportation system.
      C.       Circulation Goals
      San Anselmo's Circulation Element is based on a desire to preserve the natural and
      small-town character of the community. Accordingly, the Town's circulation network will
      be designed to accommodate existing and anticipated traffic, but traffic will not be
      allowed to dominate or dictate to quality of life in the community. It is the goal of the
      Town to maintain the residential quality of all local streets in the community.
      The circulation network will be designed to offer strong transit, pedestrian, and bikeway
      alternatives to the automobiles. The roadway system will be designed to funnel visitor
      traffic through the Town, and its central commercial area, as much as possible without
      requiring visitor traffic to resort to use of local streets for this passage.
      The primary goals of the Circulation Element are:
      1.       To promote a transportation network which offers strong transit, pedestrian, and
               bikeway alternatives to the automobile.
      2.       To design a roadway network which will maintain and enhance the quality of life
               on local residential streets in the community.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                  31
      3.       To make minimum improvements to the Town's arterial roadways in order to
               facilitate the flow of regional traffic through the Town, and thereby protect the
               quality of life on residential streets.
      4.       To support the creation of a subregional planning advisory board to review and
               comment on development impacting the Ross Valley Corridor, and any proposed
               improvements to roadways in the corridor. Traffic from west and central Marin will
               be taken into consideration.
      D.       Issues, Objectives, and Policies
      The following is a list of circulation and transportation issues facing San Anselmo and
      the Town's objectives and policies related to these issues. The issues have not been
      prioritized in this document.
      ISSUE: Character of Streets
      Objective 1:
      To maintain and enhance the residential quality and character of all streets in San
      Anselmo, with the exception of Red Hill Avenue and portions of Sir Francis Drake
      Boulevard, Greenfield Avenue, and San Anselmo Avenue.
      Policies:
      1.1      To protect the quality of life on residential streets by not allowing these streets to
               become traffic dominated.
      1.2      To limit the intensity of developments which may have the potential to make a
               residential street traffic dominated.
      1.3      To promote traffic safety by channelizing through traffic away from residential
               streets.
      ISSUE: Traffic Circulation--Level of Service
      Objective 2:
      To separate local through and visitor traffic to the maximum extent possible.
      Policies:
      2.1      Sir Francis Drake, Center, and Red Hill will continue to be the primary traffic
               carriers for visitor and through traffic.
      2.2      San Anselmo Avenue may be designed to provide for visitor traffic, but not
               through traffic.
      Objective 3:
      To maintain all arterial and collector roadway intersections within the Town at a level of
      service 'D' or better during peak am and pm hours.
      Policies:
      3.1      The level of service will be maintained primarily by regulating the intensity of
               development throughout the community.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                      32
      3.2    All new major developments or subdivisions will be required to submit information
             to the Town as to their effect on the level of service at impacted intersections.
      3.3    The Town will not allow the level of service to drop below 'D' unless it is judged to
             be in the public interest and consistent with other objectives and policies
             contained in the General Plan.
      3.4    The Town will not approve major roadway improvements, such as additional
             travel lanes, to local, collector, or arterial streets. Improvements to intersections,
             such as signalization and channeling of traffic, are not considered major roadway
             improvements.
      ISSUE: Preservation of Rural Character of Streets
      Objective 4:
      To discourage through traffic on residential streets and preserve their quiet rural charm.
      Policies:
      4.1    To direct through traffic away from residential areas of the Town by using such
             techniques as landscaping and traffic islands, and possibly limited street closures
             and one-way traffic controls if such limitations do not pose a problem to public
             safety.
      4.2    The roadway network for new developments or subdivisions should only show, if
             possible, street connections to identified residential connector streets or arterials.
      4.3    The traffic generated and distributed by all new projects must be within the traffic
             limits implied by San Anselmo's street classification system.
      4.4    All roadway improvements must be designed to preserve and enhance the rural
             character of San Anselmo streets.
      ISSUE: Alternative Modes of Transportation
      Objective 5:
      San Anselmo will continue to improve and expand its bikeway system.
      Policies:
      5.1    To maximize the use of local streets for regional bicycle traffic.
      5.2    To ensure that all development is consistent with San Anselmo's bikeway
             objectives, and Objective 5 of the Open Space Element.
      Objective 6:
      San Anselmo will continue to maintain and expand its pedestrian way system.
      Policies:
      6.1    San Anselmo's pedestrian way system is intended to link residential areas with
             local community destination points (i.e., parks, schools, town hall, and
             commercial areas).
      6.2    Sidewalks and walkways will be considered in new residential projects but may
             not be mandatory.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                    33
      Objective 7:
      To maintain and improve local and regional bus service.
      Policies:
      7.1    San Anselmo will continue to support efforts to maintain regional intercity and
             town bus service provided by the Golden Gate Bridge District.
      7.2    The Town will continue to support all efforts to improve local bus service within
             Marin County.
      ISSUE: Existing and Future Traffic Congestion
      Objective 8:
      To improve upon existing traffic circulation in the central commercial area, and along
      Center and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. (Also see Land Use Element Policies 5.1 and
      5.2.)
      Policies:
      8.1    To improve traffic circulation along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard by authorizing
             limited improvements such as bus turnout lanes at transit stops, improvements at
             existing intersections, additional traffic signals, and improvement in the operation
             of the existing traffic signals where appropriate.
      8.2    The Town may consider limited intersection improvements and the provision of
             turn lanes at intersections along Center Boulevard to improve traffic circulation.
      8.3    The Town may consider the provision of automobile signs in the commercial core
             to direct visitor traffic into the Town's central commercial area.
      8.4    An additional left-turn lane may be provided on arterials, collectors, and some
             local streets at Sir Francis Drake Boulevard to reduce existing delays and traffic
             queues.
      Objective 9:
      To improve existing and future traffic circulation, safety, and parking in the central
      commercial area and along Greenfield Avenue. (Also see Land Use Element Policies 5.1
      and 5.2.
      Policies:
      9.1    To undertake a study of traffic circulation and parking in these two commercial
             areas, and to adopt a long-term improvement plan for the areas.
      ISSUE: Road Access to Hillside and Ridge Properties
      Objective 10:
      To allow limited improvements to the existing narrow and circuitous roadways which
      provide access to ridge and hillside properties while maintaining their existing rural
      character. (Also see Land Use Element Policies 10.1-10.5.)
      Policies:
      10.1 The only improvements the Town will allow on existing roads which serve ridge
             and hillside properties are those necessary to improve safety and drainage. The
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                  34
              types of improvements which will be allowed include: resurfacing of existing
              paved areas, cross slope correction, small automobile turnouts, isolated
              widening, straightening of roads to correct safety hazards, placement of mirrors
              at blind curves, improved roadway drainage, and repair of existing slides along
              the roadway, or improvements similar in nature to those described herein.
      10.2    The Town will not allow widespread widening of existing roads which serve
              hillside, ridge, and open space parcels.
      10.3    Roadway extensions required to serve ridge and hillside properties shall be
              similar in character to the existing road which is being extended.
      10.4    Prior to acting on any application for development or land division on any hillside
              and ridge parcel, which is served by an existing roadway, the Town will prepare,
              and the applicant will pay for, a study of the existing road conditions. The study
              will include recommendations for improvements which are consistent with poli-
              cies 10.1 through 10.3.
      10.5    Landowners who wish to improve or subdivide their property may be required to
              submit fees or make improvements recommended in the roadway studies. The
              Town will adopt criteria for funding said improvements desired on each roadway
              serving hillside and ridge properties.
      10.6    Future development on hillside and ridge parcels will be required to provide guest
              parking onsite if the existing public or private roadway serving the property is too
              narrow to accommodate on street parking.
      Objective 11:
      To limit the type, size, weight, and number of construction equipment and vehicles used
      to improve or maintain hillside and ridge properties.
      Policies:
      11.1 The Town will require the submission and approval of a method of construction
              plan prior to the issuance of any grading or building permits for any
              improvements on hillside and ridge properties.
      11.2    The Construction Plan required by policy 11.1 shall set forth the types, size,
              weight, and number of pieces of construction equipment and vehicles a property
              owner or contractor intends to use in improving a hillside or ridge parcel. The
              Plan must also specify the route to be used to deliver equipment to the site,
              number of workers, and parking provisions for workers' vehicles, how and where
              equipment vehicles will be stored onsite, and the anticipated length of time
              needed to complete improvements.
      11.3    The Town shall have the right to modify a submitted construction plan to ensure
              compliance with other policies contained in the General Plan.
      ISSUE: Parking
      Objective 12:
      To review and update the Town's parking ordinance to reflect current trends in
      automobile size and use.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                   35
      Policies:
      12.1 The Town may consider alternatives to requiring each business to provide its
             required parking onsite within some commercial areas. However, each site will
             be required to provide the parking stipulated in the Zoning Code at some location
             in the area. The implementation of this concept will require the cooperation of all
             property owners and business people in the area.
      12.2   To identify the specific locations of parking space need areas and increase the
             number of parking spaces available for automobiles at transit stops.
      12.3   To develop additional off street parking spaces on residential roads to
             accommodate on street parking without disrupting the travel lane.
      12.4   To develop a program to provide parking bays.
      Objective 13:
      To screen off street parking from public view.
      Policies:
      13.1 All parking lots will be required to be landscaped and set back from the right-of-
             way.
      13.2   Trees should be used in parking lots to provide shade and break up the visual
             size of the lot.
      13.3   Efforts should be made to minimize the size of parking areas. For example, two
             parking areas separated by landscaping and connected by a driveway are
             preferred to one larger lot.
      ISSUE: Roadway Extensions to Adjoining Communities
      Objective 14:
      To strongly oppose the extension of any road from the Sleepy Hollow area to San Rafael
      or other communities in unincorporated Marin County
      Policies:
      14.1 The Town will prohibit the extension of any road north of Sir Francis Drake
             Boulevard or Red Hill Road into the City of San Rafael. The Town will oppose the
             extension of any through road north of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard or Red Hill
             Road to the City of San Rafael if said road is outside the Town's jurisdiction.
      ISSUE: Relationship of Development Intensity to Roadway
      Capacity
      Objective 15:
      To ensure that roadway improvements needed to serve new commercial and residential
      developments conform to the Town's street classification system and roadway
      improvement policies.
      Policies:
      15.1 To limit the intensity of a proposed commercial development and the density of a
             proposed residential development if the traffic generated by such development
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                 36
              exceeds the capacity of the street, and the roadway improvements needed to
              accommodate the new traffic are not consistent with the Town's roadway
              improvement policies.
      15.2    To limit the intensity or density of commercial and residential development if
              traffic generated by such development causes an existing street classified as
              local residential to function as a collector or arterial street. (Refer to the Roadway
              Network and Classification section of the Circulation Element.)
      ISSUE: Complete Streets
      Objective 16:
      To promote a balanced, multi-modal transportation network that meets the evolving
      needs of all users of the streets, roads, and highways for safe and convenient travel in
      the Town.
      Policies:
      16.1 Complete Streets. Provide “Complete Streets” that are safe, comfortable, and
              convenient routes for walking, bicycling, and public transportation to increase use
              of these modes of transportation, enable active travel as part of daily activities,
              reduce pollution, and meet the needs of all users of the streets for safe and
              convenient travel, including bicyclists, children, persons with disabilities,
              pedestrians, users of public transportation, seniors, youth, and families, motorists
              and movers of commercial goods, consistent with the other goals, objectives, and
              policies of this plan.
      16.2    Incorporate “Complete Streets” Design Features. The Town shall approach every
              transportation project and program as an opportunity to improve the
              transportation network for all users, and shall work in coordination with other
              departments, agencies, and jurisdictions to achieve “Complete Streets”. As
              feasible, the Town shall incorporate “Complete Streets” design features, such as
              accessible curb ramps, crosswalks, sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and paved
              shoulders, into existing streets to improve the safety and convenience for all
              users.
      E.      Implementation
      The following measures will be taken by the Town to implement the concept, objectives,
      and policies of the circulation element. All implementation measures should not be
      undertaken at the same time, but should be completed by the year 2000.
      1. Zoning Ordinance Rewrite
      The parking requirements section of the zoning ordinance shall be reviewed and revised
      to implement the concept, objectives, and policies of the circulation element. The parking
      standards should be revised to accommodate planned land use and today's smaller
      sized automobiles.
      2. Commercial Area Parking Study
      The Town in conjunction with representatives of the local business community should
      establish a committee to study the parking problems in the commercial areas, and
      recommend a solution including funding that is agreeable to all parties involved. Special
      attention should be given to the concept of creating additional shared parking among all
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                     37

      businesses. The study should focus on both the Central Business District and the
      Greenfield commercial areas.
      3. Funding of Roadway, Bikeway, and Pedestrian Improvements
      All new developments which require roadway modifications or improvements will be
      required to install and finance the entire cost of all these improvements. Long-term
      improvements expected along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, Center Boulevard,
      Butterfield Road, Red Hill Road, and local residential streets may be financed by gas tax
      funds, transportation grants, and other public monies. How-· ever, should the available
      funding not be adequate to install the necessary improvements, the Town may establish
      a traffic mitigation fee plan which estimates the cost of all improvements desired and
      charges each new development or improvement a fee based upon the number of trips it
      generates to the area during the peak hour. These fees will be used to help finance and
      pay the debt on improvements. The Town will and must seek the cooperation of the
      Town of Fairfax and the County of Marin in charging similar fees to finance
      improvements needed along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, Center Boulevard, Butterfield
      Road, and Red Hill Road.
      4. Development Review Process
      The Town will establish a development review process which requires all new
      development proposals of a medium or large scale to submit a traffic study with their
      applications which discusses the impact of the proposed development on the street
      system, and its conformance with the circulation objectives and policies of the plan. The
      cost of the study will be borne by the applicant, but will be conducted by a traffic
      consultant retained by the Town, or as part of an EIR prepared on the proposed project.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                38

      OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
          A. Introduction
      San Anselmo is a unique community, situated among the trees and hills of the beautiful
      Ross Valley. The community owes its special atmosphere in large part to the
      undeveloped ridge tops and hillsides within the town borders. These open spaces form
      natural borders that give the town and its neighbors an identity unmatched by most Bay
      Area communities. However, much of the undeveloped land in San Anselmo is private
      property whose owners have the right to develop and the Town can expect them to do
      so. Unless such property is acquired and/or dedicated for permanent preservation, as
      publicly held open space, it must be assumed that private development will occur.
      The Town recognizes that these privately owned lands are likely to be developed.
      Accordingly, the Open Space Element formulates a strategy which is designed to
      preserve priority open space lands in the Town, and in its adjacent 'sphere of influence'.
      The attainment of the open space objectives requires the cooperation of property
      owners, residents, community leaders, citizens, and elected officials of the incorporated
      and unincorporated communities adjacent to San Anselmo. Preservation of open space
      lands needs to be accomplished by balancing both the interests of the Town and the
      rights of property owners.
      B.       Current Status of Open Space
      San Anselmo is situated in a valley with a corridor developed along its center. The hills
      surrounding the Town create a distinct greenbelt around San Anselmo that separates
      the Town from other adjacent communities.
      In the south to west, Mt. Baldy and the ridgelands sloping to the north provide a beautiful
      natural backdrop to San Anselmo as well as neighboring communities.
      In the north and to the east, beyond the existing developed areas, open ridgelines and
      grassy, tree-studded slopes give residents the benefits of a rural, more open
      environment, as existed in San Anselmo around the turn of the century.
      One mutual goal of the Marin Countywide Plan and the San Anselmo General Plan is to
      preserve town identity by the preservation of greenbelts between communities. These
      buffer zones provide view corridors, recreation needs, and natural habitat for wildlife and
      are very important quality-of-life elements.
      Today, the pressure of an inflated real estate market has resulted in the loss of many of
      these valuable open space lands. Land for homes in Marin County and San Anselmo is
      becoming increasingly scarce. There is intense pressure to develop the last remaining
      lands in the Town, including the ridges and hillsides.
      Most available land in San Anselmo has already been developed. The undeveloped
      parcels remaining are located on hillsides and ridgetops and tend to be more difficult to
      build on due to remote access or geologic instability.
      There is a great misconception concerning these undeveloped lands. Many residents
      assume that these lands are public open space and will remain that way forever. In fact,
      very little of San Anselmo's "open" land is preserved as public open space. Unless these
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                  39
      lands are specifically protected--through purchase, by gift to the public, or some form of
      easement--each of the parcels has the potential of being developed. All of the parcels
      addressed in this element belong to private individuals and/or institutions.
      As an example, one of the most prominent natural features of San Anselmo, the top of
      Mount Baldy, is privately owned. Historically, this property has been used by the public
      as an outdoor recreation area. Most people erroneously believe it to be publicly owned,
      or part of the Marin Municipal Water District, thus protecting it forever from development.
      C.       Open Space Goals
      San Anselmo's open space plan is intended to:
           1. Create “open space greenbelts” which serve as separation buffers between the
               Town and adjacent communities;
           2. Protect ridgelines, including the ridge zone, and preservation of the natural
               features of hillside lands; and
           3. Protect highly visible hillside slopes and ridges from development, and maintain
               the visual presence of woodlands, riparian areas, and stream courses which are
               found on, or traverse, identified open space lands.
           4. Provide recreational areas for Town residents.
      The open space plan calls for a system of trails which will link open space lands with one
      another and with the residential areas they abut. Through integrating open space
      planning with all other physical development, San Anselmo can help assure that the
      integrity of its hillside, ridge, and stream environs will not be fragmented and their
      essence diluted and compromised into an anonymous “suburbia" that will satisfy no one.
      D.       Open Space Classification System
      The following definitions are included in the General Plan to make a clear distinction
      between parks and open space (both public and private).
      1. Parks
      Parks are public lands developed or planned for development which may include public
      facilities for active and/or passive recreation for residents and groups engaging in
      programmed recreation activities.
      2. Public Open Space
      Land owned by a governmental agency which has public access for nature study, hiking,
      etc. Such lands are to be left in their natural state, with no improvements more extensive
      than trails and fire breaks.
      3. Private Open Space
      Lands which remain in private or institutional (tax exempt) ownership and upon which
      the public may or may not have the privilege of entering. Such lands are open space by
      virtue of restrictions on the owner's right to develop, which may occur through:
                      a.    Zoning based on public safety considerations (e.g., geologic hazard,
                            flooding, etc.).
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                  40

                     b.    A relinquishment of development rights in one location for additional
                           development rights in another location.
                     c.    Agreements by private owners to retain their land in agricultural use or
                           as scenic open space for tax considerations.
                     d.    The preservation of lands for open space as a condition of approval of
                           a sub­ division or planned unit development or by other legal devices.
      E.      Issues, Objectives, and Policies
      The following is a list of open space issues facing San Anselmo, and the Town's
      objectives and policies relative to these issues. The issues have not been prioritized in
      this element.
      ISSUE: Protection and Maintenance of Open Space Lands
      Objective 1:
      To protect from development those open space parcels which contribute directly to the
      Town's identity, its sense of separate place in relation to other communities, and the
      quality of life in the community. The properties which meet this criteria are listed in
      Appendix A.
      Policies:
      1.1     The Town will determine the relative importance of the properties listed in
              Appendix A in terms of their open space value.
      1.2     The Town, in conjunction with one or more of the following agencies: the County
              of Marin, Fairfax, Ross, San Rafael, and the Marin County Open Space District,
              will establish a program for acquisition and preservation of priority open space
              properties.
      1.3     The Town may sponsor community and areawide meetings, exhibits, and events
              to raise community awareness with regard to open space needs in San Anselmo
              and the surrounding area.
      1.4     Any landowner or developer who intends to submit a land division or other
              development proposal for all or a portion of property listed in Appendix A will be
              required to meet with the San Anselmo Open Space Committee prior to
              submitting any development application.
              The Committee must meet with the applicant within thirty (30) days of notification
              to discuss the Town's open space objectives and options for development. The
              applicant will be required to submit a written report of the findings of this meeting
              with the development application.
      1.5     The Town's hillside and ridge protection policies and development densities will
              be used to protect the open space values of the properties listed in Appendix A if
              efforts to purchase open space have failed. Such efforts will include the
              establishment of lands designated as private open space.

Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                 43
      F.        Implementation
      There are many options available to implement the objectives of the Open Space
      Element. These options are summarized below.
      1. The Marin County Open Space District (MCOSD)
      The Marin County Open Space District, established in 1972 is a tax-supported agency.
      The District has been instrumental in obtaining large tracts of land throughout the County
      for open space. Through the District, properties bordering San Anselmo and other areas
      adjacent to Sorich Ranch have been purchased and preserved as open space.
      Cooperation between the MCOSD and other communities resulted in the purchase of
      the "Sun Valley Open Space” area. This area borders San Anselmo and was acquired
      with major funding from MCOSD. This successful project was achieved through the joint
      efforts of San Rafael, San Anselmo, and MCOSD and through a local assessment
      district.
      County participation through MCOSD is limited by financial constraints and certain policy
      restrictions. Funds for purchase are limited and priorities are determined by a number of
      factors, including the extent of local commitment to public open space. The District can
      participate in financing the purchase of land along with other private or public entities.
      The District is legally allowed to fund only up to its own appraised value of property.
      2. Local Assessment Districts
      The purpose of assessment districts is to have the people most affected or benefited pay
      for those benefits. In the case of an open space assessment district, those property
      owners benefiting from the open space would pay some of the acquisition costs.
      Assessment districts are often viewed as the "grass roots" way of raising money toward
      the purchase of open space lands.
      An assessment district can be of any size and legally its boundaries must be continuous.
      For example, owners of property within a district's boundaries are polled and asked to
      commit to the purchase of specific parcels for public open space. If the owners of 60% of
      the land areas within the assessment district sign a petition indicating they wish to be
      assessed for a particular purchase, the Town Council can establish the assessment
      district. A lien is placed on each owner's property, committing the owner to pay a
      specified amount each year over a period of 20 to 30 years. However, assessments can
      be less than 20 years if desired. The MCOSD can also establish assessment districts,
      and an assessment district can include property in Town/City and County jurisdictions
      (with approval of both).
      The principal advantage of assessment districts is that payment for the acquisition can
      be "spread out" over 20 to 30 years.
      The major disadvantages are that financing, legal, and administrative costs tend to run
      higher than some alternative financing measures, and the establishment of the District
      boundaries can become difficult and arbitrary.
      3. General Obligation Bonds
      California municipalities can issue General Obligation Bonds to finance the acquisition of
      real property. These bonds are secured by the full faith and credit of the issuing
      government entity that has the authority to use property taxes to service the debt. The
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                 44

      security on General Obligation Bonds is of the highest quality. Therefore, the interest
      rates on these bonds is generally the lowest of any public security.
      Local property taxes can now be set above the 1% limitation of Proposition 13 to support
      General Obligation Bonds if the proposed issue is approved by two-thirds of those voting
      in a local election.
      The principal advantage of General Obligation Bonds is the favorable interest rate to be
      paid and the 20-30 year term of payment.
      The disadvantages are the cost of holding the election, the difficulty of attaining the two-
      thirds vote, and the cost of debt service is still substantial.
      4. Mello-Roos Bonds (Community Facilities Districts)
      Mello-Roos Community Facilities District Bonds (CFD) are a relatively new method of
      providing long-term tax-exempt financing. The CPD is created and adopts a plan to
      accomplish the financing objectives of the District. Payment for an open space purchase
      under this plan comes from assessments placed upon properties within the District.
      Assessments can be levied with considerable flexibility, such as an ad valorem tax
      (based upon the value of the taxpayer's property), a flat rate tax, or any option that is a
      benefit to the District. A 51% vote is needed to approve the District. If successful, the
      District issues debentures that are retired over a 20-30 year period.
      The advantages of a CFD are the need for only a 51% approval vote and the ability of
      the District to include areas outside the Town limits. It would be possible, therefore, to
      include areas outside and adjacent to San Anselmo that are within the Town's "sphere of
      influence."
      The main disadvantage of a CFD is that interest rates would be higher, thereby making
      debt service more costly.
      5. Grants
      There are various entities that give grants for the preservation of open space. The Marin
      Community Foundation and other charitable organizations have recognized the
      environment as a funding category for endowment.
      6. Planning Options
                       a.      Preservation through Dedication
      Developers can be required to deed land for open space as part of their development
      agreements in San Anselmo.
      In the past, the Town has sought the dedication of private open space in development
      agreements. While access to these private open space lands may be restricted, the
      preservation of private open space land in its natural state is valuable.
                       b.      Public Access Easements across Private Lands
      An excellent method of preserving open space lands is to gain public access over
      private properties. This is especially important when public lands lie beyond private
      properties. The easement affords a way for the public to have access to these lands.
                       c.      Conservation Easement
      In conservation easements, development rights are acquired by the public for all or part
      of a property while ownership is retained by the property holder. A good example of this
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                   45
      is in West Marin, where the Marin Agricultural Land Trust is acquiring conservation
      easements to allow agriculture to continue.
                      d.     Density Transfer
      In some cases, mutual benefit can occur by transferring development rights from
      targeted open space parcels to other parcels. This has the effect of preserving open
      space while allowing for development elsewhere.
      7. Miscellaneous Options
                      a.     Open Space Endowment Fund
      Create a permanent endowment fund for the purpose of acquiring and preserving open
      space in San Anselmo. This gives citizens a convenient way of deciding the future of
      San Anselmo. This gives citizens a convenient way of deciding the future of San
      Anselmo.
                      b.     Fundraising Events
      Raise funds as well as raise community awareness with a 10-kilometer Ridge Run,
      family walks, slide shows, bird walks, and wildflower walks.
      8. Prioritize Open Space Parcels
      The Town will review the comprehensive list of open space parcels contained in
      Appendix A of the General Plan, and will evolve a prioritized list of parcels to hopefully
      acquire if funding can be found or generated through private interest groups or initiative
      efforts.
      The disadvantage of public ownership of open space is that associated with
      maintenance and liability exposure. These two factors can add substantially to the cost
      of ownership of these properties, and should be considered when any purchase of open
      space land is contemplated.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                 46
      CONSERVATION ELEMENT
      A.       Conservation Goals
      1.       Minimize environmental harm and the disruption of natural features, particularly
               in hillside and unstable soil areas.
      2.       Protect creeks from pollution and against any unnecessary disturbance of the
               natural contours and vegetation of the banks.
      3.       Establish policies and practical guidelines for the prevention of erosion, the
               stabilization of soils, and the protection of the watershed necessary to minimize
               excessive water runoff.
      4.       Preserve and protect significant habitats for fish, wildlife, and flora.
      5.       Preserve ridgetops * and other locally important natural or man-made historic
               areas or features.
      6.       Preserve historic or architecturally important buildings.
      7.       Protect the scenic value of San Anselmo by reasonably regulating signs, bill-
               boards, unsightly uses, and the placement of utilities.
      B.       Conservation and Environmental Policy Guidelines
      This plan recommends that the following policies apply throughout the planning area.
      Specific standards will be developed for applying these principles where they do not
      already exist.
      1.       Air, water, and noise pollution shall be prevented or minimized.
      2.       Radioactive, chemical, and biological health hazards shall not be created, and
               existing levels shall be reduced.
      3.       Activities causing damage to hydrological and biological processes shall be
               discouraged.
      4.       Streams shall be maintained in or restored to their natural state. A flood channel
               maintaining the natural settings on San Anselmo Creek and Sleepy Hollow Creek
               shall be of adequate width and properly maintained to allow passage of flood
               waters and preservation of riparian vegetation and habitat. Removal of
      * The Bald Hill ridgetop extends from the 800 foot level in Ross on the south to the 400 foot level
      near the San Anselmo/Fairfax boundary on the north. The Red Hill ridgetop extends roughly from
      east to west above the 300 foot level as shown. The Sunny Hills ridgetop extends from Memorial
      Park on the west to the San Anselmo boundary on the east. The Indian Rock system of ridgetops
      lies above 300 feet, north of Sorich Park. The Camino de Herrera ridgetop extends from the 400
      foot level at the end of Camino de Herrera northward to the upper end of Woodside Drive at the
      500 foot level. The perimeter ridgetop extends from the 400 foot level near the Fairfax/San
      Anselmo boundary northward along upper Oak Springs Drive to the northwest apex of the San
      Anselmo boundary, then northward, eastward, and finally southward around Sleepy Hollow to an
      end at the 500 foot level in San Rafael east of the northeast boundary of Sorich Park.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                          47
              vegetation on the hillsides should be closely controlled in order to minimize
              erosion, siltation of watercourses, and runoff.
      5.      Unique geological, ecological, and historic sites shall be protected:
              a.       Significant natural features shall be included for preservation in their
                       natural state and in an appropriate setting in any design or plan.
              b.       It is hereby declared to be the intent of the Town to preserve all buildings
                       of architectural or historical merit, as may be designated by the Council
                       from time to time, and to that end the Town shall withhold any razing
                       permit for a period of one (1) year allowing time for the people of San
                       Anselmo to consider whether they wish to assist in the maintenance or
                       acquisition of such properties.
      6.      A diversity and abundance of wildlife and waterlife shall be maintained or
              encouraged where it does not now exist. Vegetation and animal habitats shall be
              preserved wherever possible.
      7.      Construction shall be located and designed to avoid or minimize the hazards
              from earthquake, erosion, landslides, floods, fire, and accidents.
      8.      Adequate parks and recreation facilities and open space shall be provided.
      9.      Structures, parks, and other areas modified by man, where people spend most of
              their time, shall be healthful, safe, quiet, and of good design, both functionally
              and aesthetically.
      10.     Projects shall not overburden the water supply, fire protection, waste disposal,
              schools, traffic and circulation, or other services and facilities, or adversely affect
              the financial or social environment of the community.
      11.     Water supply, flood control, waste water and solid waste disposal, soil
              conservation, and open space preservation shall be coordinated to create the
              greatest public benefit and the least degree of environmental damage.
      12.     Visual qualities and view potential of both natural and man-made settings shall
              be an equal consideration with other factors in any project review. Tree cutting
              and other activity detrimental to trees that enhance the character of the town or
              neighborhood shall be avoided wherever possible.
      13.     The Town and County shall take measures to reduce existing and future ineffi-
              cient or unnecessary energy or natural resources consumption. † Recyclable and
              biodegradable materials shall be utilized and used materials shall be recycled or
              reused whenever possible.
      14.     A residential and commercial review policy consistent with the goals of the San
              Anselmo General Plan and Marin Countywide plan should be developed to
              control rapid or disruptive population and economic growth.
      † The State Secretary for Resources has recently required that Environmental Impact Reports
      contain mitigation measures to reduce inefficient and unnecessary consumption of energy.
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                      48

      15.    The Town and County intend to cooperate in preserving contiguous open space
             areas within the San Anselmo planning area and each agency should refer any
             proposed rezoning, development, or subdivision in its area to the other for
             appropriate hearings and recommendations.
      16.    It is the intent of the Town Council and Board of Supervisors to provide for only
             such urbanization as is necessary to achieve community goals and carry out the
             adopted San Anselmo General Plan by specifically adopting the accompanying
             map entitled "San Anselmo Conservation and Open Space Plan" as a specific
             plan and element of the General Plan for the planning area and to commence
             hearings immediately, leading to the rezoning and prezoning of open space as
             indicated by the map.
      C.     Other Environmental and Public Safety Concerns
      1.     Fire Hazard: In areas which lack sufficient water pressure, and/or access for fire-
             fighting equipment, or areas which have a concentration of inflammable materials
             the development review process should require proper remedial measures as a
             condition of approval.
      2.     Smog: The Air Pollution Control District has estimated that if further increases in
             pollutant emissions were to continue at the rate which occurred during the '50s
             and '60s there is a strong likelihood that air quality standards in the Ross Valley
             would be violated a significant number of times per year. For this reason, in
             addition to those specified in the Circulation Element, it is recommended that
             further increases in auto travel in the Ross Valley be avoided.
      3.     Rift Zones and Earthquake Faults: The geological information now available
             does not indicate the presence of active faults or rift zones in the planning area.
             However, when the text of the State Division of Mines survey of the San Anselmo
             area is completed, it will deal with earthshaking and other seismic hazards
             disclosed by the field investigations. This information, plus the regulatory
             measures to ensure public safety, should be incorporated into a more detailed
             seismic safety element. It is highly probable that most of the areas with seismic
             hazards are closely correlated with the areas of geologic hazard and steep
             slopes already designated as open space.
      4.     Emergency and Evacuation Routes: In addition to Red Hill Avenue and Sir
             Francis Drake Boulevard, special access for emergency vehicles is recom-
             mended via Fawn Drive in Sleepy Hollow to Ridgewood Drive in San Rafael and
             Esmeyer Drive in Terra Linda, and via Sunnyhills Drive to 5th Avenue in San
             Rafael (as depicted in the San Rafael General Plan). Another special
             “emergency vehicles only" route should be maintained open to connect Oak
             Springs Drive in San Anselmo and Willow Avenue in Fairfax.
      D.     Implementation
      Outlined below are some means of implementing the recommendations of this element.
      Achievement of the land use goals involves the use of government regulation, principally
      zoning and land use management methods to achieve the objectives desired from open
      space and conservation programs. Acquisition techniques mainly involve use of
      government fiscal resources including tradeoffs for tax reductions.

      TOWN PARKS, RECREATION, AND PUBLIC
      FACILITIES ELEMENT
      The Town does not need to anticipate a significant increase in public park, recreation
      and facility needs under the growth projections of this plan. However, there are a
      number of deficiencies in each area which should be remedied by a public acquisition
      program.
      A.       Parks and Recreation Goals
      "Provide Recreational Areas for the Residents."
      Discussion: The National Recreation Association minimum standard of four (4) acres of
      usable recreation space for each 1,000 residents would require about 56 acres (14 x 4)
      of playgrounds or parks § in the Town. If Sorich Ranch Park is relegated to its proper
      classification as public open space (see definitions in charter on open space), then the
      Town has only about 16 acres of parks. This deficiency will be hard to overcome in a
      community with most of its flatland already developed. However, this lack of opportunity
      is partially offset by opportunities for outdoor recreation in the open spaces surrounding
      the Town, provided access to them is expanded and maintained in conformity with the
      plan.
      B.       Parks and Recreation Recommendations
      1.       Isabel Cook School multi-purpose building should be refurbished and used as a
               community center in order to provide a meeting place for many of the local
               groups who do not have an adequate facility at present.
      2.       Park and Recreation offices should be located at the Isabel Cook School or
               moved into quarters vacated by other civic functions, depending on the Town
               Hall site alternatives finally chosen. Memorial Park would still require an office,
               but Isabel Cook School's multi-purpose building would provide more space.
      3.       The community's needs for a swimming pool, tennis courts, and adjacent play
               fields could be met at Sorich Ranch provided these facilities could be made
               compatible with the open space amenities of the rest of the area. Other
               possibilities which should be explored in providing for these needs are the
               possible acquisition of the entire Isabel Cook School site or acquisition of the
               Fairfax Town and Country Club by the County with maintenance and manage-
               ment jointly provided by the Towns of Fairfax and San Anselmo.
      4.       Neighborhood mini-parks and playgrounds should be acquired for the Hawthorn
               Hills, Sequoia Park, and Hilldale areas of the Town.
      5.       Public art of a durable kind should be an addition to the Town park system.
      § Parks are defined for the purpose of this plan as "public lands developed or planned for
      development, which will contain public facilities for active and passive recreation for residents and
      groups engaging in programmed recreation activities."
Town of San Anselmo General Plan                                                                            52

      6.      The Log Cabin site adjacent to Memorial Park should be incorporated into the
              park, when surplus to the needs of the present owner.
      7.      Resting spaces along trails and street approaches to trails and bikeways should
              be part of the recreational facilities provided in support of public non-auto use of
              open spaces. This would be even further facilitated by trailhead and bikeway
              terminal amenities.
      C.      Public Facilities
      1.      Town administration, public works, and public safety functions are presently
              conducted in inadequate or rented space. Recommendations ** for alleviating this
              condition are:
              a.      Relocate the present Fire Department headquarters and Firehouse No. 1
                      to the corner of San Rafael Avenue and San Anselmo Avenue. Firehouse
                      No. 2 on Butterfield will remain at its present location.
              b.      The present Town Hall site should be expanded by the acquisition of 15
                      Magnolia Avenue, plus perhaps the five parcels between City Hall Ave-
                      nue, Library Place, and Tunstead Avenue.
              c.      A further acquisition of the business properties between the present Town
                      Hall site, Magnolia and San Anselmo avenues should be explored for
                      future acquisition to square off the Town's government center, particularly
                      if other public functions are to be accommodated in the Town.
              d.      City Hall Avenue adjacent to the Civic Center site should be closed and
                      made a part of the Center.
              e.      Library Place should be extended as appropriate to serve the public facili-
                      ties area.
              f.      The present corporation yard and municipal shop should be made visually
                      compatible with the Sarich Ranch Park setting by use of fencing, land-
                      scaping, and the demolition of obsolete and visually disturbing buildings.
                      One possibility which should be explored further in capital improvement
                      programming would be to leave the site as a corporation yard only and
                      farm out auto maintenance.
      2.      Sanitary Service
              The present collection system is operating near capacity. Population growth
              should not exceed the progress made in bringing the sanitary sewer system up to
              regional standards and expanding its capacity for collection and treatment of
              wastes.
      3.      Storm Drainage and Flood Control
              The natural appearance and runoff capacity of stream channels should be pro-
              tected, preserved, and enhanced by the development of small improvements
      ** Based on discussions with the Town's site consultants (Wagstaff & McDonald), Town
      Administrator, and Public Works Director.

             (e.g., small earth-fill dams for storm water retention) and landscaping rather than
             a major flood-control project such as the concrete channel in lower Corte Madera
             Creek. The channel lines on both sides of San Anselmo Creek should be
             protected from encroachment by development.

      NOISE ELEMENT
      A.      Noise Goals
      Reduce noise level throughout the community in general with special efforts aimed at
      our major circulation arteries. ††
      B.      Implementation
      1.      Promulgate information to all residents of the need for and methods of obtaining
              reduced noise levels.
      2.      Adopt, budget for, and enforce an effective noise ordinance and other ordinances
              relating to noise reduction.
      3.      The Town shall cooperate in the establishment of a countywide program of noise
              abatement when it has been developed.
      4.      The Town will work actively with the California Highway Patrol to police noise
              levels on moving vehicles.
      †† The objective of the Town should be to reduce the noise levels approximately 5 or 6 decibels in
      the next few years, based on the contours of present noise levels which have been mapped in
      quantitative, numerical terms by Roger Maineri and the Town Public Works staff.

      SCENIC HIGHWAYS (PARKWAY) ELEMENT
      A.      Definition
      The Scenic Highways through San Anselmo are: Red Hill Avenue, Sir Francis Drake
      Boulevard from Ross line to the Fairfax Town limits, and Center Boulevard from the Hub
      to the Fairfax Town limits.
      B.      Goals
      Improve the appearance and aesthetic quality of the planning area's main thoroughfares,
      especially the entryways to the community.
      Discussion: There are no state highways and therefore no possibilities for state
      designated scenic highways in San Anselmo, nor are any contemplated.
      C.      Implementation
      1.      San Anselmo has three entryways, all of which could be improved by
              landscaping, improved signing, lighting, and other outdoor design features.
      2.      Divided highways in the planning area should have their landscaping, lighting,
              and street furniture upgraded in keeping with a common design theme that will
              visually signal that one has arrived and is moving through a different community.
