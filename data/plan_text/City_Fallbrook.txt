                                       CHAPTER 5 CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
Introduction
  Purpose and Scope
The primary focus of the Conservation and Open Space Element is to provide direction to future growth and
development in the County of San Diego with respect to the following:
    ■ The conservation, management, and utilization of natural and cultural resources
    ■ The protection and preservation of open space
    ■ The provision of park and recreation resources
Open space is defined as any parcel or area of land or water that is essentially unimproved and devoted to
open space use. There is not a specific Open space section in this Element. Open space issues are addressed
in every section of this document.
Population growth and development continually require the use of both renewable and nonrenewable
resources. Goals and policies provided in this General Plan Element are divided into nine sections that
address the following:
    ■ Biological Resources—Land use-based conservation goals and policies that protect the ecological and
       lifecycle needs of threatened, endangered, or otherwise sensitive species and their associated
       habitats.
    ■ Water Resources—Conserve and efficiently use water and protect the groundwater aquifer, water
       bodies, and water courses, which include reservoirs, rivers, streams, and the watersheds located
       throughout the region.
    ■ Agricultural Resources—Minimize land use conflicts, preserve agricultural resources, and support the
       long-term presence and viability of agricultural industry as an important component of the region’s
       economy and open space linkage.
    ■ Cultural Resources—Federal and State legislation such as the National Environmental Policy Act
       (NEPA), National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), and California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
       establish requirements to ensure cultural resources are protected and preserved. This section
       supplements this legislation with goals and policies that set the framework for local ordinances and
       regulations that protect these important cultural resources.
    ■ Paleontological Resources and Unique Geologic Features—Preserve the County’s rich geologic and
       paleontological history by establishing achievable land-use-based goals and policies.
    ■ Mineral Resources—Manage the remaining mineral deposits while striving to ensure that adequate
       resources are available to support the economic prosperity of future generations of San Diego County
       residents.
    ■ Visual Resources—Protect scenic corridors, geographically extensive scenic viewsheds, and dark skies
       within the natural environment.
    ■ Air Quality, Climate Change, and Energy—Reduce the emissions of criteria air quality pollutants,
       emissions of greenhouse gases, and energy use in buildings and infrastructure, while promoting the
       use of renewable energy sources, conservation, and other methods of efficiency.

INTRODUCTION
    ■ Park and Recreation Facilities—Ensure that adequate park and recreational facilities will adequately
        serve current and future residents.
  Guiding Principles for Conservation and Open Space
The Guiding Principles for the General Plan are introduced in Chapter 2. Guiding Principles 3, 4, 7 and 8 are
relevant to the Conservation and Open Space Element. The conservation of natural resources and the
preservation of open space are essential actions required to realize the overall vision of this General Plan,
along with the achievement of the County’s strategic initiatives.
The Conservation and Open Space Element establishes goals, policies, and programs that value and protect
natural resources to ensure they are available for the future. Primary objectives of the Conservation and
Open Space Element are to preserve the diverse range of visual, natural, and cultural resources that
exemplify the County. The Element strives to minimize the impact of future development in areas with
significant visual, natural, and cultural resources and supports the creation and enhancement of important
habitat preserves and open space areas that are well managed and maintained. The Element also promotes
efficient use of water and other natural resources and strives to ensure the long-term sustainability of non-
renewable resources. The Element also supports the preservation and creation of parks, recreational
facilities, and open spaces.
Energy production, transportation, and consumption are key contributors to greenhouse gases affecting
climate change, poor local air quality, and a variety of other sustainability challenges. The Conservation and
Open Space Element encourages and supports land use development patterns and transportation choices
that reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases. In addition, the Element encourages renewable energy
production, along with efficient energy use in buildings and infrastructure and minimizes the impacts of
projects that can generate air pollutants.
The Conservation and Open Space Element also sets forth goals and polices that minimize agricultural land
use conflicts and support the long-term presence and viability of the County’s agricultural industry.
  Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The effectiveness of the Conservation and Open Space Element depends upon its integration with the other
elements comprising this General Plan. Elements that share topics, issues, and policy direction with the
Conservation and Open Space Element include Land Use, Mobility, Housing, Noise, and Safety.
Primary objectives of the Land Use Element are to minimize future development in areas with significant
natural resources that are identified in the Conservation and Open Space Element; along with areas that may
be affected by natural hazards that are identified in both the Conservation and Open Space and Safety
Elements. In addition, the Land Use Element encourages the development of vibrant and healthy
communities, of which park and recreation facilities are an integral part. The Land Use Element also balances
the availability of water with future development, while the Conservation and Open Space Element
establishes policies that protect and conserve water resources to ensure they are available for future
supplies. The Land Use and Mobility Elements also include goals and policies that address Climate Change by
fostering land use patterns that facilitate a reduction in vehicle miles traveled and by planning for

transportation networks that encourage other modes of travel rather than the single-occupant motor
vehicle.
The purpose of the Safety Element is to establish policies related to future development that will minimize
the risk of personal injury, loss of life, property damage, and environmental damage associated with natural
hazards, as identified in both the Conservation and Open Space and Safety Elements. The Safety Element
identifies floodplain locations throughout the County, while Figure C-2 (Floodwater Accommodation)
identifies the rivers, creeks, streams, flood corridors, riparian habitats, and land that may accommodate
floodwater for purposes of groundwater recharge and stormwater management. The Mobility Element
includes regional trails and bikeways, which are major recreational assets for the region.
This Element also has connections to the Housing and Noise Elements. Regarding the Housing Element, the
goals and policies contained in this Element affect where and how housing is planned and developed, such as
requiring development to avoid sensitive resources. With regard to noise issues, biological resources can be
adversely affected by noise. Additionally, the mining of mineral resources typically has noise, traffic, air, and
groundwater impacts that must be addressed.

  Biological Resources
CONTEXT
The San Diego region is recognized as one of the most biologically important areas in the United States, and
one of the most biologically diverse areas in the world.1 The diversity of species found in the San Diego region
can be attributed to the wide variety of vegetation and habitats associated with the region’s range of micro-
climates, topography, soils, and other natural features. Unincorporated lands comprise the largest
geographical area in the County with natural features that include lagoons, foothills, mountain ranges, and
deserts. Today, the San Diego region supports over 400 sensitive plants and animals, ranging in sensitivity
from common to critically endangered. All of this diversity is part of the San Diego region’s unique natural
heritage and a legacy for future generations.
H ABITATS & S PECIES
The physical and climatic conditions found in the San Diego region provide for a wide variety of habitats and
biological communities. These communities are associations of plants, animals, fungi, and microbes. Different
habitat types may occur separately or be intermixed, but because they have different characteristics, they
often support unique assemblages of species.

COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                           5-4                                      GENERAL PLAN

GOALS AND POLICIES
The San Diego region’s unique attributes have resulted in a relatively large number of endemic species in the
area, that is, species that are only found in a limited geographic location. For example, 26 plant species in the
County are found nowhere else in the world2. When combined with habitat loss from urban, rural, and
agricultural development, the result is that the County is home to an exceptional number of rare, threatened,
endangered, or otherwise sensitive species. Both wildfire events and invasive plant and animal species
further disrupt native habitat regeneration and pose a threat to conservation of native habitat and endemic
species.
Waterways and their associated riparian vegetation provide important habitat values for wildlife, including
several rare species of birds. Moreover, wetlands provide important water quality functions such as pollutant
removal, floodwater retention, and greenhouse gas reduction. Valuable wetland resources in the County
have been reduced from past development such that they must be protected, along with adjacent upland
habitats, to maintain their functions and values.
Protecting the region's resources requires coordination and cooperation with other governmental and non-
governmental entities, such as SANDAG, adjacent jurisdictions, California Department of Fish and Game, U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, California
Regional Water Quality Control Board, California Coastal Commission, and various conservation
organizations.
W ILDLIFE C ORRIDORS AND H ABITAT L INKAGES
Significant portions of the County are publicly owned, including areas designated as open space preserves
and parks, National Forests, and State Parks. The County strives to work harmoniously with all such entities
to achieve common goals. Important wildlife corridors and linkages have been identified to provide
connections between areas of undeveloped lands, especially to significant public lands. Species that are well-
distributed across their ranges are less susceptible to extinction than species confined to small portions of
their range. Therefore, maintaining large, inter-connected blocks of habitat containing sizable and diverse
populations of sensitive species is superior to a fragmented landscape with undersized populations.
Figure C-1 (Habitat Conservation Programs) identifies existing preserve areas, along with areas where a
connected system of preserves will be established as additional easements are recorded for open space
and/or lands are acquired for public benefit.

GOALS AND POLICIES
Wildlife corridors and linkages function better when they
support sufficient native habitat conducive for wildlife
movement. Linkages are landscape level, regional
connections between core habitat areas. They consist of
a variety of upland and riparian habitat types which
provide resources for year-around foraging, nesting, and
local dispersal. Corridors are more local movement paths
for species that typically follow naturally occurring paths.
The San Diego region is an important part of the Pacific
Flyway, one of the major migration routes for birds
between Alaska and Central and South America. Some
migrant birds use parts of the County as winter habitat Escondido Creek serves as a wildlife corridor in the
or as stopover sites for resting and feeding. Stopover San Dieguito Community Planning Area
sites are just as critical to bird conservation as breeding habitat. Many spring migrants coming north from the
Gulf of California or along the west coast of mainland Mexico use the San Diego region, with its
comparatively low mountains, as a corridor for crossing the mountains to reach the Pacific coast.
Local migration of birds and other wildlife is also important. For example, in the San Diego region, western
bluebirds breed in the mountains but migrate to the coastal lowlands and other warmer regions for the
winter. Many of the larger mammals in the County, such as mountain lions, mule deer, and bobcats, move
between blocks of habitat as part of their daily routine searching for food, water, and shelter. Inter-
connected habitats are also important to prevent isolation of populations of plants and animals.

 Water Resources
CONTEXT
The County relies upon a safe and reliable supply of this most basic necessity for its quality of life and
economic prosperity. Not only do the County’s clean water resources provide drinking water, but they also
sustain the County’s rich natural environment. Water resources may be classified as surface water, which
collects in streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and groundwater, which resides in subsurface aquifers.
While surface water can drain through the County’s watersheds, it can also be infiltrated into the subsurface
saturated zone to become groundwater, a resource that many residents of the unincorporated County
depend upon. Aquifers are recharged at varying rates depending upon a number of factors, primarily the
amount and frequency of rainfall. On average, the County’s coastal areas see less than ten inches of rain per
year, the mountain peaks in excess of 40 inches, and the deserts less than three inches. Not only must the
County have sufficient quantities of groundwater, but the water must also be of a sufficient quality.
Figure C-2 (Floodwater Accommodation) identifies the rivers, creeks, streams, flood corridors, riparian
habitats, and land that may accommodate floodwater for purposes of groundwater recharge and stormwater
management.
Watersheds facilitate the collection and transportation of sediments and pollutants that can degrade water
quality and damage downstream environments. Lakes and reservoirs capture flows from many of these
watersheds. Watershed management relates to sustaining watersheds at an acceptable level of quality,
contributing to resource surface and subsurface quality, and maintaining groundwater supplies.
The County of San Diego is divided into two hydrologic
regions—the Colorado Hydrologic Region (CHR) which
drains in an easterly direction into the Salton Sea and the
San Diego Hydrologic Region (SDHR) which drains in a
westerly direction toward the Pacific Ocean and
encompasses most of the County, parts of southwestern
Riverside County and southwestern Orange County. The
watersheds, areas into which surface run-off, streams, Lake Jennings

Groundwater aquifers and local surface water reservoirs are of great importance to providing an adequate
water supply for communities that are not served by imported water. It is critical to protect the water quality
found in the local drinking water reservoirs and aquifers to ensure a continual source of drinking water, as
well as increasing local supplies through recycling and conservation efforts. Imported supplies also help to
replenish local groundwater basins. The City of San Diego has seven water reservoirs in the unincorporated
County that are crucial to protecting habitat. These reservoirs include Barrett, El Capitan, Hodges, Morena,
Otay, San Vicente, and Sutherland.
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California imports water from the Colorado River and Northern
California. This water is distributed to water purveyors in San Diego County. The Metropolitan Water District
(MWD) sets the targets for lowering demands and securing the necessary supplies in the Integrated
Resources Plan (IRP). The so-called “Preferred Resource Mix” is identified based on extensive technical
modeling, IRP workgroups, and stakeholder involvement. The 2004 MWD IRP assumed that new local
efforts—both increasing supplies and lowering demands—would meet the needs of population growth.
Given the challenges facing imported supplies, it is widely expected that the 2009 IRP will have an even
greater focus on control of demand through recycling and conservation efforts. (For additional information
on water supply and how agencies are planning to meet future demands, refer to the Land Use Element,
Community Services and Infrastructure section.)
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL COS-4
Water Management. A balanced and regionally integrated water management approach to achieve
the long-term viability of the County’s water quality and supply.
COS-4.1 Water Conservation. Require development to reduce the waste of potable water through use of
           efficient technologies and conservation efforts that minimize the County’s dependence on
           imported water and conserve groundwater resources.
COS-4.2 Drought-Efficient Landscaping. Require efficient irrigation systems and in new development
           encourage the use of native plant species and non-invasive drought tolerant/low water use plants
           in landscaping.
COS-4.3 Stormwater Filtration. Maximize stormwater filtration and/or infiltration in areas that are not
           subject to high groundwater by maximizing the natural drainage patterns and the retention of
           natural vegetation and other pervious surfaces. This policy shall not apply in areas with high
           groundwater, where raising the water table could cause septic system failures, moisture damage
           to building slabs, and/or other problems.
COS-4.4 Groundwater Contamination. Require land uses with a high potential to contaminate
           groundwater to take appropriate measures to protect water supply sources.
            Potential sources of groundwater contamination include, but are not limited to, landfills, fertilizer, pesticide,
            manure storage and sales, petroleum product storage tanks, manufacturing plants, and on-site wastewater
            treatment systems.
COS-4.5 Recycled Water. Promote the use of recycled water and gray water systems where feasible.

GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL COS-5
Protection and Maintenance of Water Resources. Protection and maintenance of local reservoirs,
watersheds, aquifer-recharge areas, and natural drainage systems to maintain high-quality water
resources.
Water conservation is also addressed in Goal COS-19 in the “Air Quality, Climate Change, and Energy” section below.
Policies
COS-5.1 Impact to Floodways and Floodplains. Restrict development in floodways and floodplains in
          accordance with policies in the Flood Hazards section of the Safety Element.
           Development in floodways and floodplains has the potential to alter natural hydrologic flow and cause soil
           erosion and increased stormwater runoff—including loss of wetland and health issues related to surface and
           groundwater contamination.
COS-5.2 Impervious Surfaces. Require development to minimize the use                  Impervious surface area impairs
          of directly connected impervious surfaces and to retain                     groundwater recharge and
          stormwater run-off caused from the development footprint at or              contributes to stormwater runoff
          near the site of generation.                                                and heat retention.
COS-5.3 Downslope Protection. Require development to be appropriately sited and to incorporate
          measures to retain natural flow regimes, thereby protecting downslope areas from erosion,
          capturing runoff to adequately allow for filtration and/or infiltration, and protecting downstream
          biological resources.
COS-5.4 Invasive Species. Encourage the removal of invasive species to restore natural drainage systems,
          habitats, and natural hydrologic regimes of watercourses.
COS-5.5 Impacts of Development to Water Quality. Require development projects to avoid impacts to the
          water quality in local reservoirs, groundwater resources, and recharge areas, watersheds, and
          other local water sources.
           Protecting reservoir water quality requires that the quality of the water entering the reservoirs is maintained
           or improved. Pollutants of high concern are nutrients and related algae, total organic carbon, and total
           dissolved solids.

  Agricultural Resources
CONTEXT
The County of San Diego is the only major urban county
with a farm gate value3 consistently ranked among the top
ten agricultural counties (ranked eight for several years) in
California.4 The County has the fourth highest number of
farms of any county in the country and third highest
number of farms of any county in California.5 Agriculture is
the fifth largest component of the County’s economy.6
Agriculture in the County provides an array of economic,
environmental, and social benefits that contribute to the
quality of life in the region. Agriculture also provides a
valuable open space resource and plays a critical role in Agricultural uses in Julian
regional wildlife conservation by providing usable open space corridors and habitat for some species.
The resources that support the County’s agriculture are unique. Unlike other jurisdictions across the nation,
farming in San Diego is dependent upon the region’s unusual microclimates and often has very little
relationship to the quality of the soils. Much of the County’s climate supports a year-round growing season
that facilitates successful small farms and crop diversification producing over 200 agricultural commodities
including high value specialty crops, nursery products, and a variety of fruits. Only six percent of the San
Diego region’s soils are classified as prime agricultural soils. The small percentage of prime soils, the small
farm size, and the high value of agriculture in the region highlights the uniqueness of farming in the County.
                                                                         A number of issues create pressures and stresses

  The farm gate value of a cultivated product in agriculture or aquaculture is the net value of the product when it leaves the
farm, after marketing costs have been subtracted. Since many farms do not have significant marketing costs, it is often
understood as the price of the product at which it is sold by the farm (the farm gate price). The farm gate value is typically
lower than the retail price consumers pay in a store as it does not include costs for shipping, handling, storage, marketing and
profit margins of the involved companies.

          existing agricultural operations from encroachment
          of incompatible land uses by doing the following:
             ■ Limiting the ability of new development to take
                 actions to limit existing agricultural uses by
                 informing and educating new projects as to the
                 potential impacts from agricultural operations Agriculture in semi-rural area near Ramona
             ■ Encouraging new or expanded agricultural land uses to provide a buffer of non-intensive
                 agriculture or other appropriate uses (e.g., landscape screening) between intensive uses and
                 adjacent non-agricultural land uses
             ■ Allowing for agricultural uses in agricultural areas and designing development and lots in a
                 manner that facilitates continued agricultural use within the development.
             ■ Requiring development to minimize potential conflicts with adjacent agricultural operations
                 through the incorporation of adequate buffers, setbacks, and project design measures to
                 protect surrounding agriculture
             ■ Supporting local and State right-to-farm regulations
             ■ Retain or facilitate large and contiguous agricultural operations by consolidation of
                 development during the subdivision process
           Discourage development that is potentially incompatible with intensive agricultural uses, including schools
           and civic buildings where the public gather, daycare facilities under private institutional use, private
           institutional uses (e.g., private hospitals or rest homes), residential densities higher than two dwelling units
           per acre, and offices and retail commercial.

           uses and multi-use trails that are compatible with agriculture adjacent to the agricultural lands
           when planning for development adjacent to agricultural land uses.
            Recreational and open space uses can serve as an effective buffer between agriculture and development
            that is potentially incompatible with agriculture uses.
COS-6.4 Conservation Easements. Support the acquisition or voluntary dedication of agriculture
           conservation easements and programs that preserve agricultural lands.

           operations to protect watersheds, reduce GHG emissions, conserve energy and water, and utilize
           alternative energy sources, including wind and solar power.
  Cultural Resources
CONTEXT
Our cultural past has helped shape our present community and will continue to create our future.
Archaeological and historic resources, known collectively as cultural resources, are the tangible or intangible
remains left by ancestral people who made and used them. Cultural resources, found throughout the County
of San Diego, are irreplaceable reminders of the County’s prehistoric and historic past that continues to have
value for communities today. These resources can provide clues to prehistoric and historic human behaviors,
and provide scientific, religious, and other valuable educational information about our cultural past. In
addition, these resources such as sacred places and traditional cultural properties continue to influence and
have value for the County’s living tribal people. The cultural environment encompasses both the built (post-
1769) and the archaeological environments, which include both prehistoric and historic archaeological sites.
Cultural resources are found throughout the County and include not only physical evidence of the past such
as Native American rock shelters, and pictographs but the intangible evidence such as traditional cultural
lands and sacred sites. Examples of historic cultural resources (the built environment) include homes, barns,
bridges, fountains, and silos. In 2008, the County of
San Diego had more than 23,000 recorded cultural
resource sites and this number continues to grow.

GOALS AND POLICIES
Policies
COS-7.1 Archaeological Protection. Preserve important archaeological resources from loss or destruction
        and require development to include appropriate mitigation to protect the quality and integrity of
        these resources.
         The importance of archaeological resources must be evaluated from the perspective of the affected
         community, including local tribes, in addition to the definitions contained in the California Public Resources
         Code. Input from the affected community on the importance of cultural resources through the consultation
         process is important in determining what resources should be preserved and what constitutes appropriate
         mitigation.
COS-7.2 Open Space Easements. Require development to avoid archeological resources whenever
        possible. If complete avoidance is not possible, require development to fully mitigate impacts to
        archaeological resources.
         Avoidance of archaeological resources is normally achieved through the design of the development project
         in conjunction with the use of open space easements that protect the resources. If complete avoidance is not
         possible, other forms of mitigation, including data recovery excavations and the incorporation of
         archaeological features into the project design on a case-by-case basis may be appropriate. The
         determination of what constitutes adequate mitigation should be based on meaningful consultation with
         the affected community, including local tribes.
COS-7.3 Archaeological Collections. Require the appropriate treatment and preservation of archaeological
        collections in a culturally appropriate manner
         The determination of what constitutes appropriate treatment and preservation of archaeological collections
         should be based on existing federal curation standards in combination with consultation with the affected
         community, such as the tribes. Many collections should be placed in a local collections curation facility that
         meets federal standards per 36 CFR Part 79. The proper storage and treatment of these collections should
         also be based on consultation with the affected community, such as the tribes. In addition, existing federal
         and state law governs the treatment of certain cultural items and human remains, requires consultation,
         and in some circumstances, repatriation. The County is committed to conduct an inventory of collections it
         holds or are held by cultural resources consulting firms.
COS-7.4 Consultation with Affected Communities. Require consultation with affected communities,
        including local tribes to determine the appropriate treatment of cultural resources.
         Consultation should take place with the affected communities concerning the appropriate treatment of
         cultural resources, including archaeological sites, sacred places, traditional cultural properties, historical
         buildings and objects, artifacts, human remains, and other items. The County is required by law, Senate Bill
         18 Protection of Traditional Tribal Cultural Places (SB-18), to consult with the appropriate tribes for projects
         that may result in major land use decisions including General Plans, General Plan Amendments, Specific
         Plans and Specific Plan Amendment. In addition to these types of permits, it is County policy to consult with
         the appropriate tribes on all other projects that contain or are likely to contain, archaeological resources.
         Consultation may also include active participation by the tribes as monitors in the survey, testing,
         excavation, and grading phases of the project.
COS-7.5 Treatment of Human Remains. Require human remains be treated with the utmost dignity and
        respect and that the disposition and handling of human remains will be done in consultation with
        the Most Likely Descendant (MLD) and under the requirements of Federal, State and County
        Regulations.
         Human remains, including ancestral Native American remains, should be left undisturbed and preserved in
         place whenever possible. For most development permits, this is required by the County’s Resource Protection

          discovered during any phase of an archaeological
          investigation, the requirements of State and local
          laws and ordinances, including notification of and
          consultation with appropriate tribal members, must
          be followed in determining what constitutes
          appropriate treatment of those remains.
COS-7.6 Cultural         Resource        Data      Management.
         Coordinate with public agencies, tribes, and Alpine Women's Club is located in the former Alpine
         institutions in order to build and maintain a Hall built in 1899
         central database that includes a notation
         whether collections from each site are being curated, and if so, where, along with the nature and
         location of cultural resources throughout the County of San Diego.
          This database should be accessible to all qualified individuals while maintaining the confidentiality of the
          location and nature of sensitive cultural resources, such as archaeological sites. The County maintains a
          partnership with the local repository of the database, the South Coastal Information Center at San Diego
          State University, which provides direct access by qualified County personnel to the database so that the
          information it contains may be used to design development projects to avoid cultural resources at an early
          point in the process.
GOAL COS-8
Protection and Conservation of the Historical Built Environment. Protection, conservation, use,
and enjoyment of the County’s important historic resources.
Policies
COS-8.1 Preservation and Adaptive Reuse. Encourage the preservation and/or adaptive reuse of historic
         sites, structures, and landscapes as a means of protecting important historic resources as part of
         the discretionary application process, and encourage the preservation of historic structures
         identified during the ministerial application process.
          Historic buildings, objects, trails, landscapes and districts are important parts of the multi-cultural heritage
          of San Diego County and should be preserved for the future enjoyment and education of the County’s diverse
          populations. Preservation and adaptive reuse of these resources should be encouraged during the planning
          process and an emphasis should be placed on incentives for preservation, such as the Mills Act property tax
          program, in addition to restrictions on development, where appropriate.
COS-8.2 Education and Interpretation. Encourage and promote the development of educational and
         interpretive programs that focus on the rich multicultural heritage of the County of San Diego.
          The County should continue to develop educational and interpretive programs that focus on the history of
          San Diego County, including but not limited to the important historical resources located on County parks,
          such as the Adobe at Rancho Penasquitos and Rancho Guajome. Such programs should be for residents and
          visitors of all ages from all communities and should include docent and self-guided tours, interpretive
          signage, kiosks, informational pamphlets, books and other audio-visual materials.

  Paleontological Resources and Unique Geological Features
CONTEXT
P ALEONTOLOGICAL R ESOURCES
Paleontological resources are the fossilized remains and/or traces of prehistoric life—both plant and
animal—as well as sedimentary formations in which they occur and the locations where they may be
collected. Fossils are generally older than 10,000 years, a temporal boundary marking the end of the glacial
Pleistocene Epoch and the beginning of the warmer Holocene Epoch in which we live today. For planning
purposes, paleontological resources exclude human remains, which are considered cultural resources.
In the San Diego region, fossils typically occur in undisturbed sedimentary rock layers beneath the soil and
sometimes may be found in surface outcrops. These fossils are limited and non-renewable. They are
considered unique and worthy of preservation when they contain a unique or unusual assemblage of fossil
organisms, provide paleo-biological information, provide insight to prehistoric life, or are the best example of
its kind in the region.
The County can be divided into three distinct geomorphic regions—the Coastal Plain, the Peninsular Ranges,
and the Salton Trough (the desert). Each region is characterized by different climatic, topographic, biological,
and geologic settings. Correspondingly, each region contains geologic deposits that are associated with
particular types of fossils, some of which are unique within the context of California and even the United
States. Since fossils form in sedimentary rocks, most of the fossils in the San Diego region are in the Coastal
Plain and Salton Trough strata. In the plutonic Peninsular Ranges, fossils occur only in valleys and other
environments where material eroded from the mountains was transported down hill and deposited.
U NIQUE G EOLOGICAL R ESOURCES
The San Diego region has a rich geologic history. Unique geological features are those that are locally or
regionally unique in the context of the geologic history of California. They may include particular rocks or
strata that explain or result from geologic processes that have affected the County and that lend themselves
to scientific study.
The present landforms that characterize the San Diego region are the result of a series of geologic events
spanning millions of years. These events include intrusive emplacement of magma, regional volcanism, large-
scale erosion, river- and ocean-derived sedimentation, local faulting and uplift, and hydrothermal processes.
The scale of some of the resulting unique geologic features, such as entire rock formations, can be much
larger than the scale of other natural resources in the County. The conservation/preservation of these large-
scale features is not necessarily needed or desired, as long as examples of them remain represented in the
County. The County defines a “unique geologic feature” as a site that exhibits distinctive characteristics, is
exclusive to the region, or provides a key piece of geologic information important in the study of geology or
geologic history. Examples may include unique rock outcrops (e.g., natural bridge), type localities of named
geologic formations (e.g., type locality of Scripps Formation in the sea cliffs north of Scripps Institute of
Oceanography), information-rich geologic exposures (e.g., cliff face exposing faulted sedimentary layers), or
unique landform (e.g., Round Mountain in Jacumba Valley, which represents a volcanic plug).

GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL COS-9
Educational and Scientific Uses. Paleontological resources and unique geologic features conserved
for educational and/or scientific purposes.
Policies
COS-9.1 Preservation. Require the salvage and preservation of unique paleontological resources when
              exposed to the elements during excavation or grading activities or other development processes.
COS-9.2 Impacts of Development. Require development to minimize impacts to unique geological features
              from human related destruction, damage, or loss.
  Mineral Resources
CONTEXT
Mineral resources are vital to community development and economic prosperity and also support
recreational, educational, and scientific pursuits. The County’s supply of accessible mineral resources is finite
and exhaustible. Management of the remaining mineral deposits is important to ensure adequate resources
are available to support the economic prosperity of future generations of County citizens.
M INERAL R ESOURCES OF S AN D IEGO C OUNTY
The State Geologist has classified certain areas of the County as underlain by significant mineral deposits.
These areas are identified as Mineral Resource Zone 2 (MRZ-2) on the maps prepared by the California
Geological Survey (Figure C-4 [Mineral Resource Zones]). Some of these areas have also been designated by
the State Mining and Geology Board as containing mineral resources of “statewide or regional significance.”
The term “mineral resource” refers to a concentration or occurrence of a naturally occurring material in such
form or amount that economic extraction of a commodity is currently potentially feasible. In San Diego
County, there are three general categories of important mineral resources, including construction materials,
industrial and chemical mineral materials, and metallic and rare materials. Although mineral resources of all
types are economically important, the continued availability of construction aggregate for the development
of roads, homes, buildings, and other infrastructure is essential to the economy of the County. While the
County is underlain by vast quantities of mineral deposits from which aggregate can be produced, urban
development has encroached upon many existing and potential future mining sites. This development and
other non-compatible land uses has reduced or eliminated access to many of the local important mineral
deposits.
Two mineral classification reports have been completed for San Diego County; these include (1) Mineral Land
Classification: Aggregate Materials in the Western San Diego County Production-Consumption Region7 and
(2) Update of Mineral Land Classification: Aggregate Materials in the Western San Diego County Production-

GOALS AND POLICIES
Consumption Region.8 The latter 1996 report concluded that aggregate reserves significantly decreased since
the 1982 study and that Portland cement concrete (PCC)-grade aggregate reserves within Western San Diego
County were enough to supply the demand for 20 years (until 2016). The report further concluded it was
unlikely all identified resources would be mined as access to resources could be substantially restricted by
competing conservation measures, such as the MSCP program.
As a result, few new mining sites have been recently permitted in the County and the aggregate production
rate from existing local mining sites has not kept pace with demand. The total permitted aggregate resources
as of January 2006 were 198 million tons, a 28 percent decrease from January 2001.9 The permitted
aggregate resources represent only 17 percent of the 50-year estimated demand (year 2006 to 2056) of
1,164 million tons. To meet demand, substantial volumes of aggregate are being imported from quarries
located outside of San Diego County. Due to increased transportation costs, the price for aggregate in the
County is among the highest in the State of California. The total permitted area of local mining facilities
contains less than a 50-year supply of aggregate for the County. Thus, maintaining access to mineral
resources, especially the remaining undeveloped MRZ-2 classified lands, is important for the future economic
activity of the County.
P ERMITTING AND R ECLAMATION OF M INING S ITES
In order for a new mining site to be operated, the California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA)
requires that a permit is granted by the local lead agency (the County), and a Reclamation Plan prepared

GOALS AND POLICIES
consistent with the minimum standards for reclamation listed in Article 9, Section 3700 et seq. of the State
Mining and Geology Board reclamation regulations. The Reclamation Plan is subject to approval by the
County in coordination with the California Department of Conservation.
R ECYCLING OF C ONSTRUCTION M ATERIALS
Although not a mining activity, the recycling of construction materials collected from demolished buildings,
roadways, or other facilities can incrementally increase the local availability (i.e. production rate) of
construction materials and extend the lifespan of existing mining operations. (Recycling also extends the
lifespan of local landfills.)
GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies listed below are intended to achieve the following:
    ■ Assure an adequate supply of mineral resources to support the economic activity projected to occur
       under the County General Plan.
    ■ Comply with the requirements of the SMARA with regard to the conservation of mineral resources,
       and the permitting and reclamation of mining sites.
GOAL COS-10
Protection of Mineral Resources. The long-term production of mineral materials adequate to meet
the local County average annual demand, while maintaining permitted reserves equivalent to a 50-
year supply, using operational techniques and site reclamation methods consistent with SMARA
standards such that adverse effects on surrounding land uses, public health, and the environment
are minimized.
Policies
COS-10.1 Siting of Development. Encourage the conservation (i.e., protection from incompatible land uses)
           of areas designated as having substantial potential for mineral extraction. Discourage
           development that would substantially preclude the future development of mining facilities in
           these areas. Design development or uses to minimize the potential conflict with existing or
           potential future mining facilities. For purposes of this policy, incompatible land uses are defined
           by SMARA Section 3675.
COS-10.2 Protection of State-Classified or Designated Lands. Discourage development or the establishment
           of other incompatible land uses on or adjacent to areas classified or designated by the State of
           California as having important mineral resources (MRZ-2), as well as potential mineral lands
           identified by other government agencies. The potential for the extraction of substantial mineral
           resources from lands classified by the State of California as areas that contain mineral resources
           (MRZ-3) shall be considered by the County in making land use decisions.
COS-10.3 Road Access. Prohibit development from restricting road access to existing mining facilities, areas
           classified MRZ-2 or MRZ-3 by the State Geologist, or areas identified in the County Zoning
           Ordinance for potential extractive use in accordance with SMARA section 2764.a.

                                        CHAPTER 5 CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
COS-10.4 Compatible Land Uses. Discourage the development of land uses that are not compatible with the
           retention of mining or recreational access to non-aggregate mineral deposits.
           See Policy COS-10.1 for a definition of incompatible land uses.
COS-10.5 Reclamation Plans. Require all mining projects to be conducted in accordance with a reclamation
           plan that meets the minimum reclamation standards required by the California Surface Mining and
           Reclamation Act and the associated State Mining and Geology Board regulations. Require the
           reclamation plan to include a phasing plan that provides for the completion of the surface mining
           on each segment of the mined lands so that the reclamation can be initiated at the earliest
           possible time on those portions of the mined lands that will not be subject to further disturbance
           by the surface mining operation.
COS-10.6 Conservation of Construction Aggregate. Encourage the continued operation of existing mining
           facilities and streamline the permitting of new mining facilities consistent with the goal to establish
           permitted aggregate resources that are sufficient to satisfy 50 years of County demand.
COS-10.7 Recycling of Debris. Encourage the installation and operation of construction and demolition
           (C&D) debris recycling facilities as an accessory use at permitted (or otherwise authorized) mining
           facilities to increase the supply of available mineral resources.
COS-10.8 New Mining Facilities. Develop specific permit types and procedures for the authorization of new
           mining facilities that recognize the inherent physical effects of mining operations and the public
           necessity for available mineral resources adequate to meet local demand, in accordance with PRC
           Section 2762.
COS-10.9 Overlay Zones. Provide zoning overlays for MRZ-2 designated lands and a 1,300-foot-wide buffer
           area adjacent to such lands. Within these overlay zones, the potential effects of proposed land use
           actions on potential future extraction of mineral resources shall be considered by the decision-
           makers.
  Visual Resources
CONTEXT
Visual resources are diverse in nature. They are found both within the natural environment and the built, or
human-made, environment. Visual resources can be valued both objectively and subjectively based on their
quality, uniqueness, prominence, relationship to community identity, and economic contributions, such as to
land values and tourism. Visual resources are important from an aesthetic perspective when, based on the
characteristics summarized above; they are identified as containing significant scenic value.
While existing visual resources can be preserved or enhanced, the urban growth anticipated by this General
Plan provides opportunities to identify or even create new visual resources, both within existing communities
and in new growth areas. Goals and policies in this section emphasize the protection of scenic corridors and
dark skies within the natural environment and the recognition and enhancement of community character
within the built environment.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                      5-24                                 GENERAL PLAN
GOALS AND POLICIES
L ANDSCAPE /S ETTING
The landscape of the San Diego region is rich in natural open space, unique topographic resources, and scenic
vistas. These natural features contribute greatly to the overall quality of the existing visual setting
experienced by viewers within the County. Urban land uses are focused in the western third of the County,
while the eastern two-thirds are largely undeveloped with mountains and desert dominating the landscape.
The County of San Diego has three distinctive geographic regions, listed from west to east:
    ■ Low-lying Coastal Plain
    ■ Mountainous Peninsular Range
    ■ Desert Salton (Imperial) Basin
The diversity of these regions provides San Diego County residents and visitors with an array of natural vistas
and scenic environments that provide a unique aesthetic collection from the ocean to the desert.
Throughout these three distinctive geographic provinces are vast amounts of publicly owned lands that
provide open space and visual relief from the human-made environment. Examples include the Marine Corps
Base Camp Pendleton on the Coastal Plain in northern San Diego County; the Cleveland National Forest in the
Peninsular Range; and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in the Salton (Imperial) Basin. In addition to these
examples of large expanses of open space, County parks, habitat preserves, reservoirs, and undeveloped
lands contribute to the County’s open space lands and overall aesthetic resource value.
Aesthetic value is not limited to open space and rural lands, but also can be demonstrated through
architectural design, or in historic structures and districts, streetscapes, and manufactured landscapes.
Within the “developed” environment, scenic features can include built uses such as structures of historic
significance or architectural merit, open but developed areas such as expansive agricultural fields or groves,
and the individual form and character of a unique neighborhood or community. These valuable aesthetic
elements of the human-made environment can be found throughout the County. A well-known example is
the historic gold-mining community of Julian.
S CENIC C ORRIDORS
A highway corridor generally includes the land adjacent to and visible from the vehicular right-of-way. The
dimension of the corridor is usually identified using a motorist’s line of vision and may include viewshed,
extending to the horizon. A “scenic highway” can pertain to any freeway, highway, road, or other vehicular
right-of-way along a corridor with considerable natural or otherwise scenic landscape.
State Scenic Highways are those highways that are either officially designated by Caltrans or are eligible for
designation. This statewide system of scenic highways is part of the Master Plan of State Highways Eligible for
Official State Designation as Scenic Highways. A highway may be designated as “scenic” depending upon how
much of the natural landscape can be seen by travelers, the aesthetic quality of the landscape, and the
extent to which development intrudes upon the traveler’s enjoyment of the view.
A highway’s status changes from “eligible” to “officially designated” when the local jurisdiction adopts a
scenic corridor protection program, applies to Caltrans for scenic highway approval, and receives notification
from Caltrans that the highway has been designated as an official State Scenic Highway. Two County routes
have been designated State Scenic Highways; these include (1) State Route 78 through the Anza-Borrego

GOALS AND POLICIES
A STRONOMICAL D ARK S KIES
Astronomical research has contributed to a greater understanding of our solar system, supported advances
in space travel, improved telecommunication systems, advanced weather forecasting, and provided insight to
energy production. The maintenance of dark skies in San Diego County is vital to the two world-class
observatories that depend on them for astronomical research. The five criteria for a high-quality site include:
(1) Elevation over 5,000 feet above sea level; (2) clear, cloud-free night sky; (3) proximity to the Pacific
Ocean; (4) distance from urban areas; and (5) freedom from nearby sources of light, dust, and smoke. Sites in
the United States that meet these criteria are found only in west Texas, central New Mexico, Arizona, the
central California coast, and the San Diego region.
The two sites in the County of San Diego, which meet all of the above criteria, include Palomar and Mount
Laguna Observatories. The maintenance of dark skies in the County is vital to their operation and the
astronomical research carried out at these facilities. Palomar Observatory, located 5,500 feet at the top of
Palomar Mountain in northern San Diego County near Palomar Mountain State Park, is privately owned and
operated by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and is used to support some of California’s and
the United States’ premier scientific research programs. San Diego State University (SDSU) and the University
of Illinois operate the Mount Laguna Observatory jointly. Located at an altitude of 6,100 feet on the eastern
edge of the Cleveland National Forest near the Anza-Borrego State Park, 45 miles east of downtown San
Diego, the Mount Laguna Observatory is one of the County’s best astronomical research and education
facilities.

  Air Quality, Climate Change, and Energy
CONTEXT
There is a strong correlation between land use planning, transportation system planning, and the emission of
air quality pollutants, greenhouse gases (GHG) that contribute to global climate change (GCC) and criteria
pollutants that degrade air quality within a region. The primary opportunities to reduce air quality pollutants
and GHG emissions are in the urbanized areas of the County where there are land use patterns that can best
support the increased use of transit and pedestrian activities since most GHGs and air pollutants result from
mobile source emissions. The unincorporated County can also be a part of the solution by producing
development patterns that contribute to reducing the dependence on the automobile and by promoting
development with lower energy demands.
The development of sustainable communities contributes to both the reduction in overall air pollutants as
well as solving the larger challenges associated with GCC. A holistic approach to achieving sustainable
communities requires the integration of a regionwide multi-modal transportation system with a significant
reduction in the reliance on single-occupant motor vehicles, along with buildings that consume less through
design and efficient building materials.
A IR Q UALITY
The boundaries of the San Diego Air Basin are contiguous with the political boundaries of San Diego County,
including the incorporated cities, and encompass approximately 4,260 square miles. The County is divided by
the Laguna Mountain Range with peaks that exceed 6,000 feet, which runs approximately parallel to the
coast about 45 miles inland and separates the coastal area from the desert. To the north of the County are
the Santa Ana Mountains which run along the Orange County coast, turning east to join with the Laguna
Mountains near the San Diego-Orange County border.
Air pollutant emission sources in the San Diego Air Basin are typically grouped into two categories: stationary
and mobile sources. Mobile source emissions can be attributed to vehicles and transportation related
activities. Stationary sources can be further divided into two major subcategories: point and area sources.
Point source emissions originate from manufacturing and industrial processes. Area source emissions are
generated from residential heaters, small engines, and other consumer products. They are widely distributed
and may have a cumulative effect.
According to readings from the ten monitoring stations operated by San Diego APCD, the County has
experienced substantial improvement in ambient ozone levels. The number of days above the Federal one-

hour ozone standard has decreased from 39 days in 1990 to zero days in 2005, while the number of days
above the more stringent State standard has decreased from 139 days in 1990 to 16 days in 2005. However,
in 2004, the County of San Diego was designated a basic non-attainment area for the new eight-hour ozone
standard.
Transportation is California's largest source of carbon dioxide, with passenger vehicles and light duty trucks
creating more than 46 percent of total climate change emissions.10 Toxic air contaminants (TAC) include
pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer or other adverse health effects such as respiratory irritation
or reproductive effects. The regulatory structure for TAC is different than for criteria pollutants. In San Diego
County, motor vehicles and natural sources are key contributors of TAC, emitting more than 27 million
pounds; while industrial, commercial, and government facilities emit more than three million pounds of TAC.
Since 1989, emissions from industrial and commercial sources reduced by approximately 75 percent.
Prioritizing and reducing these emissions further will require a continued, cooperative effort by the public,
industry, environmental groups, the California Air Resources Board (ARB), and the California Air Pollution
Control District (APCD).
C LIMATE C HANGE
The natural “greenhouse effect” allows the earth to remain warm and sustain life. GHGs trap the sun's heat
in the atmosphere, like a blanket, and help determine our climate. The amount of GHGs in the atmosphere is
being drastically altered by human activity. The onset of the industrial revolution and the increased
consumption of fossil fuels (wood, coal, gasoline, etc.) have substantially increased atmospheric levels of
GHGs. Temperatures rise as atmospheric concentrations of GHGs (such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons) increase. Over time, this rise in temperatures results in climate change. GHGs
have been at the center of the widely contested political, economic, and scientific debate surrounding GCC.
State legislation California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 requires that the State’s global warming
emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by year 2020. Through more efficient land use patterns, promoting a
variety of modes of transportation, and encouraging new and existing development to implement a variety of
energy efficient, energy conserving and renewable technologies and practices, the County is supporting the
legislation and providing the mechanism for reduced emissions throughout the region.
Human activities produce GHGs. For example, burning fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas for energy
to power automobiles, homes, and factories put carbon dioxide into the air. While carbon dioxide is the GHG
emitted in the largest quality, other GHGs such as methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorocarbons also contribute
to the problem. In California, carbon dioxide accounts for approximately 84 percent of all the GHGs, while
methane makes up approximately eight percent, and nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons contribute an
additional six percent and two percent, respectively.
The principal sources of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are fossil fuel combustion and wildland fires.
Agriculture is a major source of both methane and nitrous oxide, with additional methane coming primarily
from landfills. Cars also emit methane and nitrous oxide. In California, more than half of fossil fuel emissions
of carbon dioxide are related in some way to transportation. Fossil fuels account for 98 percent of carbon
dioxide emissions, with a two percent contribution from several industrial processes that produce carbon

GOALS AND POLICIES
dioxide as a by-product.11 Buildings contribute to 40 percent of GHGs worldwide, though this is likely to be
less in the County due to the rural characteristics of many areas.
Countywide, over a million tons of organic materials are disposed of in landfills annually, with approximately
200,000 tons disposed from the unincorporated County. Currently operating and closed landfills are
significant sources of GHG emissions. An estimated 50 million cubic feet of methane and carbon dioxide are
released daily from both closed and active County landfills, but other more potentially impactive greenhouse
emissions are also released such as volatile organic carbon gases. Emissions result from the decomposition of
organic materials in the anaerobic condition present in landfills.
Although methane recovery systems are placed on closed landfills, the majority of the methane generated by
anaerobic decomposition occurs either prior to the recovery system’s placement or is not captured by this
system. Sequestering carbon through composting stabilizes the carbon in the soil materials, resulting in a
very slow release of carbon dioxide and effectively prevents the formation of methane, which is 24 times
more retentive of atmospheric heat than carbon dioxide. Capturing methane by anaerobic digestion of
agricultural manures and burning the gas for the production of electricity on the farm is also very effective in
reducing methane emissions.
E NERGY & S USTAINABLE D EVELOPMENT
San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) is a regulated public utility that provides electric service to 3.4 million
customers within a 4,100-square-mile service area that encompasses 25 cities throughout San Diego and
southern Orange Counties. In 2003, the three key energy agencies in California—the California Energy
Commission (CEC), the California Power Authority (CPA), and the California Public Utilities Commission
(CPUC)—came together to adopt an Energy Action Plan that identifies joint goals for California’s energy
future and sets forth a commitment to achieve these goals through specific actions. In 2008, an Energy
Action Plan Status Update was released to incorporate the CEC’s 2007 Integrated Energy Policy Report (IEPR),
reflecting the passage of Assembly Bill 32, the California Global Warming Act of 2006. The IEPR includes
advanced policies, intended to enable California to meet its energy needs in a carbon-constrained world. The
report also provides a comprehensive set of recommended actions to achieve these policies. SDG&E’s Long
Term Resource Plan (LTRP) sets forth a strategy of mixed resources to ensure long-term, reliable, and
affordable power in the region, as established by the CPUC. The CPUC regulates energy issues related to
supply, delivery, rates, and tariffs for all SDG&E customers in the County.
Population is the primary driver of increasing demand for new housing. From the 1980s to the 1990s, the
rate of growth of population diminished, however, electricity consumption grew by 29 percent, and natural
gas consumption grew by 36 percent. In 2001, with the electricity crisis, there was a significant drop in per
capita consumption of energy. SANDAG has projected that the population of the San Diego region will grow
38 percent by 2030, resulting in nearly four million people. Therefore, the demand for energy will also rise as
this new population seeks ways to cool/heat and light their homes and power their cars.

                                        CHAPTER 5 CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
Energy and water are inextricably linked, especially in Southern California, where moving imported water
around the State requires large amounts of energy. For example, the California State Water Project uses
more energy than any single user. Therefore, reducing water use can save significant amounts of energy.
Energy efficiency, a key to meeting long-term energy needs, implies using less energy to perform the same
function. Conserving energy or “doing without”, and using energy more efficiently by doing the same task
with less energy, are methods where the County can promote to extend the supply of energy, with minimal
to no adverse impacts. Installing lighting that uses less electricity, installing additional insulation to reduce
heating and cooling requirements, and switching to a vehicle with better gas mileage are energy efficiency
measures. Conservation connotes “doing without” in order to save energy rather than using less energy to do
the same thing. For example, turning off lights, turning down the air conditioner, and making fewer vehicle
trips are all conservation measures.
Renewable sources include everything from small rooftop solar photovoltaic applications to larger renewable
developments such as the Kumeyaay Wind project. While the large projects can supply energy to many
thousands of homes, they generally require new transmission lines, which can result in land use and
aesthetic impacts, along with an increased risk of wildfires. San Diego County depends on fossil fuels and
natural gas to generate a large portion of its energy and power. These resources are non-renewable, and can
be polluting. It is likely that non-renewable resources will become a more scarce and costly method of
producing energy in the future. Other sources of energy can be derived from technologies such as methane
recovery at landfills, roof-top solar panels and solar farms, wind turbines, bio-fuels, and rarer projects such as
those that harness geothermal or tidal energy. These technologies are renewable, and can supplement
existing non-renewable sources, extending the supply of non-renewable fuels and offering an alternative to
polluting energy sources.

  Parks and Recreation
CONTEXT
This section identifies how the County of San Diego intends to meet the public need for parks and recreation
opportunities. This section also identifies how the County intends to meet open space needs including
building out the inter-connected preserve system (refer to Goal COS-1) and meeting General Plan goals and
County strategic initiatives. The Mobility Element addresses the regional trail network, which further
enhances and augments public recreational opportunities and experiences throughout the San Diego region.
It should be noted that there are a wide range of park and recreation opportunities within the San Diego
region provided by cities, state entities, federal entities, special districts, school districts, and private non-
profit organizations in addition to those provided by the County:
    ■ Local Parks—Local parks range in acreage
       depending on the uses and community or
       neighborhood they serve, and may be
       associated with joint use facilities such as
       schools. Typically, local parks contain
       recreation areas such as a community
       center, athletic fields, or facilities of special
       interest to the community. Smaller local
       parks may be located within or near town
       centers, where they can be used as common
       recreation and gathering areas by the
       community.                                        The Valle de Oro Community Park is located to the south of
                                                         the City of El Cajon and to the east of the city of La Mesa.
    ■ Regional     Parks—Regional parks serve
       County residents and visitors and are often larger than 200 acres, although smaller facilities may be
       appropriate for specific sites of regional interest. Regional parks include a variety of passive and active
       recreational uses and may include an interpretive center. Most regional parks contain open space,
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                      5-39                                       GENERAL PLAN

                                       CHAPTER 5 CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
       natural resources, cultural resources, and multi-use trails. Most regional parks also contain a local park
       element by serving as the recreation outlet for a community.
    ■ Trails—Trails provide recreational opportunities and allow for enjoyment by the public of parks and
       open space preserves. Trails provide connection between recreation uses. The County Trail Program is
       addressed in detail in the Community Trails Master Plan.
    ■ Recreation Facilities—Recreational facilities include community centers, teen centers and gymnasiums
       and are operated and maintained by County staff, volunteers, and service contracts.
    ■ Preserves—Preserves include areas of environmental significance and beauty. The dual purpose of
       preserves is to protect biological, cultural, and historical resources, as well as community character,
       and to make these resources available for public recreation opportunities. However, typically only
       minimal improvements such as trails, parking, and restroom facilities are found in preserves. Some
       preserves may also provide interpretive or educational amenities. Preserves vary in size depending on
       the resources being protected, and public access can be limited according to the sensitivity of the
       resources (see also Goal COS-1 and related policies in the Biological Resources section).
Open space in the County is provided by cities, the
County, State entities, federal entities, special
districts, private non-profit organizations, and land
owners as part of the development process. The
primary objective of open space within the MSCP
preserve system is biological conservation. Open
space may also be dedicated / preserved to meet
other objectives such as preservation of cultural
resources or avoidance of steep slopes. However,
open space in general allows for the overall vision
of this General Plan, along with the achievement of
the County’s strategic initiatives, to be met. Other Grasslands being preserved as open space in Ramona
land uses, such as passive recreational opportunities, may be appropriate within open space areas depending
on the sensitivity of the resources being protected. In addition to the Park and Recreation goals and policies
concerning Open Space, see also goals and policies under the Biological Resources and Cultural Resources
sections in this Element.
Existing sources of funding for park acquisition and development include federal, state, and local funds,
donations, and through developer exactions. The Park Lands Dedication Ordinance (PLDO) provides funding
for local park active recreation. The PLDO specifies that new subdivisions are required to dedicate active park
land or pay a fee in-lieu of dedication, or a combination of both, at a level of three acres per 1,000
population. State law allows for up to five acres per 1,000 population if the current active park acreage
exceeds the three-acre level. These fees may also be used to provide recreational services in regional parks
for local community residents. The County also participates in agreements that establish partnerships with
other public and private agencies (typically with non-profit organizations) to develop, operate, and maintain
recreation facilities on land typically owned by those agencies. Existing sources of funding for open space
land acquisition that will ultimately build out the MSCP preserve include local, state and federal funds and
donations.

  CHAPTER 6 Housing Element 
 

                                                                                    CHAPTER 6 HOUSING ELEMENT
Introduction 
The  State  of  California  identifies  the  provision  of  decent  and  affordable  housing  for  every  Californian  as  a 
statewide  goal.  This  Housing  Element  strives  to  meet  that  goal  through  the  provision  of  appropriately 
designated land, which provides opportunities for developing a variety of housing types, and through policies 
and programs designed to assist the development of housing for all income levels and special needs. 
This  Housing  Element  covers  the  planning  period  of  January  1,  2013  through  December  31,  2020.  The 
Element  must  be  reviewed  for  compliance  with  State  law  by  the  State  Department  of  Housing  and 
Community Development (State HCD). 
To  meet  housing  demands,  the  General  Plan  accommodates  80 percent  of  the  unincorporated  County’s 
future population in communities located within the County Water Authority (CWA) boundary, where water 
and  other  public  services  are  more  readily  available.  The  CWA  boundaries  are  shown  on  Figure H‐1  (Areas 
Served  by  Sewer),  which  also  shows  areas  with  existing  sewer  infrastructure  within  the  unincorporated 
County.  The  plan  also  establishes  efficient  and  cost  effective  land  use  through  compact  development 
patterns  that  form  distinct  communities.  This  approach  is  consistent  with  planning  trends  and  regional 
growth  objectives,  which  are  indicated  in  Figure H‐2  (Smart  Growth  Opportunity  Areas  [SANDAG]).  Within 
the CWA, the Land Use Plan has designated more land for multi‐family units, thereby increasing the number 
of future residential sites as well as providing a larger variety of homes. Minimum lot size restrictions have 
been  removed  from  the  General  Plan  to  allow  for  clustering  consistent  with  the  Zoning  Ordinance  (and 
Community Plans) and to decrease land and infrastructure costs for new development. 
The County’s Land Use Plan provides adequate housing capacity to meet this cycle’s overall Regional Housing 
Needs Assessment (RHNA) of 22,412 residential units.1 Refer to the Housing Element Background Report for 
additional information. 
   Purpose and Scope 
Pursuant to State Housing Element law (Section 65580) of the Government Code, this Housing Element must 
contain local commitments to the following: 
      ■ Provide  sites  with  appropriate  zoning  and  development  standards  and  with  services  and  facilities  to 
            accommodate the jurisdiction’s RHNA for each income level. 
      ■ Assist  in  the  development  of  adequate  housing  to  meet  the  needs  of  lower  and  moderate  income 
            households.

   The RHNA is a state‐supervised process by which a regional planning agency, here the San Diego Association of Governments 
(SANDAG), allocates to its local jurisdictions their share of an eleven‐year projected housing need at various affordability 
levels. That need must be accommodated by each jurisdiction’s housing element.

INTRODUCTION
      ■ Address,  and  where  appropriate  and  legally  possible,  remove  governmental  constraints  to  the 
            maintenance, improvement, and development of housing, including housing for all income levels and 
            housing for persons with disabilities. 
      ■ Conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing stock. 
      ■ Promote housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex, marital status, ancestry, 
            national origin, color, familial status, or disability. 
      ■ Preserve assisted housing developments for lower income households. 
State  Housing  Element  law  mandates  specific  topics  and  issues  that  must  be  addressed  in  the  Housing 
Element. These include the following: 
      ■ An analysis of population and employment trends, documentation of projections, and quantification of 
            existing and projected housing needs for all income levels. 
      ■ An analysis and documentation of household characteristics, such as the age of housing stock, tenancy 
            type, overcrowded conditions, and the level of payment compared to ability to pay. 
      ■ An  analysis  and  documentation  of  special  needs,  such  as  female‐headed  households,  homeless 
            individuals, persons with disabilities, large households, farmworkers, and the elderly. 
      ■ A regional share of the total regional housing need for all income categories. 
      ■ An  inventory  of  land  suitable  for  residential  development,  including  vacant  land  and 
            infill/redevelopment  opportunities.  This  analysis  also  looks  at  potential  residential  sites  and  their 
            accessibility to adequate infrastructure and services. 
      ■ Identifying actual and potential governmental and non‐governmental constraints that could potentially 
            impede the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing for all income groups. 
      ■ Identifying and analyzing opportunities for energy conservation in residential developments. 
      ■ An inventory of at‐risk affordable units that have the possibility of converting to market rate. 
      ■ A statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial resources, and scheduled programs for 
            the improvement, maintenance, and development of housing.2 
State law requires that adequate opportunity for participation be solicited from all economic segments of the 
community  towards  preparation  of  the  Housing  Element.  Specifically,  the  jurisdiction  must  reach  out  to 
lower  and  moderate  income  persons  and  persons  with  special  needs.  Preparation  of  the  Housing  Element 
must also be coordinated with other local jurisdictions within the regional housing market area. 
   Guiding Principles for Housing 
The foundation for Housing Element policy is based on the defined objectives of the General Plan update as 
well  as  the  initiatives  of  the  County’s  Strategic  Plan.  The  objectives  of  improving  housing  affordability, 
assigning densities based on characteristics of the land, and locating growth near infrastructure, services, and 
jobs were of particular significance. Policies respond to the characteristics and challenges of both urban and 
rural community development. 
                                                            
2
   State law recognizes that the total housing need may exceed available resources and a jurisdiction’s ability to satisfy 
identified needs. As a result, quantified objectives do not need to match the total housing need. However, a jurisdiction is 
required to establish the maximum number of housing units by income category that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and 
conserved over the Housing Element planning period. 
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                             6‐5                                        GENERAL PLAN 
 

                                                                              CHAPTER 6 HOUSING ELEMENT
In general, housing affordability is addressed through policies intended to increase the supply of housing and 
decrease housing costs. Both approaches are applicable to urbanized centers with access to infrastructure, 
services,  and  jobs,  but  in  rural  areas,  the  lack  of  infrastructure  and  services  dictates  maintaining  low 
densities. Thus, policies affecting rural areas emphasize lowering housing costs. 
  Key Issues 
This Housing Element seeks to balance housing requirements with infrastructure deficiencies, safety issues, 
and  the  rural  character  of  many  of  the  County’s  unincorporated  communities.  It  also  seeks  to  reconcile 
housing  needs  with  competing  land  use  interests.  For  example,  agriculture  is  a  major  sector  within  the 
regional  economy,  and  most  agricultural  operations  are  located  within  the  unincorporated  County.  The 
County  of  San  Diego  also  has  the  greatest  number  of  endangered  species  of  any  county  within  the 
continental  United  States,  and  most  of  those  species  are  located  within  unincorporated  areas.  Retaining 
agricultural and environmental resources, therefore, must be reconciled with a housing allocation that is the 
second largest share within the region for this Housing Element cycle. 
COMPLIANCE WITH STATE REQUIREMENTS 
Multifamily  residential  development  within  the  unincorporated  County  is  typically  constructed  at  densities 
ranging  from  10.9  to  30  dwelling  units  per  acre.  The  County’s  development  history  demonstrates  that 
residential  densities  exceeding  20  or  30  units  per  acre  (depending  on  location)  are  not  likely  to  be 
constructed, even when permitted, due to infrastructure limitations, environmental resource locations, and 
market conditions. In addition, densities above 15 or 20 dwelling units per acre are not consistent with the 
rural character of the County’s communities. 
State  law  assumes  that  land  zoned  for  multi‐family  residential  development  presents  the  best  opportunity 
for  the  future  construction  of  housing  affordable  to  lower‐income  households.  The  Land  Use  Element 
identifies a density range of 10.9 to 30 dwelling units per acre for multi‐family development. However, recent 
changes in State law now stipulate that in the unincorporated County only zoning with a minimum density of 
30 units per acres may be presumed to be dense enough to support future lower‐income housing. Because 
the unincorporated County has very little land appropriate for development at 30 units per acre, this element 
has been required to demonstrate that lower‐income housing can be built in the unincorporated County at 
densities less than 30 units per acre. 
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS 
The issue of density was compounded with a RHNA process that allocated to the unincorporated County the 
third highest number of low and very low income units in the region. Unless the RHNA process as defined by 
State  law  is  substantially  changed,  the  unincorporated  County  will  continue  to  rely  on  a  wider  range  of 
residential densities—ranging from 10.9 to 30 dwelling units per acre—to meet its allocations for moderate 
and lower income households.

INTRODUCTION
VILLAGE ISSUES 
Communities  located  within  the  County  Water  Authority  (CWA)  boundary  will  accommodate  most  of  the 
County’s future population and most of its housing. Many of these communities face common issues: 
    ■ Housing Choice: Zoning requirements for density, lot size, building type and parking requirements have 
       made it difficult for developers to provide a variety of housing choices for different age or economic 
       groups. 
    ■ Achieving  Planned  Densities:  Minimum  lot  sizes,  height  restrictions,  and  other  regulations  have 
       reduced  development  yields  to  well  below  planned  densities.  For  example,  two‐story  height 
       restrictions typically limited density to 15 or 20 units per acre. 
    ■ Infrastructure  and  Services:  Providing  roads,  sewer,  and  other  infrastructure  to  support  urban  or 
       suburban  development  is  a  challenge  in  many  communities,  particularly  in  the  County’s  outlying 
       communities. Additionally, in many of the rural villages certain higher multi‐family residential densities 
       cannot be supported due to equipment limitations in many fire districts. 
    ■ Community  Acceptance:  Some  community  resistance  to  high‐density  housing  is  based  on  existing, 
       poorly  designed  development.  In  addition,  most  unincorporated  communities  resist  new  types  of 
       higher intensity development unless it includes sufficient common open space, landscaping, and other 
       amenities that help retain rural character. 
    ■ Redevelopment  Funds/Activities:  Redevelopment  districts  provide  a  source  of  funding  for  affordable 
       housing,  and  a  means  for  revitalizing  blighted  areas.  Due  to  changes  in  State  law,  this  option  is  no 
       longer  available.  However,  if  a  similar  program  does  become  available,  the  County  will  investigate 
       potential implementation measures. 
In the unincorporated County, environmental conditions also may limit development potential. Although the 
designations  assigned  in  the  land  use  plan  were  designed  to  reflect  the  carrying  capacity  of  the  land,  a 
project  level  analysis  was  not  possible  due  to  the  regional  nature  and  scope  of  the  plan  update.  Special 
circumstances,  such  as  the  vernal  pools  in  the  Village  area  of  Ramona,  will  require  creative  and  careful 
planning from future developers. The County also contains a Village area outside the CWA in Borrego Springs. 
Located  next  to  Anza  Borrego  State  Park,  this  desert  community  fosters  a  tourism‐based  economy  that 
presents unique housing issues. 
SEMI‐RURAL AND RURAL LANDS ISSUES 
Many  of  the  County’s  lower  income  families  live  in  remote,  rural  communities  as  shown  on  Figure H‐3 
(Median  Household  Income).  However,  locating  future  growth  in  these  areas  is  not  consistent  with  the 
County’s multiple planning objectives. 
The  comprehensive  General  Plan  update,  adopted  in  2011,  reduced  housing  capacity  in  rural  or 
“backcountry”  communities  that  lack  water,  sewer,  roads,  and  fire  or  emergency  medical  services. 
Communities where future housing capacity was reduced include Palomar/North Mountain, Desert/Borrego 
Springs,  Julian,  Central  Mountain  (Cuyamaca,  Descanso,  and  Pine  Valley)  and  Mountain  Empire  (Jacumba, 
Boulevard, Campo/Lake Morena, and Potrero). The update also designated low densities within the County’s 
major  agricultural  areas,  areas  with  significant  biological  sensitivity  or  diversity,  and  areas  with  significant 
physical or environmental constraints. 
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                         6‐7                                        GENERAL PLAN 
 

                                                                                CHAPTER 6 HOUSING ELEMENT
Improving  housing  affordability  in  Semi‐Rural  and  Rural  Lands  is  a  challenge  because  high‐density  housing 
cannot  be  accommodated  in  these  locations.  In  addition,  residential  growth  should  be  directed  away  from 
rural and remote areas with minimal or nonexistent public services. Housing‐related issues include: 
   ■ Affordability: Existing zoning requirements for large lot sizes increase costs for land and infrastructure 
       in Semi‐Rural areas. These same regulations limit developers’ use of bonus programs. 
   ■ Housing  choice:  Affordable  housing  that  is  consistent  with  rural  character  includes  mobile  or 
       manufactured homes, second units, and farmworker housing. Existing regulations should facilitate this 
       type of development. 
   ■ RHNA  requirements  for  lower  income  households:  Although  the  State  encourages  the  use  of  higher 
       density zoning to meet RHNA requirements for lower income families, multi‐family densities cannot be 
       supported in rural locations. 
  Relationship to Other GP Elements 
The goals and policies contained in the County of San Diego Housing Element are designed to be consistent 
with other elements of the General Plan. 
When  the  comprehensive  update  to  the  General  Plan  was  developed,  the  County  evaluated  the  vision  set 
forth  for  the  General  Plan  and  revised  and  augmented  the  existing  housing  goals,  policies,  and  action 
programs  for  consistency  with  that  vision.  Policies,  programs,  and  actions  were  crafted  to  address  specific 
constraints and to maximize opportunities. However, the Housing Element does not determine the intensity 
and  distribution  of  residential  growth;  such  policy  direction  is  established  in  the  Land  Use  Element.  The 
Housing  Element  sets  forth  policies  and  programs  to  further  implement  the  residential  component  of  the 
Land  Use  Element  and  that  will  be  supported  by  the  transportation  network  identified  in  the  Mobility 
Element. The Housing Element also recognizes the safety constraints identified in the Safety Element, such as 
limitations  in  fire  protection  services,  as  well  as  the  compatibility  criteria  of  the  Noise  Element.  Housing 
policies  and  programs  also  reflect  a  need  to  preserve  and  conserve  the  County’s  valuable  open  space, 
agricultural, and habitat resources as defined by the Conservation and Open Space Element.

When this Housing Element is updated for the next housing cycle, the County will evaluate the policies and 
programs  for  internal  consistency  with  the  rest  of  the  General  Plan.  Conversely,  as  other  elements 
(particularly  the  Land  Use  Element)  are  amended,  the  County  is  required  by  State  law  (Government  Code 
Section 65863) to make findings that such amendments will not impede the County from meeting its housing 
needs. 
Policy Framework 
As part of this Housing Element cycle, the County is allocated a share of the region’s housing needs that is 
equivalent  to  22,412  units.  The  County  must,  through  appropriate  zoning  and  development  standards, 
accommodate  these  units  through  a  variety  of  housing  types  and  various  income  groups.  The  discussion 
below provides information and background regarding the County’s commitment to providing its regional fair 
share of housing opportunities and affordable housing within the context of maintaining the rich diversity of 
natural environments while strengthening the community character of its diverse neighborhoods. 
  Housing Development 
Most of the existing housing stock within the unincorporated County is composed of single‐family residences. 
The largest portion of the jurisdiction lies outside the CWA boundary where residents rely on groundwater 
and septic systems. These constraints will only permit single‐family homes. Consequently the development 
pressure  for  affordable  homes  at  high  densities  centers  on  those  few  unincorporated  communities  with 
access to sewer and imported water. 
The  County’s  policies  seek  to  explore  several 
approaches  that  could  lower  the  cost  of  housing.  To 
meet the State’s required RHNA, the supply of vacant 
land  zoned  at  high  densities  has  been  increased  and 
this  limited  supply  must  be  efficiently  used.  Yield 
should  be  maximized  through  the  use  of  flexible 
zoning  standards  and  housing  types.  Major  new 
developments  that  have  access  to  sewer  should 
provide  housing  opportunities  for  a  range  of 
household  incomes  by  offering  both  a  variety  of 
housing  types,  ranging  from  multi‐family  to  single‐
family, and a variety of lot sizes. 
                                                             Variety of housing types in Lakeside include single family 
In  areas  without  access  to  sewer,  major  new  mobile homes on small lots 
developments  will  continue  to  rely  on  single‐family 
units but should utilize clustering and small lots to reduce land and infrastructure costs. Also the permitted 
use of mobile/manufactured homes affords lower single‐family prices in these rural areas. 
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                       6‐10                                      GENERAL PLAN 

POLICY FRAMEWORK
  Community Character and Environment 
The rural character of the unincorporated communities is a result of necessity as well as choice. The portions 
of  the  County  that  lie  outside  the  CWA  boundary  lack  the  infrastructure  to  support  urban  densities  and 
development.  The  additions  of  new  roads  and  sewer  capacity,  which  must  be  provided  by  private 
development,  often  make  projects  cost  prohibitive.  Even  communities  like  Ramona,  Fallbrook,  and  Alpine 
which lie within the CWA have retained the rural character which emerged during the early stages of growth. 
In  the  undeveloped  areas,  environmental  concerns  and  laws  now  take  precedence  over  the  sprawl 
development that occurred in the past. Within the more populated areas, higher densities of 20 to 24 units 
per acre have existed but the resulting development was often poorly designed and was not compatible with 
the surrounding areas. 
The policies in this Element strive for a balance between land planned for development and land planned for 
the  conservation  of  important  natural  resources.  Land  planned  for  development  should  be  utilized  in  an 
efficient,  effective  manner.  Development  should  complement  in  bulk,  style,  and  scale  the  character  of  its 
surroundings while still meeting the needs of its residents. 
  Housing Affordability 
The  policies  address  a  range  of  options  to  increase  housing 
affordability through both financial and regulatory assistance. 
The  availability  of  federal,  State  and  local  funding 
opportunities  has  been  significantly  reduced  due  to  the 
economic  recession.    However,  the  County’s  Department  of 
Housing and Community Development (County HCD) pursues 
those  that  are  offered.  A  comprehensive  agricultural 
assistance  package  is  planned  to  include  fee  waivers  and 
expedited approval for farmworker housing. Flexible building 
standards  and  expedited  processing  should  also  be  explored 
as  incentives  for  developers  willing  to  provide  housing  for 
lower and moderate income households. 
  Preservation of Affordable Housing 
The allocation of State and federal funds for the rehabilitation of housing in need of repair is handled by the 
County HCD. Revitalization at the local level is generally a function of redevelopment districts which are no 
longer  available.  However,  the  County  can  assist  communities  that  are  interested  in  comprehensive  town 
center planning to locate and apply for funds to support the planning effort. 
  Governmental Constraints 
As  part  of  the  General  Plan  update,  new  direction  in  land  use  policies  will  add  flexibility  to  existing 
regulations. The flexibility will apply to projects located in Village areas where developers strive to achieve

maximum yield. For example, height limitations, private open space requirements, and noise standards may 
be  relaxed  in  appropriate  areas.  In  addition,  the  County  is  in  the  midst  of  revising  regulatory  permitting 
procedures  (business  process  reengineering)  to  expedite  project  processing  and  decrease  costs.  As  part  of 
this  streamlining  effort,  the  process  should  include  prioritizing  discretionary  decisions  which  affect  the 
provision  of  subsidized  housing  or  projects  that  provide  housing  reserved  for  lower  and  moderate  income 
households. 
 Delivery of Housing Services 
The  efforts  of  the  County  HCD  and  Planning  &  Development  Services  should  be  coordinated  to  produce  a 
threaded approach to the management and provision of housing‐related services. These services include the 
procurement and distribution of funding, the tracking of housing data, implementation of Housing Element 
programs, public education, and outreach to affordable housing developers.

CHAPTER 3 Land Use Elemen
                                                                      CHAPTER 3 LAND USE ELEMENT
Introduction
The Land Use Element provides a framework to accommodate future development in an efficient and
sustainable manner that is compatible with the character of unincorporated communities and the protection
of valuable and sensitive natural resources.
Currently, the County of San Diego is faced with both significant growth pressures and severe environmental
constraints. While population continues to grow, the supply of land capable of supporting development
continues to decrease. In accommodating this growth, the land use plan encourages the provision of diverse
housing choices while protecting the established character of existing urban and rural neighborhoods.
In general, the majority of new development—approximately 80 percent—is planned within the County
Water Authority (CWA) boundary. This strategy coincides with the provision of imported water in San Diego
County’s semi-arid environment, and reflects the development pattern of the County’s largest
unincorporated communities, which are located in the County’s western areas where demand for new
development has and will continue to be greatest. The County’s unincorporated communities and rural
lands, however, exhibit tremendous diversity. This General Plan recognizes and encourages these unique
identities by providing sufficient flexibility within a countywide framework to respect the character of
individual communities, neighborhoods, and landscapes.
Focusing development in and around existing unincorporated communities allows the County to maximize
existing infrastructure, provides for efficient service delivery, and strengthens town center areas while
preserving the rural landscape that helps define the unique character of the unincorporated County.
  Purpose and Scope
COUNTYWIDE
The Land Use Element is a framework that provides maps, goals, and policies that guide planners, the general
public, property owners, developers, and decision makers as to how lands are to be conserved and
developed in the unincorporated County. The first section, Land Use Framework, defines the categories of
use to be permitted. These are defined at two scales: (a) broadly defined regional categories differentiated
by character and overall density and (b) detailed categories that break-down the regional categories into
more precise land use types, population densities, and development intensities. The Land Use Maps
Appendix presents the Land Use Map depicting the allocation of these categories to all unincorporated
County lands based on the General Plan’s Guiding Principles in Chapter 2 (Vision and Guiding Principles). The
Land Use Map serves as the regulatory document guiding land use, conservation, and development. The final
section presents the goals and policies that carry out and amplify the intentions of the Land Use Map.
COMMUNITY PLANS
While the Land Use Element inclusive of Land Use Maps and Goals and Policies applies to all lands
throughout the unincorporated County, there are special land use issues and objectives that uniquely pertain
to each of its diverse communities. These are addressed by Community Plans in which goals and policies are

INTRODUCTION
defined to provide more precise guidance regarding the character, land uses, and densities within each
community planning area. Though Community Plans are a part of this General Plan, they are bound
separately and must be referenced in determining the types and density of land use that may be considered
for any property within the community planning area.
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES
Public infrastructure such as roads, drainage facilities, sewer and water lines, and treatment plants are the
structural framework that supports development. Their availability plays an important part in determining
the pattern of land uses within a community, as well as the direction and intensity of growth. Community
services such as law enforcement, fire protection, libraries, and parks are important to the safety and
livability of communities. They can affect the well-being of communities and should also be accounted for
when planning future growth.
Community services and infrastructure in the County of San Diego are either provided by the County or by
independent agencies and special districts at the local, regional, state, and federal levels. Actions taken by
these independent districts for the planning, provision, and funding of public facilities are not subject to the
County’s land use authority. The County does operate and maintain several dependent sanitation districts
and wastewater facilities. In addition, some regional public facilities, such as courthouses, are under the
authority of the County and serve the entire San Diego region, including residents of the County’s 18 cities.
Also, the County operates the library system for all unincorporated areas, along with some incorporated
jurisdictions.
This element includes a Community Services and Infrastructure section. Goals and policies specific to
services or infrastructure that correspond to other elements can be found in those elements. Refer to the
Mobility Element for transportation-related infrastructure, the Conservation and Open Space Element for
recreational facilities, and the Safety Element for emergency services and law enforcement.
  Land Use Setting
The unincorporated portion of San Diego County is located in the southwestern corner of California and
encompasses approximately 2.3 million acres, or 3,570 square miles. A majority of the unincorporated
County’s land, in excess of 90 percent, is either open space or undeveloped. This includes several large
federal, state, and regional parklands that encompass much of the eastern portion of the County. Only
35 percent or about 807,000 acres of the unincorporated County is privately owned. In 2007, it was
estimated that approximately 5.6 percent of the unincorporated County, or 128,369 acres, was private
undeveloped land with potential for future development in Village, Semi-Rural, Commercial, or Industrial
areas.

The predominant pattern of development in the unincorporated County is rural in character, offering a
choice in use and lifestyle different from the urbanized coastal and inland communities. Dispersed
throughout the unincorporated County are over 20 distinct communities that vary in land use and density. In
general, the communities include a core of local-serving commercial uses, services, schools, and public
facilities surrounded by residential neighborhoods. They vary from “semi-suburban” communities that
transition in scale and density from adjoining incorporated cities to low-density “village” centers surrounded
by agricultural lands and open spaces. Some of the communities are uniquely defined by their setting in
hillside areas, the desert valley, and agricultural areas.
The most developed communities are located along the unincorporated territory’s westernmost boundaries
and include the community plan areas of Spring Valley, Sweetwater, Valle de Oro, Lakeside, San Dieguito,
portions of North County Metro, and Fallbrook. These areas are largely within the County Water Authority
service area and have had access to water, sewer, roads, schools, and comparable public facilities, enabling
them to grow at a faster rate. As such facilities are more costly and difficult to develop as distances increase
further inland, development occurs more sparsely in the backcountry region.
  Guiding Principles for Land Use
The Land Use Element’s maps and goals and policies are based on and amplify the Guiding Principles
specified in Chapter 2 of the General Plan. Central to the land use concept for unincorporated San Diego
County is a development pattern that balances the land requirements of residential growth, with those of
commerce, agriculture, recreation, and wildlife habitats.
The location and densities of land uses, as depicted on the Land Use Map, are based on an analysis of
development constraints such as road access, available water/sewer services, topography, significant

INTRODUCTION
habitats, groundwater resources, hazards, and accessibility to emergency fire protection services. Using
these factors in defining permitted land use locations and densities is consistent with the County’s Strategic
Initiatives (which include safe livable communities and the environment) and California Government Code
requirements. This approach will promote health and well being, while reducing environmental impacts that
would likely result from locating development in inappropriate locations.
Within these constraints, the core concept for the County’s development directs future growth to areas
where existing or planned infrastructure and services can support growth and locations within or adjacent to
existing communities. By giving priority to areas identified for urban level densities, this concept also helps to
retain the rural setting and lifestyle of remaining areas of the County. Most areas that are appropriate for
growth are located within the CWA boundary, while future development outside that boundary is limited. To
decrease potential development outside the CWA boundary and areas without infrastructure and services,
residential densities will typically be reduced where land is not already subdivided.
The Land Use Element establishes a model for community development based on a physical structure
defining communities by a “village center” surrounded by semi-rural or rural land. In communities inside the
CWA boundary, higher density neighborhoods and a pedestrian-oriented commercial center would provide a
focal point for commercial and civic life. Medium-density, single-family neighborhoods, as well as a broad
range of commercial or industrial uses, would surround the commercial core. Semi-rural neighborhoods
surrounded by greenbelts, agricultural uses, or other rural lands would be located outside the more
urbanized portion of the community.
  Relationship to Other GP Elements
In many respects, the issues, goals, and policies discussed in the Land Use Element represent the synthesis of
those of all or most other General Plan elements. Nearly any issue that deals with the physical characteristics
of the land has implications for land use conservation and development. Recognition and understanding of
the interrelationship between the Land Use Element and these other elements is necessary to assure an
integrated and cohesive General Plan. The following describes the interrelationships between these
elements:
    ■ Mobility Element—The Mobility Element provides the backbone of roads, bike routes, and trails that
        support the uses designated by the Land Use Element, connect the communities, and are linked within
        the region. The capacity required for the road network is based on the average number of daily vehicle
        trips that would be generated with build-out of the uses designated by the Land Use Map, in
        consideration of infrastructure costs, environmental constraints, and community compatibility. Goals
        and policies of the Land Use Element closely consider the design, characteristics, and availability of
        transportation infrastructure addressed by the Mobility Element to assure their compatibility with the
        character and needs of the communities.
    ■ Housing Element—The Land Use Element is closely related to the Housing Element in that the Land
        Use Map must provide sufficient capacity to meet goals of the State Housing Law including the
        Regional Housing Needs Assessment. It establishes the distribution of residential growth and densities
        appropriate for a range of housing types and affordability.
    ■ Conservation / Open Space Element—The Conservation and Open Space Element provides measures
        for the preservation, conservation, development, and use of natural resources. In turn, these influence

                                                                       CHAPTER 3 LAND USE ELEMENT
        the distribution and density of use depicted by the Land Use Map. Additionally, the Land Use Map
        incorporates designations that support the conservation and preservation of natural resources.
    ■ Safety Element—The Safety Element identifies and maps hazards and provides hazard-specific goals
        and policies to more clearly guide land use to protect life and property from potential hazards. The
        Land Use Element goals, policies, and map minimize future development in hazardous areas.
    ■ Noise Element—The Noise Element establishes noise compatibility guidelines that are applied to
        future development. In addition, noise compatibility concerns were taken into account during
        development of the Land Use Map.
Land Use Framework
The General Plan guides the intensity, location, and distribution of land uses in the unincorporated County
through a two-tier land use framework. The first tier, Regional Categories, establishes a hierarchy for the
overall structure and organization of development that differentiates areas by overall character and density,
while the second tier, Land Use Designations, disaggregates these categories and provide more precise
direction regarding the planned density and intensity of residential, commercial, industrial, open space, and
public land uses. This framework establishes the range and intensity of allowable land uses, for all areas
under the County of San Diego’s land use jurisdiction. Unincorporated San Diego County contains numerous
lands that are outside the land use jurisdiction of the County, such as tribal lands, military installations, public
utility lands, State parks, and national forests. Examples of these lands include the Cleveland National Forest,
Anza-Borrego State Park, Cuyamaca Rancho State Park, Palomar Mountain State Park, Marine Corps Base
Camp Pendleton, and 18 different tribal reservations. While the land use framework does not apply to these
lands, the present and planned uses on these lands were considered in its development and assignment of
the Regional Categories and Land Use Designations. Additionally, this element contains goals and policies
that relate to the planning and development of these lands.
  The Community Development Model
A major component to guiding the physical planning of the County is the Community Development Model
(discussed in Chapter 2). The Community Development Model is implemented by three regional categories—
Village, Semi-Rural, and Rural Lands—that broadly reflect the different character and land use development
goals of the County’s developed areas, its lower-density residential and agricultural areas, and its very low–
density or undeveloped rural lands (see Figure LU-1 [Regional Categories Map] at the end of the section). The
Community Development Model directs the highest intensities and greatest mix of uses to Village areas,
while directing lower-intensity uses, such as estate-style residential lots and agricultural operations, to Semi-
Rural areas. The Semi-Rural category may effectively serve as an edge to the Village, as well as a transition to
the lowest-density category, Rural Lands, which represents large open space areas where only limited
development may occur.
The three regional categories are described further in the following section. As a broad set of development
classifications, the Regional Categories do not specify allowable land uses, but rather the general regional
structure, character, scale, and intensity of development. The Regional Categories allow many different land
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                     3-6                                    GENERAL PLAN

LAND USE FRAMEWORK
use types to be planned in a more unified, regional manner. As a result, they do not regulate allowed uses or
intensities of individual development proposals. Instead, they are intended to provide a structure for the
location of specific Land Use Designations, described later in this element, that define allowed type and
intensity of uses.
To facilitate a regional perspective, the Regional Categories of Village, Semi-Rural Lands, and Rural Lands
have been applied to all privately-owned lands within the unincorporated County. The Open Space
(Recreation), Open Space (Conservation), and Public/Semi-Public Facilities designations can be assigned to
any of the Regional Categories, based on ownership and location. Tribal Lands and Federal and State Lands
(including MCB Camp Pendleton) are assigned to the No Jurisdiction Regional Category. As shown in
Figure LU-1, approximately 2.3 percent of the County is designated as Village, 10.3 percent as Semi-Rural,
36.7 percent as Rural Lands, and 50.7 percent as No Jurisdiction. 1
  Regional Categories
As stated above, the Regional Categories provide a framework for the regional distribution of uses that
serves as the foundation for the Land Use Map designations, goals, policies, and regulations that guide future
development.
VILLAGE
The Village category identifies areas where a higher intensity and a wide range of land uses are established or
have been planned. Typically, Village areas function as the center of community planning areas and contain
the highest population and development densities. Village areas are typically served by both water and
wastewater systems. Ideally, a Village would reflect a development pattern that is characterized as compact,
higher density development that is located within walking distance of commercial services, employment
centers, civic uses, and transit (when feasible).
Alpine Boulevard serves as the primary circulation route in the Rural Village of Pine Valley in the Central Mountain
village of Alpine                                                  Subregion
Generally, larger Villages are anchored by “Town Center” areas that serve as focal points for commercial and
civic life. Town Centers often benefit from the development of more detailed plans to guide new

the Board of Supervisors.

                                                                       CHAPTER 3 LAND USE ELEMENT
development in achieving consistency with the goals and policies of the General Plan. A Town Center will
typically contain one or more of the following:
    ■  Pedestrian-oriented commercial area
    ■  Mixed-use development: residential, retail, and office/professional uses
    ■  Higher-density residential developments
    ■  Community-serving private and public facilities
Transit Nodes typically encompass lands within walking distance—approximately one-half mile—of future
rapid transit stations and should be located within a Village. These may be planned as diverse, mixed-use
areas with a range of residential, commercial, and where appropriate, employment-generating land uses
(e.g., office/professional or industrial) as well as parks and civic spaces. However, planning must be
consistent with the type and quantity of ridership expected of the node as well as the surrounding
community. Potential Transit Node locations are based on long-range transit plans and include rail stations as
well as express bus stops that feed into rail systems.
SEMI-RURAL
The Semi-Rural category identifies areas of the County
that are appropriate for lower-density residential
neighborhoods, recreation areas, agricultural operations,
and related commercial uses that support rural
communities. Semi-Rural areas often function as a
transition between the Village and Rural Lands
categories, providing opportunities for development, but
without the intensity and level of public services
expected in Villages and with design approaches that
blend the development with the natural landscape. Semi-
Rural residential densities are derived in consideration of Semi-rural development patterns in Bonsall community
the physical conditions, community character, and
availability of public services, roads, and other
infrastructure. Higher densities within the allowable
range should be located near Village areas, while lower
densities should be located near Rural Land areas. Site
design methods that reduce on-site infrastructure costs
and preserve contiguous open space or agricultural
operations are encouraged.
RURAL LANDS

The Rural Lands category is applied to large open space
and very-low-density private and publicly owned lands that provide for agriculture, managed resource
production, conservation, and recreation and thereby retain the rural character for which much of
unincorporated County is known. Rural areas are not appropriate for intensive residential or commercial uses
due to significant topographical or environmental constraints, limited access, and the lack of public services

or facilities. Further, the undeveloped nature of Rural Lands benefits all of San Diego County by doing the
following:
    ■  Preserving the County’s rural atmosphere
    ■  Protecting land with significant physical or environmental constraints or hazards
    ■  Preserving open space, farmland, and natural resources
    ■  Providing open space buffers and a visual separation between communities
    ■  Preserving and providing land for agricultural opportunities
    ■  Preventing sprawl development, which reduces vehicle miles traveled and greenhouse gas emissions
NO JURISDICTION
The No Jurisdiction Regional Category is applied to those areas where the County does not have land use
planning jurisdiction, including lands under state or federal jurisdiction and tribal reservations.
  Land Use Designations
Where the Regional Categories represent a broad framework for the form and organization of development,
the Land Use Designations are property specific and identify the type and intensity of land uses that are
allowed. The Land Use Designations are defined by the land use type—Residential, Commercial or
Industrial—and the maximum allowable residential density or nonresidential building intensity. The
designations are applied throughout the County, as shown on Land Use Maps, which are located in the Land
Use Maps Appendix. More specific standards may be established for each Land Use Designation to
implement the goals and policies of the General Plan, through such tools as the Zoning Ordinance, to address
impacts related to specific land uses or the needs of an individual community.
Assignment of the land use designations to lands in the County is guided by the goals and policies contained
in this element, which reflect the Guiding Principles presented in Chapter 2. A general summary of the
designations is shown on the Land Use Maps in the Land Use Maps Appendix. The pie chart shown below
depicts how the privately owned lands are designated.

Development within Residential, Commercial, Industrial,
Specific Plan Areas, and Public/Semi-Public General Plan
land use designations is regulated through either a
maximum residential density or building intensity.
Residential density is expressed as a maximum number of
dwelling units per gross acre (exclusive of public road
rights-of-way). Nonresidential building intensity is
expressed as a maximum floor-area ratio (FAR). A floor-
area ratio (FAR) is the ratio of the gross building square
                                                                Multifamily housing in 4S Ranch
footage on a lot to the net square footage of the lot or
parcel (listed in Table LU-1 [Land Use Designations and
Compatible Regional Categories]). For example, on a lot
with 10,000 net square feet of land area, an FAR of 1.00
will allow 10,000 square feet of gross building area,
regardless of the number of stories in the building. When
combined with height and setback standards in the Zoning
Ordinance, a maximum FAR can also be clearly translated
into limits on building mass and bulk. In addition to
density/intensity standards, some land use classifications
also stipulate allowable building types, such as single-
family residential, to respect the character of certain Single-family residential at 7.3 dwelling units per acre
existing and planned neighborhoods.
RESIDENTIAL LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Seventeen residential land use designations provide for a full range of housing types, from village multi-
family development to rural single-family housing. As noted previously, residential densities are stated as a
maximum number of housing units per gross acre with the provision that at least one dwelling unit may be
built on each existing legal lot designated for residential use. The stated maximum residential density may or
may not be achievable in a given area due to local site conditions and constraints. In addition to these
primary residential designations, residential uses are also permitted in certain commercial designations as
specified in the Zoning Ordinance.
Second dwelling units are allowed pursuant to the Zoning Ordinance and are in addition to the maximum
densities otherwise permitted.
V ILLAGE R ESIDENTIAL D ESIGNATIONS
Nine residential land use designations are applied within the Village regional category ranging from two to
30 dwelling units per gross acre. Village residential densities are not subject to density reductions based on
slope. The residential densities permitted within Village areas typically require water and wastewater service
and can support a range of housing types including single-family and multifamily housing. Generally,
residential densities of 10.9 dwelling units per gross acre or higher require multi-family development.
Typically, multi-family development is characterized as attached apartments or condominiums that are two
to three stories in height. The higher densities may require structured or underground parking.

typically served by municipal sewer systems, but is
often served by municipal water systems especially
where water-intensive crops such as avocado and citrus

 Density calculations shall be based on a topographic map with 10-foot contour intervals or less. To calculate maximum density for
 a property the acreage of the property should be divided into the above three categories (<25%, 25–50%, >50%), each total should
 be multiplied by the associated density, and then the resulting yields combined.

to one dwelling unit per 80 gross acres—and are intended
to reflect and preserve the rural agricultural,
environmentally constrained, and natural “backcountry”

LAND USE FRAMEWORK
NONRESIDENTIAL LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Eight nonresidential land use designations provide for commerce and employment in the unincorporated
County. The maximum development intensity of uses in these designations is expressed as a maximum FAR
(see Table LU-1). As these are expressed as maximums, in many communities the desired FAR will likely be
lower. Similarly, in specific areas (identified by Community Plans) it may be appropriate to accommodate an
increased FAR to meet specific development objectives, such as areas with shared parking facilities, mixed
uses, or around Town Centers or Transit Nodes. Detailed regulations specified in the Zoning Ordinance will
support the desired development intensity. In any case, the permitted development intensity must be
supportive of the goals and policies of the General Plan and the applicable Community Plan.
While zoning regulations and site constraints may reduce development potential within the allowable range,
zoning can also provide specific exceptions to the FAR limitations, such as FAR bonuses in return for the
provision of public amenities or other community benefits. Illustrative public amenities and benefits include
public parks and affordable housing units.
C OMMERCIAL D ESIGNATIONS
General Commercial. This designation provides for
commercial areas where a wide range of retail
activities and services are permitted. This designation
is appropriate for the following types of commercial
areas: (1) regional shopping centers, (2) community
shopping centers, and (3) existing strip development
or commercial clusters containing small but diverse
commercial uses. Uses permitted within this
designation are typically limited to commercial
activities conducted within an enclosed building.

Residential development may also be allowed as a
secondary use in certain instances. The maximum
intensity of General Commercial development varies
according to the compatible regional category as
follows:
    ■ Village—0.70 FAR
    ■ Semi-Rural—0.45 FAR
Neighborhood Commercial. This designation provides
locations for limited, small-scale retail sales and
service uses intended to meet the convenience needs
of local residents. The limited commercial uses
allowed under this designation should be considered
in contrast to the larger scale and more broadly
serving      General       Commercial         designation.

use development may take the form of small offices or
residences up to two units per gross acre (as further
specified by the Zoning Ordinance) either above
ground-floor retail uses or separated structures
typically with commercial or civic uses located along
the road frontage. A wide variety of local serving
commercial and civic uses is encouraged by this
designation, including: retail stores; visitor-oriented
services; automotive sales and services; eating and
drinking establishments; professional offices; business Rural Commercial use in Valley Center
and personal services; and parks, libraries, and other community facilities. The maximum intensity of Rural
Commercial development varies according to the compatible Regional Category as follows:
   ■ Rural Village—0.60 FAR
   ■ Semi-Rural and Rural Lands—0.35 FAR
                                               Village Core Mixed Use. This designation is intended for
                                               pedestrian-scaled town center development. A wide variety of
                                               commercial, civic, and residential uses are encouraged by this
                                               designation, and these uses may be mixed “vertically”—on
                                               separate floors of a building—or “horizontally”—in separate
                                               buildings on a single site or on adjacent parcels. To maintain a
                                               pedestrian scale and orientation, retail and other active uses
                                               are encouraged at street level. Structured parking may be

parking arrangements may be allowed consistent with the nature of the mixed uses. Specific maximum FAR
and residential density standards shall be developed through community-specific town center planning,
though in no case, within either multiple- or single-use buildings, may nonresidential intensities exceed
1.3 FAR or residential densities exceed 30 units per acre. Permitted uses must be consistent with the town
center plan, or in absence of a town center plan, shall not preclude the development and implementation of
such a plan.

LAND USE FRAMEWORK
Office Professional. This designation provides areas
dedicated to administrative and professional services as
well as limited retail uses related to or serving the needs of
the primary office uses. Residential development may also
be allowed as a secondary use in certain instances. The
maximum intensity of Office Professional development
varies according to compatible regional category as
follows:
    ■ Village—0.80 FAR
    ■ Semi-Rural—0.45 FAR
                                                                Office complex in Rancho San Diego
I NDUSTRIAL D ESIGNATIONS
Limited-Impact Industrial. This designation provides for
both      freestanding     and     campus-style      industrial
development in Village and Semi-Rural areas with access
to key transportation corridors at a maximum FAR of 0.60.
Typical uses within this designation include light
manufacturing, processing, and assembly, all within
enclosed buildings, with no exterior indications of such
activity or need for outdoor storage. This designation may
be located in close proximity to residential and commercial
designations in Village and Semi-Rural areas with suitable
screening and buffering. Supporting uses—such as office, Public storage facility in Spring Valley
business service, and institutional uses—and accessory
retail uses are also allowed.
Medium-Impact Industrial. This designation provides for
freestanding industrial development in all Regional
Category areas with access to key transportation corridors
at a maximum FAR of 0.5. Typical uses within this
designation include: manufacturing, processing, and
assembly; warehousing and distribution; large equipment
supply and sales; and other industrial and commercial
activities that are generally incompatible with dissimilar
adjacent land uses. Uses in this designation may include
                                                                Medium-Impact Industrial use with outdoor storage
outdoor operations or require significant outdoor storage in 4S Ranch
of process materials and product. This designation should
generally not be located in close proximity to residential and commercial designations in Village areas,
because significant screening and buffering will typically be required to minimize unacceptable off-site
impacts. Supporting uses are allowed in this designation, including business services.

                                                                       CHAPTER 3 LAND USE ELEMENT
High-Impact Industrial. This designation provides for
freestanding industrial development in areas with access
to key transportation corridors at a maximum FAR of 0.35.
Typical uses within this designation are similar to those of
the Medium Impact Industrial designation and include:
manufacturing, processing, and assembly; warehousing
and distribution; large equipment supply and sales; and
other industrial and commercial activities that are
generally incompatible with dissimilar adjacent land uses.
However, the off-site impacts of industrial uses in this
designation are likely to be more significant due to process, Steel fabricating plant in Spring Valley
product, and reliance on outdoor operations or storage of process materials and product. Therefore, this
designation may be incompatible with most Village areas and must be thoughtfully applied in any location in
the unincorporated area. In certain limited circumstances it may be designated near the periphery of Village
areas where the industrial use is isolated from residential and commercial designations and all allowed uses
are adequately screened and buffered to eliminate unacceptable off-site impacts. Secondary support uses
are also allowed in this designation, including related business and industrial services.
OTHER LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Seven additional land use designations are applied in the General Plan to recognize other existing land use
types and jurisdictions. Four designations—Specific Plan Areas, Public and Semi-Public Facilities, Open
Space—Conservation, and Open Space—Recreation—generally
relate to areas where the County or some other agency controls
land under County jurisdiction to provide public facilities, such
as schools, protect open space resources, or to serve
recreational needs. Two other designations—Tribal Lands, and
Federal and State lands—apply to areas where the County has
no jurisdiction over land use.
Tribal Lands. These lands comprise about 126,000 acres, or
five percent of the unincorporated County on 18 federally Resort hotel, casino, and golf course on the
recognized reservations or Indian villages. Tribal lands are Barona Reservation
primarily located in Rural Areas.
Public Agency Lands (State Parks, National Forests and other
public agency non-conservation lands). Public agency lands
comprise 1,160,700 acres, or 50.8 percent, the majority of the
unincorporated County land area. State Parks—including Anza-
Borrego Desert State Park, Cuyamaca Rancho State Park, and
Palomar Mountain State Park—and the Cleveland National
Forest contribute significantly to the unique and unspoiled
character of the County’s backcountry. The County contains
several military installations, including Marine Corps Base Camp Laguna Meadow within the Cleveland National
Pendleton, which alone encompasses about 135,000 acres, or Forest

LAND USE FRAMEWORK
six percent of the unincorporated County. These installations are designated as “Military Installations.” This
category also includes lands owned by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and incorporated
jurisdictions.
Specific Plan Area. This designation is applied to areas where a Specific Plan was adopted by the County prior
to the adoption of this General Plan. Specific Plans may contain residential, commercial, industrial, public,
institutional, and/or open space uses; and detailed land use regulations are contained within each adopted
specific plan document. The designation of new Specific Plan Areas to substitute for General Plan Land Use
Designations is not permitted. This is not intended to restrict the use of Specific Plans, which are useful
planning tools allowed for by State law and may be developed for areas of the County to provide more
precise guidance for land development, infrastructure, amenities, and resource conservation consistent with
the use types and densities specified by the Land Use Designations and the goals and polices of the General
Plan. The intention is to retain the underlying densities on the General Plan Land Use Plan to clearly show
the area’s relationship within the context where it is located.
Public and Semi-Public Facilities. This designation identifies
major facilities built and maintained for public use. Examples
include institutional uses, academic facilities, governmental
complexes, and community service facilities, such as County
airports, public schools, correctional institutions, solid waste
facilities, water facilities, and sewer facilities. This designation
may include privately owned facilities built and maintained for
public use, such as hospitals, cemeteries, and landfills. A
maximum FAR of 0.50 is permitted by this designation.                Post office in the rural village of Pine Valley
Public/Semi-Public Lands (Solid Waste Facility). This
designation occurs on two sites in the County: the Gregory Canyon and East Otay Mesa landfill sites. On
November 8, 1994, the voters adopted County of San Diego Initiative Proposition C, which amended the
General Plan and re-designated the Gregory Canyon site. Similarly, on June 8, 2010, the voters adopted
County of San Diego Initiative Proposition A, which re-designated the East Otay Mesa Site. Both initiatives
assigned a (22) Public/Semi-Public Lands designation with a Solid Waste Facility Designator based on the
General Plan that was in effect at that time. Although that designation has since been amended in an
updated General Plan, the previous designation has been retained for those two sites to comply with the
voter-adopted ordinances.
                                                    Open Space—Conservation. This designation is primarily
                                                    applied to large tracts of land, undeveloped and usually
                                                    dedicated to open space, that are owned by a jurisdiction,
                                                    public agency, or conservancy group. Allowed uses include
                                                    habitat preserves, passive recreation, and reservoirs. Grazing

area. Such ancillary uses within this designation will typically be controlled by use-permit limitations. Open
space preserves total 159,400 acres or 7 percent of the total land area in the unincorporated County. Due to
the success of the County’s MSCP program, this number continues to grow.
This designation is not normally applied to conservation easements within residential subdivisions on private
lots.
Open Space—Recreation. This designation is applied to large,
existing recreational areas. This designation allows for active
and passive recreational uses such as parks, athletic fields, and
golf courses. Uses and structures ancillary to the primary open
space use may be permitted to enhance recreational
opportunities only if they relate to the recreational purpose
and do not substantially alter the character of the area.

Regional Categories Map and Land Use Maps
The Regional Categories Map (Figure LU-1) and the Land Use Maps (located in the appendix) are graphic
representations of the Land Use Framework and the related goals and policies of the General Plan. As
required by State law, these depict the general distribution, location, and extent of the uses of the land for
housing, business, industry, open space, education, public buildings, and other categories of public and
private uses of the land. The land use designations are shown on these maps as color or graphic patterns and
correspond directly to the designations shown on Table LU-1 and defined in the Land Use Designations
section, including allowable uses and permitted development densities or intensities. These may be further
modified by specific policies for the Community Plan Areas as specified by their respective Community Plan
(separately bound as a part of this General Plan). As an adopted part of the General Plan, the Land Use Maps
are to be used and interpreted only in conjunction with the text and other figures contained in the General
Plan.
In the Land Use Maps Appendix are 35 land use maps. Of the 35 maps, 23 are regional maps, some of which
have subarea maps that are within the geographic boundary of the subregion. These maps also correlate to
the community plans, which are bound separately.

Legacy Communities
SENATE BILL 244 GENERAL PLAN REQUIREMENTS
Hundreds of disadvantaged unincorporated communities exist in California and often exhibit a lack of public
and private investment that leads to a lack of basic infrastructure as well as economic, social, and educational
inequality. In October 2011, Senate Bill (SB) 244 Land Use, General Plans, and Disadvantaged Communities
was enacted requiring cities and counties to review and update the Land Use Element of the General Plan to
identify disadvantaged unincorporated communities concurrent with the requirement to update their
housing elements. The intent of SB 244 is to encourage investment and planning to address the regional
inequality and infrastructure deficits that exist within disadvantaged unincorporated communities. For each
subsequent revision of the Housing Element, a city or county is also required to conduct a review of the
disadvantaged communities identified, and if necessary, amend the General Plan to update the required
analysis of water, wastewater, stormwater drainage, and structural fire protection needs and deficiencies.
In this instance, a “community” means an inhabited area within a city or county that is comprised of no less
than 12 or more registered voters adjacent or in close proximity to one another. In addition, a
“disadvantaged unincorporated community” means a fringe, island, or legacy community in which the
median household income is 80 percent or less than the statewide median household income. “Fringe”,
“island” and “legacy” communities are defined below.
     Island community — any inhabited and unincorporated territory that is surrounded or substantially
         surrounded by one or more cities or by one or more cities and a county boundary or the Pacific Ocean
     Fringe community — any inhabited and unincorporated territory that is within a city’s sphere of influence
     Legacy community — geographically isolated community that is inhabited and has existed for at least 50
         years 2
Per the state law, Counties must identify and describe each legacy community, as defined, within the
boundaries of a county that is a disadvantaged unincorporated community. Consequently, Cities are
responsible for identifying disadvantaged unincorporated communities that are fringe communities within
the sphere of influence of an incorporated city and island communities that are substantially surrounded by
one or more cities.
If legacy communities are identified, then the Land Use Element Amendment must include an analysis of the
service needs and deficiencies for the identified legacy communities. As a minimum, this analysis of service
needs and deficiencies would include the following:
     1. Coordinate with the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to incorporate the information
         contained in the Municipal Service Review into the infrastructure needs of the identified communities
     2. Map the location of existing infrastructure elements including, but not limited to fire stations, sewer
         trunk lines, and drainage systems

GOALS AND POLICIES
    3. Conduct an assessment of the capacity and availability of the physical infrastructure necessary to
        support the existing and proposed land uses in the identified community
    4. Consult with affected public utilities and special districts, if any, for information on the location and
        capacity of their facilities to determine the ability and the timing of facility expansion for infrastructure
        improvements for the identified community
    5. Review regional and state transportation, air quality, and water quality plans and regulations to
        consider whether any of these plans affect the future operation and expansion of public and private
        facilities 3
After the assessment of service needs and deficiencies, SB 244 requires an analysis of financing alternatives
that could make the extension of services and facilities to the identified communities financially feasible. This
includes evaluating the opportunity for grants, taxes, benefit assessments, bonds, and exactions such as
impact fees.
DISADVANTAGED UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES
Under SB 244, LAFCOs are required to identify and plan for disadvantaged unincorporated communities in
conjunction with municipal service reviews, sphere of influence updates and annexation approval
restrictions. In compliance with the requirements and recommendations of SB 244, the San Diego LAFCO
identified and mapped the geographic locations within unincorporated San Diego County containing
disadvantaged communities, both within and outside the cities’ spheres of influence.
Identification of the disadvantaged unincorporated communities by the San Diego LAFCO was based on the
SB 244 definitions addressing income, population size, and geographical relationships. In accordance with SB
244, the qualifying annual median household income is 80% or less than the statewide median household
income, which based on 2010 census data is $46,166 4. Therefore, in accordance with the requirements of SB
244, communities that qualify as “disadvantaged” would have annual household incomes below $36,932.
The following is the process LAFCO used to identify and map disadvantaged communities in San Diego
County:
    1. Indentify census tracts in San Diego County that meet the annual median household income range
        (80% or less than the 2010 statewide annual median household income) based on estimates provided
        by the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG). [While other GIS data besides census tracts
        exist to map disadvantage communities, San Diego LAFCO determined the census tract data was the
        most complete and reliable source of information for the purpose of this analysis.]
    2. Integrate the census tract estimates into a county-wide map to identify each census tract that had a
        SB 244-qualifying annual median household income.

                                                                    CHAPTER 3 LAND USE ELEMENT
    3. The SB 244-qualifying census tracts were then overlaid with the incorporated city boundaries and
       adopted spheres of influence to determine if the identified disadvantaged unincorporated
       communities were island, fringe, or legacy communities, as defined by SB 244.
The LAFCO analysis identified 25 SB 244-qualifying census tracts that require further analysis to determine if
they contain any disadvantaged unincorporated communities (see Figure 1).
IDENTIFICATION OF LEGACY COMMUNITIES
As discussed above, Counties must identify and describe disadvantaged unincorporated communities that
are legacy communities located outside the sphere of influence of a city, while Cities are responsible for
fringe and island communities. Based on the SB 244 criteria for island, fringe and legacy communities, six of
the 25 census tracts have only island communities and two census tracts have only fringe communities.
Therefore, the County analyzed the 17 remaining census tracts to determine if any contained legacy
communities.
The analysis to identify legacy communities consisted of a review of each census tract using aerial
photography and GIS data to identify areas in the census tract where eight or more dwellings were located
within a one-quarter mile radius. Eight is considered a reasonable number of dwellings to ensure the SB 244
definition of a community is met—areas with 12 or more registered voters reside adjacent or in close
proximity to each other. The one-quarter mile radius was used to determine if the dwellings were in close
proximity to each other. Any communities identified that met these criteria were further evaluated to
determine if they meet the remaining SB 244 criteria for a legacy community.
Only communities that meet all the criteria below would be considered a legacy community.
    1. Within the County’s land use authority (i.e.:; military installations are outside County’s land use
       authority)
    2. Areas more than one mile from urban and suburban development patterns (these areas are more
       likely to be geographically isolated)
    3. No evidence of recent or newer construction on dwellings and their lots, such as new roofs (these
       dwellings would likely be less than 50 years old)
    4. Non-estate type development (large dwellings on lots two acres and larger) since these dwelling would
       not likely meet the maximum household income requirements
The 17 census tracts were analyzed using the methodology identified above (refer to the Background Report
for more details). Based on this analysis, no legacy communities were identified within the land use
jurisdiction of the County of San Diego. As such, the County has fulfilled the obligations set forth in SB 244
concurrent with the fifth cycle of the Housing Element.

GOALS AND POLICIES
Goals and Policies for Land Use Element
  The Community Development Model
CONTEXT
The General Plan Land Use Framework defines a Community Development
Model that uses three regional categories—Village, Semi-Rural, and Rural
Lands—to broadly reflect the differing character of County lands that range
from communities with substantial populations to predominantly
undeveloped backcountry areas. The goals and policies in this section
implement the Community Development Model and are intended to apply
across the entire unincorporated County and are the basis for assigning
densities to these areas. Further, they recognize the diversity of the
unincorporated communities and need for community-specific planning
and guidance. Lastly, they acknowledge that planning by other agencies
with responsibilities within, around, or overlapping the unincorporated
                                                                             Community Development Model
lands will also affect how the Community Development Model is
                                                                             (refer to Guiding Principle 2)
implemented. The Community Development Model is included in the
Vision and Guiding Principles chapter under Guiding Principle 2, and discussed further in pages 3-6 and 3-7.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL LU-1
Primacy of the Land Use Element. A land use plan and development doctrine that sustain the intent
and integrity of the Community Development Model and the boundaries between Regional
Categories.
Policies
LU-1.1    Assigning Land Use Designations. Assign land use designations Refer to Guiding Principle 2 for an
          on the Land Use Map in accordance with the Community explanation of the Community
          Development Model and boundaries established by the Regional Development Model.
          Categories Map.
LU-1.2    Leapfrog Development. Prohibit leapfrog development which is inconsistent with the Community
          Development Model. Leapfrog Development restrictions do not apply to new villages that are
          designed to be consistent with the Community Development Model, that provide necessary
          services and facilities, and that are designed to meet the LEED-Neighborhood Development
          Certification or an equivalent. For purposes of this policy, leapfrog development is defined as
          Village densities located away from established Villages or outside established water and sewer
          service boundaries.       [See applicable community plan for possible relevant policies.]
LU-1.3    Development Patterns. Designate land use designations in patterns to create or enhance
          communities and preserve surrounding rural lands.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                  3-23                                   GENERAL PLAN

                                                                    CHAPTER 3 LAND USE ELEMENT
LU-1.4  Village Expansion. Permit new Village Regional Category designated land uses only where
        contiguous with an existing or planned Village and where all of the following criteria are met:
           ■ Potential Village development would be compatible with environmental conditions and
              constraints, such as topography and flooding
           ■ Potential Village development would be accommodated by the General Plan road network
           ■ Public facilities and services can support the expansion without a reduction of services to
              other County residents
           ■ The expansion is consistent with community character, the scale, and the orderly and
              contiguous growth of a Village area
LU-1.5  Relationship of County Land Use Designations with Adjoining Jurisdictions. Prohibit the use of
        established or planned land use patterns in nearby or adjacent jurisdictions as the primary
        precedent or justification for adjusting land use designations of unincorporated County lands.
        Coordinate with adjacent cities to ensure that land use designations are consistent with existing
        and planned infrastructure capacities and capabilities.
LU-1.6  Conversion of Public Lands to Private Ownership. Assign lands in public use an underlying
        designation of Rural Lands 80. When such lands are transferred to private ownership, the RL-80
        designation shall apply until the appropriate long-term use of the property is determined and a
        general plan amendment is approved for redesignation of the property. This policy applies to areas
        on the Land Use Map designated Public/Semi-Public Facilities, Federal and State Lands, and Tribal
        Lands.
LU-1.7  Maximum Residential Densities. Determine the maximum number of dwelling units permitted
        within the boundaries of any subdivision or single lot based on the applicable land use
        designation(s). When the total number of dwelling units is less than one, this shall be interpreted
        as permitting one dwelling unit. When more than one dwelling unit is permitted, fractional
        dwelling units are rounded down to the nearest whole number of dwelling units.
LU-1.8  Density Allocation on Project Sites. Permit changes in density within a project site with parcels
        that have more than one land use designation to provide flexibility in project design only when
        approved by Major Use Permit or Specific Plan. The policy does not allow a project to receive more
        units than is established by the Land Use Maps nor to supersede Housing Element requirements
        related to achieving the County’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation. [See applicable community
        plan for possible relevant policies.]
LU-1.9  Achievement of Planned Densities. Recognizing that the General Plan was created with the
        concept that subdivisions will be able to achieve densities shown on the Land Use Map, planned
        densities are intended to be achieved through the subdivision process except in cases where
        regulations or site specific characteristics render such densities infeasible.
GOAL LU-2
Maintenance of the County’s Rural Character. Conservation and enhancement of the
unincorporated County’s varied communities, rural setting, and character.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                   3-24                                GENERAL PLAN

GOALS AND POLICIES
Policies
LU-2.1    Community Plans. Maintain updated Community Plans, as part of the General Plan, to guide
          development to reflect the character and vision for each individual unincorporated community,
          consistent with the General Plan.
LU-2.2    Relationship of Community Plans to the General Plan. Community Plans are part of the General
          Plan. These plans focus on a particular region or community within the overall General Plan area.
          They are meant to refine the policies of the General Plan as they apply to a smaller geographic
          region and provide a forum for resolving local conflicts. As legally required by State law,
          Community Plans must be internally consistent with General Plan goals and policies of which they
          are a part. They cannot undermine the policies of the General Plan. Community Plans are subject
          to adoption, review and amendment by the Board of Supervisors in the same manner as the
          General Plan.
LU-2.3    Development Densities and Lot Sizes. Assign densities and minimum lot sizes in a manner that is
          compatible with the character of each unincorporated community.
LU-2.4    Relationship of Land Uses to Community Character. Ensure that the land uses and densities within
          any Regional Category or Land Use Designation depicted on the Land Use Map reflect the unique
          issues, character, and development objectives for a Community Plan area, in addition to the
          General Plan Guiding Principles.
LU-2.5    Greenbelts to Define Communities. Identify and maintain greenbelts between communities to
          reinforce the identity of individual communities.
LU-2.6    Development near Neighboring Jurisdictions. Require that development in the proximity of
          neighboring jurisdictions retain the character of the unincorporated community and use buffers or
          other techniques where development in the neighboring jurisdiction is incompatible.
LU-2.7    Commercial Viability. Ensure that new commercial centers maintain or enhance the viability of
          existing commercial areas.
LU-2.8    Mitigation of Development Impacts. Require measures that minimize significant impacts to
          surrounding areas from uses or operations that cause excessive noise, vibrations, dust, odor,
          aesthetic impairment and/or are detrimental to human health and safety.
LU-2.9    Maintaining Rural Character. Consider level of service criteria, in accordance with Policy M-2.1, to
          determine whether adding lanes to a Mobility Element road would adversely impact the rural
          character of a community or cause significant environmental impacts. In those instances, consider
          other options to mitigate LOS where appropriate.
GOAL LU-3
Diversity of Residential Neighborhoods. A land use plan that accommodates a range of building and
neighborhood types suitable for a variety of lifestyles, ages, affordability levels, and design options.
Policies
LU-3.1    Diversity of Residential Designations and Building Types. Maintain a mixture of residential land
          use designations and development regulations that accommodate various building types and
          styles.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                  3-25                                 GENERAL PLAN
                                                                             CHAPTER 3 LAND USE ELEMENT
LU-3.2    Mix of Housing Units in Large Projects. Require new large residential developments (generally
          greater than 200 dwelling units) to integrate a range of housing types and lot and building sizes.
          [See applicable community plan for possible relevant policies.]
LU-3.3    Complete Neighborhoods. Require new development sufficiently large to establish a complete
          neighborhood (typically more than 1,000 dwelling units) to include a neighborhood center within
          easy walking distance of surrounding residences. [See applicable community plan for possible
          relevant policies.]
GOAL LU-4
Inter-jurisdictional Coordination. Coordination with the plans and activities of other agencies and
tribal governments that relate to issues such as land use, community character, transportation,
energy, other infrastructure, public safety, and resource conservation and management in the
unincorporated County and the region.
Policies
LU-4.1    Regional Planning. Participate in regional planning to ensure that the unique communities, assets,
          and challenges of the unincorporated lands are appropriately addressed with the implementation
          of the planning principles and land use requirements, including the provisions of SB375.
LU-4.2    Review of Impacts of Projects in Adjoining Jurisdictions. Review, comment, and coordinate when
          appropriate on plans, projects, and proposals of overlapping or neighboring agencies to ensure
          compatibility with the County’s General Plan, and that adjacent communities are not adversely
          impacted.
LU-4.3    Relationship of Plans in Adjoining Jurisdictions. Consider the plans and projects of overlapping or
          neighboring agencies in the planning of unincorporated lands, and invite comments and
          coordination when appropriate.
LU-4.4    Development Compatibility with Military Facilities. Ensure compatibility of new development
          with the current and planned mission and operations of U.S. government military installations.
LU-4.5    Annexations with Incompatible Land Uses. Coordinate with LAFCO to oppose annexations by
          neighboring cities that would result in land uses incompatible with unincorporated lands.
           LAFCO is responsible for coordinating, directing, and overseeing annexation of territory. A prerequisite for
           annexation is the inclusion of a territory within an adjacent city’s sphere of influence.
LU-4.6    Planning for Adequate Energy Facilities. Participate in the planning of regional energy
          infrastructure with applicable utility providers to ensure plans are consistent with the County’s
          General Plan and Community Plans and minimize adverse impacts to the unincorporated County.
LU-4.7    Airport Land Use Compatibility Plans (ALUCP). Coordinate with the Airport Land Use Commission
          (ALUC) and support review of Airport Land Use Compatibility Plans (ALUCP) for development
          within Airport Influence Areas.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                        3-26                                      GENERAL PLAN

GOALS AND POLICIES
  Planning for Sustainability
CONTEXT
As discussed in Chapter 2, sustainability is a key theme of this General Plan and is inextricably related to a
number of General Plan elements, as well as land use topics. Addressing global climate change through the
reduction of GHG emissions is a common tenant of sustainability. The types, densities, and distribution of
land uses in the County play a profound role in sustaining natural resources, the economy, and well being of
residents. Land use patterns defined by the Community Development Model and Land Use Map provide for a
more compact land use pattern, where residents live closer to jobs, businesses, schools, parks, services, and
their neighbors, and would reduce vehicle trips and miles traveled. In turn, this would reduce energy
consumption, air pollution, noise, and GHG emissions, while improving the quality of life for residents and
economic activity of local businesses. Policies are also defined for the application of more sustainable
approaches to land development, building design, and construction.
The County also recognizes sustainability as it applies to the other natural systems that are integrated with
our communities. Ecosystems, topography, riparian corridors, rock formations, mature trees, and our natural
assets such as our air, water (and groundwater), agriculture, and views are important contributing elements
to sustainability.
This section focuses on general goal and policies that relate to the designation of land uses and the
development that could occur based on those land use designations. Climate Change–related goals and
policies are found throughout this General Plan. Table I-1 (General Plan Policies Addressing Climate Change)
in the introduction summarizes by topic area the goals and policies in the A complete reference to County

directly related to emissions reductions.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL LU-5
Climate Change and Land Use. A land use plan and associated development techniques and
patterns that reduce emissions of local greenhouse gases in accordance with state initiatives, while
promoting public health.
Policies
LU-5.1      Reduction of Vehicle Trips within Communities. Incorporate a mixture of uses within Villages and
            Rural Villages and plan residential densities at a level that support multi-modal transportation,
            including walking, bicycling, and the use of public transit, when appropriate.
LU-5.2      Sustainable Planning and Design. Incorporate into new development sustainable planning and
            design.

        groundwater recharge areas) when permitting development                    Region.
        under the Rural and Semi Rural Land Use Designations.
LU-5.4  Planning Support. Undertake planning efforts that promote infill and redevelopment of uses that
        accommodate walking and biking within communities.
LU-5.5  Projects that Impede Non-Motorized Travel. Ensure that development projects and road
        improvements do not impede bicycle and pedestrian access. Where impacts to existing planned
        routes would occur, ensure that impacts are mitigated and acceptable alternative routes are
        implemented.
         Examples include large parking areas that cannot be crossed by non-motorized vehicles, and new
         developments that block through access on existing or potential bicycle and pedestrian routes.
GOAL LU-6
Development—Environmental Balance. A built environment in balance with the natural
environment, scarce resources, natural hazards, and the unique local character of individual
communities.
Policies
LU-6.1  Environmental Sustainability. Require the protection of intact or sensitive natural resources in
        support of the long-term sustainability of the natural environment.
LU-6.2  Reducing Development Pressures. Assign lowest-density or lowest-intensity land use designations
        to areas with sensitive natural resources.
LU-6.3  Conservation-Oriented Project Design. Support conservation-oriented project design. This can be
        achieved with mechanisms such as, but not limited to, Specific Plans, lot area averaging, and
        reductions in lot size with corresponding requirements for preserved open space (Planned
        Residential Developments). Projects that rely on lot size reductions should incorporate specific
        design techniques, perimeter lot sizes, or buffers, to achieve compatibility with community
        character. [See applicable community plan for possible relevant policies.]
         Approval of Conservation-Oriented projects is not guaranteed by-right but shall be allowed to process if
         consistent with applicable minimum lot sizes, design guidelines, and regulations
LU-6.4  Sustainable Subdivision Design. Require that residential subdivisions be planned to conserve open
        space and natural resources, protect agricultural operations including grazing, increase fire safety
        and defensibility, reduce impervious footprints, use sustainable development practices, and, when
        appropriate, provide public amenities. [See applicable community plan for possible relevant
        policies.]
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                    3-28                                      GENERAL PLAN

GOALS AND POLICIES
LU-6.5    Sustainable Stormwater Management. Ensure
          that development minimizes the use of
          impervious surfaces and incorporates other Low
          Impact Development techniques as well as a
          combination of site design, source control, and
          stormwater best management practices, where
          applicable and consistent with the County’s LID
          Handbook.
LU-6.6    Integration of Natural Features into Project
          Design. Require incorporation of natural features Low Impact Development practices on a landscaped
          (including mature oaks, indigenous trees, and median in 4S Ranch
          rock formations) into proposed development and require avoidance of sensitive environmental
          resources.
LU-6.7    Open Space Network. Require projects with open space to design contiguous open space areas
          that protect wildlife habitat and corridors; preserve scenic vistas and areas; and connect with
          existing or planned recreational opportunities.
LU-6.8    Oversight of Open Space. Require that open space associated with future development that is
          intended to be preserved in perpetuity either be:
          1) Retained in private ownership of the property owner or a third party with a restrictive
               easement that limits use of the land as appropriate; or
          2) Transferred into public ownership of an agency that manages preserved open space.
          The owner of the open space will be responsible for the maintenance and any necessary
          management unless those responsibilities are delegated through an adopted plan or agreement.
          Restrictive easements shall be dedicated to the County or a public agency (approved by the
          County) with responsibilities that correspond with the purpose of the open space. When
          transferred to a third party or public agency, a funding mechanism to support the future
          maintenance and management of the property should be established to the satisfaction of the
          County.
LU-6.9    Development Conformance with Topography. Require development to conform to the natural
          topography to limit grading; incorporate and not significantly alter the dominant physical
          characteristics of a site; and to utilize natural drainage and topography in conveying stormwater to
          the maximum extent practicable.
LU-6.10   Protection from Hazards. Require that development be located and designed to protect property
          and residents from the risks of natural and man-induced hazards.
LU-6.11   Protection from Wildfires and Unmitigable Hazards. Assign land uses and densities in a manner
          that minimizes development in extreme, very high and high fire threat areas or other unmitigable
          hazardous areas.
LU-6.12   Flooding. Document and annually review areas within floodways and 100- and 200-year
          floodplains to ensure areas subject to flooding are accurately mapped in accordance with AB 162
          (enacted January 1, 2008). (See also Policy S-9.1)

             An aquifer is in overdraft condition when the amount of water being withdrawn (by pumping or by other
             means) exceeds the amount of water that recharges the basin over a period of years, during which the
             water supply conditions approximate average conditions.

  Villages and Town Centers
CONTEXT
Smart growth concepts focus growth in compact areas close to jobs, services, and public facilities to
maximize the use of existing infrastructure and preserve open space and natural resources. The General Plan
Land Use Map accommodates approximately 80 percent of the unincorporated County’s population growth
within the CWA boundary. The Village regional category, which allows the most intensive land uses in the
unincorporated County, facilitates the use of compact development patterns.
Villages that contain a mix of land uses encourage strong neighborhoods and contribute to meeting a
community’s daily commercial, civic, and social needs. New development can facilitate the achievement of
these objectives and enhance the vitality and livability of existing Villages. Such development is expected to
be diverse considering the unique needs and character of each Village.
It is important that new development in Villages be compatible with and connects to its surrounding area.
Under the General Plan land use designations, many of the County’s Villages may realize a sizable amount of
growth in the future years. Unchecked, growth and new development can easily transform a community.
However, when planned and implemented wisely, growth can be beneficial to a community’s identity,
economy, and character. Compatibility should be directed through the Community Plan, where the
community’s character is defined in greater detail, and the Zoning Ordinance. Because Village development
will occur as infill or redevelopment, compatibility takes on a greater scope, accounting for the immediately
surrounding area as well as the overall character of the Village.
Connections are also important to support a Village that has vitality and mobility. These attributes allow
components of a Village to interact and capitalize upon one another, thus improving economy, place, and the
sense of a distinct and unified identity. This is achieved through interconnected street and pedestrian
networks, the use of localized design standards, careful transitions between land uses, and the incorporation
of pedestrian connections and public amenities within larger developments.
Town Centers are the hubs or cores of Villages and can be more than just an assemblage of high-intensity
land uses. Ideally, they are active places where community members interact, contribute to the local
economy, and enjoy the unique sense of place offered by each community. Development plans can facilitate
these activities through the design of both public and private spaces. Major public facilities such as schools,
libraries, community centers, and parks that are located in Town Centers often contribute to its identity and
level of activity.
New residential development, whether infill or new neighborhoods, can complement adjacent Village
residential neighborhoods through compatible site and building design and connected circulation networks.

Larger developments have greater ability to contribute to
the Village with a mix of housing options and a range of
community amenities and supporting uses, such as
recreational facilities and, where appropriate, civic and
neighborhood commercial uses.
New commercial and industrial uses are at least equally
and often more important to enhancing Villages and
contributing to their identity and viability. This is because
they serve as attractors to residents and visitors, provide Main Street in Julian provides a variety of land uses
employment, and are often located near the core of the and building types
Village and have high visibility. In locating new commercial
and industrial uses, care must be taken to avoid impacting
existing business. Design will also require careful
consideration to ensure compatibility.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL LU-9

GOALS AND POLICIES
LU-9.4  Infrastructure Serving Villages and Community Cores. Prioritize infrastructure improvements and
        the provision of public facilities for Villages and community cores as sized for the intensity of
        development allowed by the Land Use Map.
LU-9.5  Village Uses. Encourage development of distinct
        areas within communities offering residents
        places to live, work, and shop, and
        neighborhoods that integrate a mix of uses and
        housing types.
LU-9.6  Town Center Uses. Locate commercial, office,
        civic, and higher-density residential land uses in
        the Town Centers of Villages or Rural Villages at
        transportation nodes. Exceptions to this pattern
        may be allowed for established industrial districts
        and secondary commercial districts or corridors.
                                                               Residential areas surround commercial and office

LU-9.7  Town Center Planning and Design. Plan and guide the development of Town Centers and
        transportation nodes as the major focal point and activity node for Village areas. Utilize design
        guidelines to be compatible with the unique character of a community. Roadways, streetscapes,
        building facades, landscaping, and signage within the town center should be pedestrian oriented.
        Wherever possible, locate public facilities, such as schools, libraries, community centers, and parks
        in Town Centers and Villages.
LU-9.8  Village Connectivity and Compatibility with Adjoining Areas. Require new development within
        Villages to include road networks, pedestrian routes, and amenities that create or maintain
        connectivity; and site, building, and landscape design that is compatible with surrounding areas.
        [See applicable community plan for possible relevant policies.]
LU-9.9  Residential Development Pattern. Plan and support an efficient residential development pattern
        that enhances established neighborhoods or creates new neighborhoods in identified growth
        areas.
LU-9.10 Internal Village Connectivity. Require that new development in Village areas are integrated with
        existing neighborhoods by providing connected and continuous street, pathway, and recreational
        open space networks, including pedestrian and bike paths.
LU-9.11 Integration of Natural Features in Villages. Require the protection and integration of natural
        features, such as unique topography or streambeds, into Village projects.
LU-9.12 Achieving Planned Densities in Villages. In villages, encourage future residential development to
        achieve planned densities through multi-family, mixed use, and small-lot single-family projects
        that are compatible with the community character.

  Semi-Rural/Rural Lands
CONTEXT
As they share many common goals and policies, the Semi-
Rural and Rural Lands regional categories are combined
under this section. Semi-Rural areas comprise the majority
of unincorporated land within the CWA boundary and
include low-density residential, agricultural, and recreation
uses. These lands buffer and separate Village areas and are
expected to develop in a manner consistent with their
natural environment and rural character. Rural Lands are
typically located outside of or between Semi-Rural areas
and further define and separate the communities they
surround.                                                       Rural lands outside the village of Julian
The majority of unincorporated land outside the CWA Boundary is largely undeveloped, lacks infrastructure,
and is thus designated as Rural Lands. A significant portion of these lands is in public ownership and is
typically used for recreation or environmental preservation. Outside the CWA boundary, Semi-Rural lands
typically reflect established communities.
The lower densities in the Semi-Rural and Rural Lands allow for reduced development pressures and greater
flexibility in a manner that minimizes impacts to the environment. This can be accomplished by implementing
policies that require all development in Semi-Rural and Rural Lands to protect and sustain ecosystems,
topography, riparian corridors, rock formations, mature trees and other natural assets, and avoid natural
hazards, such as flooding, steep slopes, and seismic instability.
Despite numerous constraints to agriculture in San Diego County, such as high water and land costs, the
County has a robust agricultural economy. Agriculture contributes to the character of the County, and
particularly Semi-Rural and Rural Lands, supplying County residents with local agricultural products, and
contributing significantly to the local economy. A goal of these categories is the preservation of local
agriculture, which includes a diverse mix of high value commodities and takes advantage of a long—in some
cases year-round—growing season. Incompatibility of adjacent land uses can present yet another constraint
to the viability of local agriculture. As residential and other potentially incompatible development occurs in
traditionally agricultural areas, careful attention should be given to the compatibility of these nonagricultural
uses and to site design techniques that would reduce or avoid potential conflicts. Goals and policies that
pertain to agriculture are located in the conservation and Open Space Element (Chapter 5).

GOALS AND POLICIES
Policies
LU-10.1    Residential Connectivity. Require residential
           development in Semi-Rural areas to be
           integrated with existing neighborhoods by
           providing connected and continuous street,
           pathway/trail, and recreational open space
           networks.
LU-10.2    Development—Environmental                Resource
           Relationship. Require development in Semi-

           the unique natural features and rural character, Echo Valley in the Jamul Community Planning Area
           and avoid sensitive or intact environmental
           resources and hazard areas.
LU-10.3    Village Boundaries. Use Semi-Rural and Rural land use designations to define the boundaries of
           Villages and Rural Land Use designations to serve as buffers between communities.
LU-10.4    Commercial and Industrial Development. Limit the establishment of commercial and industrial
           uses in Semi-Rural and Rural areas that are outside of Villages (including Rural Villages) to minimize
           vehicle trips and environmental impacts.
 Commercial, Office, and Industrial Development
CONTEXT
While the Community Development Model and the General Plan Regional Categories directly relate to the
ranges of intensity of the residential Land Use Designations, as shown on Table LU-1, there is less of a
correlation to the nonresidential Land Use Designations (Commercial, Office Professional, and Industrial). As
such, specific guidance is needed to ensure that nonresidential development is planned and occurs in a
manner consistent with the Guiding Principles for the General Plan and the plans of each unincorporated
community.
Commercial, office, and industrial uses are important to a community’s identity and viability. They serve as
attractors to residents and visitors, provide employment, and contribute to the economy. Commercial uses
accommodate the retail and service needs of, and provide employment opportunities for, surrounding
residents. Primary commercial areas, such as Town Centers, typically serve an entire Village and its
surrounding rural residents. Land-intensive commercial activity will generally serve regional as well as local
needs, and is best located at key intersections of multi-modal transportation corridors. There is also a need
for smaller scale commercial uses in residential neighborhoods beyond the Village core to serve the
convenience needs of residents in that area.
Typical Office Professional uses include office-oriented professional and administrative services and research
and development activities. Large-scale office uses are typically clustered in campus-style office or industrial
park settings, while smaller-scale office uses are typically located in mixed-use Village and Neighborhood
Centers. The Village Core Mixed Use, neighborhood commercial, and General Commercial land use

                                                                     CHAPTER 3 LAND USE ELEMENT
designations all provide for this type of mixed-use office
development. While, office development that requires
large, continuous floor area may be accommodated in
campus-style office parks under the Office Professional and
Light Industrial land use designations, it is important that
these developments not be isolated and separated by
location design from adjoining land uses, resulting in a
distinct island. Compatibility with the adjacent
development and connections to vehicular and pedestrian
circulation networks remain important.
Typical industrial uses include manufacturing, processing,
assembly, wholesaling, and warehouse activities that
normally require large indoor and outdoor areas for
processing and storage. In the unincorporated County,
these uses typically occur on large development sites or as
clusters of smaller sites served by municipal infrastructure
and with direct access to major transportation corridors.
Industrial uses with adverse impacts such as noise, The pedestrian-oriented Main Avenue in Fallbrook
vibration, odor, and aesthetic impairment must be
carefully located and designed to avoid compatibility issues with adjacent land uses. Light industrial uses are
considered compatible in pedestrian-oriented Village centers because they are similar in function and form
to offices. Medium industrial uses are most compatible within Village boundaries but outside the pedestrian-
oriented center and buffered from incompatible residential or commercial land uses.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL LU-11
Commercial, Office, and Industrial Development. Commercial, office, and industrial development
that is appropriately sited and designed to enhance the unique character of each unincorporated
community and to minimize vehicle trip lengths.
Policies
LU-11.1     Location and Connectivity. Locate commercial, office, and industrial development in Village areas
            with high connectivity and accessibility from surrounding residential neighborhoods, whenever
            feasible.
LU-11.2     Compatibility with Community Character. Require that commercial, office, and industrial
            development be located, scaled, and designed to be compatible with the unique character of the
            community.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                   3-36                                 GENERAL PLAN
GOALS AND POLICIES
LU-11.3   Pedestrian-Oriented Commercial Centers. Encourage the development of commercial centers in
          compact, walkable configurations in Village centers that locate parking in the rear or on the side of
          the parcel, use transparent storefronts with active retail street-fronting uses, minimize setbacks,
          and discourage “strip” commercial development. “Strip” commercial development consists of
          automobile-oriented commercial development with the buildings set back from the street to
          accommodate parking between the building and street.
LU-11.4   Town Center Intensity and Vitality. Encourage revitalization of Town Center areas to strengthen
          neighborhoods, expand local employment opportunities, and establish or enhance a sense of
          place.
LU-11.5   Large-Format Retail Stores. Allow large-format retail uses, typically referred to as “big box stores,”
          only where the scale of the use and design is compatible with the surrounding areas. Large-format
          retail typically means retail stores with floor plans that are larger than 65,000 sq. ft.
LU-11.6   Office Development. Locate new office development complexes within Village areas where
          services are available, in proximity to housing, and along primary vehicular arterials (ideally with
          transit access) with internal vehicular and pedestrian linkages that integrate the new development
          into the multi-modal transportation network where feasible.
LU-11.7   Office Development Compatibility with Adjoining Uses. Require new office development,
          including office parks, to be compatible to the scale, design, site layout, and circulation patterns of
          adjacent existing or planned commercial and residential development.
LU-11.8   Permitted Secondary Uses. Provide a process where secondary land uses may be permitted when
          appropriate and compatible with the primary commercial, office, and light industrial uses, in order
          to better serve the daily needs of employees and to reduce the frequency of related automobile
          trips. This policy is not intended for high impact industrial uses.
LU-11.9   Development Density and Scale Transitions. Locate transitions of medium-intensity land uses or
          provide buffers between lower intensity uses, such as low-density residential districts and higher
          intensity development, such as commercial or industrial uses. Buffering may be accomplished
          through increased setbacks or other techniques such as grade differentials, walls, and/or
          landscaping but must be consistent with community design standards.
LU-11.10 Integrity of Medium and High Impact Industrial Uses. Protect designated Medium and High
          Impact Industrial areas from encroachment of incompatible land uses, such as residences, schools,
          or other uses that are sensitive to industrial impacts. The intent of this policy is to retain the ability
          to utilize industrially designated locations by reducing future development conflicts.
LU-11.11 Industrial Compatibility with Adjoining Uses. Require industrial land uses with outdoor activities
          or storage to provide a buffer from adjacent incompatible land uses (refer to Policy LU-11.9 for
          examples of buffering).
 Community Services and Infrastructure
CONTEXT
Land uses in the County are supported by a diversity of public utilities and services. Among these are water
supply, wastewater collection and treatment, solid waste management, schools, and libraries.

W ATER S UPPLY
San Diego County is located in a semi-arid to arid
desert climate with limited local water supplies,
requiring that the majority of its water resources be
imported. The County is not a purveyor of water and
must rely on the San Diego County Water Authority
(SDCWA) and its member agencies to provide the
majority of water delivery to the region. Fifteen of
the 24 current SDCWA member agencies provide
water to the unincorporated areas of the County. An Otay Reservoir
additional 14 independent special districts, along with private water systems, provide services to the
unincorporated County. The water districts in the unincorporated County are shown on Figure LU-2 (Water
Districts).
The City of San Diego owns and maintains seven drinking source water reservoirs in the County. While these
reservoirs do not provide potable water for residents outside the city, they are used by County residents for
recreation and provide valuable habitat.
The California Urban Water Management Planning Act requires that each urban water supplier, providing
water for municipal purposes either directly or indirectly to more than 3,000 customers or supplying more
than 3,000 acre-feet of water annually, shall prepare, update and adopt an (Urban Water Management Plan)
UWMP at least once every five years on or before December 31, in years ending in five and zero. In the 2005
UWMPs, the Metropolitan water District (MWD), SDCWA and all 15 SDCWA member agencies that serve the
unincorporated County determined that adequate water supplies would be available to serve existing service
areas under normal water year, single dry water year, and multiple dry water year conditions through the
year 2030. However, there are multiple issues related to the projections included in the 2005 UWMPs.
Factors such as cutbacks in water importation supplies from MWD and SDCWA and the statewide drought
have not have been accounted for in 2005 UWMP supply and demand projections.
In addition to the UWMP, which deals with long term planning, SDCWA’s Board of Directors approved a
Drought Management Plan (DMP) in 2006. The DMP provides potential actions that the SDCWA can take to
minimize or avoid the impacts associated with supply shortage conditions due primarily to droughts. The
DMP also contains a water supply allocation methodology to be used if the SDCWA is required to allocate
supplies to its member agencies.
In August 2007, a U.S. District court decision was issued to protect the endangered Delta smelt (fish). This
federal court ruling set operational limits on pumping in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta from December
2007 to June 2008 to protect the Delta smelt. As a result of this ruling, MWD is estimated to see as much as a
20 to 30 percent reduction in State Water Project supplies in 2008 and beyond. This means that local water
agencies would have to rely on increased conservation, along with contingency and emergency sources of
water, including local groundwater and storage supplies, to lessen direct impacts on water availability for
their customers.

Additionally, after a record dry spring that dramatically curtailed snow runoff from the Sierra Nevada
Mountains, Governor Schwarzenegger declared an official statewide drought on June 4, 2008. Following the
Governor’s action, the MWD board of directors issued a Water Supply Alert for its six-county service area,
urging local jurisdictions to adopt and implement water conservation ordinances and to significantly increase
efforts and programs to conserve water.
The Colorado River, the other major source of imported
supplies for MWD, has experienced drought conditions for
eight of the last nine years. The Colorado River provides
water to more than 31 million people in seventeen
western states. Since the drought in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, MWD enacted a plan to improve water
supplies during dry conditions. The Integrated Resources
Plan (2004) called for increasing MWD’s ability to store
wet-year surplus supplies from the Colorado River and
Northern California’s Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. In
2007, enough water in reserve was available to help MWD
withstand up to three successive dry years. The federal Otay County Landfill
court decision on the Delta smelt reduces MWD’s ability to
replenish reserves in wet years and prolonged dry conditions in California continue to draw on the reserves.
As a result the, MWD’s near-term strategy is to lower demand and stretch the reserve supplies as much as
possible.
Additionally, climate changes due to global warming also create new uncertainties that significantly affect
California’s water resources and lessen the reliability of 2005 UWMPs. All 2005 UWMPs include a drought
management or shortage contingency analysis section, which identifies how the agency will manage
shortages. However, these UWMPs do not account for the severity or longevity of the above-mentioned
difficulties in providing enough supply for the region’s demand. In preparing 2010 UWMPs, the SDCWA and
its water districts will need to account for these issues and will likely place more emphasis on conservation,
water recycling, and expanding local supplies through methods such as seawater desalination, groundwater,
surface water, transfers, and imported supplies. Development of the diverse sources of water will aid in
reducing the SDCWA’s purchases of imported supplies from the MWD. Groundwater is the primary source of
supply for the special water districts and private water systems that serve the groundwater-dependent
unincorporated areas. In addition, many areas of the County are dependent on individual wells and are not
served by water agencies. The Land Use Map allows limited development in these areas. In California,
individual groundwater users are typically not regulated in regard to the amount of groundwater they can
use nor does the County typically restrict an individual’s use. However, the County can deny discretionary
permits if the proposed groundwater resources are not sufficient for the proposed development. For permits
with ongoing conditions, the County can require limitations or conditions on the amount of groundwater that
can be withdrawn.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                    3-40                                GENERAL PLAN

GOALS AND POLICIES
S OLID W ASTE
Solid waste management has been recognized as an important regional issue in San Diego County because of
limited landfill capacity, urban encroachment, and environmental concerns reducing potential facility
expansions and replacement sites, environmental regulations, and the increased cost of developing and
operating waste management facilities. Historically, the primary method of disposing of solid waste has been
through the use of landfills. Since the early 1990s, there has been a growing emphasis to reduce the amount
of solid waste being disposed of in landfills through integration of recycling and source reduction. There are
seven active landfills in the San Diego region that serve both incorporated and unincorporated areas. The
landfills currently operating in the County for public use are either privately owned and operated or are
owned and operated by another local jurisdiction. There is sufficient landfill space for thirty years considering
current landfill expansions, and proposed new landfills. However there is insufficient infrastructure to
support the traffic flow to and from the landfills resulting in daily and annual permitted tonnage restrictions.
Current plans for expansion of existing landfills and new landfills would add 179 million tons of capacity. The
San Diego County Integrated Waste Management Plan Siting Element analysis (2005) determined that if the
County would recycle at a rate of 75 percent, which complies with State mandates for integrated solid waste
management, compared to the present 50 percent, there would be no need for additional landfills in the
County, including the proposed Gregory Canyon and Campo landfills.
E DUCATION
The provision of educational facilities and services are mandated by the State Department of Education and
administered by the San Diego County Board of Education and the San Diego County Office of Education,
which is a public agency with land use authority that is separate from the County of San Diego. The County
Offices of Education and the San Diego County Board of Education provide a support infrastructure for local
schools and districts while acknowledging each school board’s responsibility to represent and serve their
community. The day-to-day development of facilities and delivery of instruction is generally the responsibility
of the County’s 42 local school districts. Student populations in the unincorporated areas of the County have
generally experienced steady growth rates depending on the particular community or area that the school
facility is located. Because the County of San Diego does not have jurisdiction over the land use decisions of
public schools, its responsibility for school facilities is limited to review and comment on projects for
proposed schools.
W ASTEWATER
The majority of sewage treatment and disposal in the unincorporated areas of San Diego County is
accomplished by one of the following three methods: (1) regional systems maintained by public water or
sewer districts; (2) small wastewater treatment facilities operated by independent districts or the County;
and (3) on-site subsurface sewage disposal (septic) systems. The method of treatment and disposal often
depends on the district’s location. Generally, those districts located in the proximity of the City of San Diego
are members of the San Diego Metropolitan Sewerage System (Metro) and use its system for treatment and
effluent disposal. A number of agencies also use a combination of the Metro system and inland treatment
and disposal. Those districts located near the coastal areas provide effluent disposal through the use of an
ocean outfall. Those districts located inland (a majority of the unincorporated areas of the County) provide
sewage treatment and disposal through reuse, spray fields, evaporation, and other techniques.

The Department of Public Works (DPW) Wastewater Management Section (WWM) is responsible for
maintaining sewer lines, pump stations, force mains and several treatment plants for the unincorporated
areas of Alpine, Julian, Lakeside, Spring Valley, Pine Valley, Campo, East Otay Mesa, and the Winter Gardens
area. Wastewater flows originating within the communities of Alpine, Lakeside, Winter Gardens, Spring
Valley, and East Otay Mesa are transmitted to the City of San Diego metro system for treatment and disposal.
The remaining communities of Julian, Pine Valley, and Campo utilize “inland” treatment and disposal
systems.
T ELECOMMUNICATIONS
Telecommunications services are offered to county residents by a diversity of providers. These include Time
Warner and Cox Communications for cable television and digital services; AT&T for standard landline
telephone; Verizon, Sprint, Cingular/AT&T, Nextel, Cricket, and T-Mobile for cell phone; and Vonage and
Skype for voice over Internet protocol. Due to the dispersed and low-density pattern of development in the
County, particularly in its eastern-most reaches, some telecommunication services are not available
throughout the entirety of the area.
I SSUES
The following are the key issues related to community services and infrastructure in the unincorporated
County:
   ■ Coordination of service and infrastructure can be difficult in the unincorporated areas that are served
        by numerous other entities.
   ■ The geographic extent of the unincorporated County precludes the ability to provide the same level of
        services and infrastructure to all of its lands.
   ■ Limited population density and/or access to some areas of the unincorporated County also result in
        both physical and fiscal challenges to providing services.
   ■ Maintenance and enhancement of public infrastructure is important to the well-being of existing
        communities. Many existing communities include basic infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer,
        but could benefit from enhancements such as pathways, trails, landscaping, and better connected
        roads.
   ■ As development occurs, it is important to existing communities that this development provides for
        adequate services to meet its own needs without adversely affecting the existing residents.
   ■ Some community services, such as libraries and community centers, may contribute to defining a
        community’s identity, location, and character.
These and other issues relevant to community services and infrastructure in the unincorporated County area
are addressed in this General Plan. As previously stated, additional goals and policies on some specific
services or infrastructure can be found in other elements of the General Plan (refer to the Mobility Element
for transportation-related infrastructure, the Conservation and Open Space Element for recreational
facilities, and the Safety Element for emergency services and law enforcement). The following goals and
policies either pertain to those issues not covered by other elements or are more general.

Introduction
  Purpose and Scope
The Mobility Element includes several components including a description of the County’s transportation
network, the goals and policies that address the safe and efficient operation, maintenance, and management
of the transportation network, and the Mobility Element Network Appendix, which depicts in map and matrix
format the location of road network components. The goals and policies strive for a balanced multimodal
transportation system with adequate capacity to support the land uses and development patterns in the
Land Use Element of this General Plan.
The Mobility Element provides a framework for a
balanced, multi-modal transportation system for the
movement of people and goods within the
unincorporated areas of the County of San Diego. A
balanced system uses multiple modes of travel
including motor vehicles, public transportation,
bicycles, pedestrians, and to a lesser extent, rail and
air transportation. While the automobile is the
predominant mode of travel in the unincorporated
County due largely to its rural character, opportunities
for increased mode choice are addressed in this
Element.                                                    Interstate 8, east of Alpine
The Mobility Element identifies the County road network, much of which currently exists, to be developed in
the unincorporated County during the implementation of this General Plan so that future rights-of-way can
be preserved for future motorized and non-motorized roadway purposes. This network includes County and
State roads that form the backbone of a regional network providing movement within and between
communities in the unincorporated County. Interstate highways, as with State roads and highways, are
managed and maintained by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). While the Mobility
Element network map indicates some roadways within city boundaries, the County has no jurisdiction over
roads in these cities. When applicable, the Mobility Element road network has been coordinated with
adjacent cities to ensure consistency to the extent feasible.
With the exception of State roads and highways, the County is responsible for the operation and
maintenance of the public roadway system in unincorporated areas of the County along with the operation
of eight public aviation facilities. The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) serves as the regional
planning agency for the entire County and is a key partner to the County along with other State, regional, and
public agencies, in planning and funding roadways and other components of the transportation network
within the County.

INTRODUCTION
  Guiding Principles for Mobility
The Mobility Element’s goals and policies are based on and reflective of a number of the Guiding Principles
for the General Plan introduced in Chapter 2. A central theme is support for a multi-modal transportation
network that enhances connectivity and supports existing development patterns while retaining community
character and maintaining environmental sustainability by reducing gasoline consumption and greenhouse
gas emissions.
The Mobility Element balances competing goals of accommodating trips generated by land use, while striving
to retain a transportation network that complements, rather than impacts, the character of communities,
which is generally rural in much of the unincorporated County. Therefore, widening of roads, which can
dramatically change the character of a community, should be pursued only after environmental and
community character impacts are also considered. The need to widen roads is minimized when trip vehicle
miles traveled are reduced, the performance of the existing network is optimized, and the use of alternative
modes of travel is maximized.
Reducing vehicle miles traveled is also an important component of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Along
with compact land use patterns, a well-connected road network contributes to reducing vehicle miles
traveled. The Mobility Element requires the provision of multi-modal facilities to accommodate alternative
modes of travel, such as public transportation, bicycling, and walking. In addition, goals and policies are
included to minimize single occupancy vehicular travel through carpooling, vanpooling, and other
transportation demand management methods.
The Mobility Element strives to maximize traffic movement and enhance connectivity by creating multiple
connections between existing and planned retail or employment centers and residential communities and
between different areas within communities. A continuous network where roads have enhanced connectivity
facilitates the provision of optional routes of travel. This enables commuters to avoid areas when roads are
congested or closed. In addition, a network with enhanced connectivity provides multiple evacuation routes
during emergencies, such as wildfires. The Mobility Element incorporates road types that are compatible
with surrounding land uses and reinforce the positive aspects of a community’s character, contributing to the
economic and social development of the community.

Requiring new development to pay its fair share of road and related infrastructure costs minimizes public
costs while ensuring the infrastructure is available to support the increased demand for services.

  Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
As mandated by State law, the Mobility Element must be consistent with all other elements of the General
Plan (including community plans) and is related to these elements as discussed in the following section.
    ■ Land Use Element. The Mobility Element is directly correlated to the Land Use Element this includes
       the identification of a road network that can adequately support the uses designated in the Land Use
       Map at build-out, based on a reasonable expectation for funding of the regional transportation
       network. The capacity required for the Mobility Element road network is based on the average number
       of daily vehicle trips that would be generated with build-out of the Land Use Map. The Mobility
       Element framework of road types relates to the varying characteristics of communities. The Land Use
       Element addresses non-transportation infrastructure components such as water, sewage, storm
       drainage, and communications; many of which are located within the rights-of-way of the road
       network.
    ■ Noise Element. This element addresses noise generated by motorized traffic on roadways, rail lines,
       and at airports. Also, the Noise Element identifies noise level contours and determines their
       compatibility with each land use type.
    ■ Conservation and Open Space Element. This element provides measures for the preservation,
       conservation, development, and use of natural resources. The element addresses the air quality
       impacts from motor vehicular traffic, along with the impacts to environmentally sensitive habitats
       from road construction or improvements. In addition, the Mobility Element identifies the regional trail
       system that enhances community circulation and provides connections to recreational opportunities
       within County parks, open space preserves, and other public lands.
    ■ Safety Element. Emergency ingress and egress routes are addressed in both the Mobility and Safety
       Elements. The Safety Element further establishes land use compatibility policies for areas located
       within the vicinity of airports.
Goals and Policies for Mobility Element
  County Road Network
CONTEXT
In the unincorporated County, the road network is by far the most dominant component of the County’s
transportation system. Although motorists are the primary users of the system, transit riders, bicyclists,
pedestrians, and equestrians rely on the network for mobility within the unincorporated County as well as
the greater San Diego region. State highways and regional arterials in the unincorporated County are part of
an extensive regional network that is integrated with an interstate highway system that provides intra- and
interregional travel within and through the unincorporated County as described below.
    ■ Traffic from Orange County enters the County along Interstate 5 through Marine Corps Base Camp
       Pendleton and travels to the coastal cities.
    ■ Traffic from Riverside County travels into the unincorporated County along Interstate 15 and State
       Route 79, through the Rainbow Community Planning Area and North Mountain Subregion,
       respectively.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                   4-4                                  GENERAL PLAN

GOALS AND POLICIES
    ■ Traffic from Imperial County enters the County along Interstate 8 through the Mountain Empire
       Subregion and along State Routes 78 and S22 through the Desert Subregion.
    ■ Traffic from Baja California, Mexico enters the unincorporated County through the Tecate Port of Entry
       in Tecate, U.S.A. in the Mountain Empire Subregion.
C OUNTY R OAD S YSTEM
With the exception of state-maintained highways and
roads, the County is responsible for the maintenance
of the public (Mobility Element and Local Public) road
network in the unincorporated areas, including
associated bicycle and pedestrian facilities. In
addition, the County also reviews development
projects with private roads to ensure adequate ingress
and egress is being provided. The three primary types
of roads under the purview of the County are as Mobility Element road
follows:
    ■ Mobility Element roads are County-maintained
       roads shown on the Mobility Element map and
       adopted in the General Plan. They provide for
       the movement of people and goods between
       and within communities in the County. The
       Mobility Element displays these roads showing
       both the road classification and its general
       alignment.                                         Via de Fortuna Road, a San Dieguito local public road
    ■ Local public roads are County-maintained roads
       that feed traffic onto Mobility Element roads.
       These roads are not adopted in the General
       Plan; therefore deviations from planned
       networks do not require a general plan
       amendment.
    ■ Private roads, including their rights-of-way, are
       not maintained by the County and generally are
                                                          Yellow Brick Road, a private road in Valley Center
       not available for general public use.
Transportation and land use are two important and related components of every community that help
establish its character and function. Land use decisions take into account the road network when assessing
the physical characteristics of the site along with resulting traffic impacts. Road design should minimize
impacts to land use by including elements and features that accommodate community needs and reflect the
character of the area. For example, the design of a four-lane road in an urbanized commercial center would
differ from a four-lane road in a sparsely developed rural area. Functional road classifications are correlated
to the Regional Categories identified in the Land Use Element.
While well designed roads respond to land use characteristics. A second major objective of the Mobility
Element is to develop roads that are multi-modal and can safely accommodate vehicular, as well as transit,
bicycle, equestrian, and pedestrian modes of travel. The San Diego County Public Road Standards and

supplemental manuals provide guidance for the road designs, along with including bus stops and non-
motorized circulation facilities into the road right-of-way.
C OUNTY R OAD O PERATIONS AND N ETWORK
The backbone of the County’s road network is referred to as the Mobility Element network, which includes
both State highways and County roads. However, the goals and policies for roadways apply to all roads,
public and private, unless otherwise stated.
The Mobility Element road network is based on a combination of physical and environmental conditions,
community input, and SANDAG traffic model forecasts based on full build-out of the General Plan land use
map. When physical and other constraints preclude constructing roads to the number of lanes required to
accommodate traffic with a LOS D or better, exceptions, coordinated with community planning or sponsor
groups, have been made to accept the road operating at LOS E or F, according to the SANDAG traffic model
forecasts. The SANDAG traffic model used 2030 projections for build-out of the regional (freeways, state
highways, and transit facilities) transportation network and the road networks and land use plans for
incorporated jurisdictions.
The road network identified by the Mobility Element is depicted on community level maps showing the road
classification series and the general route of each road (see Mobility Element Network Appendix). Freeways,
although shown on these maps, are included only for reference, as Mobility Element roads include State
highways, but not freeways. The maps are accompanied by a matrix that identifies the road segment, its
classification, any necessary improvements (such as a raised median, continuous or intermittent turn lanes,
passing lanes, reduced shoulder width, or increased right-of-way requirements), and special circumstances
including when it is deemed acceptable for a specific road segment to operate at a level of service E or F.
Further explanation regarding the operating levels of service for each road segment is provided in the
Background Material Section at the end of this chapter, along with specific exceptions to the established
levels of service.
R OAD C LASSIFICATIONS
The County’s road classifications are specific to roads operated and maintained by the County, and may be
different from roads in other jurisdictions. The County’s classification system is arranged by road type in a
hierarchy that begins with roads that provide the greatest capacity (six-lane roads) to those that provide the
least capacity (two-lane roads). The greater the road capacity, the more vehicles can travel on the roadway at
an acceptable level of service. Table M-1a (Road Classifications: Six- and Four-Lane Roads) and Table M-1b
(Road Classifications: Two-Lane Roads) provide a description for each classification, the number of travel
lanes, and both the minimum right-of-way requirements and the right-of-way requirements when bicycle
lanes and pathways are provided. The County’s Public Road Standards provide additional criteria for these
road types, such as design speed and threshold capacity. When the volume of a roadway increases beyond
the threshold capacity of its classification, a higher capacity classification is required.

GO ALS AND POLICIES
Flexibility  exists  within  the  Public  Road  Standards  for 
exceptions  that  may  be  appropriate  for  community 
context  or  other  reasons.  Additionally,  community 
specific  road  standards  may  also  be  prepared  to 
implement  context‐sensitive  solutions  for  individual 
communities.  Where  it  is  demonstrated  that 
permanent bus or transit facilities are needed, such as 
in a regional transit or school district plan based upon 
the demand and frequency of buses, additional right of 
way  may  be  required/obtained  for  the  provision  of  a 
bus  turn  out  at  designated  bus  stop  locations,  based 
upon  design  criteria  provided  by  the  transit  district  or  Residential street with parking 
school district. In some instances this has been done by 
utilizing part of the parkway in lieu of increasing the overall right‐of‐way. The bus turn‐outs are designed and 
implemented  on  a  case  by  case  basis  depending  on  the  need  and  design  parameters  at  the  proposed  bus 
turnouts. 
These  road  classifications  are  specific  to  County  Mobility  Element  roads,  and  although  another  jurisdiction 
may have a similar classification, the design criteria and standards are not necessarily the same. In addition, 
although State highways are included in the Mobility Element road network, the cross‐section and right‐of‐
way  requirements  for  State  highways  are  within  Caltrans’  jurisdiction  and  may  be  different  than  those  of 
Mobility  Element  road  classifications.  Generally  Caltrans  prefers  that  rural  conventional  highways  with  at‐
grade intersections and with speeds greater than 40 mph, have a Clear Recovery Zone of 20 feet beyond the 
edge of the traveled way. Fixed objects located at distances less than the required Clear Recovery Zone may 
not be allowed.

 A roadway that primarily serves medium to high volume traffic. Because of its high design speed, this road should typically be
 located in physically unconstrained areas and its use in Villages should be limited to industrial or heavy commercial areas
 with low levels of pedestrian and bicycle traffic. In some circumstances, an exception can be made for using a modified
 design speed of 45 mph.

 A roadway with a lower design speed and a wider parkway that should be used in Villages or similar locations where higher
 traffic volumes are combined with on-street parking, pedestrian, bicycle, and transit activities. The Boulevard Series can also
 be used in rural areas that are constrained by steep slopes or where the community requests a context sensitive solution that
 minimizes cut, fill, and grading requirements and pathways are requested.

 heavy non-motorized circulation and transit activities. This standard could also be used in semi-rural areas with high levels of
 “side friction” or access from adjacent parcels. Minor Collectors have a wide parkway that, in rural areas, can be used to
 grade slopes and improve visibility or moderate tight curves. In more urbanized areas, the wide parkway can be used for
 pathways and for landscape buffers between vehicular and non-vehicular circulation.

Local public roads provide important system connectivity and continuity for the road network designated by
the Mobility Element by providing access to local residential neighborhoods and commercial and industrial
areas. They support local traffic at a lower design speed and accommodate traffic volumes up to 4,500
average daily trips. The County Public Road Standards establish the local public road classifications and
specify the associated range of improvements.
Local public roads are normally not included in the Mobility Element network, but are depicted with the
network for informational purposes when they provide continuity between two Mobility Element roads,
especially those that would operate at an unacceptable level of service without the local public roads. Local
public roads are also depicted in areas that are currently undeveloped but planned as a future development
area. Right-of-way should be reserved for these roads for local ingress/egress and non-motorized uses until
subsequent planning efforts in the area determine specific locations of the local public road network. The
basic criteria for depicting local public roads in the Mobility Element are provided in the County’s Public Road
Standards.
L OCATION G UIDE
A Road Classification Location guide that expresses the suitability of a road classification based upon its
correlation to the County’s Regional Categories is provided as Table M-2 (Road Classification Suitability). As
shown in this table, road classifications with lower design speeds are recommended for Villages and for Semi-
Rural or Rural Lands with physical constraints. Classifications of roads should consider the predominant
topography or land use patterns, and a change in road classification should occur only at road intersections
or another easily identifiable location in the network.
At build-out of both the General Plan Land Use plan and designated road network, it is estimated that the
road network will not meet the desired level of service standard (LOS D) on approximately 10 percent of all
County roads and State highways. For these roads, a lower LOS was deemed acceptable only under special
circumstances based on specific criteria as described in Policy M-2.1.

R OAD N ETWORK
State law requires jurisdictions to develop a network that accommodates the land uses proposed in the
General Plan. A portion of the Mobility Element road network depicted in the Mobility Element Network
Appendix is currently in place, and the remainder will need to be constructed as development proceeds. The
network will be constructed by new development as a condition of project approval and/or mitigation for
project traffic-related impacts, by County capital improvement projects funded by the Transportation Impact
Fee (TIF) Program or other local funding, and by State or federal funds whenever available. The TIF fees
collected are to fund identified transportation facilities, or portions thereof, that will provide increased road
capacity necessitated by the cumulative impacts of future development. The primary objectives identified
below form the basis for the network.
    ■ Efficient and effective movement of people and goods—A primary goal of the Mobility Element is a
       road network that accommodates build-out of the land use map while operating with acceptable levels
       of congestion. The policies in this General Plan address the need to relieve traffic congestion by
       balancing the consideration of road capacity and connectivity with the accommodation of alternate
       modes of travel and the use of transportation demand management methods. Road capacity is based
       on the type of road constructed, along with its side friction, such as intersection spacing and
       driveways. Road capacity is maintained when the number of driveways accessing Mobility Element
       roads is minimized. In addition, a highly connected road network reduces the overall vehicle miles
       traveled and allows for a greater dispersion of the traffic.
    ■ Accommodate all users of the road right-of-way—The Mobility Element also supports the concept of
       complete streets that are designed and operated to enable safe access for all users and for all modes
       of travel including non-motorized users and transit riders. This includes users of all ages and abilities
       such as the elderly, children, and people with disabilities.
    ■ Right-of-way for road alignments reserved by development—New development generally causes the
       need for road improvements. Proposed development within or adjacent to the alignment of a road
       shown on the Mobility Element map will require coordination with the County to determine the extent
       to which property needs to be reserved for the alignment and the extent of property owner
       responsibility for construction of the roadway and right-of-way improvements for non-motorized uses.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                       4-11                                      GENERAL PLAN

                                                                        CHAPTER 4 MOBILITY ELEMENT
      An assessment of the need for coordinating the project development with the roadway, potential
      dedication of property, and/or acquisition of property will be discussed with the property owner. The
      County may, depending upon the specific circumstances, require dedication of the full width of the
      right-of-way for designated corridors or acquire all or a portion of the right-of-way for roads being
      constructed with TIF funds
   ■ The provision of a road network balanced with other General Plan goals—While providing for mobility
      is a primary goal, specific road improvements need to also consider factors such as the protection of
      environmental resources, the reduction of noise impacts, the development of livable communities,
      land use compatibility issues related to health risks from air pollution, and the effective allocation of
      limited County resources. New or expanded road alignments should avoid environmental constraints
      such as floodplains and steep slopes. Noise impacts from roads vary depending on the type of vehicle
      and the speed and volume of traffic. To limit noise impacts, high volume roadways should be located
      away from residential areas and sensitive noise receptors (such as schools) or should include noise
      mitigating factors in their design.
   ■ Road design, operation, and maintenance that reflects community character and the Community
      Plan—Transportation and land use are two related components of every community that help
      establish its character and function. Just as land use decisions take into account the road network,
      road design should include components and features that serve community needs and reflect the
      character of the surrounding area. Proper road design should accommodate both motorized and non-
      motorized users of the road and respond to both travel demands and the character of the place
      (neighborhood, village, open space, etc.) that the road traverses. Road design should also consider
      environmental impacts and minimize runoff pollutants entering County watersheds.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL M-1
Balanced Road Network. A safe and efficient road network that balances regional travel needs with
the travel requirements and preferences of local communities.
Policies
M 1.1      Prioritized Travel within Community Planning Areas. Provide a public road network that
           accommodates travel between and within community planning areas rather than accommodating
           overflow traffic from State highways and freeways that are unable to meet regional travel
           demands.
M 1.2      Interconnected Road Network. Provide an interconnected public road network with multiple
           connections that improve efficiency by incorporating shorter routes between trip origin and
           destination, disperse traffic, reduce traffic congestion in specific areas, and provide both primary
           and secondary access/egress routes that support emergency services during fire and other
           emergencies.
M 1.3      Treatment of High-Volume Roadways. Consider narrower rights-of-way, flexibility in design
           standards, and lower design speeds in areas planned for substantial development in order to avoid
           bisecting communities or town centers. Reduce noise, air, and visual impacts of new freeways,
           regional arterials, and Mobility Element roads, through landscaping, design, and/or careful
           location of facilities.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                     4-12                                 GENERAL PLAN

GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL M-2
Responding to Physical Constraints and Preservation Goals. A road network that provides
adequate capacity to reasonably accommodate both planned land uses and regional traffic patterns,
while supporting other General Plan goals such as providing environmental protections and
enhancing community character.
Policies
M-2.1   Level of Service Criteria. Require development projects to Refer to the Background Material
        provide associated road improvements necessary to achieve a section (Road Segments Where
        level of service of “D” or higher on all Mobility Element roads Adding Travel Lanes is Not
        except for those where a failing level of service has been Justified) at the end of this
        accepted by the County pursuant to the criteria specifically chapter for list of road segments
                                                                                               accepted to operate at LOS E/F.
        identified in the accompanying text box (Criteria for Accepting a
        Road Classification with Level of Service E/F).                             When
        development is proposed on roads where a failing level of service has been accepted, require
        feasible mitigation in the form of road improvements or a fair share contribution to a road
        improvement program, consistent with the Mobility Element road network.
          Criteria for Accepting a Road Classification with Level of Service E / F
          Identified below are the applicable situations, and potential improvement options, for accepting a road classification
          where a Level of Service E / F is forecast. The instances described below specify when the adverse impacts of adding
          travel lanes do not justify the resulting benefit of increased traffic capacity. In addition, adding capacity to roads can
          be growth inducing in areas where additional growth is currently not planned, which is not consistent with County
          Global Climate Change strategies.
          Marginal Deficiencies
          When This Would Apply—Marginal deficiencies are characterized when only a short segment of a road is forecast to
          operate at LOS E or F, or the forecasted traffic volumes are only slightly higher than the LOS D threshold. Classifying
          the road with a designation that would add travel lanes for the entire road would be excessive and could adversely
          impact community character and / or impede bicycle and pedestrian circulation. Also, in some instances, although
          underutilized alternate routes exist that could accommodate the excess traffic; they were not included in the traffic
          forecast model.
          Potential Improvement Options—Rather than increase the number of travel lanes for the entire road segment to
          achieve a better LOS, it is more prudent to apply operational improvements only on the portion of the road operating
          at LOS E and F. This may require specifying a road classification “With Improvement Options” to retain sufficient right-
          of-way to construct any necessary operational improvements.
          Town Center Impacts
          When This Would Apply—This situation would apply when the right-of-way required to add travel lanes would
          adversely impact established land development patterns and / or impede bicycle and pedestrian circulation. The
          Community Development Model (see the General Plan’s Guiding Principle #2) concept strives to establish a land
          development pattern with compact villages and town centers surrounded by areas of low and very low density
          development. The construction of large multi-lane roads could divide an established town center, even though the
          intent of the road would be to connect areas within the community or improve access to areas within or surrounding
          the community.
          Potential Improvement Options—Traffic congestion impacts can be mitigated without adding travel lanes by
          establishing alternate parallel routes that would distribute the traffic volumes, such as a network of local public roads.
          Other means of mitigating traffic congestion impacts other than increasing the number of traffic lanes include
          promoting the use of alternate modes of travel in town centers to reduce single-occupant vehicle trips or maximizing
          the efficiency of a roadway with operational improvements, such as intersection improvements.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                            4-13                                            GENERAL PLAN

                                                                                 CHAPTER 4 MOBILITY ELEMENT
          Regional Connectivity
          When This Would Apply—Regional connectivity issues would apply when congestion on State freeways and highways
          causes regional travelers to use County roads, resulting in congestion on the County road network. Rather than
          widening County roads to accommodate this traffic, the deficiencies in the regional road network should be
          addressed.
          Potential Improvement Options—Coordinate with SANDAG to identify the necessary improvements to the regional
          transportation network and to support appropriate priority in the Regional Transportation Plan to improve these
          congested freeways and highways, rather than contributing to increased congestion on County roads.
          Impacts to Environmental and Cultural Resources
          When This Would Apply—This situation would occur when adding travels lanes to a road that would adversely impact
          environmental and cultural resources such as significant habitat, wetlands, MSCP preserves, wildlife movement,
          historic landmarks, stands of mature trees, or archaeological sites. This situation would also occur in areas with steep
          slopes where widening roads would require massive grading, which would result in adverse environmental impacts
          and other degradation of the physical environment.
          Potential Improvement Options—Provide improvement options, such as passing lanes, to areas without significant
          environmental or cultural constraints. This may require specifying a road classification “With Improvement Options”
          to retain sufficient right-of-way to construct any necessary operational improvements.
M-2.2    Access to Mobility Element Designated Roads. Minimize direct access points to Mobility Element
         roads from driveways and other non-through roads to maintain the capacity and improve traffic
         operations.
M-2.3    Environmentally Sensitive Road Design. Locate and design public and private roads to minimize
         impacts to significant biological and other environmental and visual resources. Avoid road
         alignments through floodplains to minimize impacts on floodplain habitats and limit the need for
         constructing flood control measures. Design new roads to maintain wildlife movement and retrofit
         existing roads for that purpose. Utilize fencing to reduce road kill and to direct animals to under
         crossings.
M-2.4    Roadway Noise Buffers. Incorporate buffers or other noise Sensitive noise-receptors are
         reduction measures consistent with standards established in the described in the Noise Element.
         Noise Element into the siting and design of roads located next to
         sensitive noise-receptors to minimize adverse impacts from traffic noise. Consider reduction
         measures such as alternative road design, reduced speeds, alternative paving, and setbacks or
         buffers, prior to berms and walls.
M-2.5    Minimize Excess Water Runoff. Require road improvements to be designed and constructed to
         accommodate stormwater in a manner that minimizes demands upon engineered stormwater
         systems and to maximize the use of natural detention and infiltration techniques to mitigate
         environmental impacts.
GOAL M-3
Transportation Facility Development. New or expanded transportation facilities that are phased
with and equitably funded by the development that necessitates their construction.
Policies
M-3.1    Public Road Rights-of-Way. Require development to dedicate right-of-way for public roads and
         other transportation routes identified in the Mobility Element roadway network (see Mobility
         Element Network Appendix), Community Plans, or Road Master Plans. Require the provision of
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                           4-14                                          GENERAL PLAN

GOALS AND POLICIES
         sufficient right-of-way width, as specified in the County Public Road Standards and Community
         Trails Master Plan, to adequately accommodate all users, including transit riders, pedestrians,
         bicyclists, and equestrians.
M-3.2    Traffic Impact Mitigation. Require development to contribute its fair share toward financing
         transportation facilities, including mitigating the associated direct and cumulative traffic impacts
         caused by their project on both the local and regional road networks. Transportation facilities
         include road networks and related transit, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and equestrian.
M-3.3    Multiple Ingress and Egress. Require development to provide multiple ingress/egress routes in
         conformance with State law and local regulations.
GOAL M-4
Safe and Compatible Roads. Roads designed to be safe for all users and compatible with their
context.
Policies
M-4.1    Walkable Village Roads. Encourage multi-modal
         roads in Villages and compact residential areas
         with pedestrian-oriented development patterns
         that enhance pedestrian safety and walkability,
         along with other non-motorized modes of travel,
         such as designing narrower but slower speed
         roads that increase pedestrian safety.
M-4.2    Interconnected Local Roads. Provide an
         interconnected and appropriately scaled local
         public road network in Village and Rural Villages
         that reinforces the compact development Road in Valle de Oro with bicycle lane and multi-use
         patterns promoted by the Land Use Element and pathway
         individual community plans.
M-4.3    Rural Roads Compatible with Rural Character. Design and construct public roads to meet travel
         demands in Semi-Rural and Rural Lands that are consistent with rural character while safely
         accommodating transit stops when deemed necessary, along with bicyclists, pedestrians, and
         equestrians. Where feasible, utilize rural road design features (e.g., no curb and gutter
         improvements) to maintain community character. [See applicable community plan for possible
         relevant policies.]
M-4.4    Accommodate Emergency Vehicles. Design and construct public and private roads to allow for
         necessary access for appropriately-sized fire apparatus and emergency vehicles while
         accommodating outgoing vehicles from evacuating residents.
M-4.5    Context Sensitive Road Design. Design and construct roads that are compatible with the local
         terrain and the uses, scale and pattern of the surrounding development. Provide wildlife crossings
         in road design and construction where it would minimize impacts in wildlife corridors.
M-4.6    Interjurisdictional Coordination. Coordinate with adjacent jurisdictions so that roads within
         Spheres of Influence (SOIs) or that cross jurisdictional boundaries are designed to provide a

                                                                           CHAPTER 4 MOBILITY ELEMENT
            consistent cross-section and capacity. To the extent practical, coordinate with adjacent
            jurisdictions to construct road improvements concurrently or sequentially to optimize and
            maintain road capacity.
  Regional Transportation Coordination and Facilities
CONTEXT
The Mobility Element addresses the County-operated multi-modal transportation network that provides a
variety of mobility options within the unincorporated County. These services are provided by the County in
partnership with the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), Caltrans, transit agencies, the San
Diego County Airport Authority, and various railroad operators.
SANDAG is the Regional Transportation Planning Authority and has responsibility for planning and allocating
local, state, and federal funds for the region's transportation network. State law and the California
Transportation Commission require SANDAG to adopt a 20-year regional transportation plan every four
years, which considers improvements to freeways, state highways, transit, and regional bicycle and
pedestrian routes. A long-range plan, the 2030 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP): Pathways for the Future
addresses countywide growth through the year 2030 and is available on the SANDAG website at:
www.sandag.org/2030rtp.
The 2030 RTP identifies $4.5 billion in improvement projects for highway and regional arterials in the
unincorporated County necessary to accommodate development capacity through 2030. The Mobility
Element road network is based on reasonably
expected revenue forecasts where $3.7 billion in funds
of the $4.5 billion in requirements will be available to
fund improvement projects in the unincorporated
County through 2030.
State highways serve intra-county traffic and include
State Routes 67, 76, 78, 79, 94, and 125. The design of
these roadways varies according to the volume of
traffic they carry and ranges from freeway-style
construction to two-lane rural roads with at-grade
intersections. Generally, these roads require a larger
right-of-way so they can be expanded if future traffic
                                                             Interstate 15 looking north
volumes warrant.
In addition to the County’s road network, there are other regional facilities that are critical to the movement
of people and goods within unincorporated areas as well as the larger region including freight and cargo
services via truck or rail, and air travel from local airports that primarily accommodate private aircraft, with
limited, if any cargo service. These facilities, in conjunction with the County’s extensive roadway network,
provide a safe and comprehensive multi-modal mobility system for County residents, businesses, and
visitors.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                     4-16                                  GENERAL PLAN

GOALS AND POLICIES
T RUCK R OUTES
Trucks are the primary mode used to move goods in and out of the San Diego region although rail, water
transport, and air transport facilities are located in the region and contribute to this goods movement
system. Commercial trucking in San Diego region primarily uses interstate and State highways as routes of
travel. The SANDAG 2030 RTP identifies the major interstate highways and State routes used for commercial
trucking in the San Diego region and designated truck routes in the unincorporated County include the
following roadways:
    ■ Segments of Interstates 8 and 15
    ■ State Routes 94, 125, 188, and 905
    ■ Otay Mesa Road
The 2030 RTP states that the potential use of
managed lanes in off-peak periods will be evaluated
in the near future. It also identifies other
considerations for additional truck capacity that
include improvements on an outer loop which
includes SR 67, SR 94, and SR 125 in the
unincorporated County. Generally, County roads are

State Route 94 (Campo Road), south of Melody Road in the Jamul / Dulzura Subregion is proposed to remain
a two-lane road. This results in inherent limitations for truck traffic using this segment of SR-94. Truck traffic
should be shifted to Interstates 8, 805, and 905 and SR-125 after the Otay Mesa II and Calexico Ports of Entry
are upgraded.
R AIL F ACILITIES
The North County Transit District (NCTD) and Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) own and maintain the main
rail line along the coast from downtown San Diego to the Orange County line, which is shared between
Amtrak intercity, COASTER, and Metrolink commuter passenger rail services and Burlington North Santa Fe
(BNSF) Railway freight service. NCTD also owns the rail corridor between Oceanside and Escondido, operating
SPRINTER light rail service, and shares the corridor with BNSF Railway freight service.
A freight line, the San Diego & Arizona Eastern Railway's Desert Line, is the primary rail line that traverses the
unincorporated County. Existing rail lines, such as the Desert Line, may be underutilized at their current
capacities. For these lines to remain economically feasible for continued operation, their usage should be
maximized to provide an alternative to trucks, especially on SR-94, whenever feasible. In addition, BNSF is the
operator of a freight line that runs from Oceanside to Escondido. The Amtrak and COASTER passenger lines
run along the coast through Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. In addition, historical abandoned rail rights-
of-way exist in broken segments, some of which are in public ownership, yet are currently underutilized and
should be encouraged for adaptive reuse, such as rail to trail conversions.
Since 1996, the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA) has been the state agency charged with
planning, designing, constructing, and operating a statewide high-speed train system. The High Speed Rail

alignment from San Diego would be connected to this proposed system via the Interstate 15 corridor, from
downtown San Diego to Escondido, Riverside County, and Los Angeles. The High Speed Rail alignment would
originate in Downtown San Diego linking University City, Escondido, Riverside County, and Los Angeles via the
San Diego-Los Angeles-San Luis Obispo Rail Corridor Agency (LOSSAN), Miramar Road/Carroll Canyon Road,
and Interstate 15 corridors. A programmatic environmental impact report/environmental impact statement
(PEIR/EIS) was certified in 2005 and planning work continues on the corridor.

San Diego International Airport, located in the city of
San Diego, along with John Wayne Airport (Orange
County), Los Angeles International Airport (Los Angeles
County), and Ontario International Airport (San
Bernardino County) are regional airports located in
Southern California that provide residents and
businesses in the unincorporated County with
passenger and cargo services.

In addition to San Diego International Airport, eleven
public-use airports are located within the boundaries of the County, along with four major military aviation
facilities and numerous independent airports and heliports. The County owns and operates eight of these
airports, six of which are located in the unincorporated County (Agua Caliente Airstrip, Borrego Valley
Airport, Fallbrook Community Airpark, Jacumba Airport, Ocotillo Airstrip, and Ramona Airport). The County
also owns Gillespie Field in the City of El Cajon and McClellan-Palomar Airport in the City of Carlsbad. The
remaining public-use airports include Brown Field and Montgomery Field (City of San Diego) and Oceanside
Municipal Airport (City of Oceanside). These airports are shown in Figure M-1 (Airport Locations).

  CONTEXT 
With  the  passage  of  State  law  (SB 1703),  SANDAG  is  now  responsible  for  transit  planning,  programming, 
project  development,  and  construction.  SANDAG  prepared  the 
2007–2011  Coordinated  Plan,  which  provides  a  framework  for 
transit system development over the next five years and reflects 
the  goals  and  direction  for  service  development  as  described  in 
the  2030  RTP.  This  plan  also  defines  the  level  of  service  for 
transit in suburban and rural areas as follows: 
   ■ Suburban—Direct  service  along  commute  corridors  with 
       critical mass featuring rapid, frequent service during peaks 
       with  seamless  coordinated  transfers,  and  local  service 
       focused on smart growth areas and lifeline needs 
   ■ Rural—Transportation services that run only a few times a  Pine Valley bus stop with rural‐level services 
       day on select days of the week (lifeline services)

                                                                          CHAPTER 4 MOBILITY ELEMENT
                                               The two agencies responsible for transit operations and services
                                               in the unincorporated County areas are the Metropolitan Transit
                                               System (MTS) and the North County Transit District (NCTD).
                                               Transit services provided by these agencies include heavy and
                                               light rail, fixed-route bus service, demand-response service, and
                                               paratransit. Existing transit services for the unincorporated
                                               County consist of limited regional or local bus services, and light
The Sprinter, operated by the North County
Transit District                               rail (the NCTD SPRINTER) in one very localized area. Transit
                                               services are primarily provided to the larger, more urbanized
communities, although limited services are available outside this area. In addition, tribal governments
operating casinos and non-profit agencies also provide transit services for their clients and customers.
SANDAG has the responsibility to designate the local Consolidated Transportation Services Agency (CTSA) in
adherence to and to be funded in part by the state Transportation Development Act (TDA). SANDAG then
retains regional oversight. The CTSA works to expand the availability and use of specialized transportation
services by serving as an information resource for specialized transportation providers and providing
technical assistance and public outreach to increase awareness of specialized transportation options. Full
Access & Coordinated Transportation, Inc. (FACT), appointed under contract by SANDAG to serve as the CTSA
for the San Diego region, is a non-profit corporation formed to coordinate and consolidate transportation
services to people with disabilities, senior citizens, and social service agencies.
In addition, Tribal governments established the Reservation Transportation Authority (RTA), a consortium of
24 tribes, in order to pool resources and more effectively coordinate on transportation issues. In conjunction
with SANDAG and the RTA, a consultant prepared a Transit Feasibility Study to assess the needs of tribes in
the County to improve access for medical, educational, employment, and other essential transportation
needs. As a result of the study, some bus routes were expanded.
The availability of public transit can reduce the dependency on motor vehicles and help to shape future
growth patterns. Due to existing and planned development patterns, there are currently limited plans for
expansion of transit service into unincorporated communities. Although transit currently comprises a small
percentage of total trips in the unincorporated County, certain corridors enjoy high transit ridership. In
addition, transit-supportive land uses can encourage increased transit use, and transit also is an important
public service for lower income residents as well as residents with special needs including seniors and the
disabled. A primary objective of the Land Use Element is to focus development in and around existing
unincorporated communities to maximize existing infrastructure, provide for efficient delivery of services,
and strengthen Town Center areas while preserving the rural landscape. The development patterns of the
Land Use Map are intended to facilitate the use of public transportation in Village areas.
The goals and policies in this section seek to maximize opportunities for transit ridership in Village areas
while reducing congestion on roadways.

GOALS AND POLICIES
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL M-8
Public Transit System. A public transit system that reduces automobile dependence and serves all
segments of the population.
Policies
M-8.1    Maximize Transit Service Opportunities. Coordinate with SANDAG, the CTSA, NCTD, and MTS to
         provide capital facilities and funding, where appropriate, to:
            ■ Maximize opportunities for transit services in unincorporated communities
            ■ Maximize the speed and efficiency of transit service through the development of transit
                priority treatments such as transit signal priority, transit queue jump lanes, and dedicated
                transit only lanes
            ■ Provide for transit-dependent segments of the population, such as the disabled, seniors, low
                income, and children, where possible
            ■ Reserve adequate rights-of-way to accommodate existing and planned transit facilities
                including bus stops
M-8.2    Transit Service to Key Community Facilities and Services. Locate key County facilities, healthcare
         services, educational institutions, and other civic facilities so that they are accessible by transit in
         areas where transit is available. Require those facilities to be designed so that they are easily
         accessible by transit, whenever possible.
M-8.3    Transit Stops That Facilitate Ridership. Coordinate with SANDAG, NCTD, and MTS to locate transit
         stops and facilities in areas that facilitate transit ridership, and designate such locations as part of
         planning efforts for Town Centers, transit nodes, and large-scale commercial or residential
         development projects. Ensure that the planning of Town Centers and Village Cores incorporates
         uses that support the use of transit, including multi-family residential and mixed-use transit–
         oriented development, when appropriate.
M-8.4    Transit Amenities. Require transit stops that are accessible to pedestrians and bicyclists; and
         provide amenities for these users’ convenience.
M-8.5    Improved Transit Facilities. Require development projects, when appropriate, to improve existing
         nearby transit and/or park and ride facilities, including the provision of bicycle and pedestrian
         facilities, provisions for bus transit in coordination with NCTD and MTS as appropriate including,
         but not limited to, shelters, benches, boarding pads, and/or trash cans, and to provide safe,
         convenient, and attractive pedestrian connections.
M-8.6    Park and Ride Facilities. Coordinate with SANDAG, Caltrans, and tribal governments to study
         transit connectivity and address improving regional opportunities for park-and-ride facilities and
         transit service to gaming facilities and surrounding rural areas to reduce congestion on rural roads.
M-8.7    Inter-Regional Travel Modes. Coordinate with SANDAG, Caltrans, and the California High-Speed
         Rail Authority, where appropriate, to identify alternative methods for inter-regional travel to serve
         the unincorporated County residents.

  Transportation System and Travel Demand Management
CONTEXT
The road network designated in the Mobility Element strives to accommodate the Land Use Map while
minimizing the need to build new roads or improve existing roads. Transportation System Management seeks
to optimize the transportation network, while Travel Demand Management seeks to reduce the use of the
road network.
T RANSPORTATION S YSTEM M ANAGEMENT (TSM)
TSM strategies focus on increasing the efficiency, safety, and capacity of existing transportation systems
through strategies that relieve, lessen, or control congestion with minimal roadway widening. Techniques
include performance monitoring, various types of intersection modifications, advanced technology,
coordinated traffic signal timing across jurisdictional boundaries and with freeway ramps, signage and
lighting upgrades, facility design treatments, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, and targeted traffic
enforcement. These strategies can reduce vehicle travel time and enhance system accessibility with little
impact on other modes. Reducing traffic congestion keeps automobiles on roads designated for regional
mobility, while minimizing through traffic within communities. Through better management and operation of
existing transportation facilities, these techniques are designed to improve traffic flow, air quality, and
movement of people and goods, as well as enhance system accessibility and safety.
T RAVEL D EMAND M ANAGEMENT (TDM)
TDM addresses traffic congestion by reducing travel demand rather than increasing transportation capacity.
TDM programs such as employer outreach, carpool partner matching, parking cash outs, vanpools, subsidies
and/or preferred parking to rideshare participants, guaranteed. rides home, bicycle lockers, and other
amenities for bicyclists and pedestrians including clothing lockers and shower facilities are designed to
increase the efficiency of the transportation system. TDM is a key tool to reduce single-occupant-vehicle
travel as well as facilitate mobility options for area residents. SANDAG manages the regional TDM program
including 511, a free phone and web service that consolidates the San Diego region's transportation
information into a one-stop resource. The 511 program provides up-to-the minute information on traffic
conditions, incidents and driving times, schedule, route and fare information for San Diego public
transportation services carpool and vanpool referrals, bicycling information and more. The County has an
opportunity to facilitate the use of TDM methods by encouraging land use planning and infrastructure
improvements that better accommodate pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users. In addition, the County can
also offer incentives that encourage projects to implement TDM programs.

GOALS AND POLICIES
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL M-9
Effective Use of Existing Transportation Network. Reduce the need to widen or build roads through
effective use of the existing transportation network and maximizing the use of alternative modes of
travel throughout the County.
Policies
M-9.1     Transportation Systems Management. Explore the provision of operational improvements (i.e.
          adding turn lanes, acceleration lanes, intersection improvements, etc.) that increase the effective
          vehicular capacity of the public road network prior to increasing the number of road lanes. Ensure
          operational improvements do not adversely impact the transit, bicycle, and pedestrian networks.
M-9.2     Transportation Demand Management. Require large commercial and office development to use
          TDM programs to reduce single-occupant vehicle traffic generation, particularly during peak
          periods to maximize the capacity of existing or improved road facilities.
M-9.3     Preferred Parking. Encourage and provide incentives for commercial, office, and industrial
          development to provide preferred parking for carpools, vanpools, electric vehicles and flex cars.
          [Refer also to Policy COS-16.3 (Low-Emission Vehicles) in the Conservation and Open Space
          Element.] Encourage parking cash out programs
          to reimburse employees for the cost of “free”
          on-site parking to provide incentives to use
          alternate modes of travel and to reduce parking
          requirements (see also Policy M-10.5).
M-9.4     Park-and-Ride Facilities. Require developers of
          large projects to provide, or to contribute to,
          park-and-ride       facilities    near    freeway
          interchanges and other appropriate locations
          that provide convenient access to congested
          regional arterials. Require park-and-ride
          facilities that are accessible to pedestrians and
          bicyclists, and include bicycle lockers and transit Park-and-ride facility at Jamacha Boulevard in Spring
          stops whenever feasible.                            Valley

                                                                         CHAPTER 4 MOBILITY ELEMENT
  Parking
CONTEXT
Parking is an essential component of an efficient
transportation system that includes accommodation
for automobiles, motorcycles, and bicycles. Parking
requirements have an ability to alter transportation
choices. Excess free parking promotes an auto-
oriented community, discourages high-frequency
transit, and can negatively affect walkability. Yet as
land becomes scarcer and construction costs
increase, so do the costs of providing parking. If an
insufficient number of vehicular parking spaces are
                                                          Parking in a commercial area in Fallbrook
provided, additional travel is required to find a
parking space, causing congestion and delays. If too much vehicular parking is provided, a larger portion of
the site is unnecessarily paved, causing degradation in community character and excess stormwater run-off.
The provision of a sufficient quantity of bicycle parking, that is both secure and convenient, will contribute to
increased bicycle usage. In addition, a multi-modal transportation network that reduces the reliance on
single-occupant vehicles reduces the number of parking spaces needed.
Parking spaces are either provided on the street or within a project site as parking lots. Parking regulations
address off-street parking in an effort to provide functionally adequate, safe, convenient, and aesthetically
pleasing parking and loading facilities for motor vehicles. On-street parking is allowed within the road
shoulder, unless the County imposes a parking prohibition. If a parking prohibition is in place, the shoulder is
available for use as a bike facility.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL M-10
Parking for Community Needs. Parking regulations that serve community needs and enhance
community character.
Policies
M-10.1      Parking Capacity. Require new development to:
              ■ Provide sufficient parking capacity for motor vehicles consistent with the project’s location,
                 use, and intensity
              ■ Provide parking facilities for motorcycles and bicycles
              ■ Provide staging areas for regional and community trails
M-10.2      Parking for Pedestrian Activity. Require the design and placement of on-site automobile,
            motorcycle, and bicycle parking in Villages and Rural Villages that encourages pedestrian activity
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                    4-26                                      GENERAL PLAN

GOALS AND POLICIES
           by providing a clear separation between vehicle and pedestrian areas and prohibit parking areas
           from restricting pedestrian circulation patterns.
M-10.3     Maximize On-street Parking. Encourage the use of on-street parking in commercial and/or high-
           density residential town center areas to calm traffic and improve pedestrian interaction. Traffic
           operations and pedestrian safety must not be compromised.
M-10.4     Shared Parking. Support town center plans, when desired by the community, that incorporate on-
           street and/or shared vehicular parking facilities to reduce on-site parking requirements.
M-10.5     Reduced Parking. Accommodate appropriate reductions in on- Transportation Demand
           site parking requirements in situations such as:                       Management programs are
              ■  Development of low-income and senior housing                     described in the previous section.
              ■  Development located near transit nodes
              ■  Employment centers that institute Transportation Demand Management programs
              ■  Development that integrates other parking demand reductions techniques such as parking
                 cash out, when ensured by ongoing permit conditions
M-10.6     On-Street Parking. Minimize on-street vehicular parking outside Villages and Rural Villages where
           on-street parking is not needed, to reduce the width of paved shoulders and provide an
           opportunity for bicycle lanes to retain rural character in low-intensity areas. Where on-street
           parking occurs outside Villages and Rural Villages, require the design to be consistent with the
           rural character. [See applicable community plan for possible relevant policies.]
M-10.7     Parking Area Design for Stormwater Runoff. Require that parking areas be designed to reduce
           pollutant discharge and stormwater runoff through site design techniques such as permeable
           paving, landscaped infiltration areas, and unpaved but reinforced overflow parking areas that
           increase infiltration. Require parking areas located within or adjacent to preserve areas to also
           include native landscaping and shielded lighting.
 Bicycle, Pedestrian, and Trail Facilities
CONTEXT
The Mobility Element recognizes that a well planned and
designed multi-modal road network, complete with non-
motorized travel options that include bicycle and
pedestrian facilities as well as hiking, horseback riding, and
mountain biking trails and pathways, offers an important
alternative to motor-vehicle use. These modes of travel
also reduce traffic congestion, dependency on motorized
vehicles, roadway noise, and air pollution. A safe and
enjoyable walk, hike, bike ride, or horseback ride
experience provides many health benefits and encourages
more people to walk or bicycle rather than drive their
vehicles.                                                        Bike path in the Sweetwater Regional Park
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                    4-27                                      GENERAL PLAN

                                                                            CHAPTER 4 MOBILITY ELEMENT
The California Highway Design Manual defines a "Bikeway" as a facility that is provided primarily for bicycle
travel. The County Public Road Standards include provisions to allow the construction of Class I, Class II, or
Class III bikeways as defined in the California Highway Design Manual, which are described below.
            (1) Class I Bikeway (Bike Path). Provides a completely separated right of way for the exclusive use
                of bicycles and pedestrians with crossflow by motorists minimized.
            (2) Class II Bikeway (Bike Lane). Provides a striped lane for one-way bike travel on a street or
                highway.
            (3) Class III Bikeway (Bike Route). Provides for shared use with pedestrian or motor vehicle traffic.
SANDAG is in the process of developing a regional bicycle plan update that seeks to encourage development
of a unified regional bicycle system that will serve the needs of bicycle riders by identifying the best ways to
provide connections to local and regional activity centers, transit facilities, and regional trail systems. The
County’s Bicycle Transportation Plan, the County's near term plan for constructing bicycle facilities, is
coordinated with the regional plan, and guides the development and maintenance of a bicycle network,
support facilities, and other programs for the unincorporated portions of the County. Completing gaps in the
bicycle network is a consideration, among other priorities as well, for allocation of funds and the inclusion of
a project. Careful consideration is given when weighing the use of limited funds to build Class I Bikeways. In
corridors that could be treated with Class II or Class III bicycle facilities by way of minimal investment, options
that would complete bicycle networks in the near-term are pursued.
In addition to bicycle lanes and routes, the County Trails Program provides an extensive natural surface trails
system that supplements the road network as an alternative off-road travel mode for County residents. Trails
are primarily designed for the purpose of recreation and significantly enhancing the quality of life and health
benefits associated with walking, hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding throughout the County’s
varied environments. The more urban and populated communities have few accessible trails. Most of the
existing trails are in the mountains and deserts, and when located within or adjacent to biological preserves
are guided by ecological principles and the County’s MSCP, which require mitigation of impacts to biological
resources. Additional trails are needed closer to population centers in the western portion of the County to
provide residents with convenient access and opportunities to enjoy the recreational, health and
transportation benefits associated with these facilities. The two types of regional trail facilities are identified
below.
    ■ Trails, typically located away from vehicular roads,
       are primarily recreational in nature but can also
       serve as an alternative mode of transportation. They
       are soft-surface facilities for single or multiple uses
       by pedestrians, equestrians, and mountain
       bicyclists. Trail characteristics vary depending on
       location and user types.
    ■ Pathways are facilities located within a parkway or
       road right-of-way. A riding and hiking trail located in
       the road right-of-way is considered a pathway. They
       are typically soft-surfaced facilities intended to
       serve both circulation and recreation purposes.
       Pathways help make critical connections and are an Pathway in Blossom Valley in Lakeside
       integral part of a functional trail system.

GOALS AND POLICIES
A regional trails map is included as Figure M-2 (Regional
Trails), which identifies approved general alignment
corridors for regional trails in the San Diego region. In
addition, regional trails are shown on the community
level maps in Figure M-A-1 through Figure M-A-23 of
the Mobility Element Network Appendix. These trails
have characteristics and conditions that serve a
regional function by covering long linear distances,
transcending community and/or municipal borders,
having state, national, or historical significance, or
providing important connections to existing parks, open
space preserves, and other public lands. Additional Pine Valley trail
existing trail segments and proposed reroutes for portions of some of the regional trails are identified in the
Community Trails Master Plan (CTMP), the implementation tool for the County Trails Program.

Background Material
  Level of Service
Level of service (LOS), a qualitative measure describing
operational conditions within a traffic stream and the
motorists' perceptions of those conditions, provides a
measure of how well a road is able to meet the
demands or volume of traffic. The capacity threshold
of a road is the maximum number of vehicles that can
traverse a uniform section of road within a specified
timeframe. Road capacity for County roads is
measured according to average daily traffic (ADT),
while State facilities are measured according to San Dieguito Trail
Caltrans criteria based on peak-hour volumes that a
roadway could accommodate.
Six LOS capacity thresholds are defined for each type of roadway, with letters A through F used to establish
the LOS measure. Criteria for each LOS threshold include: speed, travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic
interruptions, comfort, convenience, and safety. For example, LOS A represents free flow, almost complete
freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream. LOS F represents forced flow where more vehicles are
attempting to use the road facility than can be served resulting in stop and go traffic. Table M-3 (Level of
Service Descriptions) provides definitions for the various LOS categories based upon typical peak traffic
periods. LOS D is the standard to maintain for Mobility Element roads, unless the criteria presented in
Policy M-2.1 preclude improving roads beyond LOS E/F.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                    4-32                                 GENERAL PLAN

BACKGROUND MATERIAL
 Table M-3              Level of Service Descriptions
 LOS                                                                Description
        This LOS represents a completely free-flow conditions, where the operation of vehicles is virtually unaffected by the
  A
        presence of other vehicles and only constrained by the geometric features of the highway and by driver preferences.
        This LOS represents a relatively free-flow condition, although the presence of other vehicles becomes noticeable.
  B
        Average travel speeds are the same as in LOS A, but drivers have slightly less freedom to maneuver.
        At this LOS the influence of traffic density on operations becomes marked. The ability to maneuver within the traffic
  C
        stream is clearly affected by other vehicles.
        At this LOS, the ability to maneuver is notably restricted due to traffic congestion, and only minor disruptions can be
  D
        absorbed without extensive queues forming and the service deteriorating.
        This LOS represents operations at or near capacity. LOS E is an unstable level, with vehicles operating with minimum
  E     spacing for maintaining uniform flow. At LOS E, disruptions cannot be dissipated readily thus causing deterioration
        down to LOS F.
        At this LOS, forced or breakdown of traffic flow occurs, although operations appear to be at capacity, queues forms
  F     behind these breakdowns. Operations within queues are highly unstable, with vehicles experiencing brief periods of
        movement followed by stoppages.
 SOURCE: Highway Capacity Manual, 2000
 The LOS for operating on State highways is based upon Measures of Effectiveness (MOE) identified in the Highway Capacity
 Manual (HCM). Caltrans endeavors to maintain a target LOS at the transition between LOS C and LOS D. If an existing State
 highway facility is operating at less than this target LOS, the existing MOE should be maintained.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                                 4-33                                    GENERAL PLAN
                                                                            CHAPTER 4 MOBILITY ELEMENT
SANDAG and the County elected to be exempt from the State Congestion Management Plan (CMP) program,
which includes selected freeways, state highways, and regional arterials in the County. Existing CMP
monitoring, threshold levels, guidelines and mitigation strategies will be incorporated into other SANDAG
plans and/or programs as a result.
  Accepted Road Classifications with Level of Service E / F
As described under Goal M-2, there are instances where the County considers it more appropriate to retain a
road classification that could result in a LOS E / F rather than increase the number of travel lanes. These
instances are based on criteria established under Policy M-2.1. Table M-4 (Road Segments Where Adding
Travel Lanes is Not Justified) identifies the County segment where the County has determined that the
adverse impacts of adding travel lanes do not justify the resulting benefit of increased traffic capacity.

  CHAPTER 8 Noise Element 
 

                                                                                  CHAPTER 8 NOISE ELEMENT
Introduction 
  Purpose 
The  Noise  Element  of  the  General  Plan  provides  for  the  control  and  abatement  of  environmental  noise  to 
protect citizens from excessive exposure. 
  Guiding Principles for Noise 
Goals  and  policies  within  the  Noise  Element  support  the  Guiding  Principles  specified  in  Chapter 2  of  the 
General  Plan.  The  Guiding  Principles  speak  to  the  need  of  protecting  the  County’s  unique  natural 
environment and unique characteristics. The County of San Diego is characterized as a predominantly rural 
environment  that  contributes  significantly  to  peace  and  tranquility  that  exist  within  the  County.  The  Noise 
Element strives to preserve the quality of life by protecting residents from the obtrusive impacts of noise and 
noise‐generating uses such as traffic, construction, airplanes, and certain industrial uses. 
  Relationship to Other General Plan Elements 
A primary function of the Noise Element is to ensure that noise considerations are incorporated into the land 
use  decision‐making  process.  The  Noise  Element  is  closely  related  to  the  Land  Use,  Housing,  Mobility,  and 
Conservation and Open Space Elements. Recognition of the interrelationship of the Noise Element and these 
other Elements is necessary to prepare an integrated comprehensive General Plan. The following is a brief 
discussion of the relationship between the Noise Element and the other Elements of the General Plan. 
   ■ Land  Use—The  Noise  Element  establishes  noise  compatibility  guidelines  that  are  based  on  the 
       Regional Categories established in the Land Use Element. In addition, noise compatibility concerns are 
       taken into account during development of the Land Use Map. 
   ■ Housing—The  Housing  Element  considers  the  provision  of  adequate  sites  for  new  housing  and 
       standards  for  housing  stock.  Since  residential  use  is  among  the  most  noise  sensitive,  the  noise 
       exposure information provided in the Noise Element is taken into account when planning the location 
       of new housing. 
   ■ Mobility—The transportation network is the primary source of noise within San Diego County and is 
       closely correlated with both the Land Use and Noise Elements. Airports, depending upon the size and 
       type, can have a significant noise impact, which directly affects the type and intensity of land use. In 
       addition, noise impacts from roadways increase with vehicular travel speed and traffic volume. Noise 
       exposure  will  be  an  important  factor  in  the  location  and  design  of  new  transportation  routes  and 
       facilities, as well as in the mitigation of noise produced from existing roadways on existing and planned 
       land uses. 
   ■ Open  Space/Conservation—Excessive  noise  can  adversely  affect  biological  resources,  along  with  the 
       enjoyment  of  recreational  pursuits  in  parks  and  other  designated  open  spaces,  particularly  in  areas 
       where  a  quiet  environment  is  valued  as  part  of  the  recreational  or  outdoor  experience.  As  a  result, 
       noise  levels  are  considered  in  the  planning  of  habitat  conservation  areas  and  new  recreational  and

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
        open  space  areas.  Additionally,  open  space  can  be  used  to  separate  and  buffer  noise  sensitive  land 
        uses from noise producers by the effective use of setbacks and landscaped berms. 
  Scope and Content of the Noise Element 
The Noise Element establishes noise/land use compatibility standards and outlines goals and policies which 
can  be  used  to  achieve  these  standards.  The  first  section  of  the  Noise  Element  characterizes  the  noise 
environment  in  the  unincorporated  County  and  provides  the  context  for  the  County’s  noise  land  use 
compatibility  guidelines  and  standards.  The  second  section  describes  the  County’s  goals  for  achieving  the 
standards  and  introduces  policies  designed  to  implement  the  goals.  Implementation  measures  associated 
with the Noise Element are included separately in the Implementation Plan for the County’s General Plan. 
Background Information and Context 
The  County  of  San  Diego  is  characterized  as  a  predominantly  rural  environment  with  low‐density 
development that contributes significantly to the perceived quality of life and the peace and tranquility that 
exist  within  the  County.  Major  sources  of  noise  include  transportation‐  and  non‐transportation‐related 
activities, as discussed below. 
  Transportation Noise Sources 
The most common source of noise in most rural and semi‐
rural environments is transportation‐related. Transportation 
noise  sources  include  automobiles,  trucks,  other  vehicles, 
aircraft  operations,  and  railroads.  Traffic  on  the  County’s 
roadways  is  the  most  significant  and  pervasive  source  of 
noise in the County. There are several key factors associated 
with roadway or traffic noise, including traffic volumes, the 
speed  of  the  traffic;  the  type  or  “mix”  of  vehicles  using  a 
particular roadway; and pavement conditions. 
Another  area  of  noise  concern  is  the  noise  generated  by  Noise associated with freeways can have  
private,  military,  and  County  general  aircraft  operations.  significant noise impacts to adjacent uses. 
Noise  generated  from  aviation  operations  is  concentrated 
around the airport buildings, runways, and along approach and departure routes. 
Trains are another source of transportation‐related noise. The extent of the noise impact from a passenger 
and freight train pass‐by event will depend on many factors, including the frequency of train operations, the 
number of railway cars, the type of engine, and the number of grade crossings that require warning bells or 
horns.  In  addition,  train  pass‐by  events  may  cause  adjacent  land  uses  to  be  affected  by  groundborne 
vibration.

                                                                                   CHAPTER 8 NOISE ELEMENT
  Non‐transportation Noise Sources 
Non‐transportation‐related  noise  generators  are  commonly  called  “stationary,”  “fixed,”  “area,”  or  “point” 
sources  of  noise.  Industrial  processing,  mechanical  equipment,  pumping  stations,  and  heating,  ventilating, 
and  air  conditioning  (HVAC)  equipment  are  examples  of  fixed  location  non‐transportation  source  noise 
sources within the County of San Diego. Some non‐transportation sources are not stationary but are typically 
assessed  as  point  or  area  sources  due  to  the  limited  area  in  which  they  operate,  such  as  truck  deliveries, 
agricultural field machinery, and mining equipment. 
Noise generated by industrial and commercial operations, maintenance, manufacturing, truck traffic (loading 
docks), and warehousing noise can affect surrounding noise sensitive land uses. Noise perceived as disruptive 
by  residents  in  proximity  to  existing  agricultural  operations  may  result  from  the  operation  of  agricultural 
machinery  in  the  evening  or  early  morning  hours  when  many  residents  desire  a  quiet  environment.  In 
addition,  operation  of  exterior  exhaust  and  cooling  system  equipment  typically  used  in  greenhouse 
operations can be a source of noise that may affect surrounding land uses. 
Extractive  (mining)  operations  typically  involve  a  range  of 
noise‐generating  equipment,  operations,  and  sometimes 
include  blasting  noise.  Heavy  equipment  used  in  quarry 
and mining activities and blasting operations may generate 
noise  levels  that  are  incompatible  with  surrounding  land 
uses.  Additionally,  off‐site  noise  may  be  generated 
associated with the transportation of materials to and from 
                                                                      Non‐transportation‐related noise includes noise 
the mining facility. 
                                                                      generated from industrial uses such as rock crushing
Some  noise‐generating  activities  such  as  blasting  or  pile‐
driving  as  part  of  mining  or  construction  operations  may  also  result  in  excessive  levels  of  groundborne 
vibration that may affect nearby land uses. 
Intermittent or temporary neighborhood noise from amplified music, public address systems, barking dogs, 
landscape  maintenance,  stand‐by  power  generators,  and  construction  activities  are  disturbing  to  residents 
but are difficult to attenuate and control. 
  Noise‐Sensitive Land Uses 
Noise‐sensitive  land  uses  include  areas  where  an  excessive  amount  of  noise  would  interfere  with  normal 
activities. Primary noise‐sensitive land uses include residential uses, public and private educational facilities, 
hospitals, convalescent homes, hotels/motels, daycare facilities, and passive recreational parks. 
  Existing and Future Noise Levels 
Noise level contours are used as a guide for minimizing the exposure of community residents to noise. Noise 
contours  represent  lines  of  equal  noise  exposure,  just  as  the  lines  on  a  weather  map  indicate  equal 
temperature or atmospheric pressure. Contours are used to provide a general visualization of sound levels 
and should not be considered as absolute lines of demarcation. 
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                         8‐4                                       GENERAL PLAN 
 

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Noise contours for major transportation noise sources in the County were developed for existing and future 
conditions. Existing roadway noise contours were determined from the 2007 traffic levels and are expressed 
in  terms  of  the  Community  Noise  Equivalent  Level  (CNEL).  Refer  to  the  “Noise  Evaluation  Measurement” 
section  below  for  a  more  detailed  explanation  of  this  noise  exposure  index.  Existing  noise  contours  are 
shown  on  Figure N‐1  (Existing  Noise  Contours).  Figure N‐1  also  depicts  the  noise  contours  for  the  public 
airports  and  railroads  in  the  County.  The  noise  contours  do  not  account  for  the  attenuating  effects  of 
buildings,  walls,  structures,  unique  soil  types,  and  terrain  features  that  might  intervene  between  the  noise 
source  and  receiver.  Future  noise  contours  for  roadways  are  presented  on  Figure N‐2  (Future  Noise 
Contours)  for  year  2030  conditions.  These  future  contours  are  derived  from  traffic  data  for  the  year  2030 
developed for the Mobility Element of the General Plan. 
The noise contours shown for public airports are derived from information contained within the Airport Land 
Use Compatibility Plans (ALUCP) developed for each airport, which account for the future operations within 
each Airport Influence Area (AIA). Aircraft‐related noise impacts associated with the smaller private airports 
scattered  throughout  the  unincorporated  County  are  not  considered  to  be  significant  because  activities  at 
these airports are not anticipated to increase over the next 20 years. 
Noise Evaluation and Measurement 
  Quantification of Noise 
Noise is commonly defined as unwanted sound. Sound pressure magnitude is measured and quantified using 
a logarithmic ratio of pressures, the scale of which gives the level of sound in decibels (dB). To account for 
the pitch of sounds and an average human response to such sounds, a unit of measure called an A‐weighted 
sound pressure level (dBA) is used. 
A given level of noise may be more or less tolerable depending on the duration of exposure and the time of 
day  during  which  the  noise  is  experienced.  For  example,  noise  that  occurs  at  night  tends  to  be  more 
disturbing than that which occurs during the day. Because of this fact, several measures of noise exposure, or 
indices,  consider  both  the  magnitude  of  the  noise  level  and  the  time  of  day  at  which  it  occurs.  The  most 
commonly used indices for measuring community noise levels are the Equivalent Energy Level (Leq), and the 
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). 
     ■ Leq,  the  Equivalent  Energy  Level,  is  the  average  acoustic  energy  content  of  noise,  measured  during  a 
       prescribed period, such as one minute, 15 minutes, one hour, or eight hours. It is the decibel sound 
       level that contains an equal amount of energy as a fluctuating sound level over a given period of time. 
     ■ CNEL, Community Noise Equivalent Level, is average equivalent A‐weighted sound level over a 24‐hour 
       period.  This  measurement  applies  weights  to  noise  levels  during  evening  and  nighttime  hours  to 
       compensate for the increased noise‐sensitivity of people at those times. CNEL is the equivalent sound 
       level  for  a  24‐hour  period  with  a  +5 dBA  weighting  applied  to  all  sound  occurring  between  7:00 P.M. 
       and  10:00 P.M.  and  a  +10 dBA  weighting  applied  to  all  sound  occurring  between  10:00 P.M.  and 
       7:00 A.M.

  Noise Effects 
Noise has a significant effect on quality of life. An individual’s reaction to a particular noise depends on many 
factors such as the source of the noise, its loudness relative to the background noise level, and the time of 
day. The reaction to noise can also be highly subjective; the perceived effect of a particular noise can vary 
widely among individuals in a community. Because of the nature of the human ear, a sound must be about 
ten dB  greater  than  the  reference  sound  to  be  judged  as  twice  as  loud.  In  general,  a  three dB  change  in 
community  noise  levels  is  perceivable,  while  one  to  two dB  changes  generally  are  not  perceived.  Although 
the  reaction  to  noise  may  vary,  it  is  clear  that  noise  is  a  significant  component  of  the  environment,  and 
excessively  noisy  conditions  can  affect  an  individual’s  health  and  well‐being.  The  effects  of  noise  are often 
only transitory, but adverse effects can be cumulative with prolonged or repeated exposure. The effects of 
noise  on  a  community  can  be  organized  into  six  broad  categories:  noise‐induced  hearing  loss;  interference 
with  communication;  effects  on  sleep;  effects  on  performance  and  behavior;  extra‐auditory  health  effects; 
and annoyance. 
Noise Standards 
Noise exposure criteria are incorporated into land use planning to reduce future conflicts between noise and 
land use. This is achieved by specifying acceptable noise exposure ranges for various land uses throughout 
the  County.  The  County  uses  the  Noise  Compatibility  Guidelines  listed  in  Table N‐1  (Noise  Compatibility 
Guidelines) to determine the compatibility of land use when evaluating proposed development projects. 
The Noise Compatibility Guidelines indicate ranges of compatibility and are intended to be flexible enough to 
apply  to  a  range  of  projects  and  environments.  For  example,  a  commercial  project  would  be  evaluated 
differently than a residential project in a rural area or a mixed‐use project in a more densely developed area 
of the County. 
A land use located in an area identified as “acceptable” indicates that standard construction methods would 
attenuate exterior noise to an acceptable indoor noise level and that people can carry out outdoor activities 
with  minimal  noise  interference.  Land  uses  that  fall  into  the  “conditionally  acceptable”  noise  environment 
should have an acoustical study that considers the type of noise source, the sensitivity of the noise receptor, 
and the degree to which the noise source may interfere with sleep, speech, or other activities characteristic 
of the land use. For land uses indicated as “conditionally acceptable,” structures must be able to attenuate 
the  exterior  noise  to  the  indoor  noise  level  as  indicated  in  the  Noise  Standards  listed  in  Table N‐2  (Noise 
Standards).  For  land  uses  where  the  exterior  noise  levels  fall  within  the  “unacceptable”  range,  new 
construction generally should not be undertaken.

                                                                                           CHAPTER 8 NOISE ELEMENT
  Table N‐2              Noise StandardsNote 
  1. The exterior noise level (as defined in Item 3) standard for Category A shall be 60 CNEL, and the interior noise level
     standard for indoor habitable rooms shall be 45 CNEL.
  2. The exterior noise level standard for Categories B and C shall be 65 CNEL, and the interior noise level standard for
     indoor habitable rooms shall be 45 CNEL.
  3. The exterior noise level standard for Categories D and G shall be 65 CNEL and the interior noise level standard shall be
     50 dBA Leq (one hour average).
  4. For single-family detached dwelling units, “exterior noise level” is defined as the noise level measured at an outdoor living
     area which adjoins and is on the same lot as the dwelling, and which contains at least the following minimum net lot area:
     (i) for lots less than 4,000 square feet in area, the exterior area shall include 400 square feet, (ii) for lots between 4,000
     square feet to 10 acres in area, the exterior area shall include 10 percent of the lot area; (iii) for lots over 10 acres in area,
     the exterior area shall include 1 acre.
  5. For all other residential land uses, "exterior noise level" is defined as noise measured at exterior areas which are provided
     for private or group usable open space purposes. “Private Usable Open Space” is defined as usable open space intended
     for use of occupants of one dwelling unit, normally including yards, decks, and balconies. When the noise limit for Private
     Usable Open Space cannot be met, then a Group Usable Open Space that meets the exterior noise level standard shall
     be provided. “Group Usable Open Space” is defined as usable open space intended for common use by occupants of a
     development, either privately owned and maintained or dedicated to a public agency, normally including swimming pools,
     recreation courts, patios, open landscaped areas, and greenbelts with pedestrian walkways and equestrian and bicycle
     trails, but not including off-street parking and loading areas or driveways.
  6. For non-residential noise sensitive land uses, exterior noise level is defined as noise measured at the exterior area
     provided for public use.
  7. For noise sensitive land uses where people normally do not sleep at night, the exterior and interior noise standard may be
     measured using either CNEL or the one-hour average noise level determined at the loudest hour during the period when
     the facility is normally occupied.
  8. The exterior noise standard does not apply for land uses where no exterior use area is proposed or necessary, such as a
     library.
  9. For Categories E and F the exterior noise level standard shall not exceed the limit defined as “Acceptable” in Table N-1 or
     an equivalent one-hour noise standard.
Note: Exterior Noise Level compatibility guidelines for Land Use Categories A‐H are identified in Table N‐1, 
Noise Compatibility Guidelines. 
In  addition,  the  County  has  adopted  community  noise  control  standards  as  part  of  the  County’s  Noise 
Abatement and Control Ordinance (County Code of Regulatory Ordinances, Title 3, Division 6, Chapter 4) and 
provides guidance for implementation of the County’s noise policies and ordinance in the County’s California 
Environmental  Quality  Act  (CEQA)  Guidelines  for  Determining  Significance  for  Noise.  The  Noise  Ordinance 
defines  limits  for  activities  that  generate  excessive  noise  and  sets  noise  level  limits  for  land  uses.  The 
County’s  CEQA  significance  guidelines  provide  guidance  on  the  use  of  the  General  Plan  Noise  Element  and 
the  County  Noise  Abatement  and  Control  Ordinance  when  considering  the  environmental  impact  of  noise 
exposure to high or excessive noise levels.

GO ALS AND POLICIES
Goals and Policies for Noise Element 
  Land Use Compatibility 
CONTEXT 
The following goals and policies are directed at preserving rural areas from the encroachment of urban noise. 
Promoting compatibility between land uses prevents exposure of residents from excessive noise levels while 
protecting facilities or operations that may generate noise but are essential to the economic viability of the 
County. 
GOALS AND POLICIES 
GOAL N‐1 
Land  Use  Compatibility.  A  noise  environment  throughout  the  unincorporated  County  that  is 
compatible with the land uses. 
Policies 
N‐1.1     Noise Compatibility Guidelines. Use the Noise Compatibility Guidelines (Table N‐1) and the Noise 
          Standards (Table N‐2) as a guide in determining the acceptability of exterior and interior noise for 
          proposed land uses. 
N‐1.2     Noise  Management  Strategies.  Require  the  following  strategies  as  higher  priorities  than 
          construction of conventional noise barriers where noise abatement is necessary: 
             ■ Avoid placement of noise sensitive uses within noisy areas 
             ■ Increase setbacks between noise generators and noise sensitive uses 
             ■ Orient  buildings  such  that  the  noise  sensitive  portions  of  a  project  are  shielded  from  noise 
                 sources 
             ■ Use sound‐attenuating architectural design and building features 
             ■ Employ  technologies  when  appropriate  that  reduce  noise  generation  (i.e.  alternative

CHAPTER 7 Safety Elemen
                                                                           CHAPTER 7 SAFETY ELEMENT
Introduction
  Purpose and Scope
The purpose of the Safety Element is to include safety considerations in the planning and decision-making
process by establishing policies related to future development that will minimize the risk of personal injury,
loss of life, property damage, and environmental damage associated with natural and man-made hazards.
The Safety Element addresses the County of San Diego’s natural hazards and human activities that may pose
a threat to public safety within the following topic areas:
    ■  Wildfires
    ■  Geological and Seismic Hazards
    ■  Flooding
    ■  Hazardous Materials
    ■  Law Enforcement
    ■  Airport Hazards
The Safety Element provides policy direction that supports laws and regulations related to safety hazards as
well as policies that support the guiding principles established for this General Plan.
  Guiding Principles for Safety
The Safety Element maps, goals, and policies support the Guiding Principles specified in Chapter 2 of the
General Plan. Specifically, Guiding Principle 5 provides direction for the Safety Element to ensure that
development accounts for physical constraints and the natural hazards of the land. The Safety Element
supports this principle through numerous policies that locate development away from hazardous areas and
ensure safety and security for all communities within the County. Goals and polices of the Safety Element
protect residents and areas from wildland and urban fire, crime, hazardous materials incidents, flooding,
earthquakes, and hazardous incidents from aircrafts.
  Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
Several Safety Element policies are interrelated with mandated topics in the Land Use, Circulation, and
Conservation and Open Space Elements. For example, Land Use Maps seek to minimize future development
in hazardous areas. Policies to minimize the risks posed from wildland fires, found in the fire hazards section
of the Safety Element, are also found in the Land Use and Conservation and Open Space Elements. In
addition, policies associated with secondary access during a fire emergency are found in the Mobility
Element. References to related policies are provided where appropriate within the Safety Element. It is
important to remember, however, that policies in the Safety Element are tailored to address safety-related
issues and referenced policies in other Elements should also be reviewed to determine environmental or
other types of policies associated with similar locations or types of development.

GOALS AND POLICIES
Goals and Policies for Safety Element
  Hazards Mitigation, Disaster Preparedness, and Emergency
  Response
CONTEXT
This section contains goals and policies that provide for the safety and protection of life and property from
the occurrence of a natural or manmade hazard and apply generally to any potential hazardous event, which
may be addressed further in other topic areas in this Element.
H AZARDS M ITIGATION
On October 19, 2004, the Board of Supervisors adopted the Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan
(HMP) in compliance with federal and State regulations intended to reinforce the importance of mitigation
planning and emphasized planning for disasters before they occur. The HMP is a comprehensive assessment
of natural hazards including coastal storms, erosion and tsunami, dam failure, earthquakes, floods, rain-
induced landslides, liquefaction, structure/wildland fires, and manmade hazards, including technological and
terrorism. The plan enhances public awareness and understanding, creates a decision tool for management,
promotes compliance with State and Federal program requirements, enhances local policies for hazard
mitigation capability, and provides inter-jurisdictional coordination of mitigation-related programming.
D ISASTER P REPAREDNESS
Saving lives and the protection of life, the environment, and property are the primary goals of governmental
public safety agencies in any emergency or disaster. Emergency plans provide the basis from which response
and recovery operations are executed. The success of these plans depends largely, in part, on the
collaboration of agencies and jurisdictions responsible for the development and maintenance of these plans.
The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services (OES) coordinates the overall County response to
disasters. OES is responsible for alerting and notifying appropriate agencies when disaster strikes;
coordinating all agencies that respond; ensuring resources are available and mobilized in times of disaster;
developing plans and procedures for response to and recovery from disasters; and developing and providing
preparedness materials for the public. OES and numerous regional partners have completed two important
public safety preparedness plans related to disaster evacuations and recovery:
       ■ The San Diego Operational Area Evacuation Plan—The Evacuation Plan is intended to be used as a
          template, as cities throughout the County continue to develop their individual evacuation plans.
          The Plan outlines procedures and organizational structures that can be used for a coordinated
          regional evacuation effort. Transportation routes and capacities are identified in addition to
          countywide shelter space and considerations for special needs populations.
       ■ The San Diego Operational Recovery Plan—The Recovery Plan is designed to provide guidance to
          jurisdictions and organizations within the County of San Diego as they continue their own
          recovery planning. The plan addresses short and long-term restoration plans for communities
          impacted by disaster, including issues such as: debris removal, coordination of financial assistance

                                                                           CHAPTER 7 SAFETY ELEMENT
         and housing, economic recovery, and measures to reduce or eliminate the effects of future
         incidents.
E MERGENCY R ESPONSE
OES coordinates the overall County response to disasters, including alerting and notifying appropriate
agencies, coordinating all responding agencies, ensuring resources are available and mobilized, developing
response and recovery plans and procedures, and providing preparedness materials for the public. The
Unified Disaster Council (UDC), the governing body of the Unified San Diego County Emergency Services
Organization, is chaired by the Chair of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors and includes
representatives from the 18 incorporated cities. OES serves as staff to the UDC and acts as a liaison between
the incorporated cities, the State Office of Emergency Services and FEMA, as well as non-governmental
agencies such as the American Red Cross.

           evacuation program for areas of risk in the event of a natural disaster.
  Fire Hazards
CONTEXT
In the County of San Diego, fire hazards represent a high level threat to personal injury and property damage.
Because most of the unincorporated County is located within very high or extreme fire threat areas, avoiding
high threat areas is not possible (Figure S-1 [Fire Threat]). Comparing structural loss data from CAL FIRE of
the 20 largest California wildland fires by structural loss between 1923-2008, San Diego County accounted for
over 34 percent of the total destroyed structures statewide.
Between 1967 and 2007 San Diego County experienced more than 9,000 destroyed dwellings from wildland
fires. The topography, geographic, and climatic conditions within our region lead to the overall regional fire
problem. Over half of the land acreage of the unincorporated county is public land owned by the federal
government, state government, or local government. Therefore, policies focus on minimizing the impact of
wildfires through land use planning techniques and other mitigation measures. Key issues addressed in this
section are as follows:

GOALS AND POLICIES
Defensible Space: Defensible space refers to a separation zone between wildlands and structures where fuel,
including natural and ornamental vegetation, man-made combustible materials, and ancillary structures, is
managed or modified to minimize the spread of fire to the structure and allow space for defending structures
from burning vegetation. This separation is important to improving the survivability of structures in a
wildland fire event and is most readily maintained when planned for as part of project design. For optimal
protection against wildfires, structures should also be “hardened” to make them more ignition resistant.
    ■ Wildland/Urban Interface: The wildland/urban
       interface refers to areas where structures and
       other human developments meet or intermingle
       with undeveloped wildland. Much of the
       unincorporated County is located within the
       wildland/urban interface.
    ■ Strategic Vegetation Management: Outside of
       defensible space around structures, reducing,
       thinning, or otherwise modifying the amount of
       vegetation (fuel) may reduce the risk of wildfire
       within conifer forests as well as through strategic
       fuel breaks near the wildland-urban interface in Wildland/urban interface in Bonsall
       low-wind conditions.
    ■ Access/Egress Routes: Require development to include multiple access/egress routes when necessary
       to ensure adequate safety.
    ■ Funding Fire Services: Existing funding for fire services is limited and variable. Full-time funding for fire
       services is crucial for assuring long-term commitment of adequate coverage.
    ■ Travel Time Standards: The minimum travel time standards to respond to a fire hazard or medical
       emergency facilitate the ability to identify future fire facility needs and to determine public service
       requirements for proposed development. Travel time standards indicate that expectations for service
       levels are different in urbanized areas than in rural areas.
    ■ Multiple Fire Protection Districts: Providing a coordinated response to large wildland fires is a challenge
       in the County where the responsibility for fire prevention and suppression is vested in a number of
       local, State, and federal agencies.
    ■ Multi-Story Structural Fires: The ability of rural fire protection districts to safely fight structural fires
       with multiple stories may be an issue in rural locations when higher density multi-family residential
       developments are needed to provide affordable housing or alternate housing types, since the rural fire
       protection districts simply do not have the resources to fight multi-story structure fires.
    ■ Building and Site Design: Requiring the hardening of structures with ignition resistant materials and
       the location of structures to minimize the risk from wildland fires.
During the past several years, the County instituted a number of safety-related programs and policies to
reduce the risk of fire hazards. From 2004 to 2006, the County created the County Fire Enhancement
Program to assist under-funded rural fire agencies. On June 25, 2008 the Board of Supervisors created the
San Diego County Fire Authority, bringing together volunteer fire companies, fire districts, and CAL FIRE
under the banner of regional coordination with local control. Policies in this section address the preceding
issues and provide a framework that supports previously implemented programs and policies.

GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL S-3
Minimized Fire Hazards. Minimize injury, loss of life, and damage to property resulting from
structural or wildland fire hazards.
Policies
S-3.1     Defensible Development. Require development to be located, designed, and constructed to
          provide adequate defensibility and minimize the risk of structural loss and life safety resulting from
          wildland fires.
S-3.2     Development in Hillsides and Canyons. Require development located near ridgelines, top of
          slopes, saddles, or other areas where the terrain or topography affect its susceptibility to wildfires
          to be located and designed to account for topography and reduce the increased risk from fires.
S-3.3     Minimize Flammable Vegetation. Site and design development to minimize the likelihood of a
          wildfire spreading to structures by minimizing pockets or peninsulas, or islands of flammable
          vegetation within a development.
S-3.4     Service Availability. Plan for development where fire and emergency services are available or
          planned.
S-3.5     Access Roads. Require development to provide additional access roads when necessary to provide
          for safe access of emergency equipment and civilian evacuation concurrently.
S-3.6     Fire Protection Measures. Ensure that development located within fire threat areas implement
          measures that reduce the risk of structural and human loss due to wildfire.
           Mitigation measures include, but are not limited to, the use of ignition resistant materials, multiple ingress
           and egress routes, and fire protection systems.
S-3.7     Fire Resistant Construction. Require all new, remodeled, or rebuilt structures to meet current
          ignition resistance construction codes and establish and enforce reasonable and prudent
          standards that support retrofitting of existing structures in high fire threat areas.
GOAL S-4
Managed Fuel Loads. Managed fuel loads, including ornamental and combustible vegetation.
Policies
S-4.1     Fuel Management Programs. Support programs
          and plans, such as Strategic Fire Plans,
          consistent with state law that require fuel
          management/modification within established
          defensible space boundaries and when strategic
          fuel modification is necessary outside of
          defensible space, balance fuel management
          needs to protect structures with the
          preservation of native vegetation and sensitive North Mountain wildfire area

GOALS AND POLICIES
          habitats.
S-4.2     Coordination to Minimize Fuel Management Impacts. Consider comments from CAL FIRE, U.S.
          Forest Service, local fire districts, and wildlife agencies for recommendations regarding mitigation
          for impacts to habitat and species into fuel management projects.
S-4.3     Forest Health. Encourage the protection of woodlands, forests, and tree resources and limit fire
          threat through appropriate fuel management such as removal of dead, dying, and diseased trees.
GOAL S-5
Regional Fire Protection. Regional coordination among fire protection agencies.
Policies
S-5.1     Regional Coordination Support. Advocate
          and support regional coordination among
          fire protection and emergency service
          providers.
S-5.2     Fire Service Provider Agreements.
          Encourage agreements between fire service
          providers to improve fire protection and to
          maximize service levels in a fair, efficient, Combined fire and Sherriff station in Pine Valley
          and cost effective manner.
S-5.3     Reassessment of Fire Hazards. Coordinate with fire protection and emergency service providers to
          reassess fire hazards after wildfire events to adjust fire prevention and suppression needs, as
          necessary, commensurate for both short and long term fire prevention needs.
GOAL S-6
Adequate Fire and Medical Services. Adequate levels of fire and emergency medical services (EMS)
in the unincorporated County.
Policies
S-6.1     Water Supply. Ensure that water supply systems for development are adequate to combat
          structural and wildland fires.
S-6.2     Fire Protection for Multi-Story Development. Coordinate with fire services providers to improve
          fire protection services for multi-story construction.
           Multi-story structures are associated with densities of 15 to 30 dwelling units per acre– particularly in
           areas within the County Water Authority (CWA) boundary. Design features may include safe zones and
           increased building design features.
S-6.3     Funding Fire Protection Services. Require development to contribute its fair share towards
          funding the provision of appropriate fire and emergency medical services as determined necessary
          to adequately serve the project.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                       7-9                                        GENERAL PLAN

                                                                                CHAPTER 7 SAFETY ELEMENT
S-6.4 Fire Protection Services for Development. Require that new development demonstrate that fire
      services can be provided that meets the minimum travel times identified in Table S-1 (Travel Time
      Standards from Closest Fire Station).
       Travel times are calculated using accepted methodology based on the travel distance from the fire station to
       the farthest dwelling unit of the development. Fire stations must be staffed year-round, publicly supported,
       and committed to providing service. These do not include stations that are not obligated by law to
       automatically respond to an incident. Travel time is based on standards published by the National Fire
       Protection Association. Travel time does not represent total response time, which is calculated by adding
       the travel time to the call processing time and to the turnout/reflex time. Generally, the call processing and
       turnout/reflex time would add between two to three minutes to the travel time. It is not known if any
       county has formally adopted NFPA 1710 and/or 1720 as a standard. Total Response Time (NFPA
       1710/1720) is calculated as time the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) receives the emergency call,
       transfers it to fire communications, the alarm is processed and transmitted to responders, responders
       “turnout”, plus travel time to the scene to initiate action. The use of response time for determining
       adequate service is problematic in the unincorporated County because it is subjective and varies from
       department to department, station to station and work shift to work shift. Reflex time (the amount of time
       from when the call is received by the station to when the engine leaves the station) can vary from one to
       three minutes. The use of travel time, as calculated by using NFPA 1142, allows us to be consistent across
       the County in determining adequate response, regardless of the district.
       Table S-1 establishes a service level standard for fire and first responder emergency medical services that is
       appropriate to the area where a development is located. Standards are intended to (1) help ensure
       development occurs in areas with adequate fire protection and/or (2) help improve fire service in areas with
       inadequate coverage by requiring mitigation for service-level improvements as part of project approval.

  Geological Hazards
CONTEXT
Natural geologic processes that represent a hazard to life, health, or property are considered geologic
hazards. Natural geologic hazards affecting people and property in County of San Diego include earthquakes,
which can cause surface fault rupture, ground shaking, landslides, and liquefaction; expansive soils;
weathering; and mass wasting phenomena, such as landslides and rockfalls (See Figure S-2 [Faults and Near
Source Shaking Zones], Figure S-3 [Landslide Susceptibility], and Figure S-4 [Expansive Clays]). Although it is
not possible to prevent or mitigate all geologic hazards, their destructive effects can be reduced to
acceptable levels or avoided through careful planning and project siting and design.
Of the geological hazards, seismic hazards pose the highest potential for causing widespread damage. All of
San Diego County is located within Seismic Zone 4 (Sec. 1629.4.1 of the California Building Code [CBC]), which
is the highest Seismic Zone and, like most of Southern California, is subject to ground shaking. Active faults in
the region include segments of the San Jacinto, Elsinore, and Rose Canyon fault zones. Seismic hazard policies
listed below reflect State law and adopted guidelines including the CBC, Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault
Zoning Act, and the State’s Guidelines for Evaluating and Mitigating Seismic Hazards in California (Special
Publication 117).
Landslide risks vary across the County’s diverse landscape. Landslides consist of masses of rock, earth, or
debris that move down a slope. Types of slope failures include rock falls, rotational (deep) slips, and shallow
debris flows. Landslides can be caused by human activities such as grading, irrigation of slopes, and mining
activity. Landslides also occur as a result of natural conditions such as earthquakes, heavy precipitation, weak
rock/soil character, seepage of groundwater, and topography. Areas within the County subject to the
greatest risk of landslides include properties on or below steep slopes. In order to reduce landslide hazards to
public health and safety, land use policies are incorporated into this Element that serve to avoid

development in hazardous areas or require engineering solutions that mitigate dangers to proposed
structures and to off-site lands.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL S-7
Reduced Seismic Hazards. Minimized personal injury and property damage resulting from seismic
hazards.
Policies
S-7.1      Development Location. Locate development in areas where the risk to people or resources is
           minimized. In accordance with the California Department of Conservation Special Publication 42,
           require development be located a minimum of 50 feet from active or potentially active faults,
           unless an alternative setback distance is approved based on geologic analysis and feasible
           engineering design measures adequate to demonstrate that the fault rupture hazard would be
           avoided.
S-7.2      Engineering Measures to Reduce Risk. Require all development to include engineering measures
           to reduce risk in accordance with the California Building Code, Uniform Building Code, and other
           seismic and geologic hazard safety standards, including design and construction standards that
           regulate land use in areas known to have or potentially have significant seismic and/or other
           geologic hazards.
S-7.3      Land Use Location. Prohibit high occupancy uses, essential public facilities, and uses that permit
           significant amounts of hazardous materials within Alquist-Priolo and County special studies zones.
S-7.4      Unreinforced Masonry Structures. Require the retrofitting of unreinforced masonry structures to
           minimize damage in the event of seismic or geologic hazards.
S-7.5      Retrofitting of Essential Facilities. Seismic retrofit essential facilities to minimize damage in the
           event of seismic or geologic hazards.
GOAL S-8
Reduced Landslide, Mudslide, and Rock Fall Hazards. Minimized personal injury and property
damage caused by mudslides, landslides, or rock falls.
Policies
S-8.1      Landslide Risks. Direct development away from areas with high landslide, mudslide, or rock fall
           potential when engineering solutions have been determined by the County to be infeasible.
S-8.2      Risk of Slope Instability. Prohibit development from causing or contributing to slope instability.

  Flood Hazards
CONTEXT
Flooding is a persistent or temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas.
Flooding is commonly associated with the overflow of natural rivers or streams, but can also occur near
stormwater diversion facilities, or in low-lying areas not designed to transport or infiltrate water at any time.
The potential for flooding in San Diego County is high. Storm events are the most common cause of flooding,
and areas most prone to flooding are mapped by the State, federal agencies, and the County.
Nearly every community planning area (CPA) or subregion in the unincorporated County has studied areas
subject to flood inundation, (although there are also known flood hazard areas in the County that have not
been studied). The County of San Diego publishes maps showing studied 100-year floodplain and floodway
boundaries, and 100-year floodwater surface elevations (where available), or floodplain hazard areas. These
areas are mapped as 100-year floodplains in Figure S-5 (Floodplains).1 Floodplains are relatively flat areas of
low lands adjoining and including the channel of a river, stream, watercourse, bay, or other body of water
which is subject to inundation by the flood waters of the 100-year frequency flood. Watercourses subject to
flood control requirements by the County are affected by large drainage areas (typically one square mile and
greater for FEMA mapped floodplains and 100 acres or greater tributary area for County-defined
watercourses) and are shown on the County floodplain maps. A floodway is the channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood (100
year flood) without increasing the water surface elevation more than the designated height, but not to
exceed more than one foot. Encroachment into the floodway by structures is generally prohibited.
Most community planning areas have between 100 to 4,700 acres of land identified as a floodplain. The
exception is Borrego Springs (within the Desert Subregion), which has nearly 30,350 acres of land in its
alluvial floodplain. This high number can be attributed to flash flooding that occurs in deserts. The County of
San Diego Flood Hazard Map for Borrego Valley delineates boundaries of known special flood hazard areas
on alluvial fans and lines of equal probability of flood depths and velocities. Alluvial fans are generally a
desert phenomenon where streams emerge from canyons and deposit sand and rock in a cone-shaped
formation fanning out from the canyon mouth. The potential for high velocity flow and heavy sediment load
coupled with the complex nature of alluvial fan flooding means that virtually all parts of the fan can be
threatened by catastrophic flooding. The Borrego Valley Flood Management Report (October 17, 1989),
however, provides methods for reducing risk to structures built on the alluvial fan.

Flooding may also occur as the result of dam failure. The failure of a dam occurs most commonly as a result
of poor design/construction, lack of maintenance, or structural damage caused by an earthquake. Areas
subject to inundation due to a dam failure are shown in Figure S-6 (Dam Inundation Areas). This event is
extremely hazardous, as it will typically occur quickly and without warning. Areas directly below the dam are
at the greatest risk, and, as the water moves further downstream, reduces in velocity, and becomes
shallower in depth, the magnitude of the damage and potential risk to life and property decreases.
The most effective ways to reduce the risk of flooding
is to ensure development is located outside flood
prone areas. However, it is also possible to reduce
flooding by constructing drainage facilities or using
other design measures to mitigate hazards.
Urbanization affects flooding by reducing the
permeability of land surfaces, which also increases the
amount of stormwater runoff and the required
capacity of channels. In Village and Rural Villages and
in areas containing Village densities, the General Plan
policies discourage future development from locating
within a floodplain, but recognize that there may be
instances where encroachment is warranted. Because
lower density development provides greater flexibility Dam in unincorporated County
when siting structures, future development in Semi
Rural and Rural Lands designations should be located outside mapped floodplains and natural flood control
systems.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL S-9
Protection of Life and Property. Minimized personal injury and property damage losses resulting
from flood events.
Policies
S-9.1      Floodplain Maps. Manage development based on federal floodplain maps. County maps shall also
           be referred to and in case of conflict(s) between the County floodplain maps and the federal
           floodplain maps, the more stringent of restrictions shall apply.
S-9.2      Development in Floodplains. Limit development in designated floodplains to decrease the
           potential for property damage and loss of life from flooding and to avoid the need for engineered
           channels, channel improvements, and other flood control facilities. Require development to
           conform to federal flood proofing standards and siting criteria to prevent flow obstruction.
S-9.3      Development in Flood Hazard Areas. Require development within mapped flood hazard areas be

        will cause significant adverse environmental impacts or is prohibited in the community plan.
        Channelization of floodplains is allowed within villages only when specifically addressed in
        community plans.
S-9.5   Development in the Floodplain Fringe. Prohibit development in the floodplain fringe when located
        on Semi-Rural and Rural Lands to maintain the capacity of the floodplain, unless specifically
        allowed in a community plan. For parcels located entirely within a floodplain or without sufficient
        space for a building pad outside the floodplain, development is limited to a single family home on
        an existing lot or those uses that do not compromise the environmental attributes of the
        floodplain or require further channelization.
S-9.6   Development in Dam Inundation Areas. Prohibit development in dam inundation areas that may
        interfere with the County’s emergency response and evacuation plans.
GOAL S-10
Floodway and Floodplain Capacity. Floodways and floodplains that have acceptable capacity to
accommodate flood events.
Policies
S-10.1  Land Uses within Floodways. Limit new or expanded uses in floodways to agricultural,
        recreational, and other such low-intensity uses and those that do not result in any increase in flood
        levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge, do not include habitable structures, and
        do not substantially harm, and fully offset, the environmental values of the floodway area. This
        policy does not apply to minor renovation projects, improvements required to remedy an existing
        flooding problem, legal sand or gravel mining activities, or public infrastructure.
S-10.2  Use of Natural Channels. Require the use of natural channels for County flood control facilities
        except where necessary to protect existing structures from a current flooding problem and where
        natural channel use is deemed infeasible. The alternative must achieve the same level of biological
        and other environmental protection, such as water quality, hydrology, and public safety.
S-10.3  Flood Control Facilities. Require flood control facilities to be adequately sized, constructed, and
        maintained to operate effectively.
S-10.4  Stormwater Management. Require development to incorporate low impact design,
        hydromodification management, and other measures to minimize stormwater impacts on
        drainage and flood control facilities.
S-10.5  Development Site Improvements. Require development to provide necessary on- and off-site
        improvements to stormwater runoff and drainage facilities.

 Hazardous Materials
CONTEXT
Hazardous materials are generally defined as any material that because of its quantity, concentration, or
physical or chemical characteristics, poses a significant present or future hazard to human health and safety
or to the environment, if released into the workplace or the environment. Hazardous materials typically
require special handling, reuse, and disposal because of their potential to harm human health and the
environment. Use of hazardous products is common among households, businesses, and construction
activities. However, the quantity, concentration, and/or types, of these products are often not significant
enough to pose a substantial risk to human health and safety or to the environment; therefore, do not meet
the definition of “hazardous materials.” Instead they are often referred to as household hazardous wastes,
universal waste, and electronic waste.
Hazardous materials are more often associated with select commercial, industrial, and agricultural
operations and their use is highly regulated by federal and State law. Operations meeting the definition of a
Hazardous Waste Facility must obtain a permit or grant of authorization from the State Department of Toxic
Substance Control.
Sites that have been contaminated by a release of hazardous materials also pose a risk to human health and
safety or to the environment. Location, type, and extent of contamination must be considered in determining
the appropriate reuse of such sites. Not all sites have been identified; therefore, site assessments are used to
determine the presence or likelihood of contamination in areas that are suspect.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL S-11
Controlled Hazardous Material Exposure. Limited human and environmental exposure to
hazardous materials that pose a threat to human lives or environmental resources.
Policies
S-11.1      Land Use Location. Require that land uses involving the storage, transfer, or processing of
            hazardous materials be located and designed to minimize risk and comply with all applicable
            hazardous materials regulations.
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO                                     7-21                                    GENERAL PLAN

S-11.2     Industrial Use Restrictions. Restrict industrial uses that store, process, or transport significant
           amounts of hazardous material to areas designated as High Impact Industrial.
S-11.3     Hazards-Sensitive Uses. Require that land uses using hazardous materials be located and designed
           to ensure sensitive uses, such as schools, hospitals, day care centers, and residential
           neighborhoods, are protected. Similarly, avoid locating sensitive uses near established hazardous
           materials users or High Impact Industrial areas where incompatibilities would result.
S-11.4     Contaminated Lands. Require areas of known or suspected contamination to be assessed prior to
           reuse. The reuse shall be in a manner that is compatible with the nature of the contamination and
           subsequent remediation efforts.
S-11.5     Development Adjacent to Agricultural Operations. Require development adjacent to existing
           agricultural operations in Semi-Rural and Rural Lands to adequately buffer agricultural areas and
           ensure compliance with relevant safety codes where pesticides or other hazardous materials are
           used.
  Law Enforcement
CONTEXT
The San Diego County Sheriff is responsible for providing law enforcement services in the unincorporated
County and to certain cities under contract. The General Plan Land Use Maps identify where future
development will occur, which can be used by the Sheriff in conjunction with forecasts from contract cities,
to prepare facility and service plans. As higher density residential and commercial areas typically produce
more calls for service, these areas have been identified as preferred locations of future Sheriff Facilities in the
unincorporated County. Additionally, Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) is recognized
as an effective planning tool to help minimize or deter criminal activity. CPTED consists of four
complementary strategies including natural surveillance, access control, maintenance, and territorial
reinforcement (or encouraging owners of private spaces to exercise control over their area by challenging
intruders). CPTED does not eliminate crime within a neighborhood but it can dramatically reduce the
likelihood of theft and other crimes.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL S-12
Adequate Law Enforcement Facilities. Timely development of law enforcement facilities in
locations that serve the unincorporated areas of the County.
Policies
S-12.1     New Law Enforcement Facilities. Coordinate new law enforcement facilities and services with new
           development in ways that sustain the provision of comprehensive services at levels consistent with
           substantially similar areas of the County.

S-13.2     Sheriff Facilities in Non-Residential Areas. Locate
           future Sheriff facilities in commercial, industrial, or mixed-use areas; they may also be located
           within residential areas when other sites are unavailable or unsuitable based on circulation,
           geography, proximity to demand, and other factors that impact the practical provision of services.
GOAL S-14
Crime Prevention. Crime prevention through building and site design.
Policies
S-14.1     Vehicular Access to Development. Require development to provide vehicular connections that
           reduce response times and facilitate access for law enforcement personnel, whenever feasible.
S-14.2     Development Safety Techniques. Require development within Village areas to utilize planning and
           design techniques, as appropriate, that deter crime.
            Examples of design features include the following:
            ■ Avoiding landscaping that might create blind spots or hiding places
            ■ Centrally locating open green spaces and recreational uses so that they are visible from nearby homes
              and streets
            ■ Designing streets to discourage cut-through or high-speed traffic
            ■ Installing paving treatments, plantings, and architectural design features, such as columned gateways, to
              guide visitors to desired entrances and away from private areas
            ■ Installing walkways in locations safe for pedestrians
            ■ Designing lots, streets, and homes to encourage interaction between neighbors
            ■ Including mixed land uses that increase activities on the street
            ■ Siting and designing buildings oriented for occupants to view streets and public spaces
S-14.3     Crime Prevention. Coordinate with appropriate agencies and the community to reduce crime in all
           neighborhoods by improving communication and relationships with communities and through
           educational programs that address important safety issues.
 Airport Hazards
CONTEXT
Aircraft accidents represent a hazard to the areas immediately surrounding airports. Specific areas of
potential aircraft accidents are called safety zones because they are established to protect public safety. Land

use restrictions in the safety zones are defined by each airport’s Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP).
In addition to safety zones, an ALUCP identifies land use compatibility by airspace protection criteria, noise
contours, and areas of aircraft overflight.
In addition to State and federal laws and regulations, ALUCPs guide property owners and jurisdictions in
determining what types of new land uses are appropriate around airports. As part of the General Plan
update, the County will coordinate with the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority to bring its land use
plans into conformance with the adopted ALUCPs. The Safety Element establishes generalized policies to
protect public safety and ensure future land uses remain compatible with airport operations.
