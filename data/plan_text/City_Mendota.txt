                    INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTION TO THE GENERAL PLAN
PURPOSE AND STATE LAW
A General Plan serves as a blueprint for future growth and development and
comprises the official statement of a city regarding growth and the quality of
development within a city’s planning area. As such, a General Plan contains policies
and programs designed to provide decision-makers with a solid foundation for land
use and development decisions. Consequently, the Zoning Ordinance, Specific Plans,
and individual public and private development proposals must be consistent with the
goals, policies and standards of the General Plan.
A General Plan must also be founded on a thorough understanding of the
community’s history, its environmental setting and constraints, and previous actions
that helped shape the present development pattern. Much of this information can be
found in the Background Report prepared in conjunction with this General Plan.
The last update to the City’s General Plan occurred in 1991 and only addressed the
Land Use and Circulation Elements. The Housing Element of the General Plan was
adopted separately in 2004 and covers the period from 2002 to 2007. Adoption of this
General Plan will supersede the current version of the General Plan.
STATE REQUIREMENTS
California law requires each city and county to
adopt a comprehensive, long-term General Plan to
guide the physical development of land within its
boundaries and areas outside the incorporated city
limits that are related to future planning activities.
State law is very specific on the topics that must be addressed in a General Plan. The
General Plan must address seven various topics: Land Use, Circulation, Housing,
Conservation, Open Space, Noise and Safety. The organization of the General Plan is
at the discretion of the jurisdiction and the topics (usually arranged as “elements”) may
be combined or others added. The State recognizes that each jurisdiction may face
unique issues and authorizes the adoption of optional elements that address issues of
local concern.
                                                    MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE           1-3

 CHAPTER          1
                                         INTRODUCTION
    INTERNAL CONSISTENCY
    The General Plan must fully integrate its separate parts and relate them to each other
    without conflict. This concept of internal consistency is critical to the effectiveness of
    the overall plan and has a number of dimensions as described below.
    All adopted portions of the General Plan, whether or not required by State law, have
    equal legal weight. No element may supersede another and the General Plan must
    resolve potential conflicts among the elements through clear language and policy
    consistency. Secondly, each element of a General Plan, both mandatory and optional,
    must be consistent with and complement one another. This includes the element’s
    goals, policies and implementation measures, as well as any supporting data and
    analyses. Additionally, policies and proposals put forward in an area or community
    plan must be consistent with the overall General Plan. Finally, consistency is required
    between the text and figures, tables, diagrams, etc., which are presented in the General
    Plan.
    Without consistency in all of these areas: among elements, between elements, within
    elements and between text and diagrams, the General Plan cannot effectively provide
    clear guidance for future decision-making.
    USING AND INTERPRETING THIS GENERAL PLAN
    The General Plan is intended to be used by a broad range of persons, including:
            The Planning Commission and City Council in decision-making activities;
            City staff in developing programs and reviewing projects;
            The development community in preparing development proposals; and
            Residents and citizens interested in the future of Mendota and the City’s
             policies.
    When using this General Plan, the following basic rules should be kept in mind:
            Only those statements specifically listed as a “Goal” are to be interpreted as
             stating the City’s goals.
            Only those statements specifically listed as “Policy” are to be interpreted as
             statements of City policy. Narrative descriptions and discussions not
             preceded by a Policy designation are provided for information and
             background only and may assist decision makers with the interpretation of
             Policies.

                                                                          CHAPTER          1
                    INTRODUCTION
        Unless otherwise defined by Policy, the standard definitions of words and
         terms shall be used. The Glossary to this General Plan provides definitions of
         many commonly used planning terms; these may be used as a starting point in
         resolving disputes about the meanings of words in Goals or Policies.
        Some information in this General Plan (e.g. population figures) is expected to
         become outdated in the normal course of events. Where this information is
         critical to the use of this Plan’s Goals or Policies, the most up-to-date
         information should be used.
The following specific conventions are used in this General Plan:
        Where the word “City” is capitalized, the reference is generally to the City of
         Mendota as a governmental agency, as in “The City was incorporated in
         1942.”
        Where the word “city” is lowercase, the reference is generally to the
         geographic place, as in “There are several incorporated cities the region.”
        References to current facts and figures should generally be considered to refer
         to the years 2006-2007, unless specifically stated otherwise.
GENERAL PLAN SETTING
                                               GEOGRAPHIC/PHYSICAL SETTING
                                               The City of Mendota is situated in the
                                               central portion of the San Joaquin Valley,
                                               which forms the southern portion of the
                                               Central Valley of California. The City is
                                               located in northwestern Fresno County
                                               near the confluence of the San Joaquin
River and the Fresno Slough. State Routes (SR) 33 and SR 180 also intersect in
Mendota. The main transportation route between northern and southern California,
Interstate 5, is located about fifteen miles west of Mendota. The City is approximately
10 miles southeast of the City of Firebaugh and 35 miles west of the City of Fresno.
Mendota’s regional location is shown in Figure 1-1.
Views from the City are generally limited due to the flatness of the region. However,
the Coast Ranges are frequently visible to the west, and on clear days the Sierra

                                         INTRODUCTION
    Area is located three miles southeast of the City along SR 180, surrounding the Fresno
    Slough. Several water canals, including the Delta-Mendota Canal, border the Mendota
    area on the north and intersect the San Joaquin River near its confluence with the
    Fresno Slough. Surrounding natural and man-made features include agricultural areas;
    surface water features such as the San Joaquin River, Fresno Slough and the Delta-
    Mendota Canal; and the Federal prison currently under construction to the southwest
    of Mendota.
    Mendota’s climate features hot and dry summers, with little or no rainfall, and mild
    winters with relatively light rainfall. Summer temperatures exceeding 110 degrees
    Fahrenheit and winter temperatures below 27 degrees Fahrenheit are rare. Fog occurs
    during the winter months between November and February. The normal annual
    precipitation averages about ten inches, with nearly all of this occurring between
    November and April. Winds are predominantly from the north-northwest in all
    seasons, but more so in the summer and spring months. Winds in the fall and winter
    are generally lighter and more variable in direction. The surrounding topographic
    features restrict air movement through and out of the basin and, as a result, impede the
    dispersion of pollutants from the basin.
    COMMUNITY
    Mendota is one of many towns in the region that
    began as a way station of the Southern Pacific
    Railroad. It was established in 1895 following
    construction of the west side line from San Jose
    to Millerton in the late 1880s. Initially, the
    economy of the area was associated with cattle
    and crop production, mainly vegetables and grain.
    A plentiful water supply and railway transportation were instrumental in the expansion
    of agricultural activities. Land surrounding the City has been historically tied to
    agriculture, with crops including alfalfa, wheat, barley, oats, cantaloupe, pomegranates,
    cotton, sugar beets, tomatoes and orchard crops. Mendota is a central shipping point
    for many of the agricultural products from the west side of the San Joaquin Valley and
    is known as the “Cantaloupe Center of the World.”

                   INTRODUCTION
Mendota was incorporated in 1942. The population has grown steadily at a rate
consistent with Fresno County as a whole. According to the California Department of
Finance, between 1990 and 2000, Fresno County’s population increased by almost 20
percent, or 131,917 persons. During this same period the City of Mendota grew at a
rate of 16 percent, or 1.6 percent annually. From 2000 to 2005 the City’s growth rate
increased to an estimated 2.2% annually; resulting in a population of 8,739 persons.
The Department of Finance estimates that Mendota’s growth rate is on the rise; the
current (2006) rate of growth is estimated to be approximately 3-5% annually.
The Mendota community has historically been predominantly Latino, with non-Latino
whites comprising the next largest demographic. Major ancestry groups reported to
the US Census (2000) by Mendota residents include: Mexican (71%), Other Hispanic
or Latino (13%) and Central American (11%).
The majority of jobs has been in the services, agriculture and retail sectors. The
unemployment rate in 2006 was 7.60 percent (U.S. avg. is 4.60%) and over 40 percent
of the population lived below the poverty level. However, recent job growth has been
positive, increasing by 2.82 annually (nearly twice the national average).
Overcrowding is defined by the U.S. Census as having more than one person per
room living in a single housing unit. Over the last three decades (1970 - 2000),
overcrowding in the City of Mendota has been on a steady rise. In 2000, 47.6 percent
of the population lived in overcrowded conditions.
The Community enjoys several recreation opportunities including three city parks in
addition to the county and state administered parklands, and an active sports and
activity program under city sponsorship, together with events sponsored by the eight
local service clubs. Nearby Fresno County recreation areas include the Mendota Pool
Launch Ramp, Delta-Mendota Canal Fishing Access, the Alkali Sink Ecological
Reserve and the Mendota Wildlife Refuge.

     VISION FOR MENDOTA
     Topics and issues of community concern were identified during the General Plan
     preparation process. This General Plan was developed through a process of public
     participation and input, and through research and generation of technical reports.
     PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
     Public workshops were conducted
     to obtain input from the citizens of
     Mendota regarding the proposed
     General Plan. The workshops took
     place in April 2006, at the onset of
     the update process, and in February
     and April 2007, as the preferred Land Use plan was being developed. The meetings
     were presented in both English and Spanish. Participants were asked to identify
     potential problems, issues, etc., especially regarding the proposed land use map.
     The workshops identified community needs and issues that residents would like
     addressed in the General Plan. Based on this input, the proposed Land Use Map was
     refined for inclusion into the final draft of this General Plan. Participant input also
     helped to develop land use alternatives depicting different visions for the future of the
     community, which form the basis of the alternatives analysis in the EIR for this Plan.
     RESULTING GOALS AND POLICIES
     The public and the City identified several broad goals/objectives as important
     components of the new General Plan including: working towards a jobs/housing
     balance; strengthening the local economy, diversifying jobs, housing and shopping
     opportunities, and promoting Mendota as a wonderful place to live, work and play.
     As a result of this input, policies contained in the General Plan elements seek to
     encourage new urban growth and development provided that such growth will have
     minimal adverse impacts upon the environment; will enhance the stability of the local
     economy; and will be within the capability of the City and other agencies to provide
     necessary urban services.
     The primary focus of the General Plan is to foster a climate conducive for expanded
     and diversified economic development in Mendota, including the provision of a variety
     of additional and better paying jobs, a mix of housing opportunities to meet the City’s
     current and future needs and expanded retail shopping choices.

                    INTRODUCTION
THE GENERAL PLAN
The Mendota General Plan provides a broad framework for planning the future of the
City. This General Plan serves as the official policy statement of the City regarding
both private and public development of the community, in a manner that will
maximize social and economic benefits to all citizens. All other City codes and
standards, including Specific Plans and the Zoning Code, must be consistent with the
General Plan.
PLANNING BOUNDARIES
General Plans are required to establish a planning horizon and planning area. The
planning horizon, or the date through which this General Plan could reasonably guide
Mendota, is approximately 20 years. It is anticipated that this Plan will periodically be
reviewed and amended as needed during this timeframe.
The geographic area or “Planning Area” used for preparing this General Plan includes
the incorporated City limits of Mendota and unincorporated land in the vicinity of the
City, which falls under the jurisdiction of Fresno County. This area includes the City’s
existing Sphere of Influence (SOI), established by the Fresno County Local Agency
Formation Commission (LAFCO), as well as areas beyond this boundary that are part
of the proposed expansion of the City’s SOI. Currently, the incorporated City limit of
Mendota includes approximately 1,900 acres and the existing SOI encompasses an
additional area of approximately 2,500 acres.
Figure 1-2 illustrates the existing City limits, Future Growth Area and SOI as well as
the proposed SOI. The “Future Growth Area” is an area beyond the Planning Area
(City limits and SOI) that is of interest to the City in the long-term future, but is not
proposed for urban development within the twenty-year planning horizon of the
General Plan. The Future Growth area is intended to identify areas that the City has
an interest in guiding land use decisions by the County of Fresno, as they are closely
tied to the City’s interest.

     ORGANIZATION OF THE MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN
     The Mendota General Plan is organized into several chapters as described below:
             Introduction: This chapter provides an overview of the purpose and
              requirements of a General Plan and an introduction to Mendota’s General
              Plan;
             Elements: This General Plan provides an update of the Land Use,
              Circulation, Open Space, Conservation, Noise and Safety elements. The
              Housing Element, prepared in 2004, is available for review at the City of
              Mendota. Each element is organized as follows:
                 A brief Introduction that describes the element’s purpose and relationship
                  to other elements;
                 A Setting Section that provides background and setting information;
                 Goals and Policies. The goals are an overall statement of community
                  desires consisting of broad statements of purpose or direction. The
                  policies serve as guides to the decision makers in reviewing proposals and
                  making other decisions that affect the future growth and development of
                  the City. The goals and policies, together with the maps and diagrams
                  provides the core of the General Plan; and
                 The Future of the element summarizing how the Element addresses the
                  future needs of the community.
             Implementation: This chapter outlines the timeframe for the goals and
              policies outlined in this General Plan.
             Glossary: Provides definitions for planning and technical terms used in this
              Plan.

     on circulation, noise, air quality, biological resources and cultural resources have been
     prepared to support this General Plan but, for ease of use, are not reproduced herein.
     These reports are available through the City of Mendota for readers seeking more
     detailed information.

SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS
A number of documents support the General Plan, including the Background Report
and Environmental Impact Report (EIR). The Background Report was prepared to
establish the existing conditions of the City and its surroundings. It serves as a
“snapshot” of the community at the time it was prepared in early 2006. The EIR
analyzes the potential physical impacts of adoption of the General Plan and includes
mitigation measures designed to reduce any significant impacts to less than significant
levels.
Background Report
The Background Report serves as a comprehensive inventory of natural and man-
made resources affecting the City of Mendota and the Planning Area. Its purpose is to
provide the public, the City’s decision-makers and other agencies with a compendium
of information about the Mendota area. The Background Report is not a policy
document, but instead, provides foundational information on which the goals and
policies of this General Plan are based.
This report includes a summary of the last update to the City’s General Plan (adopted
in 1991), descriptions of existing infrastructure systems and public services, population
characteristics and descriptions of natural resources in the vicinity of Mendota.
Environmental Review
Adoption of a General Plan is considered a “project” under the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). As such, the potential impacts of adoption of
the General Plan must be identified and analyzed. For this General Plan, a
Programmatic Environmental Impact Report (EIR) has been prepared. From the
outset, it was the City’s intention to create a self-mitigating plan, that is, the General
Policies themselves would mitigate potential impacts associated with the
implementation of the General Plan. This strategy required the City to consider
potential impacts and incorporate policies and programs within the General Plan that
would reduce potential impacts to less than significant levels.
HOW THE MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN MEETS STATE REQUIREMENTS
This General Plan addresses the State-mandated requirements and local issues through
inclusion of the following elements:            Land Use, Circulation, Open Space,
Conservation, Noise, Safety and Housing. As allowed by State Law, and for purposes
of clarity and simplicity, two mandatory elements: Open Space and Conservation, are
consolidated into a single element in this General Plan. The Housing Element of the

     AMENDMENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN
     State law provides for periodic review of the General Plan to ensure that it is
     consistent with the conditions, values, expectation and needs of the community. The
     General Plan may be amended from time to time as City objectives become more
     defined or shift, or as required by State-mandated amendments. In addition, periodic
     revision of the Housing Element to reflect housing need numbers for Mendota is
     required. Local governments may not amend any of the mandatory elements of the
     General Plan more than four times per calendar year. Each amendment may include
     more than one change to the General Plan.

RELATED PLANNING ACTIVITIES
ANNEXATIONS
This General Plan addresses all land both within the City limits and areas beyond the
City that bears relationship to the City’s planning efforts including the SOI and the
Future Growth Area. The SOI represents the probable physical boundaries and
service area for the City, as ultimately determined by the LAFCO. The SOI boundary
includes all City land and unincorporated lands that may be annexed as part of the
2025 development of the policies of this General Plan and approved by LAFCO. As
part of the process of annexation the land in question will be prezoned. Any
prezoning applied to an annexation area needs to be consistent with this General Plan.
The City does not have any land use authority beyond its City Limits.
WASTEWATER “ZONE OF BENEFIT” STUDIES
The City of Mendota commissioned two studies in 2006, the West Side Interceptor Zone of
Benefit Analyses and the South Side Sewer Interceptor Zone of Benefit Analyses, in order to
calculate the costs of providing wastewater services to future development areas of the
City (as well as the Federal prison currently under construction). These studies
determined the Zone of Benefit for areas that can be serviced by proposed sewer
improvements. The purpose of the Zone of Benefit is to allow the City to maintain a
consistent level of service as growth occurs in these development areas. The fees will
be used to reimburse the City for project costs based on the pro-rata share for new
development.
COMMUNITY FACILITIES DISTRICT
The City of Mendota adopted a resolution on October 24, 2006 to initiate the
formation proceedings for a proposed Community Facilities District (CFD) for police
and fire services. The resolution ordered the preparation of a report that contained the
following: a description of the services needed to meet the needs of the CFD; an
estimate of the cost of providing such services; and information regarding the
implementation of the rate and method of apportionment of the special fee. It is the
City’s intent to annex new residential development into the CFD as they are approved
to provide for police and fire services in new growth areas of the City. Future
annexation areas are to be comprised of undeveloped parcels within the City limits,
areas annexed into the City and parcels located within the City’s SOI, which are
planned to be developed for private residential purposes of four or more units, and
other parcels as may be added upon the petition of property owners.

     RELATIONSHIP TO THE MENDOTA ZONING CODE
     The Mendota Zoning Code is the primary implementation tool for the General Plan.
     Many of the goals and policies in this General Plan will be achieved through the use of
     the Zoning Code to direct and regulate public and private development. All of the
     standards in the Zoning Code (including the Zoning Map) are required by State law to
     be consistent with the General Plan. The adoption of this General Plan is intended to
     be followed by the rezoning of properties to be consistent with the General Plan Land
     Use Diagram.

established by the Southern Pacific Railroad
in 1891. The site, located in the heart of the
California’s Central Valley, was surrounded
by thousands of acres of fertile land.
Because of the railroad and the abundance
of productive lands, Mendota became, and
continues to be, a city whose economy,

             LAND USE ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE OF THE LAND USE ELEMENT
Since the last update of the City’s General Plan (1991), the Mendota region has
experienced significant growth pressure. This growth has caused the City to reexamine
the land use patterns and assumptions put forward it’s previously adopted General
Plan. The Land Use Element was last updated in 1991, and the 2005 - 2025 update is
necessary to ensure that the General Plan accurately portrays preferred growth patterns
and plans for future land uses in the City.
This Land Use Element provides the central framework of the General Plan by
designating the pattern and type of land use in the City of Mendota, based on historic
development and the community’s vision for the future. This Element identifies the
distribution, location and intensity of all land use types throughout the City. Text,
maps and diagrams establish the blueprint for future land uses within the City and
describe how these uses are integrated with the other General Plan elements and
policies.
The Land Use Element includes a Land Use Diagram that designates land uses within
the City and the surrounding area and visually depicts the community’s intended
physical form and areas for growth. The Land Use Diagram is supported by text that
describes building intensity, population density and development expectations for the
City of Mendota. The framework of goals and policies will guide the community's
decision-making throughout the term of the General Plan.
This Element has been prepared in conformance with all mandatory requirements of
State law as outlined in the introduction of this General Plan.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
Due to the nature of topics addressed in the Land Use Element, all other elements of
the General Plan overlap land use issues and topics to varying degrees. The circulation
plan described in the Circulation Element is designed to accommodate increased
traffic from the planned development outlined in the Land Use Element.
Land use planning also takes into consideration housing needs previously identified in
the Housing Element; natural and man-made hazards identified in the Safety Element;
the open space needs, agricultural resources and biological resources outlined in the
Open Space and Conservation Element; and conflicts related to noise sensitive land
uses identified in the Noise Element. Finally, the other General Plan elements ensure
                                                    MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE         2-3

 CHAPTER          2
                                    LAND USE ELEMENT
    that the infrastructure and environmental quality standards necessary for development
    within the Planning Area are available to accommodate planned land uses.
    GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING CONSISTENCY
    The Zoning Code serves as the primary tool for implementing the City’s General Plan
    land use policy. State planning law requires the Zoning Code to be consistent with the
    General Plan. Each General Plan land use category must have one or more
    corresponding zoning districts, and the development standards and land use
    regulations contained in the Zoning Code must reflect the policy statements in the
    Land Use Element.
    While the General Plan may be somewhat broad in its discussion of permitted land
    uses and development intensities, zoning provisions must identify specific regulations
    so that property owners and developers can determine how particular properties can
    be used and developed. One of the most familiar methods of implementing General
    Plan land use policy and designations is through the Zoning Ordinance. Although
    separate from the General Plan, it is essential that zoning districts be utilized to
    implement General Plan land use designations that are consistent with the intent of
    each General Plan designation.
    As outlined in the goals and policies of this element, the City’s Zoning Code must be
    updated to be consistent with the Land Use Diagram and with the land use
    characteristics described.
    LAND USE SETTING
    The City of Mendota is located in the northwestern portion of Fresno County, within
    the central portion of the San Joaquin Valley. Mendota’s current Planning Area
    includes the incorporated City limits and land within the City’s existing Sphere of
    Influence (SOI) as established by the Fresno County Local Agency Formation
    Commission (LAFCO). The SOI consists of unincorporated land in the vicinity of the
    City, under the jurisdiction of Fresno County, which is believed to be the probable
    physical boundaries and service areas of the City. The incorporated City limit of
    Mendota includes approximately 2,100 acres, and the adopted SOI encompasses more
    than 800 additional acres.
    This section provides background information and a description of the current land
    use setting, including the community profile, existing land uses and designations,
    recent and proposed development, major land use issues and Mendota’s vision for the
    future.

continues to grow. Current 2008
estimates place Mendota’s population at 9,788 with an annual rate of growth of
between 3 and 5%. The DOF also ranked Mendota as 28th out of 478 California cities
in 2007 – 2008 population change by percent (4.3%).
As determined by the Census, in 2000 there were 1,825 households, and 1,545 families
residing in the City. The City’s population was predominately Hispanic or Latino
(95%). This percentage was nearly double the rate in Fresno County as a whole (44%).
Non-Hispanic or Latino whites comprise the next largest group (5%). Thirty-four
percent of the Mendota’s residents were under the age of 18 and only 8% were over
the age of 55. Males made up the majority of the population (57%). These
percentages are consistent with current demographics (DOF 2008).
Housing
Mendota’s housing stock approximately 9% during the 1990’s, increasing from 1,758
housing units in 1990 to 1,878 units in 2000. This rate is lower than the household
and population growth because the average household size increased from an average
of 4.2 persons per household in 1990 to 4.3 persons in 2000. The DOF currently
estimates the average persons per household to be 4.4 (DOF 2008). An evaluation of
the existing and future housing needs of Mendota can be found in the Housing
Element of the General Plan.

    facilities. In 1989 the new Mendota
    Biomass Power plant was built. The plant produces electricity by burning agricultural
    waste products, and then sells the energy to Pacific Gas and Electric. The plant also
    produces low-grade steam capable of efficiently running hothouse operations.
    In 2002 there were an estimated 1,767 jobs in Mendota, slightly less than one job per
    household. The majority of jobs were in agriculture (30%) and services (29%). The
    percentage of retail jobs and (15%) and public administration (12%) were slightly
    higher than the nearby cities of Firebaugh and Kerman. Manufacturing jobs (7%)
    were comparable to neighboring communities.
    In November 2007 the City announced the partnership with Cleantech America, Inc.
    for development of a new solar power generation facility in the City of Mendota. The
    facility will sell power that it generates to Pacific Gas and Electric. The development of
    this new solar farm will mean potential jobs during the construction of the solar plant.
                                          Mendota Municipal Airport
                                          The Mendota Municipal Airport is classified as a
                                          basic utility airport. It encompasses 130 acres and
                                          has one runway that is 3,499 feet long. A 2006
                                          improvement project widened 2,722 feet of the 50 -
                                          foot wide runway to 60 feet. The airport and
                                          surrounding area is governed by the Fresno County
    Airport Land Use Policy Plan (1983), which the City has adopted as its own. The plan
    lists land use compatibility policies and addresses safety and noise issues. The City
    Manager of Mendota also serves as the Airport Manager. Upcoming airport
    improvement projects set for 2009, include capping and sealing the parking ramp and
    existing runway, completion of the runway widening to 60 feet and extending the
    runway (including taxiway) an additional 1,400 feet. As of 2008, the City does not
    have an Airport Master Plan.

Water and Wastewater
The City of Mendota’s water supply system is
currently comprised of three primary
production wells (Nos. 7, 8 and 9), two
emergency backup wells (Nos. 3 and 5),
transmission mains and a water treatment plant.
The primary wells were drilled in 2001 but not
placed into service until 2003. The well field is located on private property located
approximately 3.5 miles northeast of Mendota, near the San Joaquin River. The lease
agreement began in 1999 and runs for 25 years with 5-year renewals upon the end of
the agreement, for a period of up to 40 years. The pipeline from the well field is
designed to accommodate two additional wells at 1,400 GPM each for future
expansion. Two well sites have been identified in the area and have been determined
to be adequate for future development (Schmidt and Associates, Groundwater Conditions
in the Vicinity of B & B Ranch, Northeast of Mendota, June 2008).
The City of Mendota’s wastewater system is comprised of two basic components: the
collection and conveyance of wastewater to the wastewater treatment plan (WWTP)
and the treatment and disposal of that wastewater. The WWTP, located northeast of
the Mendota Municipal Airport, was constructed in 1975 and originally designed to
treat 0.57 MGD of domestic waste generated by the City of Mendota.
Permitted capacity of the WWTP in 2008 is 1.24 MGD with average daily flows
around 0.8 MGD. Secondary treatment is provided via two aerated lagoons followed
by four facultative lagoons. Existing disposal consists of five percolation ponds and 57
acres of shallow spreading basins for evaporation. The WWTP was modified in 2002
with three new disposal ponds and the addition of new aerators in the primary aeration
ponds. The total plant area is approximately 120 acres.
In 2008 the City is securing funding to expand the WWTP to 2.5 MGD and is in the
process of purchasing 295 acres for additional disposal ponds. This will involve new
aerated treatment ponds that provide biological oxygen demand (BOD) removal and
benthal stabilization of sludge with lagoon storage for ten years before removal. The
expansion will also increase disposal capacity through percolation ponds. The WWTP
is expandable to at least 4.56 MGD in the future and an additional 4.4 MGD in the
long-term with the addition of increased aeration and more disposal ponds.

                                            The community of Mendota has placed a great
                                            value on school retention and employment of
                                            area youth. In the early 1990’s there was a widely
                                            supported campaign to develop the Mendota
                                            Unified School District and build a new $8
    million high school. The High School opened in 1993 with the goal of keeping young
    people in their hometown for the complete educational cycle. The school has provided
    Mendota with community identity, an increased opportunity for after-school activities,
    sports and work experience for its young people.
    As of 2008, the Mendota Unified School District (MUSD) includes two elementary
    schools, one junior high school, one high school and one continuation high school.
    The MUSD has recently been experiencing overcrowded conditions. Enrollment in the
    2004-2005 school year was 2,383. The available
    capacity, as determined by the MUSD in accordance
    with Education Code Section 17071, is 2,071;
    therefore, the school district, as of 2006, is in excess
    of 300 students over capacity. With growth in the
    school population after many years of decline,
    school officials are considering expansion to the
    existing junior high or construction of a new junior
    high school.
                                             Recreation Opportunities
                                             Recreational opportunities are abundant in and
                                             around Mendota. The City has three public
                                             parks as well as state administered parklands and
                                             an active sports and activity program. There are
                                             world-class hunting and fishing opportunities in
    the area. Nearby Fresno County recreation areas include the Mendota Pool Launch
    Ramp, Delta-Mendota Canal Fishing Access, the Mendota Wildlife Area and the Alkali
    Sink Ecological Reserve.

EXISTING LAND USES (1991 GENERAL PLAN)
The City of Mendota is characterized by a range of land uses, including nearly 400
acres designated for residential development, 87 acres of commercial uses and 470
acres designated for industrial uses. Other land uses in the City include public
facilities, recreational and agricultural uses. Designated land use within the City’s SOI
includes 240 acres for residential development, 133 acres for industrial use and 400
acres for agricultural use.
Existing land use is illustrated in Figure 2-1. Figure 2-2 shows the location of recent

  CHAPTER          2
                                      LAND USE ELEMENT
     RECENT AND PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
     As of 2008, there are a number of development projects that have either recently been
     completed, are under construction or are being proposed within and around the City
     of Mendota. Development in the area includes several residential projects, a new
     Federal Correctional Institution and infrastructure improvements.
     Residential Development
     As noted in the 2004 Housing Element,
     approximately 208 housing units were constructed
     in the City of Mendota between 1991 and 2003. Of
     these new units, 31.3 percent were conventional
     single-family units and nearly 69 percent were
     duplexes or multi-family units.
     All of the multi-family units have targeted very low and low-income households. An
     average of fifteen new housing units were constructed each year in Mendota between
     1991 and 2004. However, the scale of development between 1990 and 2000 was much
     smaller in comparison to the last four years. Between 2000 and 2004, the City
     developed significantly more housing units, averaging nearly 60 units per year.
     In 2008, current and anticipated development may result in the development of an
     additional 3,300 dwelling units on approximately 1,000 acres of land.
     Public Facilities
     In 2007 the City announced its partnership with Cleantech America, Inc. to develop a
     new solar power generation facility in the City. The facility will sell power that it
     generates to Pacific Gas and Electric. A 40-50 acre site east of the airport is being
     considered although a larger site may be needed based on the availability of
     technology.
                                    A Federal Correctional Institution is currently (2008)
                                    under construction just southwest of the Mendota City
                                    limits. The schedule for development and operation of
                                    the new prison anticipates completion of construction in
                                    late 2009 and full facility operation by mid-2010. This
                                    prison will be a medium security facility with an inmate
                                    population of approximately 1,152 and also includes a
     minimum-security satellite camp of about 128 inmates. An estimated 300 to 350 full-
     time workers will be employed by the facility.

           LAND USE ELEMENT
CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AND OVERVIEW OF MAJOR LAND USE ISSUES
                                  The City has encouraged public participation and
                                  held community workshops to guide the visioning
                                  process for the community and development of the
                                  Land Use Element. Among the issues discussed at
                                  Community workshops held in 2006 and 2007 were
                                  the type and location of new development,
                                  infrastructure needs, enhancement of community
                                  character, business and job development, impacts on
                                  the downtown by future commercial development,
                                  circulation and connectivity and expectations of the
                                  City.
The workshop comments that pertain most directly to the Land Use Element are
summarized below:
      The General Plan must evaluate land use locations and relationships. The land
       use map should seek to change land uses to enhance functionality and
       compatibility in the new plan.
      Areas where land use is inconsistent with zoning must be addressed.
      The City should be looked at in terms of “districts” or “neighborhood plans”
       to plan at a more local level.
      The City should develop strategies to provide incentives (policies and
       program) for infill projects to fill gaps in the urban landscape.
      The City should develop strategies such as economic incentives, to encourage
       the development of mixed-use projects that will help with infill and provide
       development/investment opportunities downtown.
      Processes should be developed to ensure that the General Plan is reviewed
       periodically and updated as needed.
      The City should complete improvements to existing infrastructure, particularly
       sewer and water before expanding services to new development. Issues of
       concern include sewer capacity, water supply and water quality.
      The City should develop infrastructure as needed for agricultural related
       industries.

  CHAPTER      2
                                 LAND USE ELEMENT
         Better flood control flood protection/storm drain facilities must be
          developed.
         The character of the community should be enhanced through City
          beautification programs and the elimination of blight.
         The development of safe, walkable communities should be encouraged.
          Seventh Street is main target for this.
         The Police Department should be reinstated.
         The City should pursue the development of agricultural related industry (e.g.
          agricultural processing facilities). Having agricultural industry (rather than just
          fields and crops) saves on transport and induces the labor force.
         The City should continue efforts to encourage the diversification of
          businesses and development of additional year-round employment to create
          more jobs in a greater variety of employment opportunities.
         Additional commercial areas in addition to the historic “T” shape area along
          SR 180-Oller Street and 7th Street should be created.
         Residents of Mendota desire additional goods and services, including more
          convenience shopping. When residents travel to other towns to shop, not
          only is it inconvenient, but the sales taxes and other revenues generated by
          these expenditures are lost to the City and are said to “leak” to surrounding
          communities. Encourage some regional-serving “big box” commercial
          development such as Wal-Mart that will fulfill the needs of the City’s residents
          while also creating a regional shopping opportunity to draw visitors from
          neighboring communities.
         The City must ensure that new development contributes to police services.
          “Roof tops don’t buy cops.”
         Develop strategies for creating additional sources of sales tax revenue for the
          City. Examples may include Automall, tractor and RV sales.
         The Airport should be recognized as an asset to the city and the City should
          encourage strategies that expand its uses and opportunities.
         Develop a strategy for marketing Mendota to attract people and businesses to
          locate here. Many positive aspects of the City should be emphasized including
          lower employee wages (for business owners), airport, lack of problems in
          other communities, e.g., traffic congestion.

               LAND USE ELEMENT
         Develop strategies for enhancing and attracting additional visitor-serving uses
          particularly recreational opportunities including the hunting, fishing, etc. in the
          Wildlife Reserve and boating opportunities along the San Joaquin River.
          Should consider encouraging barges and riverboats used to dock nearby our
          city limits.
         Transportation
              SR 180 alignment needs to be determined.
              SR 180 alignment:       Need to maximize City’s economic benefits/
               connection to I-5.
              The City should coordinate the alignment of SR 180 with and Caltrans.
The issues raised above have been incorporated into the Land Use Plan and the Goals
and Policies presented in this Element. For example, policies have been developed to
further define districts and neighborhoods through the implementation of Specific
Plans as required under the Future Development Overlay designation; policies have
been addressed to encourage infill development and policies regarding pedestrian
circulation have been crafted. Additional Commercial areas have been added to the
Land Use Map along SR 33, south of Belmont Avenue, and along SR 33, west of
Belmont. The Land Use Map was also updated with Commercial area added within
and adjacent to the Hacienda Gardens area.
THE FUTURE OF LAND USE
The future land use plan for the City of Mendota consists of both the text in this
Element and the accompanying Land Use Diagram or Land Use Map, presented in the
Goals and Policies section. The Land Use Diagram illustrates the desired planning
boundaries, and land uses for land within the General Plan planning area. Although
uses are mapped for all property within the Planning Area, only land within the
jurisdiction of the City is regulated by these land uses.
PLANNING BOUNDARIES
Land use boundaries have been established with regard to both
physical/environmental constraints and growth projections for the community. These
growth projections were based on 2000 Census data, DOF data including historical
growth rates and proposed development projects as outlined earlier in this element.
As described earlier, Mendota’s population is currently (2008) estimated to be 9,788
with an annual rate of growth of between 3 and 5% (DOF 2008). At this historic
growth rate, Mendota’s population could reach as many as 22,434 persons by the year

  CHAPTER           2
                                      LAND USE ELEMENT
     2025; an additional 12,646 persons (http://www.metamorphosisalpha.com). This
     growth would require an estimated 2,874 additional dwelling units (based on 4.4
     persons per household estimated by the Department of Finance 2006 and 2008) and
     800 acres of residential land.
     As discussed earlier, there are several current
     development proposals that have either recently
     been completed, are under construction or are
     being proposed within and around the City of
     Mendota.         This current and anticipated
     development (totaling more than 1,000 acres
     3,300 dwelling units and approximately 14,000
     additional persons) already exceeds the historic growth rate for the City. For the
     purposes of this General Plan, it is anticipated that the proposed development will
     occur during the 2025 time frame of the Plan. In addition, it is assumed that some
     portion of the historic growth will accompany the already anticipated development.
     It is anticipated that certain agricultural areas will be “retired” from production in the
     next 20 years, and as such, some areas identified as “agricultural” on the 1991 General
     Plan are designated for urban uses on the Land Use Diagram. This is due to issues
     surrounding inadequate drainage and resulting salinity problems that may make some
     of these lands unusable for agricultural production. The retirement of agricultural
     lands is discussed in greater detail in the Open Space and Conservation Element.
     The boundaries reflect the City’s calculation of the amount of land needed for
     development during the General Plan’s 20-year time frame, consistent with the goals,
     policies and implementation programs included in this Element. Anticipated growth
     areas are located primarily to the south and west of the existing community. Areas to
     the north and east are generally not proposed for future development due to
     physical/environmental constraints, including: irrigation canals, wastewater treatment
     plant, railroad tracks, the Mendota Municipal Airport and the Fresno Slough.
     Boundaries considered in this General Plan include: 1) City limits; 2) Proposed Sphere
     of Influence (SOI); and 3) “Urban Fringe Area.” Land use planning boundaries are
     shown in Figure 2-3. The Proposed SOI is the area surrounding the City that can be
     expected to accommodate the City’s growth over a 20-year time period, to the year
     2025. LAFCO must approve the proposed SOI after adoption of the General Plan.
     Once the SOI is approved, if Mendota wishes to expand the City limits in the future, it
     must submit a request to LAFCO to annex additional land.

                    LAND USE ELEMENT
The land within the existing City limits in combination with the Proposed SOI
boundary constitutes the Planning Area for this General Plan and also serves as the
area analyzed for potential environmental impacts by the General Plan’s
Environmental Impact Report. Boundaries of the Planning Area include the Main
Intake Canal on the north and the Fresno Slough on the east. The southern boundary
extends westward from the Fresno Slough along Highway 180 and Panoche Road.
The southwestern boundary runs along the eastern extent of the prison site, currently
under construction. City of Mendota Planning Boundaries and area acreages are
summarized below in Table 2-2.

The “Urban Fringe Area” is an informal designation established by the City and lies
beyond the proposed SOI boundary and Planning Area evaluated under this General
Plan. It consists of all lands within two miles of the proposed SOI. Land use in these
areas is currently primarily devoted to agricultural uses and includes some areas under
Williamson Act contracts.
The Urban Fringe Area is currently in Fresno County’s land use and zoning
jurisdiction and not anticipated for development prior to 2025. However, it is
depicted on the land use maps as a general area of concern within which planning
decisions and other governmental actions of Fresno County may have an impact on
the City of Mendota during the 20-year timeframe of the General Plan. Consistent
with Fresno County General Plan policy LU-G.7, the County and the City shall work
cooperatively on policy changes within this area that may impact growth or the
provision of urban services.
As previously described in Table 2-2, the Planning Area of this General Plan is more
than 134% larger than the City’s 1991 General Plan Planning Area.

  CHAPTER          2
                                      LAND USE ELEMENT
     Description of Land Use Designations
     The Land Use Diagram or Land Use Map, presented in the Goals and Policies section
     of this Element illustrates the desired land use designations for land within the General
     Plan planning area based on the City’s anticipated growth. Land within the City
     boundaries is regulated by these land uses; land use outside the City’s jurisdiction is
     designated as a matter of preference for planning purposes.
     The land use designations, as described in the Goals and Policies section, have been
     crafted with the intention of maintaining Mendota’s rural, low-density community
     character. By defining the various land uses, the Policies provide clear direction for the
     various types of potential development that will fulfill Mendota’s vision for community
     growth over the next twenty years.
     Each land use designation indicated on the Land Use Diagram is summarized briefly
     below. Please refer to the Goals and Policies Section of this Element for a definition
     of each designation including allowable uses and standards of building intensity.
                                           Residential Land Use Designations
                                           The land use designations that provide for
                                           residential uses include Low Density, Medium
                                           Density, Medium-High Density and High Density
                                           designations. These designations provide for a
                                           healthy mix of various residential uses within the
                                           City. The intended character of each designation,
     the type of dwelling units and density ranges are outlined in the policies contained in
     this General Plan.
     Commercial Land Use Designations
     The provision of commercial land use designations is critical to not only the economic
     success of the City but to making Mendota a desirable place to live. Thoughtful, well-
     balanced placement of commercial uses will allow convenient access by the community
     and will ensure compatibility with adjacent
     uses. The General Plan policies encourage
     further commercial development, regional
     shopping opportunities, and visitor-serving
     uses, while protecting the economic
     stability of local businesses particularly in
     the downtown area.
2-22  MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

                                                                             CHAPTER            2
             LAND USE ELEMENT
Industrial Land Use Designations
The current industrial mix includes agricultural
packing and processing facilities and the
manufacturing of machinery. The City’s biomass
facility (constructed southeast of the airport in
1989) was not identified in the last General Plan Update. As indicated in the Land Use
Diagram presented in the Goals and Policies section of this Element, industrial
development in the City is generally concentrated along a strip of land between Naples
Avenue and Marie Street, which is bisected by the railroad line. Industrial land uses are
divided into Light and Heavy Industrial classifications as defined by policies of this
Element.
                                          Public Facilities Land Use Designations
                                          Areas owned and maintained by public or
                                          institutional agencies such as the City, the
                                          school district and other public agencies would
                                          fall into this land use category. Significant areas
designated as public facility uses include public school facilities, the prison to the
southwest of Mendota (under construction as of 2008), the Mendota Municipal
Airport and the water supply system and wastewater treatment plant. Other Public
facility areas include City Hall, the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection (CDF) fire station and the water treatment plant.
Open Space Land Use Designations
Parks, recreational facilities, and passive open space contribute to the quality of life in a
community, providing visual buffers, natural areas, traditional parks, hiking and biking
trails, and other landscaped areas. As illustrated in the Land Use Diagram, and
outlined in the Policies of this General Plan, this designation includes recreation,
buffer areas, agricultural uses and a multi-use open
space area northwest of the airport. Recreation areas
in Mendota include three City parks, the largest
being Rojas-Pierce Park located along the western
border of the City. Please see the Open Space and
Conservation Element.
Overlay Land Use Designations
The Land Use Diagram (presented as policy in this Element), designates areas adjacent
to the City where it will eventually grow and extend public services over the next
                                                       MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE            2-23

  CHAPTER              2
                                               LAND USE ELEMENT
     twenty or more years. These areas are designated as Future Development Overlay
     areas intended to be primarily residential in nature, but also provide opportunities for
     office, shopping and recreation necessary to support livable neighborhoods. Future
     Development Areas are considered “overlay areas” in that the overlay designation
     expands the land uses to allow a compatible mix, and/or density of use that are
     otherwise precluded by the primary or base General Plan designation.
     A Specific Plan will be required in advance of annexation and development of each
     area identified as Future Development Overlay on the Land Use Diagram. A Specific
     Plan is a planning tool authorized by State law (Government Code Section 65450) that
     can be used to identify appropriate land uses for an area and establish development
     guidelines in greater detail than provided by the General Plan, and the detailed
     development guidelines found in the City’s Zoning Ordinance.

                       LAND USE ELEMENT
     GROWTH OF THE GENERAL PLAN/PLANNING AREA
     The General Plan establishes general uses and densities of land within the City. From
     the Land Use Diagram and the acreages as outlined previously in Table 2-3, it is
     possible to estimate the maximum population, number of homes, and acreages of non-
     residential uses that could result from buildout of the General Plan within the City and
     within the Planning Area.
     The maximum buildout potential described herein assumes all undeveloped lands
     within the City and proposed SOI would be developed at maximum allowable
     intensities. No date for completion has been established, but it is anticipated residential
     buildout will occur by year 2025 and that non-residential buildout will occur more
     slowly than residential buildout.
     Table 2-4, below, shows the maximum dwelling units possible in each residential
     designation, the total dwelling units and population estimates for each of the various
     residential land uses. This table also documents the lands within the City and the
     Proposed SOI. The population estimates are based on an assumption of 4.4 persons
     per unit.

                                                   LAND USE ELEMENT
     If Mendota’s residential land were built to its maximum potential, at a density of 4.4
     persons per household as stated above, the total population within the incorporated
     City limits could grow to more than 17,000 persons, while the population within the
     proposed SOI area could exceed 38,000 persons. The calculated maximum buildout
     potential for the entire Planning Area under this General Plan is approximately 56,000
     persons.
     It should be noted that this is a maximum buildout potential. Site-specific constraints,
     streets and right of ways, design requirements, and market factors will reduce the
     potential buildout to a level below the theoretical calculations. As such, actual growth
     will be less than is allowed under this plan. Policies outlined in this Element require
     that that the City periodically review the Land Use diagram and monitor growth to
     ensure that an appropriate pattern and rate of development is anticipated to meet the
     present and future needs of residents of the City.
     Table 2-5, below, shows the potential buildout for non-residential uses such as
     commercial, light industrial, heavy industrial, public facility, recreation and open space.
     The anticipated core employment generating uses, Public Facility and Light Industrial
     are comprised of a combined total of more than 3,000 acres a use that includes
     agricultural facilities. An additional 1,100 acres of employment generating lands are
     designated as Heavy Industrial.

             LAND USE ELEMENT
Table 2-5 assumes an average of four employees per acre. However, the actual
number of jobs associated with each land use type may vary widely. For example,
office uses generate many more employees per acre than recreational uses. The table
above is provided as a general guide and is not intended to designate employee growth.
The actual jobs associated with implementation of the General Plan may be greater or
less depending on the job sectors that actually develop. The General Plan policies in
this Element require that the City monitor land use patters and job opportunities in the
Mendota, and promote patterns of development that allow for expanded job growth
and job opportunities for its residents.
FUTURE PLANNING
The City’s vision is to retain aspects of its rural community character as it grows over
the next two decades, while providing greater opportunities for industrial and
commercial development and new jobs for the community. The Goals and Policies
contained in this Element ensure that while residential opportunity abounds, the City
will also encourage industrial and commercial development to create a more vibrant
community with an improved jobs/housing balance. The City will strive to maintain
the downtown as the heart of the community. However, the City will support the
development of regional retail as well.
In order to achieve the City’s vision of a balanced land use mix and a desirable place to
live, work and play, the General Plan polices ensure that new growth is smart growth.
New development must positively improve the image, vitality and services of Mendota.
These principles are integrated throughout the Goals and Policies of this Element.
Smart growth principles will be further detailed in the Specific Plan Guidelines
required for areas identified for future growth (areas that have a Future Development
overlay designation in the Land Use diagram as) as described in Policy LU- 1.7.

           CIRCULATION ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE OF THE CIRCULATION ELEMENT
The Circulation Element provides an overview of the existing and planned
transportation network. It establishes goals and policies that will guide the City’s
circulation system and assist City decision-makers to prioritize future improvement
projects.
The Circulation Element is one of the seven mandated General Plan elements required
by State law. It consists of the general location and extent of existing and proposed
major roadways, transportation routes and other local public transportation facilities,
all correlated with the Land Use Element of this General Plan. This Element has been
prepared in conformance with all mandatory requirements of State law as outlined in
the Introduction Chapter of this General Plan.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
According to State law, the Circulation Element must be consistent with the other
General Plan Elements, which are all interrelated to a degree. Certain goals and policies
of one Element may address issues that are primary subjects of other Elements. This
integration of issues throughout the General Plan creates a strong basis for the
implementation of plans and programs and achievement of community goals.
The Circulation Element is most directly related to the Land Use, Conservation and
Open Space, Noise and Safety Elements.
SETTING - MENDOTA’S TRANSPORTATION
FACILITIES
This setting section of the Circulation Element describes current conditions of the
City’s transportation system based on a 2007 Circulation Study, and an overview of
the major issues that affect circulation plans and programs. This information provides
the background for the goals and policies that reflect the community’s vision for the
future of circulation in Mendota.
MENDOTA’S ROADWAY NETWORK – THE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION
SYSTEM
Roadways are the primary transportation facilities within City of Mendota. Mendota’s
roadway network consists of expressways, arterials, collectors and local streets (see

    intervals, collector streets at ½-mile intervals in residential neighborhoods and ¼-mile
    intervals in commercial areas as well as local streets. Alleys also provide an important
    means of access to commercial and residential properties in Mendota.
    Examples of the roadway network in Mendota are provided in Table 3-1, below, while
    the following provides a brief description of the function of each roadway type.
                                                  Freeways - Expressways
                                                  Freeways or expressways are typically the
                                                  largest roadway types in a city. A freeway is
                                                  a multilane divided highway that allows
                                                  access only at interchanges. An expressway
                                                  is a multilane divided highway that allows
                                                  access at public roads via at-grade
    intersections. The objective of both of these roadway types is to move the greatest
    number of vehicles as efficiently and safely as possible. They are controlled access,
    providing for high volume travel, where the concept of service to abutting land is
    subordinate to accommodating the through movement of vehicles. There are no
    freeways within the General Plan Area. The closest freeway to Mendota is Interstate-5
    (I-5), located 15 miles to the west of the City. Caltrans has used the term
    “expressway” to classify SR 33 and SR180 in their future and ultimate form.
    Arterial Streets – Major and Minor
    Arterial streets accommodate relatively high
    traffic volumes and provide the major
    circulation      between      activity   centers,
    expressways and other arterials. Access to
    local land uses is restricted along arterial
    streets, to preserve their capacity to serve
    higher volumes and longer-distance travel.
    Minor arterials can have two or four lanes, and typically do not have a median or other
    divider. Major arterials are typically divided streets with four or more lanes. The
    function of an arterial is to provide efficient through and cross-town traffic. Access to
    abutting property is limited to maintain the free movement of high traffic volumes on

State SR 180 and SR 33 are categorized as Arterial Streets. Portions of 9th Street to
Belmont Avenue can be classified as an arterial. SR 180 (Oller Street) bisects the City
in a northeast-southwesterly direction and SR 33 (Derrick Avenue) is a north-south
highway located near the western edge of the existing City limits. The two highways
intersect at the northwestern part of the City near 2nd Street as shown previously in
Figure 3-2. These two highways form the major arterials serving the City of Mendota.
SR 33, SR 180, Belmont Avenue, 7th Street and Marie Street are the major intra-city
transportation routes.
SR 33, SR 180 and Belmont Avenue have been identified by the Council of Fresno
County Governments (FCOG) in the Regional Transportation Plan (2004) as part of
the Regionally Significant Road System for Fresno County. This system is designed to
                                                                       MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE           3-5

    maintain and improve access between cities, accommodate a high level-of-service
    access to and within the Fresno-Clovis Metropolitan Area and to link regionally
    significant commercial, educational, industrial and recreational facilities. The criteria
    used to establish the regionally significant system included factors such as functional
    classification, service to regional facilities, connection of regional facilities and amount
    of current and projected use. SR 33 and SR 180 are designed to connect Mendota with
    other nearby communities and to other regional highways.
    SR 33 provides direct access southward to I-5 and connects Mendota to the nearby
    towns of Firebaugh and Los Banos, to the north. SR 33 has one lane in each direction
    south of Belmont Avenue and two lanes in each direction north of Belmont to the
    intersection with SR 180.
    SR 180 provides access to the City of Fresno to the east and terminates at the
    intersection with SR 33 in the northwest corner of Mendota. The highway has two
    lanes in each direction within Mendota, from Belmont Avenue to SR 33. Caltrans is
    currently proposing to construct an extension of SR 180 as a four-lane (divided)
    expressway that would connect Mendota directly to I-5 and close a transportation gap
    between SR 180, SR 33 and I-5. Various alignments near the City have been proposed
    and a Route Adoption Study is expected in the near future.

                                 Collector Streets – Major and Minor
                                 Collector streets are two-lane divided streets used to
                                 travel between neighborhoods, usually for relatively
                                 short trips within neighborhoods or between local
                                 streets and the arterial street system. Collector streets
                                 have relatively low speed limits, and sometimes may
                                 have restricted access to neighboring land uses.
Traffic movement between arterials and local streets is provided by collector streets.
Collectors usually carry a large share of the intra-city traffic and provide the primary
link between residential neighborhoods and the downtown area. Collector streets
typically have a maximum design capacity of about 10,000 ADT. Roads A through E,
Bass Avenue, 2nd, 6th, 7th, 9th, Marie, Juanita, Quince, Divisadero Streets, McCabe,
Smoot and Sorenson Avenues are all examples of collector streets.
Local Streets
Local streets are two-lane undivided streets
designed for trips within neighborhoods, and to
connect to collectors and arterial streets. Local
streets provide low-speed access to neighborhood
land uses, and usually carry less than 2,000
vehicles per day.
The function of local streets is to provide access
to abutting property and minimize through-traffic movements. Local streets usually
terminate at intersections with collectors or arterials and also terminate in cul-de-sacs.
Local streets may have volumes as high as 1,500 ADT, but typically have volumes of
less than 1,000 ADT.
ROADWAY CONDITIONS
Roadway Capacity and Levels of Service Definitions
Roadway capacity or circulation analyses are generally performed to determine the
carrying capacity of roadways and to help prioritize street improvements and plan for
future transportation needs. Factors to be considered in a circulation analysis include
Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes and a roadway’s Level of Service (LOS).
Average Daily Traffic (ADT)
Average Daily Traffic or ADT is the total traffic volume on a roadway during one
given day or period of 24 hours. It is commonly obtained during a given time period,

     in whole days greater than one day and less than one year, divided by the number of
     days in that time period.
     Level of Service (LOS)
     Levels of Service (LOS) ratings are qualitative descriptions of intersection operations
     and are reported using an “A” through “F” letter rating system.
     LOS generally reflects traveling conditions such as travel time and speed, freedom to
     maneuver, and traffic interruptions, using quantifiable traffic measures such as average
     speed, intersection delays, and volume to capacity ratios to approximate driver
     satisfaction. Individual levels of service are designated from LOS A for most
     favorable, to LOS F for the least favorable conditions, which each represent a range of
     conditions. LOS A represents free-flow conditions, while LOS F indicates excessive
     delays and jammed conditions. Intersection and roadway segment traffic operations
     are evaluated using the LOS concept.
     The varying LOS ratings are described below in Table 3-2.
                             TABLE 3-2: LEVEL OF SERVICE DESCRIPTIONS
         LOS                                           Description
           A      Uncongested operation; all queues clear in a single cycle
           B      Very light congestion; an occasional phase is fully utilized
           C      Light congestion; occasional queues on approaches
           D      Significant congestion on critical approaches, but intersection is functional; vehicles
                  required to wait through more than one cycle during short peaks; no long-standing
                  queues formed
           E      Severe congestion with some long-standing queues on critical approaches; traffic
                  queue may block nearby intersections
           F      Total breakdown; significant queuing
     Mendota’s Roadway Capacity and Circulation Conditions
     Table 3-3 below, summarizes the existing LOS for a selection of intersections and
     roadway segments studied in 2007. As indicated, most of the roadways are operating
     at a LOS of C or better. Congestion is therefore light on the collector streets.
     Portions of SR 33 and 180 that run through the City are currently operating at LOS C
     and D. Carrying anywhere between 4,700 and 4,850 cars at the AM and PM peak
     travel times, these roadways and intersections face significant congestion at the
     intersection, with cars often queuing through more than one traffic light cycle.

OTHER TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES IN MENDOTA
Public Transit
Fresno County Rural Transit Agency (FCRTA) services are currently (2008) available
to the elderly (60+), disabled, low income and general public patrons within 13
incorporated cities of Fresno County. Limited service is available to neighboring
counties. Currently, the FCRTA has 18 transit subsystems that are offered on a
demand responsive and/or scheduled, fixed route basis. Scheduled, multiple round-
trip, intercity service is provided to Mendota through Kerman to the Fresno-Clovis
                                             Metropolitan Area and to Firebaugh, Monday through
                                             Friday, by the Westside Transit system. Demand-
                                             responsive services are also available Monday through
                                             Friday. In accordance with the Clean Air Act, all of
                                             FCRTA’s vehicles are alternatively fueled by propane,
                                             compressed natural gas or electric batteries.
Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian circulation is currently (2008) provided for by the sidewalk system in
residential and commercial neighborhoods throughout the City. There are no Class I
bike paths in Mendota. However, FCOG has designated a regional bikeway route for
                                                                       MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE         3-13

  CHAPTER           3
                                  CIRCULATION ELEMENT
     intra-city circulation along SR 180 to its intersection with SR 33, proceeding north on
     SR 33 to the City of Firebaugh. The regional bikeways system designates the most
     suitable location for the long-term development of bikeway corridors for commuting
     and recreation. A more detailed description of the metropolitan and rural cities routes
     will be included in the Regional Bikeways and Trails Plan, currently being developed by
     FCOG.
     Rail Facilities
     The City of Mendota is bisected by a branchline of the Union Pacific Railroad and is
     operated by the San Joaquin Valley Railroad Company. The railroad has been
     identified as a regionally significant rail line by the Fresno County Regional
     Transportation Plan (2004). Movement between the
     western and eastern portions of the City is severely
     restricted by the railroad line. The only crossing
     within the central portion of the City is via 9th
     Street. One additional crossing occurs in the
     northwest where SR 33 crosses the tracks and
     provides access via the intersection with Bass
     Avenue.
     The Surface Transportation Board and the California Public Utilities Commission
     (PUC) have historically exercised strict control over railroad operations, including
     shipping rates and the abandonment, construction, relocation and consolidation of
     railroad rights-of-way.
     Airport Facilities
     The Mendota Municipal Airport is classified as a basic utility airport. It encompasses
     130 acres and has one runway that is 3,499 feet long and 50 feet wide (2,722 feet of the
     runway was widened to 60 feet in 2006). The airport and surrounding area is governed
                                                 by the Fresno County Airport Land Use
                                                 Policy Plan (1983), which the City has
                                                 adopted as its own. The plan lists land use
                                                 compatibility policies and addresses safety
                                                 and noise issues. The City Manager of
                                                 Mendota also serves as the Airport Manager.
                                                 Planned airport improvement, set for 2009,
     included capping/sealing the parking ramp and existing runway and completion of the
     runway widening to 60 feet and extending the runway (including taxiway) 1,400 feet.
     Development of an Airport Master Plan is also a high priority.
3-14  MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
                                                                            CHAPTER          3
          CIRCULATION ELEMENT
The Fresno County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) reviews plan
amendments, rezoning applications, zoning ordinance text amendments, airport master
plans and building regulations when located in the review area of Fresno County
airports. If the ALUC finds a proposal inconsistent with its plan, the city council
responsible for the airport in question may overrule the ALUC action by a four-fifths
vote. However, specific findings pursuant to Section 21670 of the Public Utilities Code
must first be made.
The ALUC has adopted a series of land use policy plans for the public use airports
within the region. The responsible public agencies have also adopted the respective
land use policy plan or have incorporated certain provisions of the policy plan into
their General Plan documents and Airport Master Plans. The policy plans provide the
basis for recommendations on land use development proposals within the airport
environs.
OVERVIEW OF MAJOR CIRCULATION ISSUES
This Circulation Element addresses a variety of issues in order to improve circulation
conditions in Mendota into the future. The City is currently experiencing significant
growth pressure, both within its limits and in the surrounding area. Buildout under
this General Plan will significantly increase the City size and population, intensify land
uses and increase the volume of traffic. Improvements to the street network,
including: lane additions, new roads and the installation of traffic signals, will be
required to maintain acceptable levels of service.
Key issues, as identified by an analysis of traffic conditions and buildout, City staff and
the community (during public workshops held in 2006 and 2007) are summarized
below:
        Prioritization and construction of roadway improvements necessary to
         improve circulation and levels of service.
        Establishment of a minimum Level of Service (LOS) standard for the
         community.
        Development of improved streetscape standards, particularly along the main
         “gateways” to the City.
        Creation of safe and convenient railroad crossings for automobiles, bikes and
         pedestrians.
        Development of designated truck routes along the main arterials.
        Identification of measures necessary to enhance pedestrian and bicycle safety.
                                                     MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE            3-15

  CHAPTER          3
                                 CIRCULATION ELEMENT
             Development of more pedestrian friendly streets by improving sidewalks and
              streetscapes.
             Encourage increased bicycle usage by creating bikeways that are more
              desirable to a wide range of cyclists.
             Support for increased public transit use.
             Development of minimum emergency access standards.
             Increased safety measures on area highways and local streets.
             Assurance of adequate funding for necessary circulation improvements.
     The issues above have been incorporated into the Circulation Policies and Goals and
     the Circulation Plan described in the remainder of this section. For example, policies
     have been developed to establish a circulation network that define an adequate LOS
     and will meet projected traffic needs through implementation of the Circulation Plan.
     Other policies have been developed to address safety concerns and pedestrian and
     bicycle systems.
     THE FUTURE OF CIRCULATION
     THE CIRCULATION PLAN
     The future circulation system of the City of Mendota as described here is comprised of
     both the text of this Element as well as the accompanying circulation maps, which
     describe the major roadways, intersection improvements, bikeways and railroad
     crossing improvements. While some of the development standards for theses facilities
     are left to implementation plans, this Element lays the groundwork and defines the
     role that various modes of transportation play in the movement of people and goods.
     The Circulation Plan (shown as Figure 3-3 and presented in the Goals and Policies
     section of this Element) illustrates the City’s future roadway pattern. Figure 3-3 only
     shows the primary roadway network system, including highways, major roads and
     connector roads of the City that provide north-south and east-west connectivity. It
     does not illustrate the many local roads that provide circulation within neighborhoods.
     These roadways will be designed at the project-level. The proposed roadway system
     has been designed in conjunction with the planned land uses and corresponding
     development capacity identified in the Land Use Element. It should be noted that the
     alignment of future roadways as presented on the Circulation Diagram is schematic.
     Precise alignments will be subject to further study prior to, or in conjunction with,
     development.

                                                                             CHAPTER     3
           CIRCULATION ELEMENT
Further details about the methods used to determine circulation needs for the City
throughout the 2005-2025 General Plan timeframe can be found in the Traffic Report
prepared for this General Plan (Peters Engineering Group, 2007) available for review
at the City of Mendota City Hall.
ROADWAYS
The future roadway pattern in the City of Mendota is designed to expand on the
“modified grid” system that currently exists within the City. The existing arterial
network provides for efficient through and cross-town traffic with connection from
collectors to highways and expressways. This network can be expanded to
accommodate the forecasted traffic demands based on the land use projections
contained in the Land Use Element, while continuing to achieve the Level of Service
standard presented in this Element. The land uses proposed under the General Plan
update would generate approximately 73,000 trips on the road network.
Table 3-4, below, list the categories of roadways addressed in this Circulation Plan
(presented as Figure 3-3 in the Goals and Policies section of this Element) and
describes how these General Plan roadway categories relate to the City’s current street
type as outlined in the Setting section of this Element. Each of the General Plan
roadway categories is explained as part of the Policy C-1.1 presented in the Goals and
Policies section of in this Element.
                               TABLE 3-4: ROADWAY CATEGORIES
          Current City Street Types               General Plan Roadway Category

           (none currently in Mendota)
                  Arterial Streets
                                                            Arterial Streets
               Major Collector Street
                 Collector Streets                         Collector Streets
                   Local Streets
     Non-Residential (Commercial, Industrial)
                                                             Local Roads
            Primary Residential Streets
             Minor Residential Streets
It should be noted that the Circulation Diagram (Figure 3-3) does not currently
designate any roadways as Freeway, Expressway or Highway. Interstate, 5 (I-5) the
closest freeway to Mendota, is located 15 miles to the west of the City. There are no
additional freeways planned. Construction and improvements to freeways are the
responsibility of the State of California. The only existing highways in the General
                                                   MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE          3-17

  CHAPTER          3
                                     CIRCULATION ELEMENT
     Plan Area are Oller Street (SR 180) and Derrick Avenue (SR 33). Caltrans is currently
     proposing to construct an extension of SR 180 as a four-lane (divided) expressway that
     would connect Mendota directly to I-5 and close a transportation gap between SR 180,
     SR 33 and I-5. Various alignments near the City have been proposed and a Route
     Adoption Study is expected in the near future. This Element provides policy language
     (Policy C-1.9) requiring that the City coordinate the alignment of SR 180 west to 1-5
     and, if necessary, amend the General Plan to ensure the City’s Circulation and Land
     Use Elements identify the route alignment.
     ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
     Intersection Improvements
     Table 3-5, below, lists a series of intersection improvements. These improvements can
     be either grade-separation improvements that separate opposing flows of traffic to
     better increase traffic flows throughout, as done with freeway interchanges, or, can be
     at-grade enhancements that increase traffic flow and/or make the intersection safer for
     pedestrians and bicyclists. This type of intersection improvements may include
     adjusting signal timing, signal preemption and other Intelligent Transportation Systems
     enhancements. Spacing of intersection improvements will consistent with Caltrans
     standards (currently limited to locations ½ mile or 1 mile of adjacent signals,
     depending on highway classification).
     Level of Service Improvements
     Tables 3-5 through 3-7 show the City’s LOS standard and the LOS at General Plan
     Buildout.1 With the future buildout of the City, roadway segments and intersections
     with existing LOS of C and better will deteriorate to LOS F conditions. This signifies
     a total breakdown of the roadway capacities. As indicated in Tables 3-5 through 3-7,
     with the recommended intersection improvements at the specified study intersections,
     these LOS conditions can be improved even under buildout conditions.
     1 As mitigated by implementation of the goals and policies outlined in this General Plan. The
     concept of level of service is described in greater detail in the Setting section of this chapter.

  CHAPTER          3
                                   CIRCULATION ELEMENT
     OTHER TRANSPORTATION FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS
     Public Transit
     Future transit needs in Mendota include both internal circulation and commute
     services. The City will continue to coordinate with Fresno County Rural Transit
     Agency to expand service within Mendota, and between Mendota and other Fresno
     County destinations as outlined in Policies C-2.2 and C-7.1. Improvements to longer-
     distance commute routes could include service between the City and major
     employment centers within Fresno County. The City will work with regional transit
     agencies to coordinate this type of service, and should identify locations for additional
     park-and-ride facilities that could contribute to the success of commute-oriented
     transit services as outlined in Policies C-4.3 and C-6.1.
     The policies in the General Plan C-3.5, C-5.2 and C-6.1 support the use and
     expansion of transit services in Mendota. As the City grows, new routes will need to
     be developed to connect residential, commercial, office and industrial areas.
     Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
     The City seeks to encourage its development as a walkable community and places a
     high emphasis on creating a pedestrian environment as outlined in Policies C-3.2
     through C-3.5, C-3.8 through C-3.10 and C-6.1 through C-6.3. To achieve this, the
     policies of this General Plan will ensure that development will provide exceptional
     places and paths for people to walk. Sidewalks will be provided along streets; where
     they intersect a major street, special treatments will be provided to help reduce the
     potential conflict between vehicles and pedestrians.
     A goal of this General Plan (Goals C-3 and C-6) is to support pedestrian activity by
     providing pedestrian facilities within existing and new development areas, and to
     eliminate both physical and perceived barriers that prevent or discourage pedestrians
     from walking between destinations.
     Pedestrian paths will primarily be developed as part of the roadway and trail systems of
     the City and reflect the interconnected nature of circulation and transportation in
     Mendota (Policies C-3.2 – C-3.5 and C-3.8 – C-3.10). Generally, big, wide streets
     inhibit pedestrian circulation by increasing the distance the pedestrian must travel in
     order to cross the street. Pedestrians are also less inclined to use a pathway when it is
     located adjacent to a soundwall. The preferred solution is to orient uses and buildings
     close to the street to create an inviting atmosphere that promotes pedestrian
     circulation. Also, at-grade roadway crossings are the best, most efficient way for
     pedestrians to circulation throughout the community. Midblock crossings need to be

provided for longer blocks to facilitate continued, uninterrupted pedestrian movement.
These preferences are outlined in this Element specifically as Goals C-2, C-3 and C-6.
Bicycles can serve as an alternative mode of transportation in Mendota because of the
relatively flat terrain and generally favorable climate. Development of a comprehensive
bikeway system within the City would encourage the use of bicycles as a regular mode
of transportation, which is a goal of this General Plan (Goal C-3). Though the FCOG
has designated a bike path along SR 180 to its intersection with SR 33, proceeding
north on SR 33 to the City of Firebaugh, future bike paths should be developed in
accordance with the recommendations of the FCOG’s future Regional Bikeways and
Trails Plan Policy).
Rail Facilities
Policies in this General Plan (C-2.4 and C-7.3) encourage the promotion of safe rail
operations that would continue to serve as an advantage to the community of
Mendota.
Airport Facilities
Policies in this General Plan (C-7.1 and C-7.2) encourage the promotion of safe air
operations and the preparation of an Airport Master Plan that will further the goal of a
Municipal Airport that is an asset and benefit to the community of Mendota.

     GOALS AND POLICIES
     The circulation goals and policies the City of Mendota are as follows and are listed
     subsequently with corresponding policies and actions.
     GOAL C-1                 Develop a roadway system that accommodates existing and future land
                              uses at the City’s desired level of service and provides multiple options
                              for travel routes, while maintaining a desired level of traffic flow.
     POLICY C-1.1             Implement the Circulation Plan (Figure 3-3). Roadway and uses shall
                              be categorized according to the following characteristics:

OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
    INTRODUCTION
    PURPOSE OF THE OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
    The Open Space and Conservation Element contains goals and policies to protect and
    maintain natural resources, prevent wasteful resource exploitation, degradation and
    destruction, and preserve open space lands for resource protection, public health,
    safety and outdoor recreation. The intent of the Open Space and Conservation
    Element is to protect the public interest in open-space land and to recognize it as a
    limited and valuable resource that should be conserved. This Element has been
    prepared in conformance with all mandatory requirements of State law as outlined in
    the Introduction Section of this General Plan.
    Required topic areas within the Open Space and Conservation Element include:
            Open Space
            Parks and Recreation
            Cultural and Historic Resources
            Natural Resources
    The goals and policies listed in this Open Space and Conservation Element address the
    protection and maintenance of natural and cultural resources, open space and
    recreational opportunities within the City of Mendota and its Sphere of Influence.
    RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
    The goals and policies of one General Plan element may also address issues that are
    primary subjects of other elements. This integration of issues throughout the General
    Plan creates a strong basis for the implementation of plans and programs and the
    achievement of community goals. The Open Space and Conservation Element is most
    directly related to the Land Use and Circulation Elements. This relationship is based
    upon the integral nature of land use, circulation and the topics addressed in the Open
    Space and Conservation Element. The future land uses outlined in the Land Use
    element influence which lands may be best used for open space and recreation,
    agriculture and natural resource use or protection. Goals and Policies contained in the
    Circulation element address the way people travel to open space and recreation areas,
    and the incorporation of open spaces into the transportation system, such as scenic
    highways or bicycle facilities or pedestrian streetscapes with pocket parks. Because of
    this connection between the elements, Open Space and Conservation Goals have been
    closely coordinated with the policies of the Land Use and Circulation Elements.

 CHAPTER          4
          OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
    OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION SETTING
    PARKS, RECREATION AND OPEN SPACE
    Existing recreational opportunities in Mendota range from traditional active sports
    such as softball and soccer to passive recreation such as nature observation and simply
    spending time outdoors. Between these two extremes falls a range of activities enjoyed
    by many residents, including picnicking in parks, walking and bicycling, and
    playground activities.
    The 1991 Mendota General Plan calculated the
    amount of park and recreational land based upon
    the combined total of developed park acreage plus
    50 percent of the amount of school sites that have
    adjoining sports fields. This calculation indicated
    26 acres of parks and recreational land available
    within Mendota. Recent mapping efforts have
    indicated a revised acreage figure of 23 acres of
    existing park and recreational land. Mendota’s three primary parks developed for
    recreational use are: Veteran’s Park, Lozano-Lindgren Park and Rojas-Pierce Park. A
    buffer along the Fresno Slough provides additional open space. Residents of Mendota
    also use school district athletic facilities for recreational use. The 1991 General Plan
    incorporated school district acreage in the calculation of park acreage. This update
    revises those figures to reflect only developed parkland owned by the City of Mendota.
    Nearby Fresno County recreation areas include the Mendota Pool Park, fishing access
    along the Delta-Mendota Canal, the Mendota Wildlife Area and the Alkali Sink
    Ecological Reserve. Existing and proposed park and recreational lands are shown in
    Figure 4-1. A buffer of a quarter of a mile is also shown to demonstrate the
    distribution of parks within and around the City.
    AGRICULTURE
    Mendota’s economy is currently based primarily on agriculture and agricultural
    industries. In 2000, the U.S. Census estimated that over 40 percent of the total labor
    force was employed in agriculture. According to the University of California
    Cooperative Extension, the highest grossing crops in the City of Mendota in 2006
    were grain crops such as alfalfa, wheat, barley and oats, as well as cotton, wine grapes,
    melons, pomegranates, sugar beets and tomatoes.
    California has some of the most agriculturally productive counties in the nation.
    According to the 2002 Census of Agriculture’s ranking of market value of agricultural

    products sold, nine of the nation’s top 10 producing counties are in California. In
    2003, Fresno County, with $4.05 billion in agricultural value, remained the number one
    county in the nation followed by Tulare and Monterey. If ranked separately, the value
    of agricultural commodities in Fresno County would rank it ahead of more than half of
    all U.S. States.
    Important Farmland
    The California Department of Conservation, Farmland Mapping and Monitoring
    Program (FMMP) was established in 1982 to continue the Important Farmland
    mapping efforts begun in 1975 by the NRCS. FMMP Important Farmland Maps
    identify five agriculture-related categories:
             Prime Farmland;
             Farmland of Statewide Importance;
             Unique Farmland;
             Farmland of Local Importance, and
             Grazing Land;
    Many of the soils in the vicinity of Mendota are
    Class III soils, meaning there are severe limitations which reduce the choice of plants
    and/or require special conservation practices for agricultural production. Land to the
    west and south of Mendota is classified as Farmland of Statewide Importance, with
    areas of Farmland of Local Importance and small areas of Prime Farmland. Land to
    the east and northeast of Mendota is generally classified as Farmland of Local
    Importance. Farmland of Local Importance in Fresno County is either currently
    producing or has the capability of production, but does not meet the criteria of Prime
    Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Importance or Unique Farmland. Figure 4-2 shows
    the location and type of farmland in Mendota as well as the status of lands under
    Williamson Act contracts.
    Williamson Act
    Within Fresno County, 1,557,837 acres are under Williamson Act contract as of 2003
    (California Land Conservation Act Status Report, 2004). Within the Existing Sphere of
    Influence, 273 acres of farmland are currently enrolled in the Williamson Act. Within
    the proposed Sphere of Influence, 1,456 acres are enrolled. Farmland within the SOI
    and under Williamson Act contract is located primarily in the southerly portion of the
    SOI. Most of the farmland in the northern, western and southern portions of the
    planning area is also under Williamson Act contract, according to the Fresno County
    Williamson Act Lands Map (2004).

 CHAPTER          4
          OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
    Drainage of Agricultural Land
    In the western San Joaquin Valley, soil salinity problems and inadequate drainage have
    limited agricultural production for more than a century, making some lands unusable
    as far back as the late 1800s. Irrigation of crops with water from the San Joaquin and
    Kings Rivers in the 1870s and 80s led to rising water tables, increased soil salinity and
    removal of some land from production. Many of the soils are naturally saline and high
    in clay content, which restricts drainage.
    The San Luis Drain was constructed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation as the solution
    to the disposal of agricultural drainwater in the San Joaquin Valley. Within the
    Mendota area, the San Luis Drain runs along the eastern edge of the Municipal Airport
    and the western edge of the wastewater treatment plant. Due to environmental
    concerns and budget constraints, the San Luis Drain was never completed as planned
    and the only constructed portion was closed in 1995 due to selenium poisoning of
    waterbirds in the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge at the Drains terminus.
    Soils in the Planning Area
    According to the Eastern Fresno Area Soil Survey (1971) and Fresno County, Western
    Part Soil Survey (2002), as depicted on the NRCS Web Soil Survey website, the
    majority of the planning area consists of the following soils:
            Calfax clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes
            Posochanet clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes
            Tranquillity clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes
            Tachi clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes
    Calfax clay loam soil is the predominant soil found in the planning area. This soil is
    found throughout the urbanized area of Mendota and in areas west and southwest of
    the City. The Posochanet clay loam is the principal soil south of Mendota. The
    Tranquillity clay and Tachi clay soils are generally located to the east, between the City
    and the Fresno Slough.
    The most notable features of the soils are the moderate to high clay compositions and
    variable saline conditions. The clay soils are prone to being expansive, causing
    shrinkage and swell. The saline-sodic conditions lead to moderate to high corrosivity
    to steel and concrete. All four of the soils in the Planning Area are rated as Class III.
    These soils have severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants and/or require
    special conservation practices.

    ARCHEOLOGICAL, HISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES
    Archaeological and historical investigations for the current project identified two
    previously recorded historic sites, P-10-005364 the Cervantes Property and P-10-
    005365 the Marchini Property, in or adjacent to the project area. There are no
    prehistoric or historic sites within the Planning Area listed as State Historic Landmarks
    or California Points of Historical Interest or on the National Register of Historic
    Places (NRHP) or the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR).
    A search of the University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) collections
    database did not identify any paleontological fossil resources in the project area, but
    there are paleontological plant resources elsewhere in Fresno County.
    New development could uncover or damage previously undiscovered artifacts of
    cultural and/or historical importance. Additional details regarding the Cultural and
    Paleontological resources in Mendota may be found in the accompanying
    Environmental Impact Report to this General Plan.
    BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
    Regional Setting
     The predominant landscape feature of the San Joaquin Valley (Valley) is a wide variety
    of agricultural croplands. The productivity of the Valley is made possible through
    irrigation water supplied by a network of delivery canals and reservoirs. In recent years
    the Valley has experienced tremendous urban growth, which has created additional
    pressures on dwindling habitat resources (USGS 2003).
    Despite its urban and agricultural
    development, the Valley serves as a major
    migration corridor and wintering ground for
    millions of migratory birds in the Pacific
    Flyway, a major north-south route of travel
    for migratory birds in the Americas,
    extending from Alaska to Patagonia. Every
    year, migratory birds travel some or all of this distance both in spring and in fall,
    following food sources, heading to breeding grounds, or traveling to over-wintering
    sites. Mendota is adjacent to an extensive network of waterways and wetlands
    including the San Joaquin River, Fresno Slough, and several man-made canals a system
    which serve as refuges, or rest stops, for the many species birds on their way to and
    from breeding and wintering grounds along the Flyway. This wetland and waterway

     complex also serves as a migratory corridor for numerous resident terrestrial and avian
     species.
     The Valley also supports numerous species and unique biotic communities (USGS
     2003). Habitat within this region is important for the protection of several sensitive
     species and comprises an extensive network of public lands. The San Joaquin Valley
     includes the following USFWS lands: San Luis National Wildlife Refuge (NWR)
     complex (San Luis, Kesterson, Fresno, and San Joaquin River NWRs), the Grasslands
     Wildlife Management Area, and the Kern and Pixley NWRs, which comprise a portion
     of the Kern NWR complex.
     Small parcels of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land are scattered throughout the
     Valley. The Alkali Sink Ecological Preserve is located approximately two miles to the
     southwest of the proposed SOI along West Whitesbridge Road (State Route 180). The
     Mendota Wildlife Area is managed by CDFG immediately to the southwest of the
     proposed SOI. Mendota Wildlife Area is 11,825 acres of wetland and upland habitats
     critical to many species. There are more than l65 species and sub-species known to
     occur or reside within the area, including shorebirds, songbirds, raptors, waterfowl and
     wading birds (Hiddleston 2001). Mammals commonly found on the area include
     coyote, muskrat, American beaver, mink, raccoon, long-tailed weasel, rabbit, skunk and
     squirrel. Western rattlesnake is also found here. Common fish species include black
     crappie, bluegill and common carp (Huddleston 2001).
     As of 2008, there is no Habitat Conservation Plan/Natural Communities Conservation
     Plan (HCP/NCCP) within the Planning Area. Nevertheless, the General Plan’s
     proposed SOI is located within the coverage area of The Recovery Plan for Upland
     Species of the San Joaquin Valley, California (Recovery Plan; USFWS1998). The
     primary objective of this Recovery Plan is the recovery of 11 endangered and
     threatened species, along with protection and long-term conservation of candidate
     species and species of special concern. The species covered in the Recovery Plan
     inhabit grasslands and scrublands of the San Joaquin Valley, adjacent foothills, and
     small valleys. Species covered within the Recovery Plan are classified as Species of
     Local Concern (SLC) as discussed under the Special-status Species section. The
     Recovery Plan does identify the area within and surrounding the proposed SOI as
     having regional biological significance for the species covered within the plan. The
     proposed SOI is near or within areas proposed for reserves where connectivity and
     linkages should be promoted.

OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
    Biological Setting
    Elevation in the proposed Planning Area averages 175 feet above mean sea level. The
    region enjoys a temperate Mediterranean climate, consisting of warm dry days and cool
    nights in the summer. Winter is usually mild; temperatures in the area can be below
    freezing and produce frost however, snow is very rare. Summer temperatures above
    100 degrees Fahrenheit are part of the normal pattern. Most of the rainfall occurs
    between October and April. The average annual rainfall amount for the City of
    Mendota is 13.4 inches (WeatherReports.com 2006). Summer and fall months are
    typically dry.
    Historically, the natural vegetation within the vicinity of the City of Mendota was
    characterized by vast stretches of savanna traversed by the riparian stands of the San
    Joaquin River and its tributaries. The range of natural vegetation communities has
    been significantly reduced from historic levels as a result of conversion of these lands
    to urban and agricultural uses. Only scant disturbed remnants of these natural
    communities remain within the proposed SOI. Agricultural and urban development
    has nearly eliminated most historic natural communities.
    Row crops dominate the agricultural land uses within the proposed SOI, with few
    orchards. Although agricultural lands within the proposed SOI can provide a source of
    food, water, and shelter to both native and introduced wildlife species, the lack of
    hedgerows, shelter-belts, wind breaks, and natural vegetation buffers severely limits
    their habitat value. In addition, agricultural practices such as herbicide and pesticide
    application, monoculture cropping, and intensive tillage further reduces the habitat
    value of these lands. With the exception of the wetland/riverine corridor provided by
    Fresno Slough, the proposed SOI is almost entirely developed with urban or
    agricultural uses with some parcels of annual grassland throughout. Figures 4-3 and
    4-4 show Recorded Occurrences of Special Status Species within five miles of the
    Proposed Sphere of Influence and Vegetation Types within the Proposed Sphere of
    Influence.
    The wetland/riverine corridor varies in width from 80 to 1,310 meters (250 to 4,300
    feet) and borders the western boundary of the proposed SOI. This area is part of the
    Pacific Flyway. Migratory birds regularly use the Mendota Wildlife Area and
    surrounding area as year-round or seasonal habitat (Huddleston 2001). Many species
    present within the proposed SOI include native and introduced wildlife species that are
    tolerant of human activities and often thrive in developed habitats. The cropland and
    fallow fields within and surrounding the proposed SOI contain suitable foraging
    habitat for raptors and other species.

            OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
     SCENIC RESOURCES
     The average elevation of the City of Mendota is approximately 175 feet above mean
     sea level, with the terrain sloping gently from the southwest to the northeast. The
     terrain is mostly flat and level with no significant hills or topographic features. Views
     from the City are generally limited due to the level topography of the region. The
     Coast Ranges are frequently visible to the west and on clear days, the Sierra Nevada
     Mountains can be seen. The City currently has no designated scenic corridors,
     protected vistas or policies regulating development in scenic areas.
     WATER QUALITY
     The City of Mendota has three primary municipal wells and two back up wells. Water
     quality from Mendota’s three primary wells meets all Title 22 requirements after
     treatment. Water quality from the two back up wells does not, however, in that there
     is a large amount of Iron and Manganese. However, this is only an aesthetic problem
     and does not pose a health risk. Each well pumps to an Iron and Manganese removal
     plant rated for 3000 GPM. There are currently two storage tanks for 1 MG each
     which provide 1.75 MG of usable water storage. Peak day demand is 3.0 MGD and
     daily average demand ranges from 0.85 MGD to 2.5 MGD. Total annual production
     is 525 MG.
     AIR QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS
     The City of Mendota is located within the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin (SJVAB),
     which is defined by the Sierra Nevada on the east, the Coast Ranges on the west and
     the Tehachapi mountains on the south. It is approximately 250 miles long and, on
     average, 35 miles wide. The SJVAB is basically flat with a gentle downward slope to
     the northwest. The Mountain ranges to the west, south and east serve to drop
     pollutants into the area by the prevailing north wind, resulting in poor air quality.
     Air Pollutants of Concern and Health Effects
     The pollution potential of the San Joaquin Valley is very high. Surrounding mountains,
     in conjunction with temperature inversions, frequently restrict lateral and vertical
     dilution of pollutants. Abundant sunshine and warm temperatures in summer are ideal
     conditions for the formation of photochemical oxidant, and the San Joaquin Valley
     frequently experiences photochemical pollution.

OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
    Primary air quality issues in the SJVAB are ozone and particulate matter (dust). Carbon
    monoxide has been a problem in the past in the larger cities such as Fresno,
    Bakersfield, Modesto and Stockton. Ozone is a strong irritant attacking the respiratory
    system, leading to the damage of lung tissue. Asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory
    ailments as well as cardiovascular diseases are aggravated by exposure to ozone.
    Suspended particulate matter consists of solid and liquid particles small enough to
    remain suspended in the atmosphere indefinitely. The major components of
    suspended particulate are dust particles, nitrates and sulfates. A portion of suspended
    particulate is directly emitted to the atmosphere as a by-product of combustion, wind
    erosion of soil and unpaved road travel. Small particles are also created in the
    atmosphere through chemical reactions.
    Ambient Air Quality Standards and Attainment Status
    The SJVAB is currently designated as a nonattainment area with respect to the state
    PM10 as well as state and national 1-hour ozone standards and the national 8-hour
    ozone standard. In addition, the SJVAB was most recently designated nonattainment
    for the state PM2.5 standard. The national standard for PM10 was not exceeded
    during the past three years.
    Due to the continuing air pollution problem in the SJVAB, the State Legislature added
    Section 65302.1 to the California Government Code in 2003. This section requires
    cities and counties in the San Joaquin Valley to amend appropriate elements of general
    plans to include data, analysis, comprehensive goals, policies and feasible
    implementation strategies to improve air quality.
    Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change
    Over the past several decades the Earth’s average temperature has been rising. The
    main cause of this “global warming” is the increase in certain gases in the Earth’s
    atmosphere called atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs). GHGs play a critical role
    in the Earth’s radiation budget by trapping infrared radiation emitted from the Earth’s
    surface, which could have otherwise escaped to space. This phenomenon, known as
    the “Greenhouse Effect,” keeps the Earth’s atmosphere near the surface warmer than
    it would be otherwise.
    Human activities associated with industrial/manufacturing, utilities, transportation,
    residential and agricultural sectors have been attributed to an increase in the GHGs.
    These activities are common in the SJVAB.

  CHAPTER          4
           OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
     Global warming could have serious consequences locally within several decades unless
     emissions are significantly reduced including: sea level rise, spread of certain diseases,
     impact on agricultural production, impact on water supply, reduction of the
     sustainability of ecosystems, increased strength and frequency of storms, extreme heat
     events, air pollution episodes, and the consequence of these effects on the economy.
     Local impacts include a reduction in the state’s water supply, increased air pollution
     creation by higher temperatures, harm to agriculture, an increase in wildfires, and
     economic losses caused by higher food, water energy and insurance prices.
     Faced with these facts, California’s governor signed into law Assembly Bill 32, the
     “Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006,” which commits the State to reduce
     emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 by enforcing a statewide cap on emissions.
     SB 375, passed in 2008, builds on the existing regional transportation planning process
     (which is overseen by local elected officials with land use responsibilities) to connect
     the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cars and light trucks to land
     use and transportation policy. In order to reach the greenhouse gas reduction goals set
     out in AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, SB 375 provides emissions-
     reduction goals around which regions can plan - integrating transportation, housing,
     and land use planning activities and providing incentives for local governments and
     developers to adopt smart growth
     With the passage of AB 32 and SB 32, attention has been focused on not only the
     consequence of global warming, but also on the responsibility local governments must
     take reduce its causes and impact.
     THE FUTURE OF OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION
     Parks, Recreation and Open Space
     The availability and accessibility of parks, recreational facilities, and open space for
     varied forms of recreation are key components in maintaining the quality of life within
     Mendota. This Element provides a policy level foundation for maintaining existing
     and creating additional parks, open space, recreation facilities and programs for
     Mendota residents. The City will also pursue various strategies and funding sources to
     achieve this goal. Funding for parks, recreational facilities, and open space for varied
     forms of recreation may come from local, state, and federal grants; and developer
     dedications.
     In order to ensure that there are ample parks for Mendota’s existing and future
     residents, Mendota has adopted a standard that requires the construction and

OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
    maintenance of five acres of parks per 1,000 residents to be distributed throughout the
    City. There are and will be at least the following types of parks:
            Neighborhood Park: A neighborhood park is a small park for informal
             recreational activities. Neighborhood parks shall be located within walking or
             biking distance of residents and provide basic recreational opportunities such
             as grass, trees, benches, playgrounds and picnic tables. Neighborhood parks
             shall be between one and three acres in size.
            Community Park: A community park provides active and passive
             recreational opportunities for large and more diverse user groups.
             Community parks serve residents within walking, biking and driving distances.
             Community parks shall be between three and fifteen acres in size.
            Regional Park: A regional park provides a focal point and gathering place
             for the wider Mendota community. Regional parks provide opportunities for
             organized sports, community activities, and passive recreation space. Due to
             their size, regional parks require parking and restroom facilities. Regional
             parks shall be between fifteen and one-hundred acres in size.
    Overlapping with the policies of providing land for parks are policies that relate to the
    provision of open space in general. Open space is defined as land designated for
    various open space purposes, including land needed to ensure recreation opportunities,
    land needed to ensure the preservation of natural resources, land needed to ensure
    public health and safety, and land needed to ensure the managed production of
    resources. Mendota has incorporated this definition of open space, tailored it to its
    physical geography, and has consequently designated the following open space types,
    as indicated in the General Plan Land Use Diagram:
            Recreational:       Recreational open space is designated for both the
             preservation of natural resources and for recreational uses. Recreational open
             space is considered parkland. Recreational open space provides opportunities
             for nature based recreation, such as bird watching and environmental
             education and may include wetlands, wildlife habitat and stream or creek
             corridors. Recreational open space may take the form of one large parcel or
             many small parcels forming a greenbelt or linear park which may also serve as
             a wildlife corridor. Recreational open space acreage may vary. Acreage
             designated as recreational open space will be counted towards meeting the
             standard that requires the construction and maintenance of five acres of parks
             per 1,000 residents to be distributed throughout the City.

  CHAPTER          4
           OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
             Agricultural: Agricultural open space is permanent open space designated
              for agricultural use.
             Multi-Use/Open Space: Multi-use open space is designated for both the
              preservation of natural resources and for recreation. It is primarily intended
              to accommodate special use facilities such as batting cages, golf ranges and
              golf courses. Acreage designated as multi-use open space will not be counted
              towards meeting the standard that requires the construction and maintenance
              of five acres of parks per 1,000 residents to be distributed throughout the City.
             Buffer: Buffer open space is permanent open space designated to prevent
              nuisance issues that can arise when two incompatible land uses are located
              immediately adjacent to one another. Buffers are also designated to provide
              connections between residential neighborhoods and other land use types. In
              numerous instances, the buffers will include walls, fencing and landscaping for
              the purposes of aesthetics at main entrance corridors into the City. Lastly,
              buffers are also designated for the protection of public health and safety and
              the preservation of natural resources (e.g. land designated as a buffer along the
              Fresno Slough). Buffer open space will not be counted towards meeting the
              standard that requires the construction and maintenance of five acres of parks
              per 1,000 residents to be distributed throughout the City.
     There are 23 acres of existing parks within the existing Mendota City Limits (23 acres
     designated as Recreational Open Space in the current General Plan Land Use Map).
     Land designated as Buffer Open Space (5.25 acres) and Multi-Use Open Space (0.035
     acres) within the existing Mendota City Limits are not currently considered/included
     in the calculations of existing park acreages. With 23 acres provided and a 2008
     population of 9,788 residents within the existing Mendota City Limits, there is a
     shortfall of approximately 25.94 acres if park acreages were provided at the standard of
     five acres of parks per 1,000 residents.
     Using the standards established by this element as a benchmark, Mendota currently has
     a significant deficiency of park and open space acreage, shown in Table 4-1 on the
     following page.

    With a significant portion of the land area within the existing Mendota city limits
    having already been developed, the opportunities to provide additional park acreage
    within the Mendota city limits is somewhat curtailed. However, every attempt will be
    made by the City of Mendota to implement the policy that park acreage of different
    types will be well-distributed throughout Mendota and its Sphere of Influence.
    Acreage deficiencies may be overcome in the future with a portion of the acreage
    identified as subject to a Future Development Overlay on the Land Use Diagram set
    aside for parks and open space. As required by Policy OSC-2.4, ten percent of the
    Future Development Overlay area should be set aside for park or open space use.
    This policy will ensure that new development at the Specific Plan level will include
    adequate park, recreation and open space facilities. The Future Development Overlay
    area currently contains 1,233 acres. Reserving ten percent of this acreage for parks,
    recreation and open space would provide an additional 123 acres for Mendota’s
    residents. As currently outlined in the proposed General Plan, only 41 acres are
    designated as park.
    Due to limitations on the amount of acreage remaining in open space with the
    potential for park development within the city limits, it is also assumed that proposed
    park, recreation and open space facilities may be located outside of the City Limits, but
    within the SOI.
    This Element also calls for the development of a Parks, Recreation and Open Space
    Master Plan. The Master Plan will provide recommendations for short-term
    improvements, as well as standards for planning future parks and recreation facilities.
    During the preparation of this new Master Plan, the community should provide input,
    make recommendations, and help to establish park and recreation priorities. Once
    completed, this element should be updated accordingly to provide the detailed
    implementation programs needed to expand local public recreational opportunities in
    conformance with the findings of the study.

  CHAPTER           4
           OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
     Agriculture
     Mendota’s agricultural heritage greatly contributes to the rural character of the City and
     serves as the foundation for the local economy. Agricultural land in the vicinity of
     Mendota should be preserved to maintain the rural character of Mendota, as well as
     the viability of the agricultural economy. However, the conversion of non-productive,
     non-prime agricultural lands for compact urban development adjacent to the existing
     City of Mendota may be appropriate in some instances due to the soil composition. In
     recent years, a significant amount of land has been retired from agriculture and
     converted to urban uses, with such as the development of a federal prison at Mendota,
     as well as the development of workforce housing.
     The viability of some agricultural land in Mendota is threatened by issues surrounding
     drainage of agricultural land. For this reason, land which is retired from intensive
     irrigation and cultivation should be considered for open space or parkland and other
     recreational facilities that may serve as a buffer between active agricultural uses and
     urban development.
     Archaeological, Historic and other Cultural Resources
     There are only two sites within the Plan area which are recorded historic sites: the
     Cervantes Property and the Marchini Property. These sites should be protected
     through adequate review of proposed development and through additional
     conservation efforts focused on Mendota’s archeological, historic and cultural
     resources.
     Biological Resources and Agricultural Land
     Agricultural lands in the proposed SOI can be divided into two categories: cropland
     and orchard. There is a total of 2,202 acres of agricultural land (currently in use as
     cropland or orchard) within the proposed SOI. Agricultural lands generally occur in
     areas that once supported productive and diverse biological communities. The
     conversion of native vegetation to agricultural lands has greatly reduced the wildlife
     species diversity and habitat value. However, some common and agricultural “pest”
     species forage in these habitats, and cultivated vegetation can provide benefits such as
     cover, shade, and moisture for these and other species during hot summer months.
     Typical species found in agricultural lands include red-tailed hawk, barn owl, American
     crow, Brewer’s blackbird, house finch, California ground squirrel and western harvest
     mouse.
     There are also irrigation ditches and detention basins within agricultural lands. They
     are highly modified channels that vary in species composition and persistence of water.

OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
    Because these irrigation ditches and detention basins may be potentially jurisdictional
    waters, project activities could possibly be regulated by the United States Army Corps
    of Engineers (USACE) under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
    Irrigation channels located adjacent to agricultural lands provide water, cover, and
    foraging habitat for wildlife in adjacent habitats. Aquatic species may include mosquito
    fish. Bullfrogs may also occur within the irrigation channels. Common garter snake
    may utilize these areas for foraging as well. The potential for the federally listed giant
    garter snake exists.
    Cropland
    Cropland generally provides less suitable habitat for wildlife because of weed control,
    tilling, and insect control practices. Numerous bird species will forage in croplands.
    Migratory species that may forage in agricultural fields during their migrations through
    the region include American, Say’s phoebe, horned lark, and various shorebirds,
    swallows and sparrows. Amphibians and reptiles may disperse across croplands on a
    seasonal basis, and common species, such as western toad, western fence lizard and
    Pacific gopher snake, may occasionally forage within croplands. Many small
    herbivorous mammals, particularly rodents, hares and rabbits, are able to establish
    seasonal populations in croplands because food is abundant and cover provided by
    crops is adequate. Tilling, flood irrigation, and rodent control tend to reduce these
    populations. Small herbivores expected to occur in croplands include gopher, ground
    squirrel, western harvest mouse, deer mouse, vole, rat and house mouse. Carnivores
    and omnivores expected to forage in croplands include broad-footed mole, coyote,
    raccoon and striped skunk. Bats also utilize croplands for foraging during late spring,
    summer, and early fall.
    Several red-tailed hawks of various ages, several Northern harriers, and several
    American kestrels as well as one prairie falcon have been observed within the bare
    ground cropland. In addition, one white-tailed kite was observed adjacent to the
    marshland within the proposed SOI.
    Orchard
    Few orchards are located in the southeastern portion of the proposed SOI consisting
    of 264 acres. Orchards within the proposed SOI are planted with pistachios with an
    understory mostly consisting of bare ground, with some non-native grasses and forbs
    such as Johnson grass, field mustard and filarees. Orchards do not provide suitable
    habitat to foraging raptors, however they may provide sufficient cover for numerous
    bird species, reptiles and many small herbivorous mammals.

  CHAPTER          4
          OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
     Development of the undisturbed (un-farmed) areas within and surrounding Mendota
     could result in the incremental loss of valuable habitat for native plants and animals.
     Portions of the City’s planning area may contain habitat for special status plant and
     animal species. As the City contemplates outward expansion, these resources should
     be identified and preserved, where feasible. This can be accomplished in a variety of
     ways, including, but not limited to, preparing site-specific analyses of proposed
     development sites and limiting development.
     SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES
     Special-status species were considered based on field survey results, a review of the
     CNDDB, USFWS and CNPS literature as well as species within The Recovery Plan for
     Upland Species of the San Joaquin Valley (USFWS 1998). An explanation of the likelihood
     of presence within the proposed SOI is outlined below.
             High: Species known to occur in or near the proposed SOI (based on
              CNDDB records within 5 miles, and/or based on professional expertise
              specific to the proposed SOI or species) and there is suitable habitat within
              the proposed SOI.
             Moderate: Species known to occur in the vicinity of the proposed SOI (based
              on CNDDB records within 5 miles) and there is marginal habitat within the
              proposed SOI – OR - Species are not known to occur in the vicinity of the
              proposed SOI, however there is suitable habitat onsite.
             Low: Species not known to occur in the vicinity of the proposed SOI, and
              there is marginal/lacking habitat or microhabitat within the proposed SOI –
              OR - Species are no longer known to occur in the vicinity of the proposed
              SOI, and site lacks suitable habitat.
             None: Species are not known to occur on or in the vicinity of the proposed
              SOI and there is no suitable habitat for the species within the proposed SOI –
              OR - Species were surveyed for during the appropriate season with negative
              results for the species occurrence within the proposed SOI.
     Range and habitat information for the special-status wildlife and plant species below
     was obtained from the CWHR program version 8 (CDFG 2002) and the CNDDB
     database. A list of Special Status Species and their potential to occur within the
     proposed SOI is contained in the Biological Resources section of the Mendota
     General Plan EIR.

                                                                            CHAPTER          4
OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
    SCENIC RESOURCES
    Views from the City and within the City are a valuable resource that many
    communities, including Mendota, feels should be preserved.              This may be
    accomplished through the identification of areas of scenic interest such as those
    providing views of the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges.
    WATER QUALITY
    Further development of Mendota can threaten water quality, unless measures are taken
    to ensure a clean water supply through protection of water resources. The City can
    take steps to ensure that water quality is maintained, through protection of
    groundwater and surface water quality and through appropriate wastewater treatment
    practices.
    AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE (GLOBAL WARMING)
    Continued development of the City will contribute to the incremental area-wide
    deterioration of air quality. The increase in population and the level of additional
    development anticipated by the General Plan will increase the volume of vehicle traffic
    on local roads, with a corresponding increase in emissions. The increase in emissions
    associated with buildout of the General Plan could hinder efforts to achieve federal
    and State air quality standards. This will be due in part to a short-term increase of
    construction emissions and a long-term increase of vehicular and other emissions, such
    as wood-burning stoves, gas-fired appliances, landscape maintenance equipment and
    consumer products.
    However, the City of Mendota can counteract the decrease in air quality using a variety
    of methods, including the development of pedestrian and bicycle friendly
    environment, thus reducing the dependence of Mendota’s residents on vehicular
    transportation, encouraging residents to transition from the use of wood burning
    devices to gas-fired stoves, encouraging the use of energy efficient materials and
    building techniques, and encouraging technological infrastructure that supports the
    reduction of dependence on the automobile through reduced commute and utilitarian
    vehicle trips.
     The City can also plan for the control of odorous emissions by requiring that odor
    impact analysis be conducted when evaluating new development applications. Future
    development in Mendota should be sited so as to prevent air pollution and odor point
    sources from being located too close to residential development or other sensitive
    receptors.

  CHAPTER          4
           OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
     Although the State has not yet mandated specific regulations for the implementation
     of AB 32 or SB 375, by local governments, it is clear that long range plans should
     consider ways to reduce GHG emissions, counteract effects of global warming and
     protect against adverse effects. Policies that effectively do this include those that
     promote resource (including water, agriculture and natural habitat) and energy
     efficiency and encourage the development of renewable resources and energy.
     ENERGY CONSERVATION
     In today’s environment, where conventional energy resources are increasingly
     constrained and their use is causing unintended adverse impacts, the need for local
     energy planning is evident. The City of Mendota can take steps to encourage and plan
     for energy conservation, thus maintaining or improving the quality of life enjoyed by
     residents. Energy conservation efforts can include encouragement programs for
     alternative transportation, green building, recycling programs and renewable energy.

     POLICY OSC-7.2     For those areas in which special status species are found or likely to
                        occur or where the presence of species can be reasonably inferred, the
                        City shall require mitigation of impacts to those species. Mitigation
                        shall be designed by the City in coordination with the U.S. Fish and
                        Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the California Department of Fish
                        and Game (CDFG), and shall emphasize a multi-species approach to
                        the maximum extent feasible. This may include development or
                        participation in a habitat conservation plan.
     POLICY OSC-7.3     The City shall encourage creation of habitat preserves that are
                        immediately adjacent to each other in order to provide interconnected
                        open space areas for animal movement.
     POLICY OSC-7.4     The City shall adopt and maintain a Noxious Weed Ordinance. The
                        Noxious Weed Ordinance shall include regulatory standards for
                        construction activities that occur adjacent to natural areas to inhibit the
                        establishment of noxious weeds through accidental seed import. See 8.0

                        1) Schedule construction activities to avoid nesting activities. The
                             avian breeding window on average is between February 1 and
                             August 30, which complies with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act
                             and Section 3503.5 of the FGC, therefore construction activities
                             should occur between September and January.
                        2) Conduct all vegetation clearing (including trees, shrubs and bushes)
                             outside of the nesting season. If clearing of any vegetation and/or
                             construction activities occur during the avian breeding window,
                             then preconstruction surveys for nesting raptors shall be conducted
                             up to 30 days before construction. The qualified biologist shall
                             survey the construction zone and a 100-foot radius surrounding
                             the construction zone to determine whether the activities taking

                        the construction zone and construction must take place during the
                        breeding season, a buffer zone shall be established by the biologist
                        and confirmed by the appropriate resource agency and a qualified
                        wildlife biologist shall monitor the nest to determine when the
                        young have fledged and submit bi-weekly reports to City of
                        Mendota Planning Department throughout the nesting season.
                        The biological monitor shall have the authority to cease
                        construction if there is any sign of distress to the raptor. Reference

                   1) Development of an ordinance that shall apply to projects that are
                        five acres or more in size since this is recognized to be the
                        minimum acreage required for viable Swainson’s hawk foraging
                        habitat.
                   2) The project Applicant shall acquire conservation easements or
                        other instruments to preserve suitable foraging habitat for
                        Swainson’s hawk, as determined by CDFG, on a 1:1 ratio.
                   3) For projects less than 40 acres in size, it may be infeasible to
                        acquire easements for less than 40 acres and project proponents
                        should have the option to mitigate adverse impacts to Swainson’s

                        mitigation fee.
    POLICY OSC-7.7 The City shall protect established trees within the City. The City shall
                   develop an ordinance to protect native trees that are six inches in
                   diameter at breast height (DBH) or greater. Trees with a six inch
                   DBH or greater shall be replaced at a ratio of 2:1 (two trees for every
                   one removed) and a revegetation plan shall be developed and approved
                   by the appropriate resource agencies prior to implementation of the
                   proposed project.

                   NOISE ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
Noise is any unwanted sound that interferes with an individual’s ability to perform a
task or enjoy an activity. While there are sounds that are considered desirable,
excessive unwanted sounds can undermine the health, safety and welfare of the
community. Removing or reducing the impact of significant sources of noise
improves quality of life for residents, employees and visitors alike.
PURPOSE OF THE NOISE ELEMENT
The Noise Element of a General Plan is a comprehensive program for including noise
management in the planning process. It is a tool for local planners to use in achieving
and maintaining land uses that are compatible with environmental noise levels. The
Noise Element identifies noise sensitive land uses and noise sources, and defines areas
of noise impact for the purpose of developing programs to ensure that residents will
be protected from excessive noise intrusion.
The overall intent of the Noise Element is to protect persons and their quality of life
by identifying noise impacts within the community, minimizing those impacts
whenever possible, and setting forth goals and policies that will ensure an amiable
acoustical environment for the City or County.
The goal of Mendota’s Noise Element is to identify the major sources of noise within
the City and discuss the City’s role in ensuring comfortable and safe noise levels
throughout the community. The Noise Element addresses potential noise impacts and
provides a basis for comprehensive local policies to control and abate environmental
noise and to protect the community from excessive noise exposure in Mendota. This
Element has been prepared in conformance with all mandatory requirements of state
law as outline in the Introduction Chapter of this Update.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Noise Element provides a policy framework for addressing potential noise
impacts in the planning process. Its purpose is to minimize future noise conflicts. The
Noise Element relates to several other elements in the General Plan, including the
Land Use, Circulation and Safety Elements. Where the overlap is identified, cross
references are provided to alert the reader to specific sections of other elements.

 CHAPTER          5
                                        NOISE ELEMENT
    ACOUSTICAL SETTING
    Noise is generally defined as unwanted sound. Sound levels are measured and
    expressed in decibels (dB), with 0 dB corresponding roughly to the threshold of
    hearing. Forty decibels would correspond with the sound of soft music, 80 decibels
    would correspond to freeway traffic noise at 50 feet and 110 decibels would
    correspond to a commercial jet takeoff at 200 feet away. Common community noise
    sources and associated noise levels, in dBA, are depicted below in Table 5-1.
    Noise sensitive receptors or development may include locations or areas where
    dwelling units or other fixed, developed sites of frequent human use occur (i.e.
    residences, transient lodging, churches, meeting halls, schools, theatres, auditoriums,
    music halls, hospitals, nursing homes, office buildings, libraries, museums, playgrounds
    and neighborhood parks). These receptors or types of development are also
    considered to be sensitive to vibration.
    Continued exposure to sound levels over 85 dB may cause hearing loss. Impacts
    related to noise pollution or excessive noise can affect a community’s quality of life.
    Noise has been linked directly to human health and, aside from general annoyances;
    excessive noise can be a source of discomfort, interfere with sleep, and disrupts
    communication and relaxation. By recognizing existing sources of noise pollution and
    taking reasonable steps to mitigate future impacts, the City may achieve a pleasant
    environment and preserve the well-being of the community.
    There are several potential sources of noise within the City of Mendota. These sources
    include noise generated from stationary activities such as commercial and industrial
    uses; aircraft operations such as the Mendota Municipal Airport; traffic on major
    roadways and highways such as State Route (SR) 33, SR 180 and other local streets; the
    Union Pacific Railroad; active recreation areas of parks and outdoor play areas of
    schools; and surrounding agricultural operations. Short-term (10-minute) noise level
    measurements were conducted on April 27, 2007 for the purpose of documenting and
    measuring the existing daytime noise environment in various areas in an around the
    City of Mendota. Based on the monitoring conducted, average daytime noise levels
    within the City range from the mid-50s to the low 70s, dependent primarily on
    distance from area roadways. This is fairly quiet. Ambient noise levels during the
    quieter nighttime hours are typically 5 to 10 dBA less than daytime noise levels.
    Ambient noise measurement locations and corresponding measured values (i.e., Leq,
    Lmax, and Lmin) are depicted in Figure 5-1.

                           NOISE ELEMENT
As identified by the 2007 noise monitoring and illustrated in Figure 5-1, significant
noise sources in Mendota fall into four basic categories: stationary sources, aircraft,
roadways and railways. Each of these noise sources is discussed individually below.

                                        NOISE ELEMENT
    STATIONARY NOISE SOURCES
    Stationary noise sources include industrial and commercial land uses. Many industrial
    processes produce noise, even when the best available noise control technology is
    applied. Noise exposures within industrial facilities are controlled by federal and state
    employee health and safety regulations (i.e., regulations of the Occupational Safety and
    Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor [OSHA] and the California
    Division of Occupational Safety and Health [Cal-OSHA]). Exterior noise levels that
    affect neighboring parcels are typically subject to local standards.
    Commercial, recreational and public
    facility activities can also produce noise
    that may affect adjacent noise-sensitive
    land uses. These noise sources can be
    continuous or intermittent and may
    contain tonal components that are
    annoying to individuals who live nearby.
    For instance, emergency-use sirens and
    backup alarms are often considered nuisance noise sources, but may not occur
    frequently enough to be considered incompatible with noise-sensitive land uses. In
    addition, noise generation from fixed noise sources may vary based upon climate
    conditions, time of day, and existing ambient noise levels. Potentially significant
    stationary noise sources in Mendota include the local concrete and biomass plants.
    AIRCRAFT
    The Mendota Municipal Airport is located east of central Mendota and serves general
    aviation aircraft. The airport consists of a single paved runway approximately 3,499
    feet in length extending in a general north-south direction. Approximately three
    aircraft are currently based at the airport. Aircraft operations average approximately
    13,000 flights annually (Fresno County General Plan 2000).
    Noise concerns typically associated with airports include increased levels of annoyance
    and interference with personal activities such as sleeping, conversing, relaxing, or
                                                watching television. While individual
                                                responses to noise can vary, various
                                                methods and noise descriptors have been
                                                developed in an attempt to correlate aircraft
                                                noise levels with land use compatibility and
                                                community reaction.

                   NOISE ELEMENT
Noise that emanates away from airports and airplane flight paths is typically
represented by concentric noise contours around the airport. The contours delineate
zones where land use is restricted, protecting the citizens on the ground from the
detrimental effects of exposure to excessive aircraft noise. These noise contours take
into account the number, time of day, and frequency of aircraft operations; as well as
variations in monthly and seasonal flight schedules.
The result is a 24-hour day/night average noise contours, depicted in CNEL, as shown
in Figure 5-2. The existing 60 dBA CNEL contour of the airport is largely confined
to within the airport boundaries.
ROADWAYS
Ambient noise levels in many portions of
the City are defined primarily by traffic on
major roadways, including State Routes
(SRs) 180 and 33. To support this General
Plan, in 2007 noise levels along the City’s
major roadways were modeled (Ambient
2007).
The result of this model: traffic noise levels for roadway segments within the City,
including distances to the predicted 60, 65, and 70-dBA Ldn/CNEL noise contours,
are summarized below in Table 5-2.
As the table shows, existing noise levels from Mendota’s current (2007) roadways are
fairly moderate – ranging between approximately 53 to 69 the dBA Ldn/CNEL. Please
see the companion Environmental Impact Report for more detail regarding the Noise
Study conducted for this General Plan.

RAILROAD
The Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) bisects Mendota in a general north-south
direction. The number of freight trains traveling along this segment can vary from day
to day, depending on demand, and there are currently no hourly limitations to freight
train travel. As identified in a 2007 Noise Impact Analysis (Ambient) approximately
two trains per day travel along this corridor on a daily basis, with higher train
operations of up to five trains per day occurring during the peak agricultural
production season. The UPRR does not anticipate substantial changes in freight train
traffic, nor to existing noise levels, as shown in Table 5-3, in future years (Fresno
County 2000, UPRR 2007).

OVERVIEW OF MAJOR NOISE ISSUES
The City has encouraged public participation and held community workshops in 2006-
2007 to guide the General Plan Update and visioning process for the community. The
City and the community identified the following noise needs to be addressed in the
General Plan:
         Controlling noise from industrial uses and aggregate operations. As additional
          development occurs throughout the City of Mendota, the potential exists for
          new noise-sensitive land uses to encroach upon existing or proposed
          stationary noise sources.
         Mitigating impacts associated with aircraft noise from the Mendota Municipal Airport. As
          the City of Mendota continues to grow and develop, there are concerns that
          noise-sensitive land uses could begin to overlap with the noise contours and
          existing flight patterns of the airport.
                                                                         MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE                        5-13

  CHAPTER          5
                                             NOISE ELEMENT
             Reducing noise from vehicle traffic, especially in residential areas. Traffic rates are
              expected to increase concurrently with future developments in the City, and
              therefore, the need to expand Mendota’s roadways is anticipated and likely.
              The main roadways of concern in the City are Belmont Avenue, Derrick
              Avenue (i.e., SR 33), and California Avenue. The largest increase in traffic
              noise levels associated with future development is anticipated to occur along
              California Avenue, West of SR 33.
             Mitigating impacts associated with railroad noise from the Union Pacific Railroad. Future
              development could result in increased exposure to railroad noise levels that
              would exceed normally acceptable noise criteria for land use compatibility.
     The issues raised above have been incorporated into the Policies, Goals and Action
     Items described in this Element.
     THE FUTURE - A COMMUNITY FREE OF THE
     HARMFUL EFFECTS OF NOISE
     As Mendota looks to the future, it is critical that the City guarantee an amiable and
     noise conscious community, to ensure a pleasant acoustic environment for Mendota’s
     residents. It is equally important that the City ensure that noise regulations keep pace
     with new anticipated development.
     Through implementation of the goals, policies and action items presented in this Noise
     Element Mendota looks forward to an amiable and noise conscious community and a
     pleasant acoustic environment for Mendota’s residents and visitors. Each of the major
     potential noise sources of the City, and how this General Plan will help to control
     them into the future is described below.
     Stationary Noise Sources
     From a land-use planning perspective, fixed-source noise control issues focus on two
     goals: (1) preventing the introduction of new noise-producing uses in noise-sensitive
     areas; and (2) preventing encroachment of noise-sensitive uses upon existing noise-
     producing facilities. The first goal can be achieved by applying noise performance
     standards to proposed new noise producing uses. The second goal can be met by
     requiring that new noise-sensitive uses near noise-producing facilities include
     mitigation measures to ensure compliance with noise performance standards. Each of
     these goals stresses the importance of avoiding the location of new uses that may be
     incompatible with adjoining uses.
5-14  MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

                                                                               CHAPTER         5
                    NOISE ELEMENT
As additional development occurs throughout the City, the potential exists for new
noise-sensitive land uses to encroach upon existing or proposed stationary noise
sources. Although the specific types of land uses to be developed are not known at
this time, development of new stationary noise sources may result in a noticeable
increase in ambient noise levels at nearby existing noise-sensitive land uses. The
policies created herein to regulate stationary noise sources will work towards
preventing the introduction of new noise-producing uses in noise-sensitive areas and
the encroachment of noise-sensitive uses upon existing noise-producing facilities
within the City of Mendota today and in the future.
Aircraft
Future growth within the City may result in new development within the projected
noise contour of the Mendota Municipal Airport. In addition, as residential
development increases in the City, more noise-sensitive land uses may be in close
proximity to one or more of the common aircraft approach paths to the airport.
Factors that would affect noise exposure associated with future development are
difficult to ascertain at this time. Of particular concern are flights occurring during the
more noise-sensitive evening and nighttime hours, which could result in increased
levels of annoyance and sleep disruption. The policies created herein that result in
awareness about noise and noise-related impacts generated by the Mendota Municipal
Airport will work towards preventing and easing any existing or future conflicts
concerning aircraft noise and aircraft noise exposure to the residents of Mendota.
Roadways
The proposed General Plan Land Use scenario would result in substantial increases in
traffic noise levels along various roadway segments, including portions of Belmont
Avenue, Derrick Avenue (i.e., SR 33), and California Avenue (see Table 5-4,
presented below). As compared with existing traffic noise levels (Table 5-2, presented
earlier), the largest increase in traffic noise levels associated with future development is
anticipated to occur along California Avenue, West of SR 33. The policies created
herein would help to reduce existing and future noise-related impacts and ambient
noise levels associated with traffic throughout the City of Mendota, ensuring safety
and a pleasant acoustic environment.
Railroad
The UPRR does not anticipate substantial changes in freight train traffic, nor to
existing noise levels, (see Table 5-3, presented earlier) in future years (Fresno County
2000, UPRR 2007). However, future development associated with implementation of
the proposed General Plan could result in increased exposure to railroad noise levels

             NOISE ELEMENT
GOALS AND POLICIES
QUALITY OF LIFE AND NOISE (GENERAL)
GOAL N-1           Prevention of noise from interfering with human activities and protection
                   of the community from the harmful effects of exposure to excessive noise,
                   maintaining an amiable community in which to live for the residents of
                   Mendota.
POLICY N-1.1       The City shall adopt a noise ordinance consistent with the stated policies
                   and within its capacity to enforce equitably.
ACTION N-1.1.1     Within one (1) year of adoption of the General Plan, the City shall
                   adopt a noise ordinance to resolve conflicts and to control unnecessary
                   noise in the City, consistent with the noise level performance protection
                   standards identified in Table 5-5, below. The Subdivision and
                   Zoning Ordinances (Titles 16 and 17 respectively) shall be updated
                   accordingly.
ACTION N-1.1.2     The City shall periodically review and update the noise element to
                   ensure policies are consistent with changing conditions in the City’s noise
                   environment. Current standards are what the City will use.
ACTION N-1.1.3     The County shall develop an effective noise control program that includes
                   the aforementioned noise ordinance (1) defining acceptable noise levels
                   based on land use, (2) setting forth monitoring methodology and
                   determination of violations, (3) defining exemptions and variance
                   procedures, and (4) delineating enforcement and abatement procedures;
                   and a public information program to inform county residents of the
                   impact of noise on their lives.
POLICY N-1.2       The City shall include noise mitigation measures in the design and use
                   of new development projects when necessary.
ACTION N-1.2.1     The city shall require development proposals to conform to the policies of
                   the City’s Noise Element ensuring compatibility with the existing noise
                   environment.

  CHAPTER     5
                                   NOISE ELEMENT
     ACTION N-1.2.2    When determining the significance of impacts and appropriate
                       mitigation to reduce those impacts for new developments projects, the
                       following criteria shall be taken into consideration.
                       Where existing or projected ambient noise levels are less than 60 dBA
                       Ldn /CNEL at the outdoor activity areas of residential uses, an
                       increase of more than 5 dBA Ldn/CNEL caused by a new
                       transportation noise source will be considered significant.
                       Where existing or projected ambient noise levels range between 60 and
                       65 dBA Ldn/CNEL at the outdoor activity areas of residential uses,
                       an increase of more than 3 dBA Ldn /CNEL caused by to a new
                       transportation noise source will be considered significant.
                       Where existing or projected ambient noise levels are greater than 65
                       dBA Ldn /CNEL at the outdoor activity areas of residential uses, an
                       increase of more than 1.5 dBA Ldn/CNEL caused by new
                       transportation noise source will be considered significant.
     ACTION N-1.2.3    Where proposed non-residential land uses are likely to produce noise
                       levels at existing or planned noise-sensitive uses that could exceed the
                       City’s noise standards (Table 5-5, below), an acoustical analysis shall
                       be required as part of the environmental review process so that noise
                       mitigation may be included in the project design. Development of
                       procedures that monitor and ensure implementation of noise mitigation
                       measures pursuant to an acoustical analysis shall also be required.
     POLICY N-1.3      Avoid placing noise-sensitive receptors near high noise-generating land
                       uses. Noise-sensitive development is considered to be locations or areas
                       where dwelling units or other fixed, developed sites where frequent
                       human use occur (i.e. residences, transient lodging, churches, meeting
                       halls, schools, theatres, auditoriums, music halls, hospitals, nursing
                       homes, office buildings , libraries, museums, playground, parks, etc.).
     ACTION N-1.3.1    To reduce heavy truck traffic in residential areas and near noise-
                       sensitive land uses associated with discretionary projects, the City will
                       review truck routes to ensure traffic noise impacts are minimized.

             NOISE ELEMENT
ACTION N-1.3.2  The City shall require land use decisions to conform to exterior noise-
                related land compatibility criteria as shown in Table 5-6, below, and
                establish recommended interior noise levels for sensitive land uses (e.g.,
                residences, schools, daycares, hospitals and other similar uses) as shown
                in Table 5-7, below. The City shall not approve the placement of
                residential or other noise-sensitive land uses in areas that exceed these
                noise standards without the provision of noise attenuation features that
                result in noise levels meeting the established noise standards.
ACTION N-1.3.3  Since activities associated with agricultural operations (such as crop
                dusting, tractor operations, and machinery operation, etc.) are recognized
                as noise sources that may be considered annoying to some persons, and
                these activities can occur during the daytime and nighttime hours, new
                development of residential uses adjacent to agricultural uses shall provide
                full disclosure of potential noise sources to future residents consistent
                with the right to farm ordinance anticipated for adoption by the City.
POLICY N-1.4    The City will include noise mitigation measures in the design and use of
                new roadway projects.
ACTION N-1.4.1  Determinations of significance for roadway improvement projects, which
                are not directly tied to a development project, shall be based on projected
                increases in ambient noise levels, as identified in Policy N-1.2.
POLICY N-1.5    The General Plan shall be consistent with the noise requirements of the
                Mendota Municipal Airport as determined by the Fresno County
                Airport Land Use Policy Plan.
POLICY N-1.6    The City shall work to seek procedures that result in an awareness
                about noise and noise-related impacts generated by the Mendota
                Municipal Airport.
ACTION N-1.6.1  The City shall require the use of easements, disclosure statements or
                other appropriate disclosure measures to ensure that new development
                within any airport influence area are informed of the presence of the
                airport and its potential for creating current and future noise.
POLICY N-1.7    The City shall work to reduce noise and minimize the impact of noise
                from existing and projected future railway operations and activities.
                                              MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE                   5-19
  CHAPTER     5
                                    NOISE ELEMENT
     ACTION N-1.7.1    The City shall require that new vibration-sensitive development shall be
                       discouraged within 200 feet of all railroad tracks and other identified
                       sources of strong ground vibration to the extent feasible. Vibration
                       sensitive development is considered to be locations or areas where
                       dwelling units or other fixed, developed sites where frequent human use
                       occur (i.e. residences, transient lodging, churches, meeting halls, schools,
                       theatres, auditoriums, music halls, hospitals, nursing homes, office
                       buildings, libraries, museums, playgrounds, neighborhood parks). For
                       such sites proposed within 200 feet of any significant source of
                       groundborne vibration, a vibration study shall be conducted prior to
                       construction by a qualified consultant to ensure that persons would not
                       be exposed to excessive vibration levels that would be disruptive (e.g.,
                       potential to interrupt sleep) or cause structural damage. The results of
                       the study shall include performance standards to fully mitigate vibration
                       impacts, which may take the form of building setbacks, site design, soil
                       compaction/grouting, and other appropriate methods.
     POLICY N-1.8      The City shall implement acceptable restrictions for various noise-
                       producing activities throughout the City.
     ACTION N-1.8.1    Noise created by construction activities, as shown in Table 5-8, shall
                       be limited to the daytime hours of 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and
                       prohibited on federal holidays. Construction activities that would result
                       in safety or traffic-related concerns during the daytime hours may be
                       permitted during the more noise-sensitive nighttime hours with approval
                       from the City’s Public Works director.
     ACTION N-1.8.2    Construction equipment and equipment staging areas shall be located at
                       the furthest distance possible from adjacent land uses.
     ACTION N-1.8.3    The City shall consider limiting the hours of operation for loading
                       docks, trash compactors, waste collection, and other noise-producing
                       activities associated with commercial areas which are located adjacent to
                       existing or planned noise-sensitive land uses.

The noise levels specified above shall be lowered by 5 dB for simple tone noises, noises consisting primarily of speech or music,
or for recurring impulsive noises. These noise level standards do not apply to residential units established in conjunction with
industrial or commercial uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings). The City can impose noise level standards which are more or less
restrictive than those specified above based upon determination of existing ambient noise levels. Fixed-noise sources which are
typically of concern include, but are not limited to, the following: HVAC Systems, Cooling Towers/Evaporative Condensers, Pump
Stations, Lift Stations, Emergency Generators, Boilers, Steam Valves, Steam Turbines, Generators, Fans / Blowers, Air
Compressors, Heavy Equipment, Conveyor Systems, Transformers, Pile Drivers, Grinders, Drill Rigs, Gas or Diesel Motors,

The exterior noise level standard shall be applied at exterior activity areas. In areas where exterior activity areas are not clearly
defined the noise level standard shall be applied at the property line of the receiving land use or at a distance of 100 feet from the
residence, whichever location is nearest to the residence.. For multi-family dwellings, an onsite common open-space or
recreation area may be designated as the open space area in lieu of individual dwelling balcony or patio areas. If the ambient
noise level exceeds the noise standards identified in the above categories, the maximum ambient noise level shall be the noise
standard for that category.
Note: For the purposes of the Noise Element, transportation noise sources are defined as traffic on public roadways, railroad line
operations, and aircraft in flight. Control of noise from these sources is preempted by Federal and State regulations. Other noise
sources are presumed to be subject to local regulations, such as a noise control ordinance. Non-transportation noise sources may
include industrial operations, outdoor recreation facilities, HVAC units, loading docks, etc. a noise control ordinance. Non-
transportation noise sources may include industrial operations, outdoor recreation facilities, HVAC units, loading docks, etc.

earlier.. In the case of hotel/motel facilities, transient lodging, or multi-family dwellings, outdoor activity areas such as balconies
or pool areas may not be included in the project design. In these cases, only the interior noise level criterion will apply. Where it
is not practical to mitigate exterior noise levels at patio or balconies of apartment complexes, a common area such as a pool or
recreation area may be designated as the outdoor activity area.

        element and the element’s relationship to other elements in the General Plan;
       A Setting section provides a description of the existing hazards in the
        Planning Area and an overview of major safety issues;
       A Safe Community: This section summarizes how the Mendota General Plan
        addresses identified hazards to ensure a safe community into the future; and
       A Goals and Policies section, including discussion of the following issues:
        flooding, geologic and seismic hazards, fire hazards, hazardous materials and
        emergency planning.

                 SAFETY ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE OF THE SAFETY ELEMENT
The Safety Element addresses a wide range of issues related to human health and
safety. This Element helps guide land use decisions by identifying potential safety
hazards and establishing appropriate policies to protect life and property in Mendota.
The overall intent of the Safety Element is to protect persons and property by
identifying potential hazards within the community, minimizing those potential risks
whenever possible, and providing for appropriate and timely response during
catastrophic events.
This Element has been prepared in conformance with all mandatory requirements of
State law as outlined in the introduction of this Update. Specific topics addressed
include:
        Flooding
        Geologic formations and seismic hazards
        Hazardous materials and waste
        Wildland and urban fire hazards
        Emergency response
The goals and policies listed at the end of the Safety Element attempt to minimize the
risk of injury and death as well as reduce the impacts to property resulting from
identified hazards in the Planning Area.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Safety Element is expected to affect land use policies and therefore it should be
coordinated with the Land Use Element. Health and safety considerations may
present justification for lowering residential density in conjunction with land use
decisions, based partly on seismic and flood risks. Because of this intimate connection
between public safety and land use, Safety Element policies are also closely
coordinated with the policies of the Open Space and Conservation, Housing and
Circulation Elements as they relate to the locations of urban versus open space land
uses, housing density and transportation routes.

    SAFETY SETTING
    Safety concerns for the City of Mendota have historically fallen into two main
    categories: natural hazards, which include flooding, seismic/geologic hazards and

    NATURAL HAZARDS
                                        Flooding
                                        Stormwater runoff in the City of Mendota is
                                        accommodated through a combination of surface and
                                        subsurface drainage facilities.     Most of the
                                        stormwater runoff in the City drains either to Bass
                                        Avenue in the northern portion of the City or to the
                                        Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way located in the
    southeast, near the end of Belmont Avenue. The majority of stormwater runoff flows
    easterly via surface areas (primarily streets) to the Fresno Slough.
    Flooding is a key concern for residents of
    Mendota and primary affects two main
    areas of the City. The first area is located in
    the northwestern portion near the
    intersection of SR 33 (Derrick Avenue) and
    Bass Avenue. One of the City’s two
    designated stormwater retention basins is
    located northeast of this intersection, in the Hacienda Gardens development area.
    According to the City Engineer, this approximately twenty acre-foot (AF) basin
    periodically fails.
    The City also experiences flooding due to runoff from Panoche Creek, which lacks an
    established drainage course to the Fresno Slough as it approaches the City from the
    west. Panoche Creek terminates at Belmont Avenue approximately seven miles west
    of the existing City limits. Flooding along Belmont Avenue within the City has been
    partially alleviated by a storm drain project that involved the construction of a block
    wall along the northern right-of-way of Belmont Avenue and by raising the elevation
    of each cross-street intersection. The project was designed to channel floodwater
    from the west along Belmont Avenue and prevent flooding in the rest of the City to

the north. Stormwater on Belmont Avenue continues eastward to the Caltrans right-
of-way at SR 180 and then proceeds south towards the Fresno Slough. Areas of the
City prone to flooding are illustrated on Figure 6-1.
Seismic Hazards
Seismically, Mendota is in a zone of low primary seismic hazard. No major faulting
has occurred along the Mendota margin of the central San Joaquin Valley. The nearest
fault to the City of Mendota is the Ortigalita Fault, which is located approximately 30
miles west, near the community of Panoche. This fault zone extends approximately 50
miles from western Stanislaus County to the far northwestern corner of Fresno
County. Most of the fault is considered active and has been designated an Earthquake
Hazard Zone under the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act of 1994.
Although most of Fresno County is situated within an area of relatively low seismic
activity, the faults and fault systems that lie along the eastern and western boundaries
of the County, as well as other regional faults, have the potential to produce high-
magnitude earthquakes throughout the County. The San Joaquin Valley is located on
alluvial deposits, which tend to experience greater ground shaking intensities than areas
located on hard rock. Therefore, structures in the San Joaquin Valley would tend to
suffer greater damage from ground shaking than those located in the foothill and
mountain areas. Secondary damage to structures results from liquefaction and seismic
compaction, land sliding and dam failure. Figure 6-2 shows the location of the nearest
faults in relation to the Planning Area.
Land Surface Subsidence
The City of Mendota is on the edge of an area of deep subsidence according to the
Fresno County General Plan (2000). Land surface subsidence can result from both
natural and man-made phenomena. Settlement related to human activities is often
caused by overpumping or overdraft of groundwater.
Overdraft of shallow groundwater beginning in the 1920s resulted in dramatic land
surface subsidence within several areas of the San Joaquin Valley ultimately the water
table to drop from just below the surface in many areas to over 200 feet in the
southern San Joaquin Valley. By 1970, 5,200 square miles of the Valley were affected
and maximum subsidence exceeded 28 feet in an area west of Mendota. Through the
importation of large amounts of surface water beginning in 1968 from the California
Aqueduct and other irrigation projects, the use of groundwater was significantly
reduced, resulting in the stabilization of land subsidence.

                                               problem to vegetation and wildlife habitats.
                                               Mendota is generally free from major
                                               wildland fires due to the urban and
                                               agricultural nature of the Planning Area.
                                               Suppression of urban fire is determined by
    issues such as proximity of fire stations (response time), adequate water flow and
    roadway access to serve fire fighting equipment.
    MAN-MADE HAZARDS
    Hazardous Materials and Waste
    Hazardous materials are those which have the potential to cause death or serious
    illness during the use, processing, storage, transport or disposal of such materials.
    Hazardous materials and waste contributes to environmental and human health
    hazards that have become an increasing public concern. Almost all land uses may
    involve hazardous materials, however, the use and disposal of hazardous materials and
    waste is generally regulated to varying degrees. Areas previously contaminated by
    these materials are required by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control
    to be identified and remediated. Transport of hazardous materials on area roadways is
    also subject to various Federal and State regulations.
    Agricultural operations in the area surrounding the City regularly store and use a
    variety of pesticides and herbicides. None of the pesticides reportedly used are
    persistent in soil, and if they were applied according to manufacturer’s directions,
    should be at residual levels below that which is harmful to human dermal contact.
    However, improper disposal of pesticides or fertilizers can degrade the subsoil, pollute
    surface and groundwater and create health hazards to humans and animals.
    Applications of such chemicals are governed by various state and federal standards and
    regulated by the County Agricultural Commissioner. Residual chemicals associated
    with current and past agricultural activities may be present at differing levels in the
    planning area.

Other Man-made Hazards
Other potential hazards in Mendota include
at-grade railroad crossings and aircraft
operations at the Mendota Municipal
Airport. The City is bisected by the Union
Pacific Railroad (operated by San Joaquin
Valley Railroad) that runs parallel to State
Route 180, between Naples Street and
Marie Street. Movement between the two
sections of the City that are separated by
the railroad is severely restricted. The only crossing within the central portion of the
City is via 9th Street. One additional crossing occurs to the northwest on SR 33, just
south of the Bass Avenue intersection.
At-grade railroad crossings are generally considered safe; however, the planned growth
of the community and the associated increase in traffic has the potential for increasing
the number of accidents that occur at these locations.
The Mendota Municipal Airport is located in the eastern portion of the City. The
airport is classified as a basic utility airport and has a single landing strip. The airport
and surrounding area is regulated by the Fresno County Airport Land Use Policy Plan
(1983), which the City has adopted as its own. The airport plan lists land use
compatibility policies and addresses safety and noise issues related to aircraft
operations. Safety restrictions include height limitations of buildings within the
vicinity of the airport and safety zones that limit allowable residential uses and other
activities.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE
The California Emergency Services Act (1970) requires the City to manage and
coordinate the overall emergency response and recovery activities within its
jurisdiction. The Standard Emergency Management System (SEMS) was instituted by
the State to coordinate government agencies during emergencies. SEMS is focused on
standardizing the organizational structure and terminology at all levels of government.
In accordance with SEMS, Mendota prepared an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP)
in 2006 that describes emergency operations organization and management; specifies
policies and general procedures; and provides for coordination of planning efforts of
the various emergency staff and service elements utilizing the SEMS. The EOP serves
as an extension of the California Emergency Plan (2005), which defines the emergency
management system used for all emergencies in the State. The objective of the EOP is
to incorporate and coordinate all the facilities and personnel of the City into an
efficient organization capable of responding to any emergency. The Mendota Office of
                                                      MENDOTA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE            6-11
  CHAPTER         6
                                       SAFETY ELEMENT
     Emergency Services has overarching responsibility for coordinating the City’s response
     to hazards and threats. Fire and police services are also discussed in the Land Use
     Element.
     OVERVIEW OF MAJOR SAFETY ISSUES
     The City has encouraged public participation and held community workshops to guide
     the General Plan Update and visioning process for the community.
     The community identified the following safety needs to be addressed in the Update:
             The General Plan Update must address drainage facilities serving the City and
              the need for improvements and expansion to accommodate new
              development.
             Efforts to minimize the effects of seismic hazards should be incorporated into
              the design of new development and should be incorporated into existing
              development as feasible.
             The community should be protected from hazards associated with fire.
             The railroad and Municipal Airport are considered to be assets to the City, but
              potential harm associated with continued and future use should be addressed.
     The Goals and Policies set forth in this Update will reduce the effects of these safety
     concerns as well as other potential hazards in the Planning Area.
     A SAFE COMMUNITY
     As Mendota looks to the future, it is critical that the City safeguard public health,
     safety and prosperity by providing and maintaining facilities and programs that enable
     the community to live in balance with natural and manmade systems. It is equally
     important that the City ensure that public services keep pace with new anticipated
     development. The City has developed the following strategies to secure the health and
     safety of Mendota’s residents and visitors.
     NATURAL HAZARDS
     Flooding
     In order to reduce the impacts of flooding in existing areas of Mendota as well as
     future development areas, the City has identified the need for a Stormwater Drainage
     Master Plan. This proposed plan would coordinate stormwater quality requirements
     on a regional basis examine existing deficiencies in the storm drain system and
     recommend necessary improvements to provide adequate stormwater drainage.

                                                                           CHAPTER         6
                 SAFETY ELEMENT
Seismic Hazards
Although Mendota is located in a zone of low primary seismic hazard, the City will
continue to require examination of geologic hazards and on-site soils for future
development. In addition, the City will promote awareness of seismic safety issues and
the retrofitting of public facilities and structures.
Wildfire
The Planning Area includes new land surrounding the existing City that may be
susceptible to wildland fires. However, most of this area has already been altered from
its natural state for agricultural purposes, which reduces the threat of wildland fires.
The City will coordinate with the Fresno County Fire Protection District to ensure that
any areas potentially affected by wildland fire hazards will be adequately protected.
MAN-MADE HAZARDS
Hazardous Materials and Waste
Toxicity and contamination of soils, water, air and organisms present hazards of
varying severity that can be controlled and minimized by proper waste management
and disposal. As outlined in the goals and policies of this Element, the City will
continue to ensure that applicable County, State or Federal regulations regarding
hazardous materials and waste are enforced and that land uses involving such materials
are sited appropriately in the community. In addition, the City will coordinate with the
Fresno County Environmental Health Division regarding hazardous materials issues.
Other Hazards
The City recognizes that the railroad and the Mendota Municipal Airport are valuable
facilities; however, they also represent potential hazards to the community. The City
shall address these safety issues by coordinating with the Union Pacific Railroad
regarding at-grade rail crossings and by developing an Airport Master Plan that will
include analysis of potential conflicts associated with future development near the
airport and potential increased airport operations.
PUBLIC SERVICES
Having adequate and sustainable public services from water and sewer pipes to fire
and police protection is critical to supporting a vibrant and growing community.
Although policies contained in this Element address this concern, many goals and
policies addressing Public Services can be found in the Land Use Element of this
Update.

                       GLOSSARY
Access - A way of approaching or entering a property, including ingress (the right to
enter) and egress (the right to leave).
Air Basin - One of 14 self-contained regions minimally influenced by air quality in
contiguous regions.
Air Pollutant Emissions - Discharges into the atmosphere, usually specified in terms
of weight per unit of time for a given pollutant from a given source.
Air Pollution - The presence of contaminants in the air in concentrations that prevent
the normal dispersive ability of the air and that interfere directly or indirectly with
man’s health, safety or comfort, or with the full use and enjoyment of property.
Air Quality Standards - The prescribed level of pollutants in the outside air that
cannot be exceeded legally during a specified time in a specified geographical area.
Ambient Noise Level - The composite of noise from all sources near and far. In this
context, the ambient noise level constitutes the normal or existing level of
environmental noise at a given location.
Annexation - The incorporation of a land area into an existing community with a
resulting change in the boundaries of that community.
Arterial - A major street carrying the traffic of local and collector streets to and from
freeways and other major streets, with controlled intersections and generally providing
direct access to nonresidential properties.
A-Weighted Decibel (dBA) - A numerical method of rating human judgment of
loudness. The sound pressure level in decibels, as measured on a sound meter, uses an
A-weighting filter to de-emphasize the very low and very high frequency components
of sound in a manner similar to the response of the human ear.
Buffer - A strip of land designated to protect one type of land use from another with
which it is incompatible. Where a commercial district abuts a residential district, for
example, additional use, yard, or height restrictions may be imposed to protect
residential properties. The term may also be used to describe any zone that separates
two unlike zones such as a multi-family housing zone between single-family housing
and commercial uses.
