POLICY DOCUMENT PART 2
Economic Development
Element
The development of a thriving local economy depends on a city’s ability to establish competitive advantages that create opportunities for private investment in business and real estate development, often in competition with other localities. For West Sacramento, these advantages include a largely undeveloped urban riverfront, close proximity to the region’s economic and cultural core, direct access to major transportation networks including a deep water port, ample availability of development sites and existing buildings of various size, quality municipal water, dedicated financial resources to invest in infrastructure improvements, and a business-friendly environment and reputation.
The policies of the Economic Development Element are intended to exploit these advantages to position West Sacramento for increased private investment, thereby stimulating job growth, expanding City revenues, and improving the quality of life for residents. The policies provide for maintaining a strong and comprehensive economic development program focused on attracting and retaining businesses in targeted sectors and fostering entrepreneurship, investing in infrastructure to prepare properties and key areas for development, maintaining a business-friendly environment, increasing access to education and job training for existing residents while attracting new residents to provide a skilled workforce, and expanding retail choices for residents and the greater region.

Healthy Community Element
More and more communities are facing the challenges of childhood obesity, asthma, type two diabetes, and other health issues resulting from an unhealthy and sedentary lifestyle. Past efforts to address these issues focused solely on changing individual behaviors and have not succeeded in reversing the obesity epidemic. Recent research has found that people’s environments - where they live and work, how they travel, what they eat, and where and when they are physically active - have a major impact on their health and well-being. Therefore, many of today’s efforts focus more on the community than the individual. A healthy community promotes a positive physical, social, and economic environment that supports the well-being of its residents.
By adopting this Healthy Community Element, the City of West Sacramento has recognized that health is a serious community issue and has made a commitment to creating a healthy living environment where residents can thrive. The Healthy Community Element addresses factors that influence physical and mental health including, physical activity, nutrition, and access to health care. The Element also addresses issues of health disparities and equal access to public participation, recognizing that a healthy community is one in which citizens are empowered to participate in decisions about the future of their community. Finally, the Healthy Community Element includes a section addressing child care needs in the city, recognizing that safe and affordable child care is essential to healthy child development.
Because health is a universal issue, the policies related to creating healthy communities are contained in nearly every General Plan Element, including Mobility, Land Use, Urban Form and Structure, Parks and Recreation, and Safety.

PART 2
Healthy Community Element
Community Equity
A healthy community is one in which all residents have equal access to the services they need to live a healthy and prosperous life. Unfortunately, there are health disparities within communities, with some areas lacking access to healthy food, safe and affordable housing, medical care, and a healthy physical environment. The City of West Sacramento is committed to ensuring equity for all residents and to building the capacity of all residents to understand, organize around, and influence policy and decision-making on the environmental conditions in their daily lives. Policies in this section promote a healthy living environment for all residents of West Sacramento.
GOAL HC-1
To eliminate health disparities by promoting equal access to health care services, healthy food, safe and affordable housing, job opportunities, safe neighborhoods, and a healthy environment.
HC-1.1 Environmental Justice 0
The City shall ensure the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes with respect to the development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of land use and environmental laws, regulations, and policies. (SO)
HC-1.2 Geographic Disparities 9

Active Living
The design of the built environment has a significant impact on the opportunities residents have to remain active and healthy and avoid chronic diseases. Adults living in walkable neighborhoods are more physically active and youth get more regular physical activity when they have opportunities to walk or ride a bicycle from home to school. Studies have shown that residents living in communities with a mix of shops and businesses within easy walking distance, as well as an accessible network of trails and open space, have a lower risk of obesity than residents of communities that do not have these services within easy walking distance. Since children spend much of their time in the classroom and adults spend a great deal of time at work, schools and employers also have the opportunity to promote physical fitness. Policies in this section promote active living through a well-designed built environment, access to open space, and programs that encourage physical fitness.
GOAL HC-2
To support active living through a built environment, a network of parks and open space, and programs that promote physical activity, connectivity, and reduce vehicle miles traveled.
HC-2.1 Physical Activity and the Built Environment ® •
The City shall make land use and urban design decisions that promote physical activity. (RDR)

HC-2.6 Safe Routes to School ® •
The City shall develop and implement a Safe Routes to School (SRTS) program. (JP)
HC-2.7 Physical Activity in the Workplace
The City shall encourage employers to provide fitness facilities, support facilities (e.g., bike lockers, showers), flexible policies (e.g., flexible schedules, longer breakers), and programs (e.g., walking and cycling clubs) to promote physical activity in the workplace. (JP)

Healthy Foods
The American diet has grown increasingly unhealthy. Several factors determine what people choose to eat, but access is a major factor. Studies have found that people buy food that is readily available. Today, communities with the highest rates of obesity are typically places where residents have few opportunities to conveniently purchase nutritious food. A healthy, nutritious diet can reduce the risk of obesity and associated chronic diseases, directly improving one’s health and well-being and minimizing health care costs for local governments. While food is a personal choice, the City of West Sacramento recognizes the need to create an environment in which all residents have access to affordable and healthy food. Policies in this section promote healthy eating habits in West Sacramento by increasing access to farmers’ markets, community gardens, and other sources of healthy food; promoting nutrition education; and limiting sources of unhealthy food.
GOAL HC-3
To promote healthy eating habits.
HC-3.1 Access to Healthy Foods ®
The City shall strive to ensure that all residents and employees are within walking distance of sources of fresh food (e.g., grocery stores, healthy corner stores, farmers’ markets, and community gardens) and shall encourage new healthy food suppliers in underserved areas. (RDR/PSP)
HC-3.2 Food Policy Council
The City will consider forming a food policy council with local partners including health professionals,	school	district

HC-3.7 Enhance Farmers’ Markets (J)
The City shall maintain and enhance existing farmers’ markets and explore ways to expand farmers’ markets to underserved areas. (PSP)

(IGC/JP)

(JP)
HC-3.15 Restrict Unhealthy Food Options
The City shall discourage new liquor stores and fast food restaurants in areas with an existing high concentration of such stores. (RDR)
Health Care
While there are numerous hospitals and other health facilities immediately across the Sacramento River in the City of Sacramento, West Sacramento itself is significantly underserved by health care facilities. A lack of access to health care can exacerbate chronic diseases such as heart disease or diabetes. Policies in this section promote the expansion of health care facilities and services to meet the health needs of West Sacramento residents.
GOAL HC-4
To promote access to health care and medical services for all residents and employees.

Child Care
The availability, accessibility, and quality of child care are frequently pressing concerns for contemporary families. Yet child care and early education have not traditionally been considered public responsibilities in American society. The impact of child care shortages - and the shortage of financial resources to support qualified, long-tenured child care workers - is felt most acutely at the local level. There is a gap between child care demand and child care supply in West Sacramento and the need will grow as the city grows in the future. The City of West Sacramento recognizes that a healthy community is one in which all children have access to safe, affordable, and high-quality child care. Policies in this section promote the provision of adequate child care facilities for all residents and employees in the city.
GOAL HC-5
To ensure an adequate, affordable, and diverse supply of child care facilities and services is available to parents and caregivers who live or work in West Sacramento.
HC-5.1 Range of Service

Land Use Element
West Sacramento’s land use pattern reflects the city’s unique location and surrounding context. General Plan 2035 builds upon the city’s historic growth pattern to accommodate anticipated population and employment growth, while preserving and enhancing the qualities and characteristics that make the city a desirable place to live and do business. The Land Use Element focuses on creating a compatible and complementary mix of housing, employment, retail, mixed-use, industrial and service uses that contribute to the city’s economy, environment, and quality of life.
Existing and emerging neighborhoods will continue to develop as planned, but also be enhanced with additional housing opportunities and mixed-use development. New and revitalized urban mixed-use districts and corridors will provide new opportunities for compatible and integrated housing, retail, and office uses and enhance the urban structure of the city. Industrial uses are planned to continue in and around the Port of West Sacramento, and in areas in the northwest of the city.
Recognizing their interdependence, policies in the Urban Structure and Design Element should be consulted when reviewing land use policies to ensure that the physical form, design, and architectural style of development and redevelopment advance the City’s desire for high-quality development.

Sustainable Growth & Development
West Sacramento’s historic growth and development patterns have generally favored low-intensity suburban development. The city is at a major crossroads as the new 2035 General Plan focuses the city’s future growth within the existing city limits. The pace of future growth is not likely to slow. As remaining development capacity in the Southport villages continues to be absorbed, new development and redevelopment will also begin in the city’s waterfront mixed-use districts (e.g., Bridge District, Stone Lock, Pioneer Bluff). Infill development on smaller vacant parcels and underutilized sites is also expected to continue to transform other areas of the city (e.g., Central Business District, West Capitol Avenue). This section contains policies to guide the overall growth of the city and ensure that new development and redevelopment balances the needs of residents and businesses and is in keeping with the City’s vision for its future.
GOAL LU-1
To provide for sustainable, orderly, well-planned, and balanced growth that meets the needs of residents and businesses, uses land efficiently, and is supported by adequate infrastructure.
LU-1.1 Sustainable Development (J)
The City shall encourage compact development patterns and higher-development intensities that use land efficiently; preserve open space; support transit, bicycle, and pedestrian mobility; increase housing diversity; and provide for strong neighborhood commercial retail viability. (RDR)
LU-1.2 Growth Phasing and Development Patterns
The City shall require development to occur in an orderly fashion and in pace with the expansion of public facilities and services, including schools. (RDR)
LU-1.3 Green Rating System
The City shall encourage new large development projects, specific plans, and planned developments to build to a green rating standard and apply for certification in a green neighborhood or development system such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental	Design-Neighborhood
Development (LEED-ND). (RDR)
LU-1.4 Land Use Transitions
In existing developed areas designated for new uses, the City shall ensure the orderly transition to new uses consistent with the adopted General Plan and phase out existing uses, during the transition period. (RDR)
LU-1.5 Compatible Infill
The City shall actively encourage infill development that is architecturally and environmentally sensitive and is compatible with surrounding land uses. (RDR)
LU-1.6 Infill and Refill Development®

LU-1.8 Growth & Change Monitoring
The City shall review and adjust, as necessary, the General Plan's land use, population, and employment capacity at least every seven years, subject to the evaluation of their impacts. (RDR/MPSP)
LU-1.9 Building Intensity and Land Use Intensity
The City shall regulate the levels of building intensity and population density according to the standards and land use designations set out in the General Plan and assumed in the final EIR. Cumulative population and employment shall not exceed General Plan assumptions without re-evaluating the General Plan and conducting appropriate environmental analysis if necessary. (RDR/MPSP)
LU-1.10 Multi-Parcel Development (?)
Where a developer proposes a multi-parcel development project with more than one residential density range or maximum FAR, the City shall apply the density or FAR range of the General Plan Land Use Designation to the net developable area of the entire project site rather than individual parcels within the site. Some parcels may be zoned for densities/intensities that exceed the maximum allowed density/intensity of the project site’s Land Use Designation, if the net density of the project as a whole is within the allowed range. (RDR)
LU-1.11 Annexations within the Planning Area (J)
For proposed projects outside the city limits, the City shall work with project proponents to ensure high-quality development, adequate infrastructure improvements, adequate flood protection, and provision of City services. All future urban development within the Planning Area should occur under the
jurisdiction of the City. To this end, the City shall require that vacant unincorporated properties be annexed into the City prior to the provision of any City services, or that a conditional service agreement be executed agreeing to annex when deemed appropriate by the City. In order to minimize the disruption and protect agricultural land, development that is adjacent to the city boundaries or has convenient freeway access shall be preferred. Proposals for development of land not adjacent to the city or without convenient freeway access shall be discouraged. (RDR)

Land Use Diagram & Standards
The Land Use Diagram depicts proposed land uses for West Sacramento through the year 2035 and beyond. The boundary lines between land use designations are delineated as specifically as possible, in most cases following parcel lines. For larger undeveloped areas particularly in areas of Southport, the boundary lines between land use designations are indicated more generally. These boundaries will be more clearly delineated by subsequent general plan amendments as more detailed planning is undertaken for these areas.
The following sections describe the land use designations appearing on the Land Use Diagram, standards of population density and building intensity for the various land use designations, and examples of where within the city the various land use designations have been applied.
Development Standards
These are legal standards of density for residential uses and standards of building intensity for nonresidential and mixed use. The following explains how these standards operate.
Density. Standards of building intensity for residential uses are stated as a range (i.e., minimum and maximum) of allowable number of dwelling units per gross acre. Standards of population density for residential uses can be derived by multiplying the allowable number of dwelling units per gross acre by the average number of persons per dwelling unit assumed for the applicable residential designation. The diagram below shows various building configurations representing different density ranges.
Density
Floor Area-Ratio (FAR). Standards of
building intensity for nonresidential uses such as mixed-use, commercial, and industrial development are stated as a range (i.e., minimum and maximum) of FARs. In the case of mixed-use developments that include residential uses, the FAR includes residential building square footage, and the density range is not applicable.
FAR is the gross building area on a site, excluding structured parking, to the net developable area of the site. The net developable area is the total area of a site excluding portions that cannot be developed (e.g., right-of-way, public parks). A site includes all contiguous parcels that will share parking or access. For example, on a lot with 25,000 square feet of land area, a FAR of 0.50 will allow 12,500 square feet of useable building floor area to be built, regardless of the number of stories in the building (e.g., 6,250 square feet per floor on two floors or 12,500 square feet on one floor). On the same 25,000-square-foot lot, a FAR of 1.00 would allow 25,000 square feet of useable floor area, and a FAR of 2.00 would allow 50,000 square feet of useable floor area. The diagram below shows various building configurations representing FARs of 0.50, 1.00, and 2.00.

LAND USE ELEMENT
While FAR provides for the overall development size and intensity, it does not specify the form or character of the building. Different interpretations of the same FAR can result in buildings of very different character. The Urban Structure and Design Element includes policies that guide physical form characteristics envisioned for development throughout the city. In addition, other City regulations (e.g., zoning design guidelines, height limits, and building setbacks,) guide the form of buildings within a given FAR range and provide for exceptions to maximum FAR in limited circumstances

Residential Neighborhoods
Vital to West Sacramento’s future is the creation of stable neighborhoods with a variety of housing types and support services. Policies in this section provide for the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of West Sacramento’s existing	residential
neighborhoods. The policies also ensure that there is adequate land available to meet future residential demand and that each neighborhood includes a variety of housing types, complementary support uses, connections, and public facilities to create complete neighborhoods, from historic neighborhoods north of the barge canal, to emerging villages in Southport, to planned urban neighborhoods along the waterfront. Rural properties will remain rural with the exception of those planned for development in Southport. Existing singlefamily neighborhoods will remain largely intact. New waterfront neighborhoods will continue to emerge with an urban character.
GOAL LU-3
To promote the development of complete residential neighborhoods that include a range of residential densities and a variety of housing types, and address the housing needs of various age and socio-economic groups who reside in West Sacramento.
LU-3.1 Adequate Land Supply
The City shall maintain an adequate supply of residential land in appropriate land use designations and zoning categories to accommodate projected household growth and to maintain normal vacancy rates. (RDR/PSR) LU-3.2 Neighborhood Housing Mix® □ The City shall promote neighborhoods that have a variety of housing types and densities to help create an overall healthy, balanced community. (RDR)
LU-3.3 Higher Density Housing ®
The City shall promote the development of higher density housing in areas served by the full range of urban services; along collector, minor arterial, and major arterial streets and within walking distance of shopping areas and public transportation. (RDR)
LU-3.4 Stable Residential Areas •
The City shall promote the preservation of the integrity of existing stable residential neighborhoods and shall respect existing neighborhood scale and character when infilling and/or upgrading existing residential neighborhoods. (RDR)
LU-3.5 Incompatible Uses U
The City shall protect existing residential neighborhoods from the encroachment of incompatible activities and land uses (e.g., traffic, noise) and environmental hazards (e.g., flood). (RDR)
LU-3.6 Neighborhood Transitions V
The City shall preserve, protect, and enhance established neighborhoods by providing sensitive transitions between these neighborhoods and adjoining areas, and requiring new development, both private and public, to respect and respond to existing design, buildings, streetscapes, and open spaces that contribute to the overall character of the neighborhood. (RDR)
LU-3.7 Complete Neighborhoods ® O
The City shall promote the creation of well-defined residential neighborhoods in newly developing areas. Neighborhoods should have a clear focal point, such as a neighborhood shopping center, park, school, or other open space and community facility, and should be designed to promote pedestrian convenience. To this end, the City shall encourage the use of existing neighborhoods, including the modified grid street system, as models for the planning and design of new residential neighborhoods. (RDR)

LU-3.8 Walkable Neighborhoods (?) 0
The City shall require the design and development of neighborhoods that are pedestrian-encouraging and include features such as short blocks, broad and well-appointed sidewalks (e.g., lighting, landscaping, adequate width), tree-shaded streets, buildings that define and are oriented to adjacent streets and public spaces, limited driveway curb cuts, paseos and pedestrian lanes, alleys, traffic-calming features, convenient pedestrian street crossings, and access to transit. (RDR)
LU-3.9 Iron Triangle
The City shall encourage the development of high-density uses in the Iron Triangle neighborhood to create connectivity with the adjacent Washington neighborhood. (RDR)
LU-3.10 Old Broderick Historic Character
The City shall endeavor to maintain and enhance the historic character of Old Broderick. (RDR)
LU-3.11 Southport Development
Land use designations and development in the Southport area shall be guided by the following principles:
-	Concentrate community commercial, high-density residential and public facilities uses in nodes along major and minor arterials.
■	Allow the development of water-dependent recreational and commercial uses along the waterways in Southport.
-	Emphasize a mixture of residential types and densities, while concentrating on homeownership as a general goal.
■	Ensure that ample buffers are established between incompatible land uses.
* Consider the use of Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) provisions to provide for an equitable distribution of the economic returns from future development for all property owners in the Southport area.
■ Provide for an orderly sequence of development based on the extension of public facilities and services. (RDR)
Commercial Centers
From regional serving shopping centers (e.g., River Point Marketplace), to neighborhood-oriented shopping centers (e.g., Southport Town Center, Country West), to small general stores and corner stores, commercial centers provide places for commerce, employment, entertainment, and gathering. Policies in this section focus on the development of commercial centers that maintain and revitalize existing commercial centers and promote new commercial opportunities. They encourage the development of centers exclusively for commercial and employment uses (/'.e., without housing) and mixed-use projects that integrate retail with housing, office, public facilities, and other uses. They encourage and support efforts to redevelop and retrofit outdated and underperforming strip-commercial centers into mixed-use centers with a variety of uses and services.
GOAL LU-4
To promote the development of distinct, well-designed commercial centers that provide convenient neighborhood retail and services, maximize community commercial and regional shopping opportunities, and expand employment opportunities.
LU-4.1 Commercial Centers (?)
The City shall encourage development of neighborhood and community serving commercial centers that complement and are well integrated into surrounding neighborhoods and provide gathering places for residents, employees, and visitors. (RDR)

The City shall encourage and, where feasible, require the vertical and horizontal integration of uses within commercial centers, particularly residential and office uses over ground floor retail. (RDR)
LU-4.3 Enhanced Street Character® Q
The City shall encourage renovation, infill, and redevelopment of existing centers that reduces the visual prominence of parking lots, makes the centers more pedestrian-friendly, reduces visual clutter associated with signage, and enhances the definition and character of the street frontage and associated streetscape. (RDR)
LU-4.4 Transform Centers ®
The City shall consider incentives (e.g., rezoning, density bonuses, or housing by-right) to transform existing auto-dominated centers into neighborhood destinations by integrating residential, office, service, and community-supportive facilities and services with retail uses and by adding public plazas and pedestrian amenities that will create people-oriented centers for living, working, and gathering. (RDR/MPSP)
LU-4.5 Grouping	Commercial
Development ®
The City shall avoid continuous "strip commercial" in new development areas by encouraging the clustering of commercial land uses in appropriate locations near transit services. New commercial development at the intersections of primary arterials and near freeway on ramps shall be designed to avoid the appearance of strip development. (RDR)
LU-4.6 Neighborhood Serving Centers ®
The City shall promote the development of strategically located (e.g., accessible to surrounding neighborhoods) mixed-use neighborhood centers that accommodate localserving commercial, employment, and
entertainment uses; provide diverse housing opportunities; are within walking distance of surrounding residents; and are efficiently served by transit. (RDR)
LU-4.7 Arterial Locations
The City shall direct higher intensity commercial development to areas along major arterials and to the intersections of major arterials and freeways. (RDR)
Mixed-use Districts & Corridors
Mixed-use development is a viable strategy to enhance community livability by locating residents close to jobs, commercial services, and transit. This form of development has emerged in West Sacramento as a desired development pattern in several areas of the city, including the Central Business District, the waterfront districts, and West Capitol Avenue. A diagram in the Urban Structure & Design Element shows the location of the city’s mixed-use districts and corridors. Policies in this section provide for the development and redevelopment of specific areas of the city into unique higher-density and intensity mixed-use districts and corridors that contribute to a more compact development pattern. These areas support surrounding neighborhoods. They focus on creating pedestrian-oriented and transit-friendly environments that are energetic and dynamic places for living, and working, and frequent gathering places for residents and visitors.

Circulation Diagram & Standards
The Circulation Diagram depicts the official classification of existing and proposed streets and roads within West Sacramento. All new roadways and roadway widening are assumed to be constructed to a width adequate to serve the projected traffic volumes and support multi-modal travel. The following paragraphs define the various types of roadways in the classification system:
* Local Roadways are intended to serve adjacent properties only. They carry very little, if any, through-traffic, and generally carry very low traffic volumes. While normally discontinuous in alignment, many of West Sacramento's local roadways are laid out in a grid system, making through travel possible, but not desirable. Speed limits on local roadways normally do not exceed 25 miles per hour. Transit bus service is not typically provide on Local Roadways. With the low traffic volumes and low speeds, bicycles are accommodated without special lane markings or signage. Sidewalks are provided on both sides of the street. Parking is generally provided on both sides of the street? Local roadways are not depicted on the Circulation Diagram.

■ Collector Roadways are intended to "collect" traffic from local roadways and carry it to roadways higher in the street classification hierarchy (e.g., arterials). Collector roadways also serve adjacent properties. They generally carry light to moderate traffic volumes on two lanes, and speed limits are typically maintained in the 25 to 35 miles per hour range. Bicycles should be accommodated by a bike lane a minimum of five feet in width (six feet in width if adjacent to on-street parking.) For pedestrian connectivity, sidewalks should be provided on both sides of the street. Onstreet parking can be provided on collector roadways. Few roads in West Sacramento can definitively be classified as collector roadways, since many local streets, in their grid layout, feed directly to arterial roads. Roadways designated as collectors on the Circulation Diagram include, among others, F Street, Michigan Blvd., Bryte Avenue, Park Blvd., Stonegate Drive, Golden Gate Drive, Oakland Bay Drive, and Higgins Road.
° Minor Arterial Roadways are fed by local and collector roads, provide intra city circulation and connection to regional roadways, and often carry heavy traffic volumes. Although their primary purpose is to move heavy volumes of traffic, minor arterial roadways often serve adjacent properties, especially in commercial areas. Speed limits on minor arterial roadways often range from 35 to 45 miles per hour. Bicycles should be accommodated by bike lanes a minimum of six feet in width, ideally with a buffer, physical or stripped, separating from adjacent vehicle traffic. For pedestrian connectivity, sidewalks should be provided on both sides of the street. Transit stops should allow for bus pullouts as to not impede the movement of vehicle traffic. Onstreet parking should not be allowed. Roadways designated as minor arterials on the Circulation Diagram include, among others, Kegle Drive, the western end of West
Capitol Avenue, and the southern end of Jefferson Blvd.
° Major Arterial Roadways are fed by local, collector, and minor arterial roadways, provide for major cross-town and regional travel, and carry larger volumes of traffic. They are divided roadways of four or six lanes with a large median area which is used for auxiliary lane purposes at intersections. There should be no direct access to adjacent properties unless no reasonable alternatives exist. Such direct access should be limited to right turn-in and right turn-out movements only. Speed limits on major arterial roadways are typically at least 40 miles per hour. Bicycles should be accommodated by bike lanes a minimum of 6 feet in width, ideally with a buffer, physical or stripped, separating from adjacent vehicle traffic. For pedestrian connectivity, sidewalks should be provided on both sides of the street. Transit stops should allow for bus pullouts as to not impede the movement of vehicle traffic. Onstreet parking should not be allowed. Roadways classified as major arterials on the Circulation Diagram include, among others, Jefferson Blvd., Harbor Blvd., Sacramento Avenue, and West Capitol Avenue.
■ Freeways/lnterstates serve intracity and intercity travel. They provide no direct access to adjacent properties, but rather are fed traffic from collector or arterial roadways through the use of access ramps and, therefore, do not have at-grade intersections. Freeways provide connections to other regional highways and are capable of carrying heavy traffic volumes. Speed limits on freeways are usually the highest allowed by law. Bicycles and pedestrians are not allowed on freeways. Capitol City Freeway (U.S. 50/Business 80) and 1-80 serve this function in West Sacramento.

Parks & Recreation Element
The City of West Sacramento seeks to provide its residents and visitors with a broad range of active and passive recreation opportunities. The Parks and Recreation Element sets the framework for an expanded park system and a greater variety of recreational activities. West Sacramento’s riverfront and natural open spaces will be linked to enhance opportunities for walking, bicycling, picnicking, participating in water sports, and appreciating natural open spaces and conservation areas. Access to a broad range of recreational activities is important to improving public health through exercise. The location of schools and their recreational facilities can serve as a focal point of neighborhood identity and activity. Parklands also help to sustain natural environmental resources by providing landscapes that absorb greenhouse gases, produce oxygen, and filter pollutants into the groundwater basin.

Safety Element
Protection from the risks of natural and man-made hazards is essential in establishing a sense of well-being for residents and important considerations in attracting new businesses to the city that will provide quality jobs. The goals and policies in this element are designed to protect and enhance public health and safety throughout the community. An emerging issue related to public health and safety is planning for the impacts of climate change. Rising levels of greenhouse gases are projected to have a variety of effects that will increase the risk of drought, flooding, forest fires, disease, and other impacts.
This Element contains the City’s greenhouse gas reduction targets and policies to respond to and adapt to the potential effects of climate change. In addition to safety issues related to hazardous conditions, the planning process should account for other issues related to community health and safety, including noise exposure. However, a major safety concern is the ongoing risk from flooding. West Sacramento depends on a comprehensive system of flood control facilities that includes levees constructed along the Sacramento River and Deep Water Channel to protect the city from 100- and 200-year flood events.
Significant progress has been made in improving the levees surrounding the city with the eventual goal of providing 200-year flood protection. All new development is required to demonstrate 200-year flood protection or to contribute in-lieu fees to making physical improvements to the existing levee system. Additionally, existing City programs in conjunction with State and Federal agencies, and supported by this General Plan, insure the continued maintenance of the levees. Vigilance must be maintained to provide continued protection to residents, businesses, and visitors, and to maintain programs and facilities that minimize flood risk.

Urban Structure & design
ELEMENT
Urban structure and design integrates diverse development concepts on many levels. From the overall city, to building and site design, to streetscape design, the goals and policies presented in this element provide for the visual pattern of land use. At the citywide level, these concepts focus on the overall structure of the city and how it connects different areas and transitions from rural areas to the city’s urban core. This Element includes general and more specific guidance for gateways and entryways and the waterfront. Finally, building, site, and streetscape design ensure that each area of the city and its buildings are unique and in harmonious.
Recognizing the interdependence, policies in the Land Use Element should be consulted when reviewing urban structure and design policies to ensure that the physical form, design, and architectural style of development and redevelopment advance the City’s desire for high-quality development.

URBAN STRUCTURE AND DESIGN ELEMENT
West Sacramento
Neighborhoods & Districts
Figure 3-1 depicts the 25 neighborhoods and districts that make up the city of West Sacramento. These areas were defined by the age of neighborhoods or districts, land use types, streets, development patterns, and logical contiguous areas. Within each area are discrete neighborhoods, commercial and mixed-use centers, industrial districts, corridors, and other community facilities and features. The following paragraphs provide a brief summary of the key characteristics desired for each of the neighborhoods and districts shown in Figure 3-1.
CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (CBD)
The Central Business District will continue to evolve into the civic and cultural center of West Sacramento. It will serve as the city’s “downtown," and lead to the “main street” commercial character of West Capitol Avenue. The CBD will be anchored by uses such as City Hall, the Turner library, the Community Center, and the Los Rios community college. In the short- to mid-term, the CBD shall be defined as the existing downtown area focused on the intersection of West Capitol Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard.
residential mixed-use neighborhoods. Each district will have retail, entertainment, shopping, restaurants, and public gathering places.
HISTORIC CITY NEIGHBORHOODS
Broderick, Bryte, Michigan/Glide, and Old West Sacramento
The historic city neighborhoods will not change significantly but will experience some redevelopment and revitalization. Most development in these areas will consist of infill on vacant lots and redevelopment of dilapidated structures.
SOUTHPORT VILLAGES
Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest
The Southport villages will continue to develop largely as planned since 2000. However, each village will have some small increases in density or new mixed-use development, providing opportunities to integrate a variety of residential uses and/or neighborhood commercial services into existing and planned neighborhoods.
WATERFRONT DISTRICTS
Washington, Bridge District, Pioneer Bluff, and Stone Lock
The Waterfront will become a series of vibrant mixed-use districts lining the Sacramento River from the Washington neighborhood in the north, through the Bridge District and Pioneer Bluff, and into Stone Lock in the south. The Waterfront districts will form the urban core of West Sacramento. They will include a mix of high-rise and mid-rise residential and office buildings near the water and dynamic

WEST CAPITOL AVENUE CORRIDOR
THE PORT
West End, West Capitol, and South of West Capitol
The West Capitol Avenue corridor east of Interstate 80 (West Capitol, South of West Capitol) will continue its transition into a “grand residential boulevard” with a residential emphasis between commercial nodes at Harbor and Jefferson Boulevards. Development will be characterized by residential uses and mixed-use (/.e., residential over retail and office). Reuse of existing underutilized buildings will preserve the area’s distinct character while reenergizing the corridor with new activity. Wide sidewalks with sidewalk cafes and pedestrian amenities will provide social gathering places. West of Interstate 80 (West End), the corridor may be identified as a special study area to help determine its longterm uses.
HISTORIC INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS
West Harbor, Michigan/Glide, and Iron Triangle
The city’s historic industrial districts will transition and transform over time. West Harbor and Michigan/Glide will retain their historic industrial uses, but may introduce supporting commercial uses. Some existing, underutilized industrial sites will also redevelop. The Iron Triangle, an industrial area located adjacent to the Central Business District and Washington neighborhood, will start to transition to an urban, residential area; however, most of the industrial uses will remain during the timeframe of this General Plan.
North of Port Industrial, Port North Terminal, Seaway, Port of Sacramento Industrial Park, and Southport Industrial Park
The Port and adjoining industrial areas will maintain their status as the industrial and shipping center of the region. Seaway will become a mixed-use employment center (business and maritime industrial and support services). Where appropriate, open space enhancements will provide additional linkages to Lake Washington and the city’s open space network.
RURAL CORE
The Rural Core, made up of open space and larger-lot single-family homes, will maintain its rural character and continue to serve as a village separator to provide clear village identity in Southport.
OTHER DISTRICTS
Riverside/CHP and Riverpoint
The Riverside/CHP area will develop as an employment center consisting of a mix of light industrial and business park uses, including research and development facilities. The area will also include employment center supporting retail sales and services, such as restaurants, fitness centers, and office services. Riverpoint is an established regional commercial center.
