Introduction
City Profile and History
Pleasant Hill is a vital, progressive, suburban residential community, dedicated to
education, supportive of business, and rich in recreational opportunities. Located in
central Contra Costa County, the city covers 8.2 square miles (including 2 square miles
of roads) and had an estimated 33,500 residents in 2002. The city is bordered to the south
by Walnut Creek, the north by Martinez and Pacheco, the east by Concord, and the west
by Lafayette.
The name Pleasant Hill derives from the Spanish “reliez” used in an 1848 survey to
describe the area. Most of the city actually lies on an alluvial plain at the eastern edge of
the Briones Hills, which rise to 1,400 feet. The local climate is characterized by cool, wet
winters and hot, dry summers. The average annual temperature is 56°F, with average
daily temperatures ranging from 45°F in January to 68°F in September.
The Bolbone and Chupacane cultures inhabited the area before settlers arrived from
Mexico in the late 1700s. In 1844, Irish immigrant William Welch became the only non-
Mexican to obtain a land grant in the region. His Rancho Las Juntas contained more than
13,000 acres, including present-day Pleasant Hill. Early residents primarily cultivated
grains such as wheat, hay and barley, which were shipped to market via Pacheco Creek.
Other transportation options emerged with the Southern Pacific Rail line in 1891 (now
the site of the Iron Horse Trail) and the Caldecott Tunnel in 1937. The first residential
subdivisions in Pleasant Hill were built in the 1920s and 1930s south of Gregory Lane
and west of Contra Costa Boulevard. The city grew significantly with new single-family
subdivisions north of Gregory Lane between 1946 and 1954. When Pleasa nt Hill
incorporated in 1961, about half of the existing buildings in the city were in place.
The opening of Interstate 680 in 1964 helped spur additional construction. Multifamily
projects built in the 1970s along Chilpancingo Parkway (named for Pleasant Hill's sister
city in Mexico) began to change the city from being exclusively a community of single-
family detached houses. Subsequent transportation improvements (including BART,
Interstate 680 widening, and Taylor Boulevard) promoted additional higher-intensity
multifamily and nonresidential development in and around Pleasant Hill. The most
significant recent developments in the city are the new downtown and multifamily
housing for seniors directly to the south.
Pleasant Hill historically has been a suburban residential community serving major
employment centers to the west and south, and the pattern of residents commuting
outside the city to work is expected to continue (the city would need 185 new jobs per
year to achieve a 1:1 ratio of jobs to housing). However, explosive regional growth in the
last decade has transformed Pleasant Hill, as evidenced by recent higher density
residential and commercial development, especially downtown. Future development is
expected to be more modest because the city is approaching buildout.
The city economy is highly dependent on service and retail employment, and its
July 2003                                      1                                     Introduction

General Plan 2003                                                                    City of Pleasant Hill
revenue-generating base is limited. Less than 10 percent of developed land is devoted to
revenue-generating commercial, office, or industrial uses. Of the roughly 200
undeveloped acres in the city, only about 5 acres are available for non-residential use.
However, several large underutilized sites have significant potential for redevelopment,
including the 19-acre Contra Costa Shopping Center (former Montgomery Ward’s Site)
east of Interstate 680, and the DVC Plaza (K-Mart) Shopping Center and other
commercial plazas along Contra Costa Boulevard.
The City provides building inspection, planning, redevelopment, police, street
construction and maintenance, and storm drainage services. Fire protection, recreation
and park, sewage collection and treatment, school and water services are provided
through special districts not subject to City control.
The first Pleasant Hill General Plan was adopted in 1962. The current General Plan was
adopted in 1990 and amended as recently as February 1999. Prior to implementation of
the 1991 Downtown Plan, the community lacked a central commercial core. The Plan
called for replacing traditional commercial development with mixed-use projects on
short blocks to promote a pedestrian atmosphere and to provide a central gathering
place for the community with trees, water, recreation places, streetscape amenities and
public art.
The New General Plan
In June 2000 the City Council contracted with a consultant team to assist with updating
the Pleasant Hill General Plan. In April 2001, the team published a Background Report
describing conditions in the city.
The report also summarized the following key planning issues raised by citizens:
          Traffic. Residents tend to associate high traffic volumes and delays with specific streets,
          and with uses such as Diablo Valley College and schools. Contra Costa Boulevard
          remains an obstacle to pedestrians.
          Schools. Excellence of public education is a high priority. Many residents desire more
          control over the Pleasant Hill schools than is afforded through the Mount Diablo Unified
          School District, which covers a much larger area.
          Housing. Home purchase is beyond the reach of about half of city residents, and rentals
          are scarce, especially units with more than two bedrooms. Rising regional housing costs
          and the lack of vacant land for new housing in the city suggest that intensive
          redevelopment, new mixed-use development, and new sites for housing will be needed.
          Citizens desire that remodeled single-family homes remain compatible with surrounding
          neighborhoods.
          Recreation and Parks. The community needs more fields, a variety of recreation
          facilities (particularly for youth activ ities), and a new senio r center.
Introduction                                           2                                        July 2003

City of Pleasant Hill                                                                  General Plan 2003
          Economic Development. Residents appear to prefer small, friendly stores that will help
          Pleasant Hill retain its small-town atmosphere. Although the city retail base is
          overshadowed by development in adjacent cities, the success of the downtown and the
          potential for new business, lodging and office uses at redevelopment sites could improve
          commercial viability and economic diversity.
          Visual Quality. Streetscape and architectural enhancements could help bring together
          otherwise separate or isolated parts of the community. A unified design theme along
          Contra Costa Boulevard and redevelopment of the Contra Costa Shopping Center (former
          Montgomery Ward’s site) could extend the downtown identity and link the east side with
          the rest of the city. Signs and amenities at city gateways could promote a distinct city
          image.
          Mangini/Delu
          Property. Home to the
          only remaining
          agricultural use in the
          city, the 25-acre property
          represents a variety of
          potential future land use
          scenarios.
          Flooding. The potential
          for serious flooding
          needs to continue to be
          addressed through                                  Mangini/Delu Property
          enforcement of federal
          regulations on development in flood-prone areas. The Federal Emergency Management
          Agency has proposed significantly increasing the size of the mapped 100-year floodplain
          in Pleasant Hill.
          Buchanan Field. Airport operations affect quality of life and safety in northeastern
          Pleasant Hill. However, residents only can participate in airport planning decisions via
          comment to the County Airport Land Use Commission.
          Diablo Valley College. Opportunities exist to improve the physical and cultural
          connections between the city and the college, perhaps through joint sponsorship of events,
          sharing of facilities, and a City-College liaison or working group.
          Other Issues. Additional issues the General Plan should address include the County
          Library, access and care for seniors, historic and cultural preservation, and downtown
          outdoor spaces.
Following publication of the Background Report, a 19-person citizen task force
(appointed by the City Council to represent the range of perspectives in Pleasant Hill)
met almost monthly from May 2001 through May 2002 to determine how the new
General Plan should address these and other issues. The General Plan Policy Task Force
included two representatives from the City Council, two from the Planning
July 2003                                            3                                      Introduction

General Plan 2003                                                                   City of Pleasant Hill
Commission, one from the Mount Diablo Unified School District, one from Diablo
Valley Community College, one from the Pleasant Hill Recreation and Park District, one
from the Chamber of Commerce, a local high school student, a member of the Traffic
Safety Committee, a representative of the Committee on Aging, a representative of the
Citizens’ Advisory Committee on redevelopment, a representative of the Education and
Schools Advisory Committee, and three citizens appointed at large.
In addition to formulating the goals, policies and programs of the new General Plan, the
Task Force considered in detail potential land uses at five key locations in the city and
made the following recommendations for future development:
? Contra Costa Boulevard – Facilitate private redevelopment with clustered, higher quality
     retail, restaurant, convenience, and services uses.
? Contra Costa Shopping Center (former Ward’s site) – Redesignate from Commercial and
     Retail to Mixed Use with residential density and nonresidential intensity to be determined
     under a specific plan that includes both vertical and horizontal integration of uses
? DVC Plaza (K-Mart) Shopping Center – Retain neighborhood retail, and encourage college-
     related us es, such as faculty and student housing, parking, cafes, food, and books, as well as
     open space along the Contra Costa Canal.
? Mangini/Delu Property – Allow single-family housing under the current zoning.
? Former Oak Park Elementary School Site – Devote the majority to flood detention and green
     space, and allow up to 96 residential units.
Plan Organization and Content
The California Constitution allows cities to regulate land use planning, zoning,
subdivision and building on private property to promote the health, safety and welfare
of the general public. State law requires each city to prepare and adopt a
“comprehensive, long-term General Plan for the physical development” of the
community. Intended to guide local decision-making regarding future growth, the
General Plan expresses community goals about the future distribution and character of
land uses and activities, both public and private.
The plan should be comprehensive, by both covering the local jurisdiction’s entire
planning area and addressing the broad range of issues facing the community, including
physical, social, aesthetic and economic concerns. The General Plan must also be
internally consistent, bearing no policy conflicts between the elements (required and
optional). The General Plan must also be a long-term document, establishing
development policies to serve as the basis for day-to-day land use decision- making
within an approximate 20-year timeframe.
Because planning and development issues do not necessarily follow political
boundaries, the law provides for including in a city’s general plan “any land outside its

City of Pleasant Hill                                                          General Plan 2003
boundaries which, in the planning agency's judgment, bears relation to its planning.”
Therefore, this General Plan covers the incorporated area of the city and unincorporated
areas in the City's Sphere of Influence – Pacheco and the southwest hills – that could be
annexed into the city and receive City services.
The County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) establishes spheres of
influence to denote areas under County jurisdiction where a city has a shared concern
regarding land use and development. Annexation of land in the Pleasant Hill SOI is
anticipated to occur only when desired by residents of a subject area and if expected to
provide economic benefits to the City.
Each General Plan must include policies for each of the following elements:
? Land use – designating the general distribution and intensity of land uses, including
     housing, business, industry, open space, education, and public facilities.
? Circulation – identifying the general location and nature of existing and proposed
     highways, arterial and collector roadways, transit terminals, and other
     transportation facilities.
? Conservation – addressing treatment of natural and cultural resources, including
     wetlands, trees, rivers, archeological remains, and historic structures.
? Housing – assessing the current and projected housing needs of all segments of the
     community and identifying land to provide adequate housing to meet those needs.
? Noise – appraising noise sources in the community and developing ways to mitigate
     nuisances.
? Open Space – detailing techniques for preserving open space areas for natural
     resources, outdoor recreation, public health and safety, and agricultural activities.
? Safety – establishing policies to protect the community from risks associated with
     seismic, geologic, flood, fire and other hazards.
Table 1 illustrates how the required General Plan elements are organized in a framework
that reflects the focus of future planning in Pleasant Hill. In addition to the topics
required by State law, the General Plan contains a Growth Management Element to
comply with Contra Costa County Measure C (approved 1988). This additional element
establishes policies requiring adequate services to be in place prior to approval of new
development. The new General Plan also includes an Economic Strategy Element aimed
at optimizing commercial diversity and business opportunities in the city. The Housing
Element follows a slightly different format than the other elements in order to comply
with State requirements, including the provision that each program include a quantified
objective (where applicable).

Each General Plan element contains goals, policies and programs that set a course for
future land use in the city. Goals summarize how development and future growth
should be directed by identifying physical, economic and/or social ends that the
community wishes to achieve. The accompanying policies establish basic courses of
action for the Planning Commission and City Council to follow in working to achieve
the community goals. (Policies directly guide the response of elected and appointed
officials to development proposals and related community actions.) Finally, programs
are identified that will need to be implemented by City departments to carry out the
policies and achieve the goals of the General Plan.
Administering and Amending the General Plan
Once adopted, the General Plan does not remain static. State law permits up to four
General Plan amendments per mandatory element per year (Government Code
§65358[b]). Most amendments propose a change in the land use designation of a
particular property. As time goes on, the City may determine that it is also necessary
to revise portions of the text to reflect changing circumstances or philosophy.
State law provides direction on how cities can maintain the plan as a contemporary
policy guide: It requires each planning department to report annually to the City
Council on “the status of the plan and progress in its implementation” (§65400 [b]).
In addition, the City should comprehensively review the Plan every five years to
determine whether or not it is still in step with community values and conditions.
Public participation in the General Plan update, adoption and amendment process is

City of Pleasant Hill                                                            General Plan 2003
actively encouraged by the City and is always welcome. Any citizen wishing to amend
the General Plan would follow the procedure generally outlined below. (More detailed
information on processing and timing is available from the Planning Department.)
     1. Prior to filing an official application for a General Plan amendment, the
          prospective applicant or his or her agent should discuss the proposed
          amendment with the Community Development Director. This gives the
          applicant a first-hand opportunity to find out the details of the amendment
          process as well as any concerns the City may have about the proposed
          changes.
     2. Should the applicant decide to proceed with an amendment, the next step is
          to file an official application with the Planning Department and pay the
          required processing fees. All applications requesting a change in land use
          designation must be accompanied by a development plan of sufficient detail
          to ascertain the potential impacts of the proposed project on the site and the
          surrounding area. What constitutes sufficient detail is determined by the
          Community Development Director on a case-by-case basis.
     3. Environmental review in accordance with the provisions of the California
          Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is required of every General Plan
          amendment.
     4. Once an application is submitted, it will be placed on an agenda for public
          hearing before the City Planning Commission according to the schedule
          established by the Planning Commission for General Plan amendments. Prior
          to the Planning Commission hearing, the City, in accordance with State
          Government Code, will provide notice to the public of the hearing date and
          the item to be discussed. For an individual amendment, this typically
          involves a legal notice in The Contra Costa Times and/or the Pleasant Hill
          Record and a notice mailed to all property owners within 300 feet of the
          subject property. (Major amendments affecting the entire community, such as
          this update of the Plan, are noticed differently because of their scale. In such
          cases, State law provides alternative methods of notification that do not
          require notice to be mailed to individual property owners.)
          Planning Department staff will prepare a report to the Planning Commission
          for the public hearing, describing in detail the proposed amendment, any
          environmental or other impacts that may result, and comments from other
          City departments or affected governmental agencies. The staff also will state
          whether the Commission should recommend the amendment to the City
          Council for approval or denial. The staff report is sent to the Commission and
          the applicant. The staff report, comments from the applicant, and other
          public testimony become factors in the Commission’s action.
State law requires that any decision on a General Plan amendment be supported by
findings of fact. These findings provide the rationale for making a decision either to

approve or deny a future project. While specific findings may be applied on a
project-by-project basis, at least the following standard findings should be made for
each General Plan amendment:
     1. The proposed amendment is deemed to be in the public interest.
     2. The proposed General Plan amendment is consistent and compatible with the
          rest of the General Plan and any implementation programs that may be
          affected.
     3. The potential impacts of the proposed amendment have been assessed and
          have been determined not to be detrimental to the public health, safety, or
          welfare.
     4. The proposed amendment has been processed in accordance with the
          applicable provisions of CEQA.
City-initiated amendments, as well as amendments requested by other public agencies,
are subject to the same basic process and requirements described above to insure
consistency and compatibility with the Plan. This includes appropriate environmental
review, public notice, and public hearings leading to an official action by Council
resolution.

      City of Pleasant Hill                                                                           General Plan 2003
      Community Development Element
      Land Use Pattern
      Pleasant Hill is almost entirely built-out: only about 60 acres, or 1.5 percent, of land in
      the city, is available for new development. Therefore, future development is expected to
      consist primarily of reuse of existing lots.
      The new General Plan carries forward the 14 land use designations established in the
      1990 plan, except that the Multifamily Low category has been split to create a new
      Multifamily Very Low designation, and the Neighborhood Business designation has
      been added (see the attached General Plan Land Use map, adopted as part of this General
      Plan). All development and redevelopment must be consistent with these categories.
      Table CD1 shows how much land in the city falls into each designation, including vacant
      parcels. Maximum allowed density is expressed in units per net acre (which excludes
      rights-of-way) for residential uses and floor area ratio (FAR) for non-residential uses.

The General Plan designations accommodate a variety of specific land uses (which may be
permitted as of right or conditionally by the Zoning Ordinance), as follows (see Table CD1
for allowable residential densities and commercial building intensities):
         ? Single Family Low Density is intended for houses on larger lots (15,000-20,000 sq. ft.) at
            1.3-3 units per acre.
         ? Single Family Medium Density allows detached houses on lots 7,000-10,000 sq. ft. at 3.1-
            4.5 units per acre.
         ? Single Family High Density designates areas for detached homes on lots as small as
            6,000 sq. ft. at 4.6-6.9 units per acre.
         ? Multifamily Very Low Density identifies areas suitable for duplexes, townhouses and
            very-small-lot single-family homes at 7-11.9 units per acre.
         ? Multifamily Low Density identifies areas suitable for duplexes, townhouses, attached
            single-family homes and mobile homes at 12-19.9units per acre.
         ? Multifamily Medium Density allows duplexes, townhouses, condominiums and mobile
            homes at 20- 29.9 units per acre.
         ? Multifamily High Density is intended for townhouses, condominiums and apartments
            at 30-40 units per acre.
         ? Commercial and Retail includes shopping centers, banks, hotels, personal services (such
            as barber shops and dry cleaners),
            entertainment and cultural venues,
            restaurants, auto sales and service,
            and ancillary offices.
         ? Neighborhood Business includes
            convenience shopping and services
            primarily to meet the needs of local
            residents.
         ? Office includes business, medical and
            professional uses, office buildings and
            office parks with ancillary commercial
            and retail uses.
         ? Mixed Use combines residential with
            retail, commercial, office and/or
            public uses with flexible parking and
            setback requirements. Individual
            Mixed Use projects are not expected to contain any specific combination of these uses,
            and the development potential of each Mixed Use site shall be determined through
            project review under the provisions of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zoning
            District.

          ? Light Industrial includes small assembly operations, warehouses, printing, and recycling
             transfer stations.
          ? Park designates existing and proposed parkland, both developed and undeveloped.
          ? Open Space is essentially unimproved land devoted to preservation of natural resources
             and outdoor recreation.
          ? Semi-public and Institutional includes utility facilities and easements, libraries, City
             offices, fire stations, churches and hospitals.
          ? School includes child day care facilities and commercial or educational athletic facilities,
             such as sports training centers.
The overall land use pattern established by existing development is anticipated to
continue through the 20-year timeframe of this General Plan. None of the Community
Development programs, nor any programs in the General Plan, are intended, nor shall
they be construed, to reduce the ‘Potential Units, Net’ specified on Table H22 or to
disallow the specific ‘Proposed General Plan Land Use’ or ‘Proposed Zoning’ changes
identified on Table H22.
Neighborhoods
Retaining the character and charm of residential neighborhoods is a top priority for
Pleasant Hill residents. Most neighborhoods are relatively isolated from commercial, retail
and office developments, with homes located on local or minor collector streets, rather
than busier arterial roadways. Residents generally are not exposed to heavy traffic and
noise, and live close to parks and elementary schools (see the Creeks and Neighborhoods
map on page 13).
Single-family neighborhoods in Pleasant Hill generally have kept their original low -
density character. However, some
areas are experiencing a transition
as older homes undergo
renovation, and many residents
are concerned that more-massive
remodeled homes are not
compatible with the modest scale
of the surrounding neighbor-
hoods. Multifamily developments,
which often provide housing to
meet the needs of the growing
senior population and families less
able to afford detached housing, generally are separated from single-family
neighborhoods.
Community Development Goal 1. Preserve and enhance residential
neighborhoods.

Community Development Policy 1A. Encourage aesthetic enhancement of residential
areas, while retaining the charm and character of individual neighborhoods.
Community Development Program 1.1. Amend the Zoning Ordinance to include design
guidelines for future residential development, redevelopment, and renovation.
Community Development Program 1.2. Continue to allow land use redesignations that increase
residential density only when 75 percent of the boundary of the area to be redesignated is adjacent
to land with the same or higher-density land use designation.
Exempt from the 75-percent rule are properties deemed by the City Council, following a
hearing and recommendation from the Planning Commission, as unsuitable for single
family residential use by virtue of noise, traffic, and proximity to nonresidential uses.
Lack of profitability from lower density development of a property (as opposed to
higher density) shall not be a factor in deeming properties unsuitable for single family
residential use: considering ‘profitability’ as a criterion is inappropriate in any and all
land use decisions. Development of the area or property to be redesignated shall not
have significant growth inducing impacts or significant traffic or noise impacts on
existing residential neighborhoods. Intensification of land use on properties larger than
40,000 square feet and not on Table H22 is presumed to have significant growth
inducing impacts unless it is shown that appropriate design and mitigations will
minimize impacts on schools, traffic and residential neighborhoods.
Community Development Goal 2. Maintain the historic balance among
different types and intensities of residential development, commercial retail,
office uses, and open space.
Community Development Policy 2A. Encourage uses needed by the community at
appropriate locations.
Community Development Program 2.1. Amend the Zoning Ordinance to direct uses desired by
the community to specific zoning districts.
Community Development Program 2.2. When making decisions regarding (1) intensification of
residential zoning or land use designations or (2) changes in land use designations from
commercial to residential, the City shall only permit such changes when the change in land use is
reasonably expected by the City Council to result in (a) effective mitigation of environmental
constraints, noise, traffic, and other hazards; (b) excellence of design; (c) compatibility with
adjacent development; and (d) at least one of the following: provision of affordable housing
pursuant to the policies in the City’s Housing Element; provision of parkland or recreation
facilities consistent with Community Development Goals 17, 18, and 19.
Community Development Program 2.3. Allow residential densities above the minimum
established for a specific land use designation only when the granting of a residential density
above the minimum for the density range established by the General Plan for that land use
category can be reasonably expected by the City Council to result in (a) effective mitigation of
environmental constraints, noise, traffic, and other hazards; (b) excellence of design; (c)
compatibility with adjacent development; and (d) at least one of the following: provision of

City of Pleasant Hill                                                          General Plan 2003
Visual Quality
Among its many provisions, the Zoning Ordinance includes measures to protect scenic
hillsides from unsightly development, and to preserve historic structures and large trees.
The Zoning Ordinance also requires approval by the City’s appointed Architectural
Review Commission for all exterior construction except remodeling of an existing
single-family home.
City architectural review is intended to ensure that construction incorporates high-
quality design, and that buildings blend with surrounding development and
environmental features. The design guidelines are not intended to limit creativity;
rather, they set minimum standards for achieving overall, practical, larger goals. The
City doesn’t seek uniformity, but does want sufficient aesthetic consistency to enhance
and reinforce the established character along particular streets, to portray an image of
what is best about Pleasant Hill, and to retain and create charm and individual character
while avoiding a sense of “sameness.”
Gateways, the primary locations where people enter
and leave the city or its distinct districts, are important
in establishing an image and identity for Pleasant Hill.
Gateways give people a sense that they have left one
place and come into another. Because they convey a
feeling of arrival and provide initial and lasting
impressions, gateways should be attractive and
identifiable. Gateways can express welcome through
architectural features, signage that emphasizes a
consistent theme, landscaping, and art. Public art
(monuments, sculptures, murals, statuary, fountains,
and other artistic installations) also can enhance a
variety of spaces accessible to the general public and
foster community interaction.                                    World War I Veterans Monument
Like gateways and key streets, scenic corridors through the city contribute significantly
to the overall image of Pleasant Hill. The County General Plan designates Reliez Valley
Road and Taylor Boulevard as scenic routes with a 50-foot setback for new
development. The City has designated additional scenic routes that have outstanding
views and sufficient right-of-way to facilitate landscaping and safely accommodate
bicyclists and pedestrians, as follows:
? Alhambra Avenue, also designated as a scenic route in Martinez;
? Grayson Road, from Reliez Valley Road to Taylor Boulevard, which connects the
     County scenic routes;
? Golf Club Road, also a City bikeway;
? Morello Avenue north of Paso Nogal Road; and
? Paso Nogal Road southwest of Morello Avenue, also a City bikeway and part of the
     regional trail system.
The City also has designated Geary Avenue, Oak Park Boulevard and Pleasant Hill
Road as scenic corridors that, though not appropriate for a development setback, merit
additional landscaping and other improvements to enhance their visual quality.

? The vital, progressive nature of the city as a suburban residential community and a
    supportive environment for business.
Community Development Goal 5. Create an attractive, integrated design
theme along Contra Costa Boulevard.
Community Development Policy 5A. Require commercial uses on Contra Costa

Public Facilities and Services
Incorporated in 1961, the City of Pleasant Hill provides a range of municipal services
through its police, building, community development, redevelopment and public works
departments. Its largest and most visible facilities include City Hall, the police
department building, the maintenance yard, more than 100 miles of roadways and about
20 miles of publicly and privately owned drain system. The Growth Management
Element establishes performance standards and related policies for public services.
The City Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for the period 2000-2006 includes about
$15 million worth of maintenance, road, building, landscaping, drainage, transportation
and other projects. Significant CIP projects include road resurfacing and striping,
pothole repair, sidewalk construction, storm drain installation and repair, utility
undergrounding, and upgrading of median landscaping.

CIP funding sources include revenues from State gasoline taxes, return-to-source
revenues from the Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA), City General Fund
and Recreation and Park Fund allocations, City fees and taxes (including traffic
mitigation fees, bedroom taxes, and storm water discharge and other development fees),
and grants from County, State and Federal programs. Grant funding requires the City to
compete with other agencies, and return-to-source revenues (which supplement City
transportation improvements and programs) require the City to fund road projects at
levels set by CCTA.
Fire Protection and Emergency Response
The Contra Costa County Consolidated Fire Protection District maintains its
headquarters and communications center at 2010 Geary Road in Pleasant Hill. The Fire
District also operates two fire stations in the city: Station 2 adjacent to headquarters and
Station 5 at 205 Boyd Road. The Fire District has purchased land and prepared plans for
a third station is at Devon Avenue near Pleasant Hill Road.

The communications center employs a manager and 14 dispatchers. Each existing station
employs nine firefighters, working three at a time on three shifts, with one paramedic on
duty at all times. Each station houses one engine with advanced life support equipment
that can typically respond anywhere in the city within four minutes. (The District
standard for maximum allowable response time is five minutes.) Portions of the
unincorporated county served from Stations 2 and 5 include homes that can’t qualify for
fire insurance because of necessarily longer response times.
Police
The Pleasant Hill Police Department employs 40 officers, 20 civilian employees and 12
volunteer reserve officers. The department utilizes updated equipment, including a
computer aided dispatch system, mobile data terminals in each patrol car linked to the
department computer system, and fingerprint and mug-shot technology.
Due to the high volume of commuter traffic on Pleasant Hill streets, traffic enforcement
is a high priority, and the department offers driver education programs. Officers inspect
child safety restraint devices and instruct parents on how to use them properly. They
also provide input to City staff and the Traffic Safety Committee about education,
engineering, and enforcement issues.
The department practices and encourages community oriented policing, including
through school resource and youth services programs. In addition to monitoring
campuses to deter truancy, the school resource officer acts as a community problem
solver and troubleshooter, meeting with neighborhood groups and local leaders and
assisting with issues involving graffiti, the homeless, hate crimes, and gangs. The youth
services bureau addresses problems such as suicide, runaways, child abuse, drug use
and shoplifting. A major goal of the program is to get juvenile offenders to take
responsibility for their behavior. Depending on the circumstances, a youth may be
required to compensate for damage or loss, perform community service work, write an
essay, attend a workshop and/or participate in counseling.
Community Development Goal 10. Provide high-quality police, fire and
emergency medical response and services.
Community Development Policy 10A. Establish secondary emergency access routes for
all areas of the city currently lacking dual access.
Community Development Policy 10B. Meet City-adopted emergency response time and
efficiency objectives.
Community Development Program 10.1. Improve City streets where necessary to accommodate
emergency vehicles.
Community Development Program 10.2. Work with non-City agencies (including through
mutual aid agreements where appropriate), and provide required funding for City services, to
maintain necessary emergency personnel staffing levels, and to build additional emergency
service facilities and infrastructure as necessary.

Water Supply
The primary source of water for Pleasant Hill is the surface water of the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta, transported via the Contra Costa Canal (built by the U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation in the 1940s). The Contra Costa Water District (CCWD) treats this water
and provides it directly to the area of Pleasant Hill generally east of Pleasant Hill Road.
CCWD also sells untreated water to the City of Martinez, which treats and provides
water to about 200 properties east of Alhambra Avenue, from Shetland Drive to Devon
Avenue. The East Bay Municipal Utility District provides water west of Pleasant Hill
Road. The water purveyors can also draw groundwater from wells or surface water
from their own reservoirs or the Sacramento or San Joaquin Rivers to supplement
supplies. The independent Diablo Vista Water District serves the Poet's Corner area with
water from the Contra Costa Canal (see the Water Districts map on page 19).
CCWD installed most of the water
system in its service area, though it
also includes facilities constructed
by the Gregory Gardens Water
System before it was purchased by
CCWD in 1978. In the late 1990s,
CCWD constructed a new water
system to serve the downtown
redevelopment area and replaced
several water mains and a 24-inch
transmission main in the canal right
of way. These enhancements have
increased water pressure and flows.

Wastewater
The Central Contra Costa Sanitary
District collects and disposes of Pleasant Hill wastewater, which is treated at a facility in
an unincorporated area adjacent to Martinez. The plant has adequate capacity to
accommodate anticipated growth projected in Pleasant Hill. (Average dry weather flow
for the 165-square mile district in 1999 was 39.6 million gallons per day [mgd], 88
percent of the amount allowed under the current National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System permit.)
The District has applied to the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board
to increase its effluent discharge limit to 53.8 mgd to accommodate planned growth of
111,000 people in the service area over the next 35 years. The increase also would
accommodate worst-case scenarios for groundwater infiltration, which can significantly
raise flow during summer months of high rainfall years (when groundwater
accumulation reaches its peak).
Based on its latest evaluation of treatment plant capacity, the District projects that 53.8
mgd can be discharged without constructing additional treatment facilities (based on
consumption of 225 gallons per day [gpd] per dwelling unit and 1,000 gpd for non-
residential uses). District collection system and treatment master plans identify facility

improvements necessary to maintain service at or above this level, which are prioritized
and scheduled for implementation in an annually updated Capital Improvement Budget
and 10-year Capital Improvement Program.
Community Development Goal 11. Ensure adequacy of water supply, sewage
disposal, and solid waste services.
Community Development Policy 11A. Ensure that basic services are provided to
proposed development, and that the provision of those services does not jeopardize
service to existing uses.
Community Development Program 11.1. Consult with water providers and the Sanitary District
prior to approving development.
Community Development Program 11.2. Continue to improve on recycling efforts, with the goal
of attaining the mandated 50 percent diversion rate.
Schools
Schools are an important part of the community’s image and contribute to local pride.
Census 2000 reported that 8,676 city residents over the age of 3 were enrolled in schools,
both public and private, ranging from preschool to vocational and graduate school. Of
those students, 3,587 attended grades K-8 (public and private), and 1,462 were in high
school (public and private).

districts in the state, with more than 56 school sites and programs. The District's
statistics for ethnic/racial diversity, average class size, test scores, numbers of “limited
English proficient” students and the primary languages they represent, mirror those for
the State as a whole. Table CD2 shows current enrollment at Pleasant Hill public schools.
If it can be determined that there is a long term need, the City is prepared to cooperate
with the School District in planning for another high school.

the long-term residency of the County Central Library in the city, and to site and plan a new
state-of-the-art facility in Pleasant Hill.
Community Programs
The City has identified a need for additional and upgraded community-oriented
facilities and programs. Existing facilities for senior citizens in particular are outdated
and operating well beyond capacity.

and sites (e.g., July 4th, Veterans’ Day), and promote and accommodate new ones (e.g., farmers
market, street fairs, summer concerts) that promote community character and civic pride.
Recreation, Parks, Open Space
The City has adopted a standard of 3 acres of developed parkland for each 1,000
July 2003                                         25                          Community Development

General Plan 2003                                                              City of Pleasant Hill
residents, which would require 100 acres for the estimated current estimated population
of 33,500). The Pleasant Hill Recreation and Park District maintains 203.5 acres of
parkland and open space in the city (with 68.0 developed acres), including the portion of
the Contra Costa Canal Trail that runs through Pleasant Hill (see Table CD3).
Recreation facilities at public schools account for another 57.4 acres that qualify as
“developed,” with landscaping, playing fields, lights and/or buildings. Private open
space and other common areas in subdivisions include another 130 acres.
The Recreation and Park District is independent of the City government. It was
established in 1951 (ten years before City incorporation) and encompasses about 20
percent more households than does the City (District lands total 269 acres).
The District also operates the following facilities in Pleasant Hill:
?   Administration Office and Teen Center, 147 Gregory Lane
?   Community Center, 320 Civic Drive
?   Senior Center, 233 Gregory Lane
?   Winslow Center (for arts and crafts), 2590 Pleasant Hill Road
?   Park Maintenance office, 310 Civic Drive
?   Gregory Gardens KidStop, 200 Harriet Drive
?   The School House, 2050 Oak Park Boulevard
?   Rodgers Ranch Historical Site, 315 Cortsen Road
The District also offers swimming and lighted softball and tennis programs at College
Park High School and a variety of after-school programs at the pool, gymnasium, fields
and tennis courts at the Pleasant Hill Education Center.
Many of the Recreation and Park District buildings (which total 60,000 square feet) are
available for rent for special events, and community garden plots can be leased annually
at Pleasant Hill Park. Concerts are held regularly at the Community Center. The District
also co-sponsors a number of
local athletic and educational
groups and clubs.
About 100,000 people visit
District facilities, participate in its
2,100 educational and recreational
programs and/or volunteer
annually, including about 40,000
paid registrants (at an average of
about $50 per person). The
District estimates that
participation in paid activities is                         Pleasant Hill Park
increasing about 18 percent per
year, and that its combined programs run at about 85 percent capacity, with some – such
as KidStop, aquatics and the Senior Center – at or near capacity.

Natural Resources
Undeveloped hillsides and other open spaces in
Pleasant Hill support pockets of grassland, oak
woodland and shrubland-chaparral habitat. The city
also contains a variety of plants and trees that
provide additional cover and food for animals. This
“urban habitat” includes residential and commercial
landscaping and streetscape plantings. Rodents,
small mammals, and birds utilize trees and
vegetated areas for foraging and nesting.
Even though the watercourses in Pleasant Hill are largely channelized, creek corridors
include wetlands and riparian vegetation that also provide habitat for birds and
terrestrial species, plus frogs and other amphibians. The remaining wetlands in the city
also are important for recharge and filtering of water supplies.
The City Zoning Ordinance protects trees, as measured 24 inches above the ground, as
follows: (1) native oaks and other indigenous trees one foot or more in diameter, and (2)
non-native trees (primarily eucalyptus and redwood) two feet or more in diameter.
Protected species include native oak, alder, bay/laurel, black walnut, buckeye,
elderberry, madrone, maple and sycamore trees.
Community Development Goal 20. Preserve open space areas, hillsides and
natural features.
Community Development Policy 20A. Ensure that open space and undeveloped
hillsides remain free of future development.
Community Development Program 20.1. Establish a land acquisition fund in the CIP to acquire
significant open space and undeveloped hillside areas that may be threatened by development.
Community Development Program 20.2. Amend the Zoning Ordinance to establish reasonable
aesthetic and land coverage constraints on new land divisions in open space and undeveloped
hillside areas.
Community Development Goal 21. Preserve and reclaim streams, wetlands
and riparian areas to function as open space.
Community Development Policy 21A. Require reclamation of degraded streams,
wetlands and riparian areas, including wildlife migration corridors, where possible in
cooperation with the Flood Control District.
Community Development Program 21.1. Establish guidelines for preserving and reclaiming
streams, wetland s and riparian areas in conjunction with new or modified development.
Community Development Program 21.2. Comply with directives from environmental regulatory
authorities to update the Zoning Ordinance and other ordinances, standards and regulations to
July 2003                                       29                          Community Development

incorporate stormwater quality and watershed protection measures to limit impacts to aquatic
ecosystems and preserve and restore the beneficial uses of natural water bodies and wetlands in
the city.
Community Development Program 21.3. For new development, consider alternatives to
impermeable surfaces that will promote gradual infiltration of precipitation.
Community Development Goal 22. Protect native species and their habitat.
Community Development Policy 22A. Minimize the impacts of development on plants
and animals, including sensitive habitat and migration corridors.
Community Development Program 22.1. Require mitigation for potential environmental impacts
of development on native species and their habitat, including migration corridors.
Community Development Program 22.2. Require construction activities to avoid disturbance to
natural features, including wildlife migration corridors, as much as possible.
Community Development Program 22.3. Continue to enforce the tree protection provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance.
Community Development Program 22.4. In areas of documented occurrence of the California
Tiger Salamander, require site-specific study and mitigation of potential impact, which may
include avoidance of habitat, reduction of habitat disturbance, and offsite or onsite restoration or
protection of similar habitat.
Community Development Program 22.5. Support efforts of the County to determine the
feasibility of constructing fish bypass facilities for flood control drop structures in area creeks.
                       Conservation and Energy
                       The City seeks to encourage conservation through responsible
                       approaches to energy consumption and use of resources.
                       Appropriate building design and recycling are the two primary
                       means of reducing overall consumption of resources.
                       The predominance of sunny conditions in Pleasant Hill offers city
                       residents and businesses ample opportunity to utilize solar energy.
                       New development and remodels can increase energy efficiency
                       through architecture that includes active solar components and/or
                       optimizes passive solar orientation.
                       Appropriate use of insulation, weatherization, construction materials,

                       improve energy efficiency. Deciduous trees planted around buildings
                       can provide shade in the summer to reduce the need for artificial
                       cooling, but still allow solar gain in the winter. The City Architectural

Pleasant Hill Bayshore Disposal provides recycling containers and service to residences
and business in the city as part of regular trash pick-up service. The Central Contra
Costa Sanitary District provides recycled water in Pleasant Hill for landscaping
irrigation at the Contra Costa Country Club, schools, parks, playgrounds, medians and
playing fields, and for dust control and industrial uses. A recently constructed 24-inch
pipeline serves as the main recycled water supply line and will ultimately deliver 1.5
million gallons per day of recycled water to Pleasant Hill. The East Bay Municipal
Utilities District Lamorinda Project is expected to make additional recycled water
available for irrigation, and the City proposes to adopt a Recycled Water Ordinance.
The City also seeks to avoid power outages and improve aesthetics by undergrounding
utilities when and where feasible.

  Cultural and Historic Resources
  The Zoning Ordinance includes overlay districts intended to protect and enhance
  historical and cultural resources, including by guiding development around them. The
  historic overlay district has been applied only to the Rodgers Ranch. Built in 1868, the
  Rodgers House and Barn are the oldest remaining structures in Pleasant Hill and the
  only ones in the city listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Although other
  structures in Pleasant Hill have potential historical significance (see Table CD4), there are
  no State Historical Landmarks in the city.

Economic Strategy Element
Commercial Uses
More than half of the over-4 million square feet of commercial development in Pleasant
Hill is devoted to retail use (see Table CD1). About 20 percent is in office use, while less
than 10 percent (325,000 square feet) is services. However, the primary job base in
Pleasant Hill is the service sector, which grew by more than 1,000 jobs in the 1990s, the
largest increase for any industry segment in the city.
Most retail stores in Pleasant Hill are located either in neighborhood shopping centers,
along Contra Costa Boulevard, or downtown (the largest retail concentration in the city
with 350,000 square feet). Centers along Contra Costa Boulevard typically mix retail uses
(such as auto parts, convenience, and hardware stores) with fast food and chain
restaurants in older buildings surrounded by parking. Several shopping centers in the
city are anchored by major supermarkets and drug stores.
Annual taxable retail sales in Pleasant Hill rose almost 40 percent during the 1990s (from
$356 million to $494 million). Major contributors to the increase include apparel, home
furnishing, appliance, office supply, and large discount stores. With the opening of
downtown stores in 2000, this trend is expected to continue.

The roughly 1 million square feet of rentable office space in Pleasant Hill represents
about 3 percent of total office development in the Interstate 680/Contra Costa County
market, which stretches from Antioch to Pleasanton (see Table ES1). With an overall
vacancy rate below 2 percent, the Interstate 680/Contra Costa office market is generally
perceived as strong and one of the most cost-effective in the Bay Area. The relatively
high office vacancy rate in the city during late 2000 reflected the small inventory base
and trends in the high-tech industry.

About 3 million square feet of office space is under construction in the Interstate
680/Contra Costa County area, mostly in the Tri-Valley area (86 percent). Almost
200,000-square foot of office/retail development is under construction near the Pleasant
Hill BART Station, but office space in the city is not expected to increase without
redevelopment of existing sites.

Central Contra Costa County has about 2,000 hotel rooms, with occupancy ranging from
about 75 percent at full-service hotels to about 90 percent for extended-stay and limited
service facilities. Pleasant Hill has four hotels and motels (all located near Interstate 680)
with a total of 409 rooms, and a fifth is under construction with 142 rooms. The two
extended stay facilities in the city account for 60 percent of available rooms.
Economic Opportunities
About 5 acres of vacant land and 60 acres of underutilized sites are available for
commercial development in Pleasant Hill. At a floor area ratio of 0.3 (a realistic average
for current nonresidential development), these sites could accommodate about 750,000
square feet of new business space.
Table ES2 projects a $100 million net sales expenditure potential by 2020 for apparel,
food, and eating and drinking, which could support 143,000 square feet of new retail
space in the city. (Estimated sales for other retail uses exceed the projected expenditure
potential of city residents, indicating no residual potential: these businesses are

      1 Average 1999 State per capita expenditure, adjusted to reflect Pleasant Hill income and 3 percent
      inflation
      2 2020 sales targets adjusted at 3 percent/year for inflation
      3 Adjusted to reflect 30 percent taxable sales
     Notes: The base year used in the ES2 table for Retail Sales is 2000. The figures in column three (‘2000
     Retail Sales’) represent the actual sales estimated to have transacted in the listed categories (Apparel,
     General Merchandise, Home Furnishings, Appliance, Other Retail, Food, and Eating and Drinking)
     within Pleasant Hill in 2000.
     The figures in the second column represent the ‘2020 Potential’ – the estimated future ‘buying power’ of
     Pleasant Hill residents.
     Typically in a retail analysis, these two sets of figures are compared to determine whether there is retail
     sales ‘leakage’ (where retail dollars are leaving the community because its residents are shopping at
     stores outside the city) or ‘capture’ (where retail stores within the community are able to attract spending
     from nonresidents of the city). Where Retail Potential exceeds Retail Sales, there is a ‘leakage’ of sales
     dollars; where Retail Potential is lower than Retail Sales, there is a ‘capture’ of retail sales dollars. Thus,
     in the case of Pleasant Hill, the estimated 2020 Retail Potential of the residents is lower than the
     estimated 2020 Retail Sales for the categories of General Merchandise, Home Furnishings and Other
     Retail. This is a positive finding that implies that the City will be able to capture sales dollars in those
     three categories from nonresidents such as employees, visitors and residents of other communities, and
     can therefore encourage the construction of additional square footage in those categories.
 Based on land availability, about 2,500 new office jobs are projected in Pleasant Hill by
 2020, mostly in services, but also in manufacturing (including high-tech), wholesale, and
 finance, insurance and real estate (see Table ES3). About 630,000 square feet of offices (2
 or 3 buildings) would be required to accommodate these jobs (at 4 employees per 1000
 square feet). A portion of this demand may be met by office development already
 planned for downtown and the BART Station area. There is a strong preference for

Demand for full-service hotels is expected to increase by about 2,300 rooms in central
Contra Costa County by 2020. Although Pleasant Hill had only one 135-room full-service
hotel in 2002, pending proposals for more than 400 new extended-stay suites in the city
and the BART Station area could reduce development potential for full-service lodging.
Services are expected to continue to be the mainstay of the city economy: ABAG
forecasts a 26 percent increase in service jobs by 2020. The fastest growing services are
projected to be business, health, and engineering and management. Other potential
service niches the city can target for future employment opportunities include high-tech
and telecommunications, local government, education, transportation, construction,
utilities, and finance, insurance, real estate. With only 4,200 retail jobs in Pleasant Hill,
this sector could also expand, particularly given unmet demand for apparel, food, and
eating and drinking.
The city is well suited for concentration of service, retail and other jobs due to proximity
to major employment centers, freeway and transit accessibility, relatively affordable
housing and office space, a balance of urban and semi-suburban amenities, and high
quality of life. There already is a concentration of major public sector employers in the
city, including Diablo Valley College, the Mount Diablo Unified School District and the
Contra Costa County Office of Education.

Circulation Element
Street Network
The policies in this element are intended to ensure the safety of persons using the city
circulation system and to maintain compatibility between that system and the land uses
it serves. Local streets that provide direct access to homes and other fronting properties
comprise the majority of streets in Pleasant Hill.
Rapid growth has produced heavy travel demand on streets and highways throughout
Contra Costa County. Pleasant Hill is located on Interstate 680, the only north-south
freeway in the County, which carries more than 250,000 vehicles per day through the
city. Interchange improvements in the late 1990s helped improve access between
Interstate 680 and Contra Costa Boulevard, the busiest north-south street in the city.
In general, the city street system operates efficiently without significant delays. Table C1
and the Circulation System map on page 43 show major streets (arterials and collectors)
in Pleasant Hill and average daily traffic in 2000. Traffic volumes are highest on
boulevards such as Contra Costa, Taylor, Monument, and Treat that accommodate
through traffic, serve concentrated commercial development, and provide access to
Interstate 680. Other through streets such as Buskirk Avenue and Pleasant Hill Road
(north of Taylor) also carry high traffic volumes.
Arterials are intended to carry traffic between areas of the city, direct service to major
traffic generators, and connect to the freeway system. Arterials also often provide direct
access to parcels, although medians commonly restrict left turn options. Arterials, which
typically carry more than 10,000 vehicles a day at speeds of 30-40 mph, include:
Buskirk Avenue – north-south arterial with signals at Coggins Drive and Monument Boulevard.
Buskirk serves a variety of residential and nonresidential uses and is often utilized by through
traffic traveling south from Monument Boulevard to the BART station and destinations in
Walnut Creek and Concord.
Chilpancingo Parkway – arterial from a signalized intersection at Contra Costa Boulevard west
to Martinez. With a full interchange at Interstate 680, the Parkway attracts through traffic and
provides access to Diablo Valley College via Old Quarry Road. Chilpancingo Parkway also serves
adjacent commercial and medium-density multifamily residential development. The eastern
extension of this parkway is Concord Avenue, a major access route to downtown Concord.
Contra Costa Boulevard – major north-south arterial traversing the city parallel to Interstate 680
with freeway access:
? Southbound near Chilpancingo Parkway/Concord Avenue
? Southbound at Gregory Lane off-ramp
? Southbound and northbound at Monument Boulevard
? Northbound (off-ramp) and southbound (on-ramp) near Boyd Road
Contra Costa Boulevard serves much of the city’s commercial and business development, as well
as Diablo Valley College (via Viking Drive and Golf Club Road). Intersections are signalized at
Chilpancingo Parkway, Golf Club Road, Viking Drive, Taylor Boulevard, Ellinwood Drive,

regional through-traffic to the Treat Boulevard/Interstate 680 interchange and the Pleasant Hill
BART Station in the unincorporated County, and directly accesses residences.
Gregory Lane – arterial west from Contra Costa Boulevard to Pleasant Hill Road, with signalized
intersections at Contra Costa Boulevard, Cleaveland Road, Moiso Lane Helen Road and Pleasant
Hill Road. West of Pleasant Hill Road, Gregory Lane becomes Grayson Road, a two-lane collector
west to Reliez Valley Road, with a signalized intersection at Taylor Boulevard This corridor
serves east-west through-traffic, as well as residential, church, retail and office uses.
Golf Club Road – four-lane divided arterial west from Contra Costa Boulevard to Paso Nogal
Road, with signalized intersections at Contra Costa Boulevard and Old Quarry Road; two-lane
road west to terminus at Contra Costa Country Club. Golf Club Road also provides access to
residential uses, Diablo Valley College, and several small retail centers.
Monument Boulevard/Crescent Plaza – arterial east from Contra Costa Boulevard into Concord.
Intersections at Contra Costa Boulevard and Buskirk Avenue are signalized, and an interchange
at Interstate 680 serves through-traffic between the freeway and Concord. Most of the south side
of Monument Boulevard is developed with commercial land uses east of Interstate 680.
Oak Park Boulevard – east-west arterial from Pleasant Hill Road to Interstate 680, where it
becomes Coggins Drive, a collector serving the Pleasant Hill BART Station area. These streets
accommodate regional through-travel and local residential and commercial access, with key
intersections at Pleasant Hill Road (stop-sign controlled), and Putnam Boulevard, Monticello
Avenue Pleasant Valley Drive, Contra Costa Boulevard and Buskirk Avenue (signalized).
Pleasant Hill Road/Alhambra Avenue – arterial through the city (though a collector between
Oak Park Boulevard and Gregory Lane) with a stop sign at Oak Park Boulevard and signals at
Paso Nogal Road, Taylor Boulevard, Gregory Lane, Devon Avenue, Strand Avenue and Geary
Road. Pleasant Hill Road/Alhambra Avenue also provides local access to adjacent residential
areas and a school.

Level of Service
Level of Service (LOS) describes the relative ease or congestion of traffic movement (see
Table C2 ) with ratings from A (free flow conditions with little or no delay) to F (jammed
conditions with excessive delays and long back-ups on major streets in the City). Table
C3 summarizes LOS for 10 key intersections in the city, based on traffic counts collected
in January and February 2001 and on methodology adopted by the Contra Costa
Transportation Authority.
                         Table C2. Intersection Level of Service Definitions
 LOS        Delay Period                                          Description
   A          0 - 5 seconds     Free/Insignificant Delay: No approach area is fully utilized by traffic.
   B               5 - 15       Stable Operation/Minimal Delay: An approach area may be fully utilized.
                                Some drivers feel restricted.
   C              15 - 25       Stable Operation/Acceptable Delay: Approach areas are fully utilized.
                                Most drivers feel restricted.
   D              25 - 40       Approaching Unstable/Tolerable Delay: Drivers may have to wait through more
                                than one red signal. Queues may develop but dissipate rapidly.
   E              40 - 60       Unstable Operation/Significant Delay: Volumes at or near capacity.
                                Vehicles may wait through several signal cycles. Long queues form.
   F                > 60        Forced Flow/Excessive Delay: Jammed conditions. Intersection operates below
                                capacity with low volumes. Queues may block upstream intersections.

Although the Contra Costa Boulevard intersections with Chilpancingo Parkway and the
Interstate 680 ramps in the north part of the city may be congested during p.m. peak
hours, intersections in the city are projected to continue to operate at acceptable levels
(LOS D or better) throughout the 20-year timeframe of the General Plan (also see the
LOS discussion in the Growth Management Element). Roadway improvements that may
need to be provided by private developers to ensure future acceptability of service levels

include:
? widening and realigning Buskirk Avenue and adding traffic signals at its
     intersections with Hookston Road and/or Mayhew Way to accommodate
     redevelopment of the Contra Costa Shopping Center (which could increase traffic by
     10-15 percent along Buskirk Avenue south of Monument Boulevard);
? widening Contra Costa Boulevard at Gregory Garden Shopping Center; and
? adding a traffic signal on Pleasant Hill Road in conjunction with additional
     development of the Mangini/Delu property.
Due to high volumes, complex configurations and freeway access, the intersections in
the city with the highest accident frequency are:
? Contra Costa Boulevard/Chilpancingo Parkway/Concord Avenue;
? Monument Boulevard/Buskirk Avenue/Ramona Drive/Lisa Lane;
? Contra Costa Boulevard/Gregory Lane; and
? Contra Costa Boulevard/Monument Boulevard.
A February 2001 study of peak hour (4-6 p.m.) traffic on Contra Costa Boulevard
indicates:
? It takes about 12 minutes to drive north from Oak Park Boulevard to Chilpancingo
     Parkway (about half spent at signals) and 10 minutes to drive south from
     Chilpancingo Parkway to Oak Park Boulevard (about one-third spent at signals).
? Average free-flow speed is about 31 mph northbound and about 28 mph
     southbound, while average overall speed (including stops) is about 16 mph
     northbound and 19 mph southbound.
Viking Drive and Boyd Road experience substantial congestion associated with morning
school-related traffic. Viking Drive provides access to Valley View Middle School,
College Park High School and Diablo Valley College, while Boyd Road provides access
to Sequoia Elementary and Middle Schools.
Alternate Transportation
Bike routes are designated along most major and local streets in the city, as well as on
trails along the Contra Costa Canal, the East Bay Municipal Utility District right-of-way
and the railroad tracks (“Iron Horse” trail; see the Circulation System map). The routes
link destinations in the city to each other and to the County bikeway system to
accommodate both work and recreation-related trips. Pedestrian access also exists on
bicycle off road routes.
County Connection provides bus service in the city and to adjacent areas (see the
Circulation System map). Public bus routes cover most major streets and serve the
Martinez AMTRAK station and the Pleasant Hill BART station for regional commuting.
BART provides a significant alternative to the automobile for work-related trips from
Pleasant Hill to the East Bay and San Francisco. BART is expanding its service to South
San Francisco and the San Francisco International Airport. The Pleasant Hill Station has
about 3,000 parking spaces.

Growth Management Element
Introduction
This element establishes standards for traffic levels of service, and for fire, police, park,
school, water, sewage disposal and flood control services. It meets the requirements of the
Contra Costa Transportation Improvement and Growth Management Program (Measure
C, approved 1988) by establishing a comprehensive, long-range program to match
demand for public facilities generated by new development with the plans of service
providers, capital improvement programs and development mitigation programs.
Traffic Levels of Service
The Contra Costa Transportation Authority is responsible for implementing Measure C
and State-mandated Congestion Management Program standards that must be met or
exceeded by this Growth Management Element. The State distributes a portion of gas tax
revenue to local governments that comply with the countywide Growth Management
Program, and the County allocates additional sales tax revenues to cities that participate in
programs to generate:
?   Traffic level of service standards for designated roadways;
?   Standards for public transit frequency, routing, and coordination of service;
?   Trip reduction and travel-demand measures;
?   Analysis of impacts on regional transportation systems from land use decisions made
    by local jurisdictions; and
? A capital improvement program to maintain or improve traffic levels of service and
    transit performance.
Transportation Authority funds may not be used to replace private developer funding for
transportation projects determined to be required to meet or maintain standards for new
growth.
The Community Development element sets forth policies for allocating land uses and
maintaining a circulation system that provides acceptable levels of service (LOS). The
Growth Management Element adds a concurrency requirement that specifies traffic LOS
standards that must be maintained if growth is to occur. This element differentiates
between Routes of Regional Significance, Basic Routes, and Reporting Intersections.
Routes of Regional Significance are arterials subject to Action Plans prepared by the City
in cooperation with TRANSPAC (the Regional Transportation Planning Committee for
Central Contra Costa County) and the Contra Costa Transportation Authority, as follows:
?   Interstate 680
?   Alhambra Avenue/Pleasant Hill Road north of Taylor Boulevard
?   Taylor Boulevard
?   Geary Road
?   Contra Costa Boulevard

Basic Routes are local roads not
designated as Routes of Regional
Significance. The City and the
Transportation Authority have
adopted the following standards
for signalized intersections on
Basic Routes:
? Suburban: LOS low -D (.80 -
     .84 volume-to-capacity ratio)
? Central Business District: LOS
     low-E (.90 - .94 volume-to-
     capacity ratio)
Reporting Intersections
established to ensure these
standards will continue to be met
are:
? Patterson Boulevard at Oak
     Park Boulevard
? Buskirk Road at Coggins
     Drive
? Gregory Lane at Pleasant Hill
     Road, and Cleaveland Road
? Chilpancingo Parkway at Old                              Central Business District
     Quarry Road
LOS standards are considered to be met if measurements show that intersection
operations are equal to or better than the standard, or if the City's adopted Capital
Improvement Program includes project(s) that, when constructed, will result in operations
equal to or better than the standard. Findings of Consistency with the LOS standards may
be made only if a traffic impact analysis shows that project approval is consistent with
adopted Action Plans for Routes of Regional Significance and will not result in violation of
adopted standards at any Basic Route signalized intersection, unless projects in the City's
Capital Improvement Program will result in attainment of the standards, or if Findings of
Special Circumstances (including imposition of appropriate mitigation measures) have
been adopted by the City and the Transportation Authority.
If a Basic Route signalized intersection does not meet adopted standards and amendments
to existing City programs to achieve compliance are not feasible, the City may request that
the Transportation Authority make Findings of Special Circumstances. The Request must
identify alternative standards and proposed mitigation measures and programs. Criteria
that may create special circumstances include:
? high proportion of through -traffic;
? inability to fund improvements required to bring a facility into compliance;

? impacts to environment or neighborhood character in conflict with General Plan
    policies; and
? conflict with economic development or other policies included in the General Plan.
The funds allocated to the City by the Transportation Authority may be used for projects
designed to:
 ?   meet or maintain traffic levels of service standards;
 ?   maintain and improve the existing street system;
 ?   ensure General Plan and Transportation Authority compliance requirements are met;
 ?   implement Action Plans for Regional Routes; and/or
 ?   provide mitigation for intersections subject to Findings of Special Circumstances.
Growth Management Goal 1. Continue allocating land uses in a manner that
sustains acceptable circulation levels of service.
Growth Management Policy 1A. Designate Routes of Regional Significance in
cooperation with the Transportation Authority and TRANSPAC.
Growth Management Program 1.1. Continue to work with the Transportation Authority and
TRANSPAC to develop Action Plans for Routes of Regional Significance.
Growth Management Program 1.2. For all Basic Routes, continue to apply the standards for
signalized intersections adopted by the City and the Transportation Authority, unless the City
and the Transportation Authority make findings of special circumstances.
Growth Management Program 1.3. Conduct traffic impact studies consistent with the Technical
Guidelines published by the Transportation Authority as part of the application review process for
development projects estimated to generate more than 100 peak-hour vehicle trips.
Growth Management Program 1.4. If Measure C is allowed to sunset, reevaluate the adequacy of
General Plan projects in addressing traffic and public service impacts associated with new
development, and perform a new environmental analysis that accounts for the absence of Measure
C provisions.
Growth Management Program 1.5. Only approve projects expected to generate more than 100
peak-hour trips in the peak direction when the City or RDA has made Findings of Consistency with
the adopted LOS standards.
Growth Management Program 1.6. Continue to require developers to pay costs necessary to
mitigate impacts of their projects on the local and regional transportation system, including
establishment of trails and other alternatives to vehicle use.
Growth Management Program 1.7. Annually monitor compliance with adopted standards for the
Reporting Intersections, and submit a checklist on compliance with the Growth Management
Program to the Transportation Authority.
Growth Management                                  54                                           July 2003
City of Pleasant Hill                                                                   General Plan 2003
Growth Management Program 1.8. Amend the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Capital
Improvement Program or other relevant City plans and policies as necessary to attain the LOS
standards for Basic Route signalized intersections.
Growth Management Program 1.9. Participate in multi-jurisdictional transportation planning
through TRANSPAC activities, including planning for intersections subject to Findings of Special
Circumstances located in other jurisdictions when it is believed that the City's actions contribute to
conditions at such intersections.
Growth Management Program 1.10. Participate in the Transportation Authority's conflict
resolution process as needed to resolve disputes related to preparation and implementation of Action
Plans and other programs described in this Element.
Growth Management Program 1.11. Following adoption of Regional Route Action Plans by
TRANSPAC and the Transportation Authority, implement specified City actions in a timely
manner.
Performance Standards for Services
Because the City of Pleasant Hill is responsible for regulation of development but does not
provide all of the services needed to serve development, it must check with service
providers to determine the adequacy of services before approving a development
proposal. Performance standards measure the adequacy of a facility or service an agency
commits to provide or deliver. In addition to specifying traffic level of service standards,
Measure C requires each jurisdiction to establish standards for parks, fire and police
protection, sanitary facilities, water, and flood control.
The City has adopted the following performance standards for these services, plus
schools:
          Water Supply – verification from water authorities that adequate water quality,
          quantity and distribution can be provided. Additional reservoirs or distribution system
          improvements would be financed from the capital improvement funds for the districts,
          which are derived from water rates and connection fees.
          Sewage Disposal – verification by the Central Contra Costa Sanitary District that
          adequate collection and treatment can be provided. Capacity increases are funded by
          developer fees paid to the District.
          Schools – verification by the Mt. Diablo Unified School District that adequate
          capacity is available for new residential development. School impact fees from
          developers cover part of the cost of expanding and maintaining school facilities.
          Parks and Open Space – 3 acres per 1,000 residents added are to be acquired as
          enabled by State law (Quimby Act). Land dedication or payment of in-lieu fees is a
          condition of approval of residential subdivisions. Parkland is acquired by the City and then
          transferred to the Pleasant Hill Recreation and Park District for development and maintenance.

General Plan 2003                                                                    City of Pleasant Hill
         Fire Protection – verification by the Contra Costa County Fire District that fire
         protection can be provided within a 5-minute response time. Service improvements
         are funded from a variety of sources, including developer fees and County set-aside capital
         improvement funds.
         Police – verification by the Pleasant Hill Police Department that emergency
         response can be provided within 5 minutes and that 20 minute response can be
         maintained for 95 percent of non-emergency calls. The Police Department budget is a
         City general fund expenditure.
         Storm Drainage – verification by the Contra Costa County Flood Control and
         Water Conservation District and the City Public Works Department that adequate
         storm drainage facilities exist or are funded. Storm drainage fees are collected by the
         City as a condition of development to fund drainage projects serving the city.
Growth Management Goal 2. Approve new development only after finding
that the adopted performance standards are met.
Growth Management Policy 2A. Require all new development to contribute to or
participate in the improvement of park, school, fire, police, sanitary, water and flood
control services in proportion to the demand generated by project occupants and users.
Growth Management Program 2.1. Continue to implement a development mitigation program to
ensure that new growth pays its share of the costs associated with the provision of facilities for fire,
police, park, sewage disposal, water, flood control, and school services.
Growth Management Program 2.2. Continue to approve development projects only after finding
that one or more of the following conditions are met:
? Performance standards will be maintained following project occupancy;
? The characteristics of the development project require project-specific mitigation measures to
    maintain standards, and such measures will be required of the project sponsor;
? Capital projects planned by the City or special district(s) will result in maintenance of
    standards.
Growth Management Program 2.3. Identify in the City's Capital Improvement Program those

Flooding
Storms coming off the Pacific Ocean between October and April contribute about 95
percent of the average annual precipitation of 19.5 inches in Pleasant Hill. Water
generally flows north through the city to Suisun Bay via the Grayson Creek system (see
the Creeks and Neighborhoods map on page 13).
Significant flood events have occurred numerous times in the city. After a 1958 flood, the
Contra Costa Water District used $24 million in Federal funds to construct a rectangular
concrete channel from Gregory Lane on the East Fork of Grayson Creek, and Apollo
Way on the West Fork, downstream to Viking Drive. From there downstream, the U.S.
Natural Resource Conservation Service constructed a wider, trapezoidal earthen
channel, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers subsequently heightened the adjacent
levees. These structures have the capability of carrying runoff from a 50-year storm
(which has a 2 percent chance of occurring during any year), while capacity of the
unimproved creeks south of Gregory Lane is estimated at a 10-15-year storm (as much
as a 10 percent chance of occurring any year).
During periods of moderately heavy rainfall, flooding occurs in the area between
Murderer's Creek and the East Fork of Grayson Creek. Higher intensity storms may add
flood potential near the confluence of Mangini Creek and the West Fork of Grayson
Creek. During 50-year and stronger storms, shallow flooding also may occur between
Grayson Creek and Contra Costa Boulevard, and along Walnut Creek in the Sherman
Acres and Fair Oaks neighborhoods east of Interstate 680. Storm waters tend to spill
over channels or banks and then flow along streets and across developed property.
The City Capital Improvement Program (CIP) calls for $900,000 (in 1999 dollars) in
storm drain system improvements, primarily to address localized deficiencies. The CIP
also includes construction of a detention basin to contain runoff from up to a 100-year
event (which has a one percent chance of occurring any year). City staff is working with
County and Federal agencies to obtain funding for the project, which is hoped to
eliminate the 100-year floodplain designation in Pleasant Hill.

Airport
Constructed during World War II, Buchanan Field has been operating since 1946 as a
public-use airport on unincorporated land under County control. From the 1970s until
the mid-1990s, scheduled commercial flights served destinations in southern California.
Annual airport operations in 1999 consisted of 232,939 flights, compared to a high of
353,926 in 1978. The 592 aircraft based at Buchanan Field in October 2000 included 17
jets, 28 helicopters, 46 multi-engine, and 501 single-engine planes. Airport operations are
governed by a 1990 County master plan. (For a discussion of airport-related noise issues,
see the Noise section beginning on page 60.)

According to the 2000 Contra Costa County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, State
law identifies local general plans as the primary mechanism for implementing airport
compatibility policies. Pursuant to the Plan, the County Airport Land Use Commission
reviews planning, zoning and building regulations within the "airport influence" area,
and may review specific development proposals in that area in Pleasant Hill if the City
agrees. The airport influence area
extends about 2.5 miles from the
runways, encompassing most of
Pleasant Hill north of Boyd Road.
The Airport Plan establishes
standards for new development in
three areas (see the map at right):
? Safety Zone 2, which covers a
    part of the northwest corner of
    Chilpancingo Parkway and
    Contra Costa Boulevard,
? Safety Zone 3, which applies to
    several commercial properties at
    that intersection, and
? Safety Zone 4, which includes a
    portion of Diablo Valley College,
    adjacent neighborhoods and
    commercial uses along Contra
    Costa Boulevard.
New residential, day care and
inpatient health care uses are not        Shutt Moen Associates, 2000
allowed in Zone 2, and new
                                              Airport Safety Zones include northeastern Pleasant Hill
buildings in Zone 2 are limited to
two stories. New residential
development in Safety Zone 3 is limited to 125 persons per acre and three stories. New
buildings in Zone 4 are limited to four stories. (Buildings in Pleasant Hill, except in the
portion of the downtown area adjacent to Interstate 680 are limited to three stories by
the Zoning Ordinance.)
Safety and Noise Goal 2. Ensure that airport operations do not adversely affect
quality of life and safety.
Safety and Noise Policy 2A. Adhere to County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
development restrictions.
Safety and Noise Program 2.1. Monitor Airport Land Use Commission planning efforts, and
encourage the Airport Land Use Commission to consider the concerns of Pleasant Hill residents
in its decision-making process.

Geologic Hazards
Pleasant Hill lies mostly atop geologically
recent (Quaternary) clays and clay loams
deposited by stream activity. This
alluvium is older (Pleistocene and
Pliocene-Pleistocene) in west Pleasant
Hill, and younger (Holocene) in the
eastern area of the city where stream
activity is more prevalent. The hilly areas
of the city represent outcrops of older
volcanic and sedimentary bedrock. (The
maps at right are details of U.S.
Geological Survey maps posted at
wrgis.wr.usgs.gov/sfbay/geolist.html.)
Under the State Seismic Hazards
Mapping Act, cities must regulate
development within mapped seismic
                                                             Most of the city is underlain
hazard zones to protect the public from                        by Quaternary alluvium
the effects of strong ground shaking
caused by liquefaction, landslides and
other earthquake-related ground failure.
However, a seismic hazard map for
Pleasant Hill has not yet been produced
by the California Geological Survey
(CGS). Once such a map is adopted,
issuance of development approvals will
be subject to the outcome of detailed
geologic and geotechnical studies that
evaluate hazards and provide
appropriate mitigation measures. The
City annually updates its emergency
response plan to incorporate new
information and technology regarding
the range of potential hazards, including
from seismic activity.
There are no Alquist-Priolo earthquake
fault zones in Pleasant Hill, so the risk of
surface fault rupture is considered low.
                                                         Holocene (Qh) sediments near streams
(The Concord Fault lies about one mile                       are susceptible to liquefaction
northeast of the city, and the Calaveras
and Hayward faults pass about 7.5 miles southeast and 11 miles southwest of Pleasant
Hill, respectively.) Local faults (shown above, right) are considered to be inactive and
insignificant, including the possible ancestral trace of the Calaveras Fault that runs
north-south through the ea stern part of the city.

General Plan 2003                                                                  City of Pleasant Hill
Bedrock areas are least susceptible to damage from ground shaking and associated
ground failure, while older alluvium has moderately low damage susceptibility, and the
lowest-lying and youngest (Holocene or “Qh”) stream deposits possess moderate
damage susceptibility. The Uniform Building Code accounts for ground conditions by
including seismic factors based on recommendations by a geotechnical engineer.
A 1995 USGS summary of ground characteristics for Bay Area hillsides (including those
in Pleasant Hill) emphasizes properties that affect development engineering. USGS 1975
mapping based on aerial photos shows landslides, colluvium (slope wash and small
alluvial fans), alluvium and areas of artificial fill. CGS 1995 maps depict general
suitability of city hillside areas for development, with recommendations for detailed
geotechnical investigations in at-risk areas. (The County uses the USGS and CGS maps
to identify where site-specific geologic studies are warranted for proposed
development.)
Maps prepared for the County in the late 1980s identify areas of generally high,
moderate, and low liquefaction potential. Although high potential does not imply the
presence of liquefiable sands, the County requires rigorous evaluation of liquefaction
potential in such areas, and less comprehensive investigations in moderate areas. The
mapping tends to be conservative on the side of safety: alluvial and estuarine deposits
are included in the “high potential” category. Site-specific investigations are used to
determine if liquefiable sands are present and to provide stabilization measures where
liquefiable sands are confirmed. Although no liquefiable sands have been found in
Pleasant Hill, some have been identified near Grayson Creek just northwest of the city.
A 1977 County Soil Survey and 1995 USGS Professional Paper (#1357) provide
information on expansive soils and bedrock in Pleasant Hill. According to the most
recent CEQA Initial Study form, highly expansive soils represent potential for significant
geologic impact. Most alluvial soils (prevalent in Pleasant Hill) are considered to be
expansive. Site-specific geotechnical studies are necessary to characterize conditions on a
parcel and to provide specific criteria and standards for mitigating potential damage.
Safety and Noise Goal 3. Reduce potential harm to people and property from
geologic/seismic hazards.
Safety and Noise Policy 3A. Ensure that structures are designed and located to
withstand strong ground shaking, liquefaction and seismic settlement.
Safety and Noise Policy 3B. Avoid development in areas at risk for slope failure, and
ensure that hillside developments employ appropriate design and construction
techniques.
Safety and Noise Program 3.1. Adopt and enforce the most recently state approved building code
provisions necessary to promote seismic safety in structural designs, including regulations
relating to grading and construction relative to seismic hazards, liquefaction potential, and
development on sloping ground.

Safety and Noise Program 3.3. Continue to require slope stability assessments by appropriate
registered professionals upon the initiation of new development proposals in areas of known slope
instability and/or on slopes steeper than 15 percent.
Fire Hazards
Wildfire potential exists in the western and northwestern portions of the city due to the
presence of chaparral and grassland vegetation, especially on hillsides. The City weed
abatement program requires 15-foot fire breaks for larger parcels and removal of tall
grasses and weeds on smaller lots and within 50 feet of structures.
Safety and Noise Goal 4. Minimize the threat to people, property and the
environment from fire hazards.
Safety and Noise Policy 4A. Enhance the ability of the Fire District to respond to and
suppress fires.
Safety and Noise Policy 4B. Encourage weed abatement.
Safety and Noise Program 4.1. Assist the Fire District with training and other efforts when

Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials include industrial wastes, pesticides, herbicides, infectious waste,
radioactive materials and combustible fuels. Transport and storage of hazardous
materials pose potential public safety hazards in Pleasant Hill. Vehicle accidents
involving hazardous materials have occurred on Interstate 680, and no regulations
prevent trucks from carrying hazardous materials through the city. The County Multi-
Hazard Functional Plan identifies the role of local agencies in responding to hazardous
materials incidents (see Table SN1).

Two fuel pipelines traverse the city: one beneath Taylor Boulevard and another beneath
the Iron Horse Trail at the eastern edge of the city. Both pipelines are equipped with
pressure-sensitive valves that automatically shut off flow in the event of a break in the

Hazardous materials storage in Pleasant Hill is limited to fuels in underground tanks at
service stations and chemicals at light industrial sites. Each business storing hazardous
materials must obtain permits from the City and the Fire District, and must file with the
County Environmental Health Department a plan that establishes incident prevention
measures, handling protocols, and evacuation procedures. The proposed plans also are
reviewed by the Central Contra Costa Sanitary District, the Regional Water Quality
Control Board, and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, and are enforced by
the Fire District.
In accordance with State law, the City has adopted the County Hazardous Waste
Management Plan, which establishes siting criteria for toxic waste treatment, storage
and disposal facilities that require environmental review. The Zoning Ordinance calls
for review of such facilities to consider options to incineration and include enforceable
mitigation measures.
A May 1997 Watershed Sanitary Survey by the Contra Costa Water District assessed the
vulnerability of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to potential forms of contamination.
Contamination can come from industrial and municipal wastewater discharges, urban
runoff, highway runoff, agricultural runoff, pesticides (insecticides, herbicides,

fungicides), grazing animals, concentrated animal facilities, wild animals, mine runoff,
recreational activities, traffic accidents/spills (including cars, trucks, trains, ships and
aircraft), seawater intrusion, geologic hazards, transformers with PCBs, and solid and
hazardous waste disposal facilities.
The survey concluded that these potential sources of contamination are regularly
mitigated by the natural flushing of the delta, controls at the contamination sources,
and/or existing water treatment practices. After the completion of the Sanitary Survey,
the Los Vaqueros Reservoir was completed and filled. This reservoir provides another
means of mitigation because water can be drawn from it during dry periods when water
cannot be taken directly from the Delta.

Noise
State law requires each general plan to identify and address noise generation in the
community and establish current and projected noise levels for roadways, railroads,
airports, industrial uses, and other significant sources. Noise contours maps (on pages
61 and 62) are used as guides to establish a land use pattern that minimizes exposure of
residents to excessive noise. Noise levels are not expected to change significantly during
the 20-year timeframe of this General Plan.

the primary noise
sources affecting
Pleasant Hill residents.
Noise from Interstate
680 is mitigated with
soundwalls and/or
berms along both sides
of the freeway through
the city. The sound-
walls reduce perceived
loudness of freeway
traffic at shielded
residences by about half.                       Airport noise affects northeastern Pleasant Hill
Noise intensity is customarily measured on a decibel scale, an index of loudness.
Sounds as faint as 10 decibels are barely audible, while noise over 120 decibels can be
painful or damaging to hearing (see Table SN2). Pleasant Hill residents are frequently
exposed to noise ranging from 35 to 80 decibels.

A sound 10 decibels higher than another is perceived as about twice as loud. A five-
decibel change is readily noticeable, but a three-decibel difference is barely perceptible.
Therefore, increases in airport activity and traffic volume are not expected to produce a
significant change in perceived noise levels in Pleasant Hill: the 35 percent expected
growth in airport operations would contribute only 1.3 decibels. Likewise, it would take
more than a 25 percent increase in traffic in a specific location to generate one additional
decibel of noise.

Table SN3 shows acceptable noise levels for specific land uses established by the State
Office of Planning and Research, including normally acceptable noise limits ranging
from 60-65 decibels in residential areas. However, Zoning Ordinance section 35-16.14
establishes lower acceptable levels, including a 50-decibel maximum for residential
areas. Public Safety Section 5.1 of the Municipal Code places limits on specific noise-
producing activities (such as amplified music, vehicle exhaust and repair, and
construction), including prohibitions during night and weekend hours.

The “Ldn” label for specified noise levels indicates that sound is averaged over time to
account for the fact that passing vehicles or aircraft may cause noise to fluctuate more
than 20 decibels over a few seconds. “CNEL” refers to the fact that noise is also
averaged over a 24-hour period. CNEL assigns a 5-decibel penalty to noise between 7
p.m. and 10 p.m., and both Ldn and CNEL assign a 10-decibel penalty between 10 p.m.
and 7 a.m. (when quieter background conditions make sound more noticeable).
The State Building Code contains noise insulation standards that require an acoustical
study whenever outdoor noise levels (annualized CNEL) would exceed 60 decibels at a
proposed duplex, multifamily residence, hotel, motel or other attached dwelling. The
study must show that the proposed project design would result in interior noise levels of
45 decibels or less.

Air Quality
Motor vehicles are the main source of air pollution in and around Pleasant Hill,
producing ozone precursors and carbon monoxide. Traffic also adds to particulate
levels, though demolition and construction are the primary contributors. Wood burning
creates additional particulate matter, especially in winter when most wood is burned
and temperature inversions trap particles near the ground. Wood smoke also contributes
to ozone production, as does gasoline evaporating from service stations.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets allowable thresholds for key pollutants,
and California has adopted more stringent acceptable levels (see Table SN4).

State law requires sources emitting more than 10 tons per year of any toxic air pollutant
to estimate and report emissions to the local air district, which then requires certain
sources to submit a health risk assessment and communicate the results to the public.
Facilities required to report toxic emissions in Pleasant Hill are limited to gas stations
and dry cleaners.

Housing Element
Introduction
California planning law provides more detailed requirements for the housing element
than for any other element of the general plan. The State Legislature has found that "the
availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early attainment of
decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family is a
priority of the highest order." The housing element establishes policies for the
community to implement to ensure that all that is publicly possible is being done to
provide safe, decent housing for its current and future residents. The City of Pleasant
Hill last updated its Housing Element in 1990. In accordance with State law, this
Housing Element covers the period from January 1, 1999, through June 30, 2006 (the
other General Plan elements extend to 2025).
Article 10.6 of the California Government Code requires each city and county to analyze
housing needs and establish goals, policies, programs, and quantified objectives to meet
the identified needs. The analysis must address all economic segments of the
community, the city’s share of the regional housing need, and the housing needs of
special groups such as the elderly, disabled, homeless, large families, and single parents.
The City must either identify vacant or redevelopable sites that can provide sufficient
housing to meet these needs, or include programs in the housing element to identify
additional sites or make additional land available for housing.
The fair share of regional housing needs in the city and surrounding Sphere of Influence
is derived from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) Regional Housing
Needs Determination (RHND) of March 2001 and population and housing estimates
(Projections 2000 report), the U.S. Census Bureau, and the California Department of
Finance (the official source of demographic data for State planning and budgeting).
Public Participation
Government Code §65583(c)(6)(B) requires the City to “make a diligent effort to achieve
public participation of all economic segments of the community in the development of
the housing element.” In conjunction with the concurrent update of the City’s General
Plan, the City Council in November 2000 appointed a broad-based General Plan Policy
Task Force with citizens from different geographic areas and economic segments in the
city, financial and real estate professionals, decision-makers, and others to provide
significant policy guidance. The Task Force included two representatives from the City
Council, two from the Planning Commission, one from the Mount Diablo Unified School
District, one from Diablo Valley Community College, one from the Pleasant Hill
Recreation and Park District, one from the Chamber of Commerce, a local high school
student, a member of the Traffic Safety Committee, a representative of the Committee on
Aging, a representative of the Citizens’ Advisory Committee on redevelopment, a
representative of the Education and Schools Advisory Committee, and three citizens
appointed at large.

The Task Force met 10 times from May 2001 to May 2002 to formulate General Plan
goals, policies, and programs. Housing was discussed at all of the meetings, and
community members were given the opportunity to ask questions and recommend
changes to the draft Housing Element goals, policies, and programs. The January and
February 2002 meetings were devoted to the economics of commercial and residential
uses, with attention to five specific sites with potential for development or
redevelopment. The March meeting was devoted entirely to housing. In April 2002 the
Planning Commission held a study session on the Housing Element.
In addition to Housing Element input from the Task Force, 15 stakeholders identified by
the City as having special knowledge of the community and its land use and housing
issues were surveyed and interviewed in 2000 as part of the update of the General Plan
and Housing Element. Their comments were used to inform the initial preparation of
General Plan goals, policies, and programs, including those for the Housing Element.
The interviewees included four of the five City Council members, plus many of the
people who became Task Force members, or other representatives of their organizations
or agencies, plus a “soccer mom,” a high school student, and a local builder.
Each meeting of the Task Force and Planning Commission is videotaped and
rebroadcast, and the Housing Element is posted on the City’s web site
(http://www.ci.pleasant-hill.ca.us).
Evaluation of Previous Housing Element
The previous housing element sought to increase the proportion of affordable
multifamily units, primarily to accommodate larger families and the increasing number
of senior citizens. To a considerable extent, the City has been successful in achieving this
objective (see Table H1).
Another key objective of the previous housing element was conserving and
rehabilitating homes. In 1992 the city took a significant step toward preserving its
existing housing stock by instituting the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program, which
uses Redevelopment Agency housing set-aside funds to provide low -interest amortized
or deferred loans to very low and low income homeowners. In addition, Pleasant Hill is
continuing its participation in the County Neighborhood Preservation program, which
also extends low interest loans for rehabilitation of owner-occupied and rental housing.
The goals and policies contained in the previous housing element were appropriate to
meet the housing needs of the city. This updated element builds on that foundation,
while taking into account the fact that the city is substantially developed and few
(though significant) prospects remain to increase housing opportunities. This element
contains specific implementation programs, quantified objectives and an aggressive
below market rate housing program. Another priority of this housing element is
conservation and rehabilitation of existing homes.

Population and Employment Trends
Population
 Some U.S. Census data used in this Housing Element are from 1990; 2000 data available
in time for this update are included and specifically cited. Most projections are from
ABAG Projections 2000. Some data and estimates are from the State Department of
Finance (DOF). Both ABAG and DOF estimates differ from census data for 2000. For
example, ABAG lists city population as 33,300 compared to 32,837 in the Census, and
households as 13,450, compared to 13,753 in the Census (see Table H2).
All of the population growth in Pleasant Hill in the 1990s occurred in the second half of
the decade. (ABAG estimates indicate that the city population actually declined slightly
from 1990-1995.) From 1995-2000 the city grew almost 6 percent, an annual rate of 1.12
percent. This growth rate is expected to decrease to 0.65 percent between 2000 and 2005
and even less in later years. By 2020, the final year of current ABAG projections, Pleasant
Hill is expected to have 36,200 people living within the city limits.

An additional 5,100 people live in the Sphere of Influence (SOI), about 14 percent of the
total city-plus-SOI population. ABAG projections show no growth in the SOI population
during the next 20 years. Total population of the City plus SOI is projected to be 41,300
in 2020.
In evaluating housing needs, it is important to distinguish between the household
population (those people living in single-family homes, condominiums, apartments,
mobile homes or other housing units) and the group quarters population, those people
living in institutions such as nursing homes, dormitories, or prisons. Pleasant Hill has
only about 500 people living in group quarters (see Table H3). ABAG group quarters and
household population projections are provided for the City plus SOI only; there is no
separate tally for the city alone. Census data from 1990, however, showed 411 people
living in group quarters in the city limits, all of whom were residents of nursing homes.
The ABAG and Census data indicate that more than 98 percent of residents live in
households and less than 2 percent live in group quarters.

The minority population of Pleasant Hill represents a small but growing proportion of
the total population (see Table H4), although the percentage is significantly lower than
that in the county. Pleasant Hill experienced an increase in number of people of
Hispanic and Asian origin, as immigration from these areas to the San Francisco Bay
Area continues. Those identified by the Census as “Hispanic” climbed from 7 percent in
1990 to 8.1 percent in 2000, and “Asian” rose from 7 percent to 11.5 percent.

Households
The Census Bureau defines a household as “a person or group of persons who live in a
housing unit.” The people who make up a household do not have to be related. ABAG
estimates the number of households separately for the city and SOI. ABAG projections
show the number of households declining in the SOI while continuing to increase in the
city (see Table H5). Comparing household growth with population growth shows that
while population increased much faster than the number of households from 1995-2000,
the growth rates are expected to move closer together, and the rate of household growth

will eventually overtake population growth (see Figure H1). As a result, average
household size will eventually decline in Pleasant Hill, contrary to trends for the county
and state, where household size is expected to continue to increase. This is consistent
with projections of an increa sing proportion of elderly people, who tend to live in
smaller households.
Two-person households are the most common in Pleasant Hill. In 2000, only 6 percent
of all households had more than four persons (see Table H6). The 2000 Census also
shows that owners occupy 63.5 percent of housing units (up from 62 percent in 1990),
and the vacancy rate is 0.5 percent for ownership units and 1.4 percent for rental units.

 Employment
 The effect of employment trends on planning for housing is measured through the ratio
 of jobs to housing. If a city does not have enough units to house the workers employed
 in the city, the cost of housing is pushed up as people compete for the limited number of
 units. Workers who lose out in that competition must find housing elsewhere and
 commute to work, increasing traffic problems in and between the cities where they live
 and work.
 The jobs/housing balance can be expressed in two ways: as the ratio of jobs to
 households; or as the ratio of jobs to employed residents (see Table H7). In the Bay Area,
 there are 1.42 workers per household, so a city that has more than 1.42 jobs per
 household will have a jobs/housing imbalance. In the economy as a whole, there would
 be one employed resident for every job (ignoring unfilled jobs), so a city with more than
 one job per employed resident would also have a jobs/housing imbalance.

 Pleasant Hill currently has more housing than needed to accommodate the number of
 jobs in the city, with 1.23 jobs per household and 0.85 jobs per employed resident.
 Pleasant Hill is thus a net provider of housing for those who work in other communities.
 The jobs/housing ratio is expected to remain stable throughout the period covered by
 ABAG projections.

Housing Needs
As part of the housing element law, the State has adopted a process for determining
each local jurisdiction’s fair share of regional housing needs. The process begins with the
state Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) meeting with each
regional council of governments to determine the need for new housing in that region.
The regional council of governments is then required to determine what share of that
regional housing need should be assigned to each city and county. The requirements for
each jurisdiction include a share of housing needs for all income levels: very low income
(less than 50 percent of the area median income); low income (50-80 percent of median
income); moderate income (80-120 percent of median income); and above moderate
income (more than 120 percent of median income).
ABAG and HCD determined that the nine-county Bay Area has a need for 230,743 new
housing units during the period from January 1, 1999 to July 1, 2006. ABAG allocated
shares of this need to cities by calculating each city’s share of the projected increase in
the number of jobs and households during that period. Cities are also assigned a share
of the housing needs for their spheres of influence. Pleasant Hill’s share of regional
housing needs is 714 units over the 7.5-year period, or 95 units per year: 18 percent of
the units are needed for very low income households, 11 percent for low income
households, 25 percent for moderate income households, and 46 percent for above
moderate income households (see Table H8).
Cities are not expected to actually produce this number of units; it is assumed that
production of housing will be carried out primarily by the private sector and will be
affected by market conditions and other factors beyond a city’s control. Instead, the City
must create conditions through zoning and land use policies that would allow the
private sector to construct the targeted number of units. If the Housing Element shows
that current conditions would not permit meeting the targets, the City is expected to
develop policies and programs to create conditions under which the units could be
constructed. These policies and programs can include rezoning or other changes in land
use policies, direct City subsidies to developers, or participation in County, State, or
federal programs to assist in the production of housing.
The 714 units assigned as Pleasant Hill’s fair share include 73 units attributable to the
unincorporated sphere of influence even though ABAG projections show no increase in
population projected for the SOI and predict a decline in the number of SOI households.
Table 8 shows that since counting toward the 1999-2006 regional housing needs
requirement began (on January 1, 1999), 337 units have already been constructed. Table
H8 includes 32 very low and 20 low income price-restricted rental units preserved at
Hookston Manor, 12 low income owner-occupied units assisted by the City Housing
Rehabilitation Loan program, and 7 very low income units at Pleasant Hill Co-housing
that qualify based on owner income.

Age Distribution
The population of Contra Costa County is aging: people over 65 years old made up only
11 percent of the population in 1990, but are estimated to be 20 percent of the population
in 2020 (ABAG provides age projections only at the county level). Pleasant Hill in 1990
had a slightly higher proportion of elderly (12 percent projected by ABAG for 2000,
compared to an actual 13.2 percent according to Census 2000). The aging trend is
expected to follow the pattern in the rest of the county (see Table H9).

Although ABAG projected that the proportion of people in Pleasant Hill under 19 years
old would decline from 28 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2020, the 2000 Census
indicates that this population segment had already dropped to 23.5 percent. The Census
                                                            also listed the median age in the city as

There are 672 residential and 679 group care units for seniors in Pleasant Hill (see Table
H11). There also are at least 49 smaller senior care facilities located throughout the city.
There is approximately one senior unit for every 29 residents, which is a higher ratio
than for other cities in the county. Of senior householders in 2000, 70 percent were
owners. In meeting the needs of the increasing elderly population, the following factors
must be considered:

Disabled Population
Disabilities may affect a person’s housing needs in two ways: a mobility or self-care
limitation may require modifications to housing to accommodate the disability; and a
work disability may limit a person’s ability to afford adequate housing. Some
individuals may have more than one type of disability.
Disabilities are much more common among the elderly population: 30 percent of seniors
have some form of disability, compared to only 8 percent for people 16-64 years old (see
Table H12). Eleven percent of seniors reported having both a work disability and
mobility/self-care limitations. Only 3 percent reported having a mobility or self-care
limitation only, and 16 percent reported having a work disability only. Appropriate
modifications to housing units can assist those with mobility and self-care limitations to
remain in their homes or to find housing.

Large Families and Overcrowding
Only 6 percent of Pleasant Hill households had five or more persons in 2000 (see Table
H6). Large households who are renters may experience significant housing problems
due to the low number of rental units (estimated at less than 25 percent) with three or
more bedrooms.
While large households may often be overcrowded (defined as more than one person
per room), smaller households may also find themselves in overcrowded conditions
when their incomes are too low to afford adequate housing. Overcrowding does not
appear to be a major problem in Pleasant Hill (see Table H13). Only 4 percent of renter
households and 1 percent of owner households are overcrowded.

Single-Parent Households
Table H14 shows that about 12 percent of Pleasant Hill households are single-parent
families. Most of these are headed by women. Even though the number of single-parent
families is relatively small, housing problems for this group can be significant. Bay Area
households have an average of 1.4 workers per household, so any household with only
one person able to earn wages is at a significant disa dvantage in the housing market.
Single parents may also have to take more time off from work to care for their children.
Many single-parent households are also at a high risk of becoming homeless because of
their lower incomes and the lack of affordable housing and support services. Planning
for housing development to serve single-parent families may require on-site child-care
facilities.

Persons in Need of Emergency Shelter
State housing element law requires the analysis of the special housing requirements of
persons and families in need of emergency shelter, and identification of adequate sites
that will be made available through appropriate zoning and development standards and
with public services and facilities needed to facilitate the development of emergency
shelters and transitional housing.
Pleasant Hill participates in countywide efforts to assist the homeless and those in need
of temporary shelter. The County Homeless Plan is overseen by the Homeless
Continuum Of Care Advisory Board. This board is made up of three consumer
representatives, two homeless advocates, two citizens-at-large, three agency
representatives, three city representatives and two representatives each from voluntary
organizations, the faith community, business, and County, State and federal agencies.
The primary police department contact with the homeless is a group of about a dozen
men with drug and alcohol abuse problems. On average, 50 people, including several
women, lack permanent shelter in the city. Most of the homeless pass through the city
after one or two nights, and about half of them sleep in cars. Occasionally car-based
transient groups have been observed to include children. Housing Policy 4B and
accompanying programs provide for transitional and emergency shelter facilities in
specific zoning districts. One project, Interfaith Transitional Housing at 2387 Lisa Lane,
has already received City approval for a 28-unit facility.
The Housing Alliance and Shelter, Inc. are countywide nonprofit organizations that
address homelessness issues by providing services in Martinez including revolving loan
and cash assistance programs to help people re-establish and maintain permanent
housing; a rental deposit guarantee program that guarantees to landlords that formerly
homeless people will repay move-in costs; family counseling; and information and
referral services.

Income and Ability to Pay
The 1990 Census data (used to calculate regional housing need) showed that 50 percent
of Pleasant Hill households earned more than 120 percent of the area median income,
compared to 42 percent for the region as a whole. Only 16 percent of households earned
less than 50 percent of median income, compared to 21 percent for the region.
Despite these high incomes, overpayment for housing is a problem for many Pleasant
Hill households, particularly renters. About 36 percent of households were paying more
than 30 percent of income for housing in 1990 (see Table H15). Thirty percent of income
is generally considered to be the amount that a household can afford to spend for
housing. If a household spends more than 30 percent it is considered to be overpaying
for housing.
Overpayment is much more of a problem for people with limited incomes. Of those
earning less than $20,000 in 1989 (approximately equal to the very low income category
described above), 70 percent were overpaying, including 84 percent of renters and 42

percent of owners. Renters are more likely to be overpaying in all except the highest
income category. A significant 28 percent of owners earning more than $50,000 a year
were overpaying for housing.
The problem of overpayment has become worse over the last decade as Bay Area
housing prices have risen to extreme levels. The average home price in Pleasant Hill in
mid-2000 was $280,000, up 9 percent over the previous year. In April 2002 the multiple
listing service for Contra Costa County included 25 single family homes for sale in
Pleasant Hill, with asking prices ranging from $325,000 to $780,000. Nine condomin iums
were listed for sale, ranging in price from $200,000 to $400,000.
Comparing home prices with the amount that a household would usually be expected to
pay for housing (see Table H16) indicates that nearly half of city residents (those below
median income) could not afford to purchase a single-family home. Low-income
households could afford to buy some condominiums, although very few were offered
for sale. Moderate-income households could afford to buy homes at the lower end of the
range, but the homes at the high end of the range could probably be purchased only by
those willing and able to pay much more than 30 percent of their income for housing.

Pleasant Hill rents would generally be affordable except to large families or those with
very low incomes. Rents for apartments in April 2002 ranged from $750-$1200 for studio
and one-bedroom units to $950-$1500 for two-bedroom units. A low -income household
(80 percent of area median) could afford one-bedroom and some two-bedroom
apartments, and median-income households could afford two-bedroom apartments (see
Table H17). A very low income household, however, would be limited to a studio or
lower end one-bedroom unit. Large families would find the rental situation particularly
acute, and very few apartments with three or more bedrooms are typically available in
the city.
Housing Supply
California Department of Finance estimates show 14,114 housing units in Pleasant Hill
in January 2000. Most of these were single-family units, although 26 percent were in
buildings with more than five units (see Table H18). Pleasant Hill has very few buildings
of 2-4 units or mobile homes. Recent construction shows a shift toward more
multifamily units: 63 percent of units constructed in 1990-2000 were in buildings of five
or more units. However, these units were built in a small number of projects and may

 Housing construction in Pleasant Hill was slow in the 1990s. The State estimates that 472
 units were built from 1990 through 1999, while City building department records show
 558 homes built during the decade. Either figure would make the 1990s the slowest
 decade for housing construction since before 1940.

 Rehabilitation Need
 The need for rehabilitation of housing is generally a function of age and maintenance
 level. About half of the homes in Pleasant Hill are less than 30 years old and unlikely to
 need rehabilitation unless normal maintenance has been neglected (see Table H19).
 Homes built before 1970 are more likely to need rehabilitation. The one-third of the
 housing stock built between 1940 and 1960 may require replacement of basic plumbing,
 heating, and electrical systems (if not already upgraded), and the small number of
 houses more than 60 years old could be in serious need of rehabilitation.
 The maximum life expectancy of a typical roof, concrete driveway, and other housing
 components is about 40 years. Information from the Contra Costa County Tax Assessor's
 office shows that 40 percent of the housing units in Pleasant Hill were built before 1961.
 A "windshield survey" in 2002 of older neighborhoods (Gregory Gardens, Sherman
 Acres, Poet's Corner, College Park, and Fair Oaks) concluded that about half of the units
 in those areas (1,775 homes) were candidates for rehabilitation; however, City assistance
 funds are available only to very low and low income households.

Rehabilitation needs can be complicated by an aging population and high housing costs.
Elderly people may be less able to maintain their homes, and people paying a high
proportion of their incomes for mortgage may have little left over for maintenance and
replacing major building components. High housing costs can also lead to more rapid
deterioration as more people crowd into units to afford rents or mortgages. To meet this
need, the Redevelopment Agency created the Housing Rehabilitation loan program in
1992. This comprehensive program makes low-interest loans to qualified homeowners
for the rehabilitation of their residences. Most loans repayments (including interest), are
deferred until the home is sold.

At-risk Units
Housing elements are required by State law to include an inventory and analysis of
federally assisted multifamily housing units "at risk" of conversion to market-rate
housing. The inventory has to account for all units for which subsidies expire within the
period starting at the statutory date for housing element revision and running for the
following 10 years.
A total of 310 affordable or below market rate units (2 percent of the City's total housing
stock) have been developed in the city through the utilization of Redevelopment
Housing Set-aside, HCD Multifamily Housing Program, federally subsidized Section
221 (d)(4), Section 8 or Section 202 programs, Community Development Block Grants,
and through tax-exempt bond financing (see Table H20). Additional funding available to
preserve at-risk units in the city include federal HOME Program funds and
administrative fees collected by the County Housing Authority. Local entities capable of
acquiring and managing at-risk units in Pleasant Hill include Affordable Housing
Associates and SHELTER Inc., which have expressed interest in working with the City
to preserve housing affordability.
Only 25 subsidized units in Pleasant Hill are at risk of conversion to market rate during
the 10-year period from 2002-2012. All of these are non-elderly apartments at 102
Chilpancingo Parkway (Chilpancingo Vista). Preserving these units would require a
subsidy of about $200 per unit per month or $60,000 per year, while replacing the units
would cost roughly $5,700,000.

The previous housing element noted that some units subsidized under the federal
Section 8 rental subsidy program would be lost before 1999. In fact, the Pleasant Hill
Redevelopment Agency (RDA), consistent with the City’s continuing commitment to
affordable housing, recovered 99 such units previously lost. The City of Pleasant Hill
facilitated the purchase and rehabilitation of Hookston Manor by a nonprofit housing
provider, Affordable Housing Associates of Berkeley (AHA), by providing $500,000 of
the $8.6 million cost. The City Redevelopment Agency held a public hearing on the
matter on December 7, 1998, and authorized a $500,000 loan which will be waived if the
project’s affordability is maintained for 55 years. The County contributed $500,000 from
federal CDBG funds, the State provided $450,000 through an affordable housing grant,
and the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) issued $4.25 million in tax exempt
bonds.
Hookston Manor was built as a 100 unit, senior, affordable apartment project. It was
initially and for many years occupied exclusively by senior Section 8 Certificate holders,
but its 20-year affordability restrictions expired in 1995. The owner purchased the
property just as TEFRA, the federal Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1986,
was enacted. That Act significantly altered the tax consequences for owners of rental
property. As a result, the owners failed to make needed improvements, and the
property’s condition and appearance declined appreciably. As a result of that, many of
the Section 8 Certificate holders moved out of the project.
The owner had been, for several years, in the process of selling the facility as a market
rate complex. In the period from 1995 to 1999, the owner moved a substantial number of
new tenants and non-senior families into the facility. Records from that period show that
28 “surviving tenants” (those who had not moved out by 1999) were relocated prior to
the AHA rehabilitation. (Others had already moved, and had been replaced by higher
income tenants.) All 28 of the surviving tenants were moderate income; none were very
low or low -income. In 1999, as a result of Pleasant Hill’s efforts, 99 units were
purchased, rehabilitated and added back to the city’s affordable housing stock. The City
RDA recorded loan terms that include affordability covenants which require that 99
units (one of the 100 units is reserved for the complex's manager) be decent, safe, and
sanitary and restricted to 50 Low and 49 Very Low Income seniors for 55 years from
2000 forward.

Affordable Housing Development Potential
Pleasant Hill has a limited supply of land available for new housing construction. Less
than 200 acres of vacant land are designated for housing, which could accommodate
between 157 and 789 new housing units (see Table H21). The low estimate is based on the
assumption that no single-family parcels will be subdivided and that multifamily
parcels will be developed at the low end of the permitted density range. The high
estimate assumes that single-family parcels will be subdivided to achieve the maximum
number of units permitted by the general plan category and that multifamily parcels
will be developed at the high end of the permitted density range. Neither estimate
assumes any change to general plan categories. Meeting the City’s regional housing fair
share requirement of 714 units would require developing many vacant parcels at
medium to high densities.

City affordable housing provisions require developers of more than five units to
dedicate 10 percent (not including density bonus) for low-income households, 5 percent
for very low-income households, or 25 percent for seniors. Single-family development
may meet the requirements by providing 20-25 percent second units. Units are required
to remain affordable for 20 years (or longer if required by other subsidy or financing
programs).
The Zoning Ordinance allows second units on all residential lots with a use permit, except
in the MRL, MRM, and MRH zoning districts. A second unit is attached to the primary
structure, does not exceed 640 square feet in size, and has cooking, eating, sleeping, and
full sanitation facilities. Second units can be an important source of affordable housing
since they can be constructed relatively inexpensively and have no associated land costs.
They can also provide supplemental income to the homeowner, thus allowing the elderly
to remain in their homes or moderate-income families to afford houses.
State law allows the City Redevelopment Agency to acquire land and subsidize and
encourage new development, and requires the agency to set aside 20 percent of revenues
for the development of affordable housing. Pleasant Hill has two designated
redevelopment areas, Commons and Schoolyard, both of which have housing
components.
Table H22 lists specific sites potentially available for development of housing during the
current planning period, including housing for households of very low and low income.
The sites identified in Table H22 include all those the City currently knows about, and
the numbers of potential net units are the City’s best current estimates.

  Indeed, Table H22 represents a realistic, achievable effort to provide affordable housing. As of January 2003, the City had produced
  109 of the RHND-required 129 very low income units through actual construction or preservation. An additional 20 units were in the
  review process, to be constructed by 2006. Of the required 79 low income units, the City has caused 61 units to be built, approved, or
  preserved. An additional 18 units were being processed by the Redevelopment Agency as of January 2003 to be constructed by mid-
  2006.
  As of January 2003, the total number of units constructed and under construction in Pleasant Hill since January 1, 1999, totaled 664
  units, just 70 units below the ABAG RHND goal for mid-2006.

6 The 44 moderate units are established as follows: At the Co-housing project at the end of Lisa Lane, seven units are confirmed and listed as “very low,” however an additional 28
  are “moderate” based on household incomes (adjusted by family size) provided by the Co-housing group and unit sales prices that ranged from $170,000 for the smallest unit to
  $404,000 for four bedrooms. In addition, 9 “second units” have been built and occupied since 1/99. All are studio or one-bedroom apartments. A recent Contra Costa Times
  survey found rents for studio and one-bedroom apartments ranged from $850 to $1,100 per month. These rents all fall in the low and moderate range, and confirm the nine
  second units as no more expensive than “moderate.” Seven additional units were rehabilitated using Redevelopment setaside funds, and the City, as part of the loan process and
  conditions of the program, confirmed the income of each applicant. These units are not counted elsewhere in this table.
7 100 units at Hookston Manor were lost from the lower income housing stock in 1995. The City (with an expenditure of $500,000 and an equal contribution from the County)
  initiated action to buy the project, require its rehabilitation, and require retention of 99 units as affordable housing for 55 years. (See "At-risk Units" discussion).

City of Pleasant Hill                                                         General Plan 2003
Constraints on Housing Production
Governmental Constraints
Although local governments have little influence on such market factors as interest rates
and availability of funding for development, their policies and regulations can affect
both the amount of residential development that occurs and the affordability of housing.
Since governmental actions can constrain development and affordability of housing,
state law requires the housing element to “address and, where appropriate and legally
possible, remove governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and
development of housing.”
The primary governmental constraint on housing production is the limitation on the
number of units in a given area imposed by the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance.
The small amount of land available for multifamily housing development could be a
significant constraint to meeting Pleasant Hill’s share of the regional housing need. Any
other land utilized for this purpose would have to be rezoned, or given substantial
subsidies and/or density bonuses in order for development to occur. A conditional use
permit is not required to build at the maximum density in residential zoning districts.
City Measure B (approved in 1986 and sunset in 1996) imposed limitations on rezoning
to higher residential densities. One of those limitations only allowed increased
residential density when 75 percent of the boundary of the area to be redesignated was
adjacent to land with the same or higher density. That provision, incorporated in the
General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, did not significantly constrain housing potential
because the city is substantially built-out, and the majority of vacant residentially-zoned
land lies in the Downtown and Schoolyard redevelopment areas, both of which allow
higher density multifamily and mixed use development. The Zoning Ordinance also
incorporated a provision of Measure B that limits the height of structures to 35 feet.
Through 2002, that provision did not create any demonstrated impacts on the
development of affordable housing.
Program 3.2 in the Community Development Chapter of this General Plan will continue
the Measure B constraint to allow land use redesignations that increase residential
density only when 75 percent of the boundary of the area to be redesignated is adjacent to
land with the same or higher-density land use designation. However, an important
exemption has been added: Properties deemed unsuitable for single family residential
use by virtue of noise, traffic or proximity to nonresidential uses are exempt from the 75
percent rule and may be redesignated for higher density residential provided the
properties to be redesignated do not induce growth in, or have significant traffic or noise
impacts on, existing residential neighborhoods. Based on the City’s experience through
2002, the above provisions, as modified, will not negatively impact the development of
affordable housing. With respect to projects or sites not already approved and which
appear on Table H22, these provisions will not negatively impact the affordability or
development capacity of those projects or sites.

General Plan 2003                                                             City of Pleasant Hill
The Contra Costa County Growth Management Program (Measure C, adopted 1988)
may also serve as a constraint on housing production. Measure C imposed a half-cent
sales tax increase to help fund a transportation improvement and growth management
program. To be eligible for sales tax funds, each pa rticipating City and the County must:
    1. Adopt a growth management element of the general plan to address the impacts
         of growth;
    2. Adopt and apply traffic service standards to ensure that new development does
         not significantly worsen traffic on streets, roads, and regional routes;
    3. Adopt standards for fire, police, parks, water, flood control, and sanitary sewer
         facilities that will be met as areas grow;
    4. Reduce dependency on the automobile through transportation systems
         management for large employers or alternative mitigation programs for
         residential areas;
    5. Adopt a five-year capital improvement program that lists projects, costs, and
         funding mechanisms;
    6. Ensure that new development pays its own way through mitigation and fee
         programs; and
    7. Address housing options and job opportunities at the local, regional, and
         countywide level.
These provisions could constrain housing development if rezoning of land or the
approval of projects is determined to result in a lowering of levels of service. The
imposition of mitigation fees could increase the cost of housing. However, the additional
tax could be used to fund improvements accompanying higher-density transit oriented
development.
Development review procedures, fees, and standards. Housing production may be
constrained by development review proc edures, fees, and standards. Residential
projects proposed in Pleasant Hill may be subject to design, environmental, zoning,
subdivision and planned unit development review, use permit control, and building
permit approval. These reviews together typically take from 3 weeks for a single family
remodel to 5 months for a major multifamily project. Developers estimate that every
month required for processing adds 2 percent or more to overall project costs.
The City of Pleasant Hill is committed to processing housing projects expeditiously
while preserving the quality of its neighborhoods. Because most Pleasant Hill sites are
urban infill, categorical exemptions and negative declarations are used extensively to
satisfy the California Environmental Quality Act. Discretionary reviews (such as
Architectural Review and Development Plan) and Subdivision review are conducted
concurrently. Projects offering more than the minimal affordable housing (as required
under the City’s Inclusionary ordinance) receive priority processing. Priority processing
for affordable housing—which is the City’s current but informal practice—will be
codified in 2003 (see Housing Programs 3.14 and 3.15).

Land use controls and standards for residential development do not adversely constrain
the production of affordable housing in Pleasant Hill. Residential structures in the city
may be 2.5 stories and 35 feet in height. Open space for multifamily projects is required
at 200 sq. ft. per unit and may be provided on private patios or balconies or in shared
outdoor areas. Note that PUDs and/or projects with affordable housing may exceed the
standards for building height, FAR, and coverage.
To ensure that requirements for parking do not constrain affordable housing
production, the City provides flexibility in its parking standards for higher-density
developments (see Housing Program 2.4). Zoning Ordinance §35-17.8 permits the
Planning Commission to reduce the required number of parking spaces upon making
specific findings.
The Mixed Use designation is found in four areas on the General Plan Land Use Map:
(1) Parcel 149-230-005, 1700 Oak Park Boulevard, the former Oak Park Elementary
School site; (2) all of the Downtown, between Boyd Road on the south, Woodsworth
Lane on the north, Cleaveland Road on the west, and Contra Costa Boulevard on the
east; (3) the currently retail areas of Contra Costa Boulevard, from the Downtown north
to Ellinwood Drive, and (4) the Kmart/DVC Plaza Shopping Center, bordered by Old
Quarry Road on the west, Chilpancingo Parkway on the north, the flood control channel
on the east, and Golf Club Road on the south. Sites (1) and (2) appear in the Land
Inventory on Table H22 because the City has every expectation that they will be
developed during the current planning period. The General Plan Mixed Use designation
is implemented through application of the PUD Zoning District, which thus far has
encouraged higher-density residential development, including affordable housing, by
reducing or eliminating potential constraints otherwise posed by application of zoning
standards and procedures designed primarily for small parcels, and by allowing
flexibility for both vertical and horizontal integration of uses on a site.
Trends in Mixed Use development. Mixed Use has succeeded in many cities and is
coming of age in Pleasant Hill. Pleasant Hill is planning to leverage the success of its
new downtown to develop a balanced land use mix in nearby areas that are currently
vacant or underutilized.
Mixed use development includes new
residential over or adj acent to new retail, infill
residential among older businesses, and other
innovative integration of residential and
nonresidential uses. Examples are the Pearl
District in Portland, the Gas Lamp District in
San Diego, the Denny Regrade and Belltown
neighborhoods in Seattle, and much of San
Jose’s recent development.
Pleasant Hill has seen the success of mixed use
firsthand; its revitalized downtown is integrated              Gallery Walk Project Nears Completion

      General Plan 2003                                                                                      City of Pleasant Hill
      with and bordered by residential. The success of residential downtown has resulted in
      additional new residential development in surrounding neighborhoods. In 2002, the
      residential market was the strength in California’s sluggish economy, and the trend is
      for residential to lead the future recovery. By laying a foundation for and promoting
      Mixed Use, the City has set the stage to stimulate the revitalization of its neighborhoods.
      The strategy takes advantage of favorable market timing to leverage the success of the
      downtown to nearby areas that are currently vacant and/or underdeveloped. These
      include the portion of Contra Costa Boulevard between downtown and Sun Valley Mall,
      the former Oak Park Elementary School site, and the Kmart DVC Plaza.
      In the Economic Strategy Element of this General Plan, Policy 3B calls on the City to
      “Facilitate the improvement and upgrading of older and outmoded uses along Contra
      Costa Boulevard, including mixed use development where feasible, such as at the DVC
      Plaza (K-Mart) site (including the portion east of the canal).”
      Multifamily residential use is allowed with a use permit in the Professional and
      Administrative Office (PAO) Zoning District. City staff has identified parcels currently
      zoned for office uses that could be developed with residential uses. The selected
      properties are either adjacent to existing homes, or are near parcels zoned for residential
      development, or are well served by public services, such as transportation and
      shopping. The sites include the property located at 100 Hookston Road and 400 Taylor
      Boulevard.

      Development review regulations and fees are mandated by State law or deemed
      necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community and protect
      existing residents from the otherwise external costs of new development. Fees collected
      by the City in the review and development process are limited to the City's costs for
      providing these services, and about 70 percent of development fees are imposed by
      agencies outside the City’s control (see Table H23).

City of Pleasant Hill                                                         General Plan 2003
Pleasant Hill employs the Uniform Building Code and Standards, National Fire Code,
Uniform Fire Code, Uniform Plumbing Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, National
Electric Code and State Health and Safety Code. No City amendments to these codes
significantly affect housing costs.
Energy conservation measures can add to construction costs but can reduce housing
costs for occupants. The City Building Inspection division enforces the State energy
building code (Title 24) through its plan checking process. These regulations establish
insulation, window glazing, air conditioning and water heating system requirements.
The City environmental review may also require measures to reduce energy
consumption. The City Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program and County
Neighborhood Preservation program often include attic and exterior wall insulation,
door and window repair or replacement, weather stripping and caulking, duct
insulation and water heater blankets in rehabilitation projects.
Pleasant Hill and other agencies also require the installation of certain on-site and
off-site improvements to ensure the safety and livability of residential neighborhoods.
On-site improvements typically include streets, curb, gutter, sidewalk, and utilities, and
amenities such as landscaping, fencing, streetlights, open space, and park facilities.
Off-site improvements typically include:
? Sections of roadway, medians, bridges, sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and lighting.
? Drainage, including sections of channel, culverts, swales, and pond areas, (Contra
     Costa County Flood Control District).
? Sewage collection and treatment (Central Contra Costa Sanitary District).
? Water systems, including lines, storage tanks, and treatment plants (Contra Costa
     County Water District and East Bay MUD).
? Public facilities for fire, school, and recreation.
? Geological hazard repair and maintenance where appropriate.
The costs of on-site and off-site improvements usually are passed along to the
homebuyer as part of the final cost of the home.
Nongovernmental Constraints
The availability and cost of housing is strongly influenced by market factors over which
local government has little or no control. State law requires that the housing element
contain a general assessment of these constraints, which can serve as the basis for actions
that local governments might take to offset the effects of such constraints. The primary
market constraints to the development of new housing are the costs of constructing and
purchasing new housing.
Costs associated with the acquisition of land include the market price of land and the
cost of holding land throughout the development process. These costs can account for as
much as half of the final sales prices of new homes in small developments or in areas
where land is scarce. Among the variables affecting the cost of land are its location and
amenities, the availability and proximity of public services, and the financing
July 2003                                     103                                      Housing
General Plan 2003                                                               City of Pleasant Hill
arrangement made between the buyer and seller. Although vacant residential land in
Pleasant Hill is generally not available for purchase, single family vacant land would be
estimated to sell for about $12-14 per sq. ft., while multifamily land would sell for an
average of $25 per sq. ft.
Another primary nongovernmental constraint is the high cost of producing housing.
HCD estimated in its 1997 Raising the Roof report that developing a 60-unit new
apartment building in the County would cost $7.5 million ($125,000 per unit), requiring
$1,468 in monthly rent per unit to make the project profitable. Although that would be
affordable to a household making 87 percent of local median income, HCD found that
actual Pleasant Hill rents were lower. Assuming that the cost of producing housing has
risen with increased land costs, rents today would still be too low to attract private
investment in new rental construction. In fact, the cost to develop housing (exclusive of
profit, but including land, fees, material, labor and financing) in the city averages $100
per sq. ft. for a single family home and $70 per sq. ft. for multifamily projects.
Production of attached condominiums, which provided significant housing supply for
low and moderate income families in the 1990s, has diminished sharply statewide, from
18,700 new units in 1994 to 6,000 new units in 1999. Attached condominiums built in
1999 accounted for 4.1 percent of new housing starts. Most new condominiums are
beyond the affordability of low income households, with some priced above $300,000.
The cost and availability of capital financing affect the overall cost of housing in two
ways: first, when the developer uses capital for initial site preparation and construction
and, second, when the homebuyer uses capital to purchase housing. The capital used by
the developer is borrowed for the short-term at commercial rates, which are
considerably higher than standard mortgage rates. Although financing for single family
residential development is readily available in the city, construction financing is difficult
to obtain for multifamily construction, which poses a significant constraint on the
production of affordable housing in Pleasant Hill. No mortgage-deficient areas or
underserved groups have been identified in the city.
Two of the multifamily housing sites in the land inventory on Table H22 have
environmental constraints. None is so severe that they cannot be mitigated to
accommodate mixed use or multifamily. Those on the 572 Beatrice Road site are exactly
the same as constraints found on the already constructed Pleasant Vistas condominium
project on 190 Cleaveland Road north of Babette Court. A creek runs to the west of the
site, requiring a 15 foot natural setback; and the western portion of the site has to be
raised slightly (about 2 feet) to make sure the habitable portions of the site are outside
the 100 year flood plain. This is not a major constraint and has minimal impact on the
ability to develop the site. Regarding the 1700 Oak Park Blvd. site, only a portion of the
site is in the 100-year flood plain, and only slightly. The site is flat and easily developed.
There was a school on the site for 40 years, and the City has no record of flooding on the
site. The proposed flood detention basin at most will take 5.5 acres of the site, which
easily leaves the remaining 2.5 acres for development of 96 units.

Consistency with Other General Plan Elements
State law requires that a general plan and all of its elements comprise an "integrated,
internally consistent and compatible statement of policies." The goals, policies and
programs of this housing element are consistent with the goals, policies and programs
contained in other elements of the General Plan.

Goals, Policies, and Programs
In some cases programs implement more than one policy. Programs generally include a
statement of specific City actions necessary to implement the program and identify the
City department or other agency responsible for implementation, quantified objectives
(where applicable), and a timeframe for completion.
Housing Goal 1. Maintain a housing supply sufficient to meet the housing
needs of all Pleasant Hill residents.
Housing Policy 1A. Monitor residential and job producing development in the city in
order to maintain an adequate housing supply for city residents.
Housing Policy 1B. Maintain a sufficient supply of residential land with appropriate
zoning to meet locally generated housing needs.
Housing Policy 1C. Provide active leadership in implementing the policies and
programs contained in the Housing Element.
Housing Policy 1D. Encourage and facilitate interjurisdictional development of
affordable housing.
Housing Program 1.1. Report annually to the City Council and Planning Commission regarding
the amount and type of housing activity. As required by State law, City staff provides a yearly
report on the progress made toward achieving the City’s housing goals.
         Responsible Agencies: Community Development Department, Planning Commission
         Timeframe:               Ongoing
         Quantified Objective: N/A
Housing Program 1.2. Work with the Regional Transportation Planning Committees
(TRANSPAC/ TRANSPLAN) and the other transportation sub-regions to limit potential traffic
congestion created through new development. City staff is required by the Congestion
Management Authority to notify TRANSPAC when new housing development proposals
generate 100 or more peak hour trips per day.
         Responsible Agencies: Community Development Department, TRANSPAC
         Timeframe:               Ongoing
         Quantified Objective: N/A
Housing Program 1.3. Continue to provide zoning categories that allow a range of housing
densities sufficient to meet the City’s share of Regional Housing Needs, as required by ABAG.
The City will monitor residential development at least annually. Current data indicate
that the City has enough residentially zoned land to meet housing needs during the 1999-
2006 period.
         Responsible Agencies: Community Development Department, Planning Commission
                                  City Council

Housing Program 1.4. Study suitable sites for rezoning to Multifamily High Density (Pleasant
Hill currently has no vacant land in this zoning category); encourage a mix of land uses and
residential densities when compatible with the neighborhood and environmental impacts are
mitigated.
          Responsible Agencies: Community Development Department, Planning Commission,
                                 City Council
          Timeframe:             2004 and Ongoing
          Quantified Objective: N/A
Housing Program 1.5. Continue to utilize Planned Unit Development zoning. PUD (Zoning
Ordinance Section 35-9) allows for flexible development of large and/or contiguous parcels
that may include housing along with other uses.
          Responsible Agencies: Community Development Department, Planning Commission,
                                 City Council
          Timeframe:             1999 and Ongoing
          Quantified Objective: N/A
Housing Program 1.6. Continue to allow residential development on land designated for office
uses. See Program 2.6.
          Responsible Agencies: Community Development Department, Planning Commission,
                                 City Council
          Timeframe:             1999 and Ongoing
          Quantified Objective: 2 Low, 28 Moderate Units
Housing Program 1.7. Encourage affordable housing in every proposed residential development,
and for every non-residential proposal, consider a mix of uses that includes housing. City staff
will inform developers of Pleasant Hill’s objectives for affordable housing and will discuss
the possibility of including housing for all income levels in each project.
          Responsible Agencies: Community Development Department, Redevelopment Agency
          Timeframe:             1999 and Ongoing
          Quantified Objective: N/A
Housing Program 1.8. Continue to work with the County and neighboring cities to increase the
opportunity to jointly develop affordable housing. The City worked with the County on the
BRIDGE Grayson Creek project (2001) and the agreement for Mixed Use development of the
former Oak Park Elementary School site (1700 Oak park Blvd., 1999). The City is currently
working with all other Contra Costa communities on the “Shaping our Future” (Smart
Growth) study, to be completed in 2003.

          Timeframe:             1999-2003 and Ongoing
          Quantified Objective: N/A
Housing Program 1.9. Consider annexation of parcels in the Sphere of Influence if necessary to
meet the City’s assigned share of the Regional Housing Needs Determination.
          Responsible Agencies: Community Development Department, City Council,
          Timeframe:             2004-2006
          Quantified Objective: As needed
July 2003                                       107                                         Housing

Housing Goal 2. Promote diversity in tenure, type, size, location and price to permit a
choice of housing for persons of all economic levels.
Housing Policy 2A. Allow a variety of housing types to be built on residential sites.
Housing Policy 2B. Remove constraints to production and availability of housing when
consistent with other General Plan policies (Programs 2.3 and 2.4 address the most
critical constraints).
Housing Policy 2C. Facilitate priority “fast track” processing by shortening the review
process where appropriate for affordable, below market rate and special needs housing
projects.
Housing Policy 2D. Encourage mixed-use development at underutilized sites, where
appropriate.
Housing Program 2.1. Update the Zoning Ordinance to facilitate small-lot development, small
single-family units and single-family attached units through amendments such as decreased
setbacks, zero-lot line allowances, lot clustering through the Planned Development process, and
shared parking provisions in appropriate locations.
         Responsible Agency:      Community Development Department
         Timeframe:               2003
         Quantified Objective:    24 Very Low, 34 Moderate, 40 Above Moderate Units
Housing Program 2.2. Allow manufactured housing in residential districts in accordance with
applicable State and federal laws, and require such units to meet local standards for elements
such as siding, roofing, and type of foundation, to the extent allowed by State and federal law.
         Responsible Agency:      Community Development Department
         Timeframe:               1999 and Ongoing
         Quantified Objective:    6 Very Low Units
Housing Program 2.3. Update the Zoning Ordinance to better organize allowable densities in
ways that will promote affordable housing, including by rezoning parcels identified in Table H22
and other sites as needed and as appropriate. The following site has not yet been rezoned but is
already appropriately designated on the General Plan Land Use Map: 1632 Oak Park
Boulevard will be noticed for a rezoning to Multifamily Very Low.

         Quantified Objective:    12 Low, 99 Moderate, 9 Above Moderate Units
Housing Program 2.4. Continue to provide appropriate flexible parking requirements that allow
shared use in locations being considered for higher-density housing development.
         Responsible Agency:      Community Development Department, Planning Commission,
                                  City Council
         Timeframe:               1999 and Ongoing

that provide affordable housing, and study ways to mitigate the cost of construction, for example
by allowing narrower street widths, rolled curbs, and parking bays, and by promoting the use of
less expensive building materials, such as plastic for storm drainage pipes.
          Responsible Agency:     Planning Commission
          Timeframe:              2002 and Ongoing
          Quantified Objective:   N/A
Housing Program 2.6. Update the Zoning Ordinance to provide incentives for including housing
in appropriate locations that allow mixed-use development. In particular, the City will amend
the Zoning Ordinance to allow by right the development of multifamily residential in a
Mixed Use project. This General Plan has assigned the Mixed Use designation to four areas
on the General Plan Land Use Map: (1) Parcel 149-230-005, 1700 Oak Park Boulevard, the
former Oak Park Elementary School site; (2) all of the Downtown, between Boyd Road on
the south, Woodsworth Lane on the north, Cleaveland Road on the west, and Contra Costa
Boulevard on the east; (3) the currently retail areas of Contra Costa Boulevard, from the
Downtown north to Ellinwood Drive, and (4) the Kmart/DVC Plaza Shopping Center,
bordered by Old Quarry Road on the west, Chilpancingo Parkway on the north, the flood
control channel on the east, and Golf Club Road on the south. Sites (1) and (2) appear in the
Land Inventory on Table H22 because the City has every expectation that they will be
developed during the current planning period. The General Plan Mixed Use designation is
implemented through application of the PUD Zoning District, which thus far has
encouraged higher-density residential development, including affordable housing, by
reducing or eliminating potential constraints otherwise posed by application of zoning
standards and procedures designed primarily for small parcels, and by allowing flexibility
for both vertical and horizontal integration of uses on a site.
          Responsible Agency:     Community Development Department, Planning Commission,

          Quantified Objective:   See Housing Program 2.1
Housing Goal 3. Increase housing opportunities for people of limited incomes.
Housing Policy 3A. Facilitate construction of affordable housing by favoring new
projects that include units for lower-income segments of the community.
Housing Policy 3B. Look for opportunities to promote the development of housing
affordable and available to those who work in Pleasant Hill.
Housing Policy 3C. Participate in programs assisting production of affordable units in
order to provide housing for low- and moderate-income households.
Housing Policy 3D. Provide direct assistance to individuals and households needing
affordable housing.
Housing Program 3.1. Continue to provide a density bonus for development of affordable and
senior housing. The City’s Density Bonus Ordinance, adopted in June 1993, provides a
minimum 25 percent increase in density, and an additional incentive, or financially
equivalent incentive, if the development provides:
     ? 20% lower-income units; or

         Quantified Objective: 10 Very Low and 30 Low (Senior) Units
Housing Program 3.2. Allow developers to satisfy affordable housing requirements by providing
units elsewhere in the city when inclusion of affordable units within the development is not
feasible. Codify that off-site development of affordable units is permitted only after the
Planning Commission makes a written finding based on substantial evidence that including
affordable units is not feasible.

         Timeframe:               1996 and Ongoing
         Quantified Objective: N/A
Housing Program 3.3. Require all housing projects of five or more units to include affordable
housing. Developers may satisfy the requirements of the City’s Affordable Housing
Ordinance by provide providing at least:
    ? 5 percent of the base density of the project for occupancy by very low income
         households, or
    ? 10 percent for low income households,
    ? 25 percent for qualifying senior residents, or
    ? 20-25 percent second units (in single-family projects).

         Quantified Objective: 5 units per year: 13 Very Low, 25 Low
Housing Program 3.4. Publicize the opportunity to construct second units. The City’s second
unit ordinance (adopted 1989) could be made more effective as a mechanism for providing
affordable housing with advertising such as a brochure that describes the highlights of the
ordinance, and articles in the City’s newsletter, which is mailed to all homeowners on a
quarterly basis. A second unit brochure and other outreach materials will be made available
to residents and will be posted on the City’s website.

Housing Program 3.5. Use Redevelopment Agency funds to leverage State and federal funds, and
encourage the use of private financing mechanisms, to assist in the production of affordable
housing . Funding mechanisms that should continue to be explored include the HCD
Multifamily Housing Program, federally subsidized Section 221 (d)(4), Section 8 or Section
202 programs, Community Development Block Grants, tax-exempt bond financing, federal
HOME program funds, administrative fees collected by the County Housing Authority, and
favorable financing made available through financial institutions, to assist low- and
moderate-income households.

throughout the city. California Redevelopment Law requires the Redevelopment Agency to set
aside 20 percent of the total tax increment revenue generated annually for the preservation or
production of housing for low and moderate income households. As of 2001 this set-aside
amounted to approximately $450,000. These funds have been used to assist in the
development of senior housing projects and housing rehabilitation loans and grants.

Housing Program 3.8. Invite non-profit housing developers to work with the City in promoting
and encouraging affordable housing. The City worked with Affordable Housing Associates in
restoring Hookston Manor to affordable housing (99 units, 1999); with BRIDGE in
developing Grayson Creek (71 units, 2000); and in 2002 is assisting Habitat with preliminary
site searches. The City will continue cooperative efforts in the future with these or other
interested nonprofit developers.

Housing Program 3.11. Establish a Housing Trust Fund to assist in the development of
affordable housing. Revenue for a trust fund can come from “in-lieu” fees provided from the
inclusionary unit ordinance, redevelopment funds, State and federal funds. The potential
uses of these funds include: land acquisition for below market rate housing, buy-downs on
mortgages for purchasers of below market rate units, capital improvements to below market
rate housing, etc.

Housing Program 3.13. Investigate concepts and funding sources for a homeownership assistance
program. The City will explore the possibility of providing financial assistance to people who
cannot afford to buy a home with priority given to those who work in the city, but cannot
afford the cost of housing, for example, teachers, police officers and those who work in City
government. Other potential target groups are first-time homebuyers of lower- and
moderate-income levels, and large families. In 2002, the City initiated a first-time homebuyer
program with the developer of Gallery Walk on Cleaveland Road (12 moderate income units
and 121 above moderate). The City also will seek to establish itself as a sponsor of other first-
time homebuyer programs, such as Cal Rural’s new Workforce Housing program for high
cost counties, which is underwritten by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and is
expected to launch early in 2003.

Housing Program 3.14. Establish new and appropriate standards for use by the Architectural
Review Commission in the processing of affordable housing developments. The Architectural
Review Commission reviews all new residential proposals. It typically reviews development
plans for landscaping, design of buildings, and provisions for accessibility for the disabled.
As of 2002, the Commission did not follow any formal standards or guidelines. This
Program requires the establishment of appropriate standards. The standards should be
crafted to ensure compatibility of affordable housing developments with their residential
surroundings, but at the same time, should not require costly architectural details or site
improvements that would unnecessarily increase the cost of such housing.

Housing Policy 4B. Support efforts to provide temporary shelter for homeless persons.
Housing Program 4.1. Continue to provide a density bonus for senior housing. Incentives must be
created to encourage developers to build senior housing. One way of doing this is to provide
meaningful density bonuses that will make senior housing projects financially viable.
Amending the Zoning Ordinance to reflect the State minimum density bonus percentage
will give the City Council or Redevelopment Agency the flexibility to consider more senior
projects and award density bonuses on a project-by-project basis. (See Program 3.1.)

Housing Program 4.2. Facilitate projects that provide units meeting federal, State and local
requirements. Population groups in the city with special needs include the physically
handicapped. Currently, the City enforces State-mandated requirements for rental housing
units. The City will study methods to provide ownership housing that can be equipped with
handicapped facilities. Tenants at Chilpancingo Vista, a 25-unit housing development
designed exclusively for handicapped persons, indicate an acute need for two bedroom units
designed for the handicapped. The City has agreed to work in cooperation with the County
to study ways to expand this facility and provide the desirable units. In addition, the City, in
cooperation with project sponsors, will apply to State HCD for Multifamily Housing
Program (MHP) funds reserved for development of units for the disabled. The passage of the
Housing Bond (Proposition 46) provides $190 million statewide for this purpose. The State
will accept applications twice each year over four years, beginning in January 2003.

regarding homeless shelter needs. A survey of the city’s homeless, in conjunction with Shelter,
Inc. (Contra Costa County’s umbrella organization for the homeless), was last conducted in
the early 1990s. Updating that survey would provide the necessary documentation to
determine if Pleasant Hill is meeting the needs of its homeless population, and if not, what
other methods could be used to respond to the needs of this group.

dBA: The "A-weighted" scale for measuring sound in decibels; weighs or reduces the effects of low
and high frequencies in order to simulate human hearing. Every increase of 10 dBA doubles the
perceived loudness though the noise is actually ten times more intense.
Dedication: The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for public use, and the
acceptance of land for such use by the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the public
function for which it will be used. Dedications for roads, parks, school sites, or other public uses

substitute for a dedication of land, usually calculated in dollars per lot, and referred to as in lieu
fees or in lieu contributions.
Density, Employment: A measure of the number of employed persons per specific area (for
example, employees/acre).
Density, Residential: The number of permanent residential dwelling units per acre of land.
Densities specified in the General Plan may be expressed in units per gross acre or per net
developable acre. (See “Acres, Gross,” and “Developable Acres, Net.”)
Density Bonus: The allocation of development rights that allow a parcel to accommodate
additional square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the
parcel is zoned, usually in exchange for the provision or preservation of an amenity at the same
site or a t another location. Under California law, a housing development that provides 20 percent
of its units for lower income households, or 10 percent of its units for very low-income
households, or 50 percent of its units for seniors, is entitled to a density bonus.
Density, Control of: A limitation on the occupancy of land. Density can be controlled through
zoning in the following ways: use restrictions, minimum lot-size requirements, floor area ratios,
land use-intensity ratios, setback and yard requirements, minimum house-size requirements,
ratios comparing number and types of housing units to land area, limits on units per acre, and
other means. Allowable density often serves as the major distinction between residential districts.
Design Review; Design Control: The comprehensive evaluation of a development and its impact
on neighboring properties and the community as a whole, from the standpoint of site and
landscape design, architecture, materials, colors, lighting, and signs, in accordance with a set of
adopted criteria and standards. “Design Control” requires that certain specific things be done
and that other things not be done. Design Control language is most often found within a zoning
ordinance. “Design Review” usually refers to a system set up outside of the zoning ordinance,
whereby projects are reviewed against certain standards and criteria by a specially established
design review board or committee. (See “Architectural Control.”)
Detention Basin: A structure constructed to retard flood runoff and minimize the effect of sudden
floods. Water is temporarily stored, and released through an outlet structure at a rate which will not
exceed the carrying capacity of the channel downstream. Basins often are planted with grass and
used for open space or recreation in periods of dry weather.
Developable Acres, Net: The portion of a site that can be used for density calculations. Some
communities calculate density based on gross acreage. Public or private road rights-of-way are
not included in the net developable acreage of a site.
Developable Land: Land that is suitable as a location for structures and that can be developed
free of hazards to, and without disruption of, or significant impact on, natural resource areas.
Developer: An individual who or business that prepares raw land for the construction of
buildings or causes to be built physical building space for use primarily by others, and in which
the preparation of the land or the creation of the building space is in itself a business and is not
incidental to another business or activity.

generates the demand for housing. Each new household formed creates the need for one
additional housing unit or requires that one existing housing unit be shared by two households.
Thus, household formation can continue to take place even without an increase in population,
thereby increasing the demand for housing.

by itself or for incorporation with similar units on -site into a structure for residential, commercial,
educational, or industrial use. Differs from mobile homes and manufactured housing by (in
addition to lacking an integral chassis or permanent hitch to allow future movement) being
subject to California housing law design standards. California standards are more restrictive than
federal standards in some respects (e.g., plumbing and energy conservation). Also called
Factory-built Housing and regulated by State law of that title. (See “Mobile Home” and
“Manufactured Housing.”)
Multifamily Building: A detached building designed and used exclusively as a dwelling by
three or more families occupying separate suites.

(1) non-conforming structures (by virtue of size, type of construction, location on land, or
proximity to other structures), (2) non -conforming use of a conforming building, (3)
non-conforming use of a non-conforming building, and (4) non-conforming use of land. Thus,
any use lawfully existing on any piece of property that is inconsistent with a new or amended
General Plan, and that in turn is a violation of a zoning ordinance amendment subsequently
adopted in conformance with the General Plan, will be a non-conforming use. Typically,
non-conforming uses are permitted to continue for a designated period of time, subject to certain
restrictions.

photochemical reaction with solar ultraviolet radiation. In the lower atmosphere, ozone is a
recognized air pollutant that is not emitted directly into the environment, but is formed by complex
chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen and reactive organic compounds in the presence of
sunlight, and becomes a major agent in the formation of smog.
Para-transit: Refers to transportation services and that operate vehicles, such as buses, jitneys, taxis,
