Overview and Contents
This Housing Element builds upon the goals, objectives, policies and programs in Larkspur’s
2004 Housing Element. In accordance with programs adopted in the 2004 Housing Element,
the City amended the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance to require a higher percentage of
affordable housing in new market-rate developments. As demonstrated in projects like Drake’s
Way, an apartment complex of 24 very low and extremely low income units, and the proposed
development of the 2000 Larkspur Landing Circle site, the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance
facilitates and supports quality affordable housing in Larkspur. Other affordable housing
projects constructed in the past 15 years include Cape Marin, Larkspur Courts Apartments, and
Edgewater Place.
The City also amended its Zoning Ordinance to encourage housing and retail/commercial
mixed-use opportunities, which facilitated the construction of 2 very-low income units above
retail spaces on Magnolia Ave., close to shopping and transit in downtown Larkspur. Additional
zoning amendments made pursuant to the 2004 Housing Element programs reduced off-street
parking requirements for mixed-use housing units, and discourage conversion of residential
units to office commercial space. The Central Larkspur Area Specific Plan (CLASP), adopted in
2006, also provides for housing and retail commercial mixed-use opportunities close to
shopping and transit in and adjacent to downtown Larkspur.
Larkspur’s ‘fair share’ of the regional housing need is a total of 382 units between 2009 and
2014 (see Figure I below). State law requires the City to calculate its need for extremely low
income (ELI) households, households that earn 30% or below the area median income.
Larkspur’s need for ELI housing is 45 units (50% of the very low income need, 11.8% of the
total). Larkspur’s progress to date (since July, 2007) in meeting those needs is documented in
Table 19 of Section 2, Housing Opportunities Analysis. This Housing Element continues to
support a multi-faceted approach to housing that fulfills the regional goals for affordable
housing, maximizes the chances for broad community consensus, and builds upon these
successes.
This Housing Element has been prepared based on discussions around housing needs and
strategic programs and opportunities for addressing those needs. Community input provided on
the preliminary strategic programs and opportunities helped to shape the Housing Element,
which is available on the City’s website, at the City Library, and at City Hall for further
community review.        The State of California Department of Housing and Community
                                                 i

Development (HCD) will also review the Housing Element. Steps in the review process include
at a minimum:
(1)   Planning Commission/City Council-Hosted Work Sessions and Staff-Hosted
      Workshops to review housing strategy options as presented during several City
      Council workshops.
(2)   Preparation and Distribution of the Draft Housing Element for additional
      review by the public and State law required review by the California Department of
      Housing and Community Development (HCD).
(3)   Response to Comments from HCD and the Public, with possible modifications to
      the Draft Housing Element based on comments.
(4)   Planning Commission Public Hearings and recommendations to the City Council
      for adoption of the updated Housing Element.
(6)   City Council Public Hearings to adopt the Planning Commission-recommended
      Draft Housing Element.
Larkspur’s Housing Element must be sensitive to the many converging and competing interests,
desires and views in the City relating to development of all types of housing while preserving
the historic character of Larkspur’s neighborhoods, open space and fragile natural resources. All
persons are encouraged to sign-up on the Housing Element Mailing List through the Larkspur
Planning Department by emailing LKPlanning@larkspurcityhall.org.
The major actions proposed by this Housing Element are:
1. To identify sites with a high potential for development or redevelopment for affordable,
    market-rate, or inclusionary housing while taking into account the characteristics of the
    community and environmental constraints.
2. To identify other resources and incentives to promote the development of affordable
    housing including residential second units and in-lieu fees.
3. To take actions toward the implementation of the Central Larkspur Area Specific Plan.
4. To encourage mixed residential/commercial development where mixes of uses is feasible
    and appropriate and encourage the construction of senior housing as part of mixed use
    developments.
5. To review and amend the Zoning Ordinance, building code, and other housing policies to
    remain consistent with changing state law.
6. To address the City’s need for emergency homeless shelters through the amendment of the
    City’s zoning ordinance to allow for at least one shelter by-right in the A-P or C-2 districts.
For ease of use, Appendix A contains a list and map of potential housing opportunity sites
considered in this Housing Element.

Introduction                                                                 City of Larkspur Housing Element
Introduction
Purpose of the Housing Element
All California cities and counties are required to have a Housing Element included in their
General Plan which establishes housing objectives, policies and programs in response to
community housing conditions and needs. This Housing Element has been prepared to respond
to housing needs in the City of Larkspur through the year 2014. It contains updated
information and strategic directions (policies and specific actions) that the City is committed to
undertaking to address its housing needs.
Housing affordability in Larkspur, and in the Bay Area as a whole, has become an increasingly
important issue over the past two decades. Recently, the nation-wide economic downturn has
led to rising unemployment (as of February 2010, unemployment rates measured at 12.5%
statewide and 8.4% county-wide; California Employment Development Department, U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics) and home foreclosure rates. Foreclosure rates in Larkspur, however,
continue to be relatively low compared to other cities in the County (Marin Housing Workbook,
2009). Median single-family home prices in the City increased annually from 2005 to 2008, but
reacted to the falling market with a 13 percent decrease from a median price of $1.35 million in
2008 to $1.17 million in 2009 (Marin County Assessor, 2010). Average monthly rent in the City
increased by 7% from 2005 to 2008
(Marin Housing Workbook, 2009). The
widening gap between housing costs
and decreasing income levels creates
a formidable barrier to those seeking
affordable housing in Larkspur. A lack
of affordable housing within the
community can lead to difficulties
filling vacant jobs, increased traffic
congestion as workers are forced to
commute from outside the City, and
the displacement of young families,
senior residents, and other community
members who relocate to more EAH’s Drake’s Way development, completed in November of 2009,
affordable communities.                     consists of 24 very-low and extremely-low income units.
The City is close to total build-out, and the scarcity of undeveloped land limits the opportunities
for new affordable housing units. With the exception of a few infill and mixed-use sites, most of
which have approved development proposals, other available residential sites are limited to
small or steep sites with limitations due to access, soil stability, drainage, etc (see discussion in
Section 2, Housing Opportunities Analysis; page 49). The primary challenge of Larkspur’s
Housing Element is to properly address local housing needs while ensuring that new housing
will fit the community’s geographic and historic context. Key questions include:
(1)       What kind of housing do we need? What kind of housing (size, type, location and
price) best fits with our workforce housing needs, household characteristics, and ability to pay
for housing?
                                                    1

Introduction                                                          City of Larkspur Housing Element
(2)    Where can we appropriately put new housing? Where in our community can
       additional residential units be accommodated, especially for seniors and very low
       (including extremely low), low, and moderate-income households; where they will not
       impact but maintain and enhance the character of the community?
(3)    How can we effectively work together? What can the City do –– in collaboration
       with community organizations, other agencies, non-profits, and others –– to
       encourage the construction and the conversion of existing housing to meet the need
       of workforce and special needs housing?
(4)    How can we effectively help special needs groups? What can be done to assist
       those households with special needs including, but not limited to the elderly,
       homeless, and people living with physical or emotional disabilities?
Housing Element Requirements
The Housing Element responds to Larkspur’s housing needs by identifying policies and
implementing actions for meeting those needs. State law defines the general topics that
Larkspur’s Housing Element must cover. Specifically, the element must: (1) document housing-
related conditions and trends; (2) provide an assessment of housing needs; (3) identify
resources, opportunities and constraints to meeting those needs; and (4) establish policies,
programs and quantified objectives to address housing needs.
Overview of State Law Requirements
State law establishes requirements for all portions of the General Plan. However, for the
Housing Element, the State requirements tend to be more specific and extensive than for other
elements. The purpose of a Housing Element is described in Government Code §65583.
      The housing element shall consist of an identification and analysis of existing and
      projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives,
      financial resources, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and
      development of housing. The housing element shall identify adequate sites for
      housing, including rental housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, and
      emergency shelters, and shall make adequate provision for the existing and
      projected needs of all economic segments of the community.
While jurisdictions must review and revise all elements of their General Plan on a regular basis
to ensure that they remain up-to-date (approximately every ten years), State law requires that
Housing Elements be reviewed and updated at least every five years. The process of updating
Housing Elements is initiated by State law through the regional housing needs process, as
described later in this document. The City prepared and adopted Housing Elements in 1990 and
2004, in response to the Regional Housing Need Allocations determined in 1988 and 1999,
respectively. The current Housing Element timeframe, as established by State law, addresses
the regional housing needs for the planning period of January 2007 to June 2014. However, in
September of 2005, the due date for updated Housing Elements was extended by the State
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to June, 2009. Therefore, the
planning period for this Housing Element is June, 2009 through June, 2014.
                                                 2

Introduction                                                        City of Larkspur Housing Element
State law is also quite specific in terms of what the Housing Element must contain:
(1)    Housing Needs, Resources and Constraints –– “An assessment of housing needs
       and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to meeting these needs . . .”
(2)   Housing Goals, Quantified Objectives and Policies –– “A statement of the
      community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to the maintenance,
      preservation, improvement, and development of housing . . .” and
(3)   Five-Year Action Plan –– “A program which sets forth a five-year schedule of actions
       the local government is undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies
       and achieve the goals and objectives of the housing element through the administration
       of land use and development controls, provision of regulatory incentives, and the
       utilization of appropriate federal and state financing and subsidy programs when
       available . . .”
Most importantly, the Housing Element must: (1) identify adequate sites with appropriate
zoning densities and infrastructure to meet the community’s need for housing, including its
need for housing for very low (including extremely low), low and moderate income households;
and (2) address, and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental constraints
to housing development. The policies and programs in the Housing Element are evaluated
based on the ability of the City of Larkspur to respond to housing needs and the Association of
Bay Area Governments (ABAG) Regional Housing Needs Allocation based on a realistic
assessment of the availability of adequate sites during the timeframe of the Housing Element.
Housing Element Amendments
Since the adoption of the City’s 2004 Housing Element, several important amendments have
been made to state housing law that introduce new requirements the City must consider in its
current Housing Element. Table A below summarizes the requirements presented by a few of
the amendments most pertinent to Larkspur. The City has created policies and action programs
that address these new requirements in Section 4, Housing Policies and Implementing
Programs.
The California State legislature passed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32), which
mandated the statewide reduction of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels (108 million metric tons)
by 2020. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) found that 40 percent of the state’s
greenhouse gas emissions could be traced to the transportation sector, with automobiles and
light trucks alone contributing 30 percent. CARB must determine regional greenhouse gas
reduction targets by September of 2010. In order to help the state achieve its greenhouse gas
reduction goal, the legislature passed Senate Bill 375 in 2008 which mandated that regional
transportation planning and land use planning be combined. Traditionally, land use planning
and transportation planning have been separated. In the Bay Area, transportation planning is
overseen by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and regional planning by the
Association of Bay Area Governments (discussed further below). Under SB 375, a Sustainable
Communities Strategy will be produced as part of the MTC’s Regional Transportation Plan that
will address housing and transportation policies that will help the region meet its greenhouse
gas reduction targets by the 2020 deadline. The City of Larkspur will participate in the
Sustainable Communities Strategy process.

 Table A. Important Amendments to State Housing Element Law
    Amendment                                                  Requirements
                        The City must calculate the existing and projected housing need for extremely-low income
                        households, a subset of very-low income households. This can be determined either by
                        the jurisdiction's own methods or by using the state standard of 50 percent of the very-
                        low income housing need. The City must analyze what types of housing would most
 Assembly Bill          appropriately meet this need and determine whether any zoning amendments must be
 2634 (2006)            made to permit such housing.
                        The City must desiginate a zone which would allow for the construction of at least one
                        year-round emergency shelter "by right," or without any conditional use or other
                        discretionary permits. Additionally, transitional and supportive housing must be
 Senate Bill 2          considered residential uses and should be subjected only to restrictions which currently
 (2006)                 apply to similar residential housing in the same zone.
                        The City must immediately provide local water and sewer providers with a copy of the
                        Housing Element as soon as it is adopted, in addition to any amendments adopted. Water
 Senate Bill 1087 and sewer providers in turn are required to prioritize service to proposed developments
 (2005)                 with lower income housing.

The Five-Year Action Plan
In establishing housing programs, the Housing Element sets forth a “Five Year Action Plan” that
details the actions, or “programs,” that will implement Larkspur’s housing goals and policies. For
each program, the Action Plan must identify the agency responsible, the timeframe for
implementation, and the number of units that will be constructed, rehabilitated or conserved, or
number of households that will be assisted, as a result of the program.
The   primary areas of housing needs that must be addressed in the Action Plan should:
(1)    Ensure adequate sites;
(2)    Provide assistance to support affordable housing;
(3)    Conserve and improve the existing affordable housing stock;
(4)    Address and remove governmental constraints;
(5)    Promote equal housing opportunities; and
(6)    Preserve assisted housing.
Review by State HCD
State law requires that every updated Housing Element be submitted to the State of California’s
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to ensure compliance with the
State’s minimum requirements. This certification process is unique among the General Plan
elements.
Housing Elements are submitted twice to HCD for review and comment; once during
development of the Housing Element (in draft form) and again after adoption of the Housing
Element by the local jurisdiction. The first review period requires 60 days and must take place
prior to adoption by the Larkspur City Council. During the first review, HCD will submit
comments back to the City regarding compliance of the draft Housing Element with State law
requirements and HCD guidelines. Modifications to the draft Housing Element in response to
these comments are appropriate. The City Council must consider HCD’s comments prior to
adoption of the Housing Element as part of the Larkspur General Plan. The second review
                                                              4

Introduction                                                             City of Larkspur Housing Element
requires 90 days and takes place after adoption. It is after the second review that written
findings regarding compliance are submitted to the local government.
ABAG Regional Housing Needs Determination
One unique aspect of State Housing Element law is the idea of “regional fair share.” Every city
and county in the State of California has a legal obligation to respond to its fair share of the
projected future housing needs in the region in which it is located. For Larkspur and other Bay
Area jurisdictions, the regional housing need is determined by the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG), based upon an overall regional housing need number established by the
State. ABAG’s allocations are based on analysis of:
(1)    The existing need for housing, addressing current overcrowding and vacancy rates
(2)    The projected need for housing, including projected growth, household formation,
      births and deaths, and migration patterns;
(3)    The local and regional distribution of income; and
(4)    Existing employment and employment growth.
The housing need allocated by ABAG is divided into four affordability categories based on income
(Very Low, Low, Moderate, and Above Moderate) as shown in Table B below. These income
categories are defined in the Definitions section of this Chapter. Table B summarizes the housing
need determinations for all of the jurisdictions in Marin County. Larkspur’s “fair share” of the
regional housing need is a total of 382 units between June 2009 and June 2014, with the following
income breakdowns: 90 units affordable to very low income households (23.6% of the total); 55
units affordable to low income households (14.4% of the total); 75 units affordable to moderate
income households (19.6% of the total); and 162 units affordable to above moderate income
households (42.4% of the total). Additionally, jurisdictions must quantify the number of units
required for extremely low income (ELI) households, which is defined as 30 percent of the
jurisdiction’s median income and below. State law allows jurisdictions to assume that the housing
need for ELI households is equal to 50 percent of the very low income household need. Based on
this calculation, the ELI housing need for Larkspur is 45 units (11.8% of the total).
Because local jurisdictions are rarely if ever involved in the actual construction of housing units, the
fair share numbers establish goals that should be used to guide planning policy and development
decision making. Specifically, the numbers establish a gauge to determine whether the City is
allocating adequate sites for the development of housing (particularly housing at higher densities
to achieve the housing goals for very low, low and moderate-income households). Beyond this
basic evaluation of sites (which must be serviced by necessary infrastructure facilities), the City
must review its land use and development policies, and regulations and procedures to determine if
any of them are creating unreasonable constraints on housing development to meet its fair share
need. Furthermore, the City must demonstrate that it is actively supporting and facilitating the
development of housing affordable to lower income households.
Every Housing Element must demonstrate that the local jurisdiction has made adequate
provisions to support the development of housing at the various income levels to meet its fair
share of the existing and projected regional housing needs. Income limits are updated annually
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for each county (see Figure
                                                     5

    A below). For this Housing Element, the              City has chosen to use the State’s HCD income
    eligibility limits, which are based on HUD’s         income eligibility limits for the Section 8 voucher
    program. (Note: When discrepancies exist            between State HCD and HUD’s income eligibility
    limits, the City will work with Marin Housing       Authority to establish the proper eligibility limits to
    apply.)

Larkspur’s Housing Element Update Process
The Housing Element must identify community involvement and decision-making processes and
techniques that are affirmative steps to generate input from low-income persons and their
representatives as well as other members of the community. Input should be sought, received
and considered before the Housing Element is completed. Requirements for public participation
are described in Section 65583(6)(B)) of the Government Code. In addition to facilitating
community involvement, the process is also intended to coordinate among various departments
and local agencies, housing groups, community organizations and housing sponsors.
Collaboration enhances the effectiveness of Housing Element programs in indicating “the
agencies and officials responsible for the implementation” (described in Section
65583(c)(6)(B)).
One response to this concern has been a process jointly sponsored by all of the local
government jurisdictions in Marin –– all eleven cities, and the County –– to develop “best
practices” and participate together, where possible, in developing common strategies to address
housing needs. As part of this effort a Marin Housing Workbook was prepared that provides an
important reference document for Larkspur’s Housing Element update. The process for
developing the Marin Housing Workbook involved significant community outreach and
participation, which the City can now build upon to craft its own strategies for meeting housing
needs.
In an effort to involve all economic segments
within Marin, the Marin Housing Workbook
was developed through an open, inclusive
process.        The 4,000 persons and
organizations on the mailing list included all
housing-related non-profits in Marin County
and persons from a mailing list provided by
the Marin Housing Authority. In addition,
recommendations considered as part of the
“best practices”, contained in the document,
were made by groups such as the Marin
Housing Element Coalition, Greenbelt
Alliance and Non-Profit Housing of Northern
California. A telephone conference was also
conducted with HCD staff and the County’s       Larkspur residents and business owners attend a public workshop
                                                hosted by the Planning Department on March 16, 2010.
Planning Directors and representatives.
Larkspur’s Housing Element update process has built upon the regional work effort noted above,
and provided an opportunity for community review of housing strategy options and identification of
opportunities tailored to community values and needs. In an effort to involve all economic
segments of the community, the City held two public workshops which were noticed in the Marin
Independent-Journal and the Twin Cities Times, in addition to two public hearings held by the
Planning Commission and City Council. Notices were also mailed to approximately 250 people and
organizations on the Housing Element mailing list as well as to interested property owners and
residents. The mailing list includes representatives of groups with special housing needs, tenant

Introduction                                                         City of Larkspur Housing Element
and low income groups, landlords, developers and neighborhood residents as well as City staff
members and decision makers.
Larkspur citizens participating in the workshops and public hearings expressed support for the
development of affordable housing, but also shared their concerns with the number of units
identified by ABAG, and their frustration with the State dictating how their community should
develop. They felt that the City’s existing supply of high density housing should be taken into
consideration during the RHNA process. However, overall, participants supported the existing
policies and programs providing incentives for affordable housing, many of which were
implemented pursuant to the 2004 Housing Element. Participants also supported the proposed
amendments to the Administrative Professional and General Commercial districts to allow
permanent emergency shelters by-right (subject to operational standards to be determined by the
City), pursuant to State law. Representatives from non-profit housing organizations, including the
Non-Profit Housing Association of Northern California, expressed support for affordable housing
development at Bon Air Center, a new high-density housing site identified in the Housing Element,
and for the existing incentives offered by the City.
Below are key process milestones:
        Planning Commission/City Council-Hosted Work Sessions and Staff-Hosted
Workshops to review housing strategy options as presented in the Preliminary Draft Housing
Element. (October 2009, March and April 2010)
        Preparation and Distribution of the Draft Housing Element for additional review by
the public and State law required review by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development. (March 2010)
        Response to Comments from HCD and the public, with modifications to the Draft
Housing Element based on comments. (August 2010)
        Planning Commission Public Hearings and recommendations to the City Council for
adoption of the revised Draft Housing Element. (October 2010)
        City Council Public Hearings to adopt the Planning Commission-recommended revised
Draft Housing Element. (November 2010)
Relationship of the Housing Element to Other Elements of the
Larkspur General Plan
The General Plan is a long-range planning document that serves as the ‘constitution’ for
development in the City of Larkspur. It was adopted in 1990 and describes goals, policies and
programs to guide decision-making, and the City will soon begin a comprehensive General Plan
update process. All development-related decisions in the City must be consistent with the
General Plan. If a development proposal is not consistent with the Plan, it must be revised or
the Plan itself must be amended.
State law requires a community’s General Plan to be internally consistent. This means that the
Housing Element, although subject to special requirements and a different schedule of updates,
                                                   9

Introduction                                                          City of Larkspur Housing Element
must function as an integral part of the overall General Plan, with consistency between it and
the other General Plan elements. Many housing needs can only be addressed on a
comprehensive basis in concert with other community concerns such as infill development or
mixed use incentives, for example, which must consider land use, traffic, parking, design and
other concerns as well. Recent planning activities in Larkspur have focused on specific issues
and areas. The Central Larkspur Specific Plan (CLASP), adopted in 2006, is an example of a
more focused, comprehensive policy approach to community development.
The adoption of the CLASP provided an opportunity to review land uses and development patterns
in this Plan area as well as accommodate further affordable housing opportunities in the City.
Currently, Subarea 3 of the CLASP (the Niven Nursery site) is poised to be developed into a mixed
community of families, seniors, and other residents with the construction of a mix of housing
types, including 20 affordable housing units. From an overall standpoint, the development
projected under this Housing Element is consistent with the other elements in the City’s current
General Plan.

Introduction                                                             City of Larkspur Housing Element
                                  Housing Element Definitions
Accessible Housing: Units accessible and adaptable to the needs of the physically disabled.
Affordable Housing: The City Larkspur’s zoning code defines affordable housing as a below-
market-rate dwelling unit offered for sale or rent to households of low or moderate income.
Generally, housing costs (including principal, interest, utilities, and insurance) are considered
affordable when they account for no more than 30% of a household’s annual income. “Affordable
housing” thus differs for each individual household depending on their household income. For
example, a schoolteacher earning $34,300 per year can afford monthly payments up to $857 for
housing.
Household: The U.S. Census Bureau defines a household as all persons occupying a housing unit,
including families, single people, or unrelated persons. Persons living in licensed facilities or
dormitories are not considered households.
Income Limits: Income limits are updated annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) and the State Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD) for Marin County. HCD income eligibility limits are based on HUD’s Section 8 voucher
program eligibility limits (the most recent HCD income limits can be accessed online at
http://www.hcd.ca.gov). Income limits for Marin County in 2009, as defined by California Housing
Element law, are:
 Extremely Low Income Households: Households earning less than or equal to 30% of the
median household income––i.e., in 2009 a family of four earning $33,950 or less per year. The
acronym “ELI” is used throughout this Element to refer to extremely low income households.
 Very Low Income Households: Households earning less than or equal to 50% of the
median household income––i.e., in 2009 a family of four earning $56,550 or less per year.
 Low Income Households: Households earning 50-80% of the median household income––
i.e., in 2009 a family of four earning between $56,550 and $90,500/year.
 Lower Income Households: Households earning less than 80% of the median income- i.e.,
in 2009 a family of four earning $90,500 or less per year.
 Moderate Income Households: Households earning 80-120% of the median income––i.e.,
in 2009 a family of four earning between $90,500 and $116,150/year.
 Above Moderate Income Households: Households earning over 120% of the median
household income––i.e., in 2009 a family of four earning above $116,150/year.
Median Household Income: The middle point at which half of the City's households earn more
and half earn less. The current median income for a family of four in Marin is $96,800/year.
Multiple-family Housing: A structure or portion thereof used or designed as a residence for
three or more families each doing its own cooking in said structure, including apartments,
apartment hotels; but not including motels and hotels.
Persons per Household: Average number of persons in each household.
Senior Housing: Defined by California Housing Element law as projects developed for, and put to
use as, housing for senior citizens. Senior citizens are defined as persons at least 62 years of age.

 Demographics: Population and Employment Trends
 Population Growth and Trends
 As of 2008, Marin County’s population was measured at 248,794 people (U.S. Census Bureau).
 Over the next 40 years, the California Department of Finance projects that Marin County as a
 whole will grow at an average annual rate of 0.5 percent, which amounts to about 1,220 people
 and 500 households per year countywide. By the year 2035, the County’s population will reach

 Age is an important population characteristic to consider when planning for housing, as housing
 needs vary for households of different ages. Table 2 below provides snapshots of the City’s
 population by age group in both 1990 and 2008, and illustrates an aging trend that is mirrored
 in the County. The median age in Marin County is 43.8, close to Larkspur’s median age of 45.9.
 Both the County and City median ages are well above the state median age of 34.5 (U.S.
 Census Bureau, 2008). The population of children (under the age of 18) increased slightly,
                                                                                    13

The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) projects a significant increase in Marin’s
elderly population. By the year 2035, 40 percent of Marin residents will be 60 years of age or
older. In Larkspur, the number of residents over the age of 60 will increase steadily, from 30
percent to approximately 44 percent in 2035. In addition, three out of four individuals 85 years
of age or greater are expected to be women (Baird + Driskell, 2004). An aging population will
require specialized housing accommodations, including access to affordable housing, group
living opportunities, and smaller homes. Special housing needs for seniors are discussed in
further detail later in this section.
Employment Growth and Trends
Employment growth in both Marin County and Larkspur is anticipated to significantly outpace
population growth over the next twenty years. Between 2005 and 2035, the number of
employed County residents is projected to increase by 4 percent, while the number of jobs in
                                                           the County will increase by 17 percent

The County economy is predominantly white collar, with over half of its residents employed in
professional, management, and financial fields. Many of these residents commute out of the
County into urban and employment centers such as San Francisco and Oakland. The largest
employers within the County are County government, healthcare facilities including Kaiser
Permanente and Marin General Hospital, the software company Autodesk, and Fireman’s Fund
Insurance (Marin County Draft Housing Element, 2009). As of 2008, the majority of employed
Larkspur residents work in professional occupations, sales and office occupations, and
management, business, and financial operations, with the remaining minority employed in the
service industry, construction, maintenance, and transportation (see Table 3).

Although Marin County and Larkspur will continue to expand their job base, many residents
commute elsewhere to work. At the same time, many of the people who work in the County
and Larkspur live in other communities due to

Household Types and Size
The U.S. Census Bureau defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit,
including families, single people, or unrelated persons. Persons living in licensed facilities or
dormitories are not considered households. There were 6,002 households in Larkspur in 2008
(compared to 6,142 in 2000) of which 47 percent were families and 53 percent were non-family
households (Claritas, 2008, U.S. Census, 2000). There are an additional 150 individuals living in
group quarters. Significantly, 43 percent of all households were comprised of people living
alone, a fact that reflects the predominance of rental apartments and an aging population
(Claritas, 2008). In 2000, approximately 34 percent of single person households were headed
by individuals age 65 or over, representing 15 percent of all households at that time.
Households by types (i.e., family, single person, and non-family) are shown in Table 5.

In 2005, the average household size in Marin County was 2.34 persons, while the average
household size in Larkspur was 2.03 persons. The City’s relatively smaller household size
reflects the higher incidence of single person households in the City, though household size has
increased slightly from the 2000 Census average of 1.93 persons. The City’s household size is
projected to increase to 2.1 persons per household by 2035 (see Table 6). The Countywide
average household size is projected to remain relatively static through 2035, averaging between
2.34 and 2.35 persons per household. Compared to the rest of the Bay Area, which as a region
has an average of 2.69 persons per household, the City’s average household size is significantly
lower, averaging 0.35 fewer persons per household. (ABAG, 2009)

Marin County and Larkspur’s aging population reduces the amount of household occupants as
children move out and mortality increases. According to the 2000 Census, renter households in
Marin County (2.21 persons per household in 2000) are slightly smaller than owner households
(2.42 persons per household in 2000). In Larkspur, owner households are quite a bit larger than
renter households (2.21 to 1.65 persons per household).
Housing Types and Conditions
Unlike many Marin cities, multi-family dwellings (dwellings with three or more living units; see
definition on page 11) are the most common housing type in Larkspur, comprising 52 percent
of the total housing units. Single-family dwellings are the next most common, representing 44
percent of the total housing stock. Mobile homes account for the remaining four percent of
housing units. Townhomes and condominiums account for 13 percent of the single family
housing stock. The City has two mobile home parks with travel trailers that provide very low-
cost housing. Although many of the trailers are not designed for use as permanent housing,
the parks’ trailers are occupied as such. Maintenance of the parks is regulated and enforced by
the State of California. (Department of Finance, 2009)

The number of housing units in Larkspur increased by 11 percent between 1980 and 2000, from
5,583 to 6,174 units, with most of the development occurring in the 1980s. Construction of new
single family and multi-family homes slowed significantly between 2000 and 2008, indicating
the City’s approach to total build-out. Of the 339 units added to the housing stock in Larkspur
between 1990 and 2000 (about 34 units per year), approximately 70 percent were multi-family
housing in developments with five or more units (U.S. Census, 2000). This is contrary to
development patterns in most jurisdictions in Marin County, where most housing units built
during the same timeframe were single family homes. Between 2000 and 2010, the City
legalized 11 multi-family units in the Blue Rock Inn, and two units were constructed above
commercial businesses on Magnolia, while 25 detached single family units and 6 second units
were built. Additionally, 24 very low income multi-family units at EAH’s Drake’s Way
development were completed in November 2009. Housing by type (i.e., single family or multi-
family) in Marin County jurisdictions are shown in Table 7.

Larkspur has a rich heritage with many historic homes worthy of conservation. Homes built
more than 50 years ago comprise 33 percent of the housing stock, compared to 40 percent in
Marin County (U.S. Census, 2000). In general, the condition of the housing stock in Larkspur is
very good. Since demand for housing has remained strong, it is expected that the market has
accomplished much rehabilitation on its own. An overview of neighborhoods in Larkspur by the
Planning staff indicates that few houses (about ten to twelve), including in the area of
Boardwalk One, are in need of repair due to the high market value of existing housing. The City
estimates that an overwhelming majority of units are in “sound” condition (i.e., providing safe,
sanitary, and adequate housing), with the appearance of regular maintenance of the home and
landscaping. In recent years, many homes have been renovated with new roofs, windows, or
additions, or have been completely replaced.
Additionally, the City continues to participate in the Housing Authority of Marin’s Rehabilitation
Loan Program, funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). HUD’s CDBG program is meant to improve
housing conditions and economic opportunities in smaller cities, with aid focused on low and
moderate-income residents. Marin County received approximately $1.6 million in CDBG grants
in 2009 (HUD, 2009). The Rehabilitation Loan Program provides low-interest single-family home
repair loans, emergency repair and accessibility grants, exterior enhancement rebates,
weatherization and home security grants, and multi-family rehabilitation loans for qualified very-
low-income homeowners. There have been 533 Residential Rehabilitation Loans made to
homeowners throughout Marin County. City policies continue to support these efforts.
Housing by Tenure
Tenure refers to whether a housing unit is rented or owned. As of 2007, there were a total of
100,489 occupied housing units in Marin County, 65 percent of which were owner-occupied and
35 percent renter-occupied. There were 7,438 unoccupied units. The proportion of owner-
occupied units in the County has increased slightly since 2000 from 63 percent owner-occupied
to 65 percent owner-occupied, as a disproportionate number of single-family homes, as
compared to multi-family units, have been built in Marin. (U.S. Census Bureau, 2007)

In Larkspur, the proportion of rental housing to owner-occupied housing is almost evenly split,
with renter-occupied households representing 51 percent and owner-occupied households
representing 49 percent of the occupied housing stock (Claritas, 2008). The proportion of
owner-occupied housing has increased since 1980, when 43 percent of the housing units were
owner-occupied (Larkspur Housing Element, 2004).
Overcrowding
The U.S. Census defines overcrowded housing as units with more than one inhabitant per room,
excluding kitchens and bathrooms. As shown in Table 8, the incidence of overcrowding in
Larkspur for both owner and renter- Table 8. Overcrowding in Larkspur
occupied housing units was 2.6 percent, Households (HH) Owners Renters Total Percent

According to 2000 Census data, the incidence of overcrowding in Marin County was one percent
for owner-occupied units and 6.5 percent for rental units, compared to two percent for owner-
occupied units and three percent for rental units in Larkspur (U.S. Census 2000). The incidence of
overcrowding may have increased over the 1990 levels due to the increase in housing prices
relative to local incomes, the increase in the average household and family size, and low vacancy
rates.
Vacancy Trends
The vacancy rates for housing in Marin County, as indicated by the 1990 and 2000 census
reports, have decreased since 1990 when the census recorded a vacancy rate of 4.7 percent.
The County’s total vacancy rate, measured at 4.1 percent in 2008, has remained constant over
the past decade. However, the County’s effective vacancy rate for rental housing (which
excludes units that are unavailable as long-term rentals units) is 2.7 percent, an increase of 0.5
percent since 2000 when it was measured at 2.2 percent. (Marin Housing Workbook, 2009)
The vacancy rate for all housing in Larkspur was 4.2 percent in 2008, exhibiting no change
since 2000 (California Department of Finance, 2008). The City’s effective rental vacancy rate
was 2.2 percent in 2000; current effective rental vacancy rates are unavailable for Larkspur
(Baird and Driskell, 2004). In 2008, vacancy rate for all rentals in Larkspur was 4.5 percent
(first quarter data from Real Facts, Inc.). This figure is indicative of a very tight rental housing
market in which demand for units exceeds the available supply. In general, a higher vacancy
rate is considered necessary by housing experts to assure adequate choice in the marketplace
and to temper the rise in home prices. A five percent rental vacancy rate is considered
necessary to permit ordinary rental mobility. In a housing market with a lower vacancy rate,
tenants will have difficulty locating appropriate units and strong market pressure will inflate
rents. In addition, the lower the vacancy rate the greater the tendency for landlords to
discriminate against potential renters.

Fair Housing of Marin is a civil rights agency that investigates housing discrimination, including
discrimination based on race, origin, disability, gender, and children. Their caseload consists
almost entirely of renters. In 2008, the organization received over 1,200 housing-related
inquiries, of which about 170 evolved into formal discrimination complaints (Fair Housing of
Marin, 2009). Fair Housing of Marin also educates landowners on fair housing laws, provides
seminars in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese on how to prepare for a housing search and
recognize discrimination, and conducts educational programs on the importance of community
diversity in schools. The City refers housing discrimination cases to Fair Housing of Marin, and
has made information about housing discrimination resources available to the public at City Hall
(see Programs H2.B and H2.C in Section 4, Housing Policies and Implementing Programs).

Sales Prices and Rents
The median sales price for a detached single-family home in Larkspur in 2009 was $1.17
million, a 43 percent increase from the 2000 median price of $820,000 (Marin County Assessor-
Recorder, 2010 and 2001). The median price for a condominium or townhouse in the City in
2009 was $407,000, a 17 percent increase from the median price of $347,500 in 2000 (Marin
County Assessor-Recorder, 2010 and 2001). From 1993 to 2000 the median home sales price
in Marin County increased 66 percent from $314,250 to $523,000 (Baird + Driskell, 2004). As
shown in Table 9, the median price for a detached single-family home or townhome in Marin
County in 2009 was $750,000, requiring an income of over $150,000 per year to qualify for a
loan.

Household Income
Income is defined as wages, salaries, pensions, social security benefits, and other forms of cash
received by a household. Non-cash items, such as Medicare and other medical insurance
benefits, are not included as income. It is generally expected that people can afford to pay
about a third of their income on housing. Housing costs include principal, interest, utilities and
insurance. It is therefore critical to understand the relationship between household income and
housing costs to determine how affordable—or unaffordable—housing really is. Table 11 below
shows the calculations used to determine the various income categories determined by the
State each year.
 Table 11. California State Income Limits                              In 2008, the median household income in

Larkspur households have annual incomes between $100,000 and $250,000. According to the
2000 Census, 39.3 percent of all Marin County households and 33 percent of all Larkspur
households (2,016 households) fall in the extremely low, very low and low household income
categories (in 2000, a family of four earning less than $58,300; in 2009, less than $90,500). The
majority of these households (64 percent) rent their homes. Of these households, 526 households
(54 percent) were extremely low income households (in 2000, a family of four earning $22,450 or
less; in 2009, less than $33,950). A breakdown of extremely low income households by tenure and
household characteristics is shown in Table 15.

        Housing Affordability
        Housing that costs 30 percent or less of a   household’s annual income is referred to as “affordable
        housing.” Because household incomes               Table 12. Estimate of Ability to Pay for Rental

and affordability at various incomes. As Tables 12 and 13 illustrate, homebuyers and renters at a
variety of income levels face the risk of overpaying for housing in Larkspur, and given the
household income trends and housing cost trends discussed above, it is reasonable to conclude
that the affordability gap will continue in the future. Overpaying households in Larkspur and

Extremely Low Income Households
According to the 2000 Census, there are 526 extremely low income (ELI) households in Larkspur,
comprising nine percent of all households. Just like any household, the housing needs of ELI
households vary. An ELI household could be a disabled adult receiving federal supplemental
security income (SSI), or could be a single parent with two children working a minimum wage job.
Seventy percent of ELI households rent their home. Some ELI households may need care provided
by supportive or transitional housing (see discussion of supportive and transitional housing in
“Special Housing Needs” below).
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data for Larkspur from the 2000 Census
indicates that 85 percent of rental and 63
percent of owner ELI households spent Table 14: Estimated Overpaying Households by
more than 30 percent of their income on Tenure (2000)
housing (see Table 15), and 91 percent                                                          Total      Total

group. Additionally, almost half of the City’s ELI rental households (42 percent) are elderly single-
person or two-person households. Similarly, 44 percent of ELI homeowners are elderly single-
person or two-person households. As the median age in Larkspur is projected to increase
significantly over the next twenty years, the incidence of ELI senior households may similarly
increase. To anticipate this growing need, the City should plan for housing types affordable to ELI
senior households, including second dwelling units, affordable units dedicated to senior housing,
and below-market rate rental housing. The City currently provides priority processing and
considers waiving fees and other requirements for developments providing affordable and/or
senior housing.
Appropriate housing types for ELI households include second dwelling units (for one to two-person
households), and below-market rate rental units of a variety of sizes. The City has built
relationships with non-profit organizations specializing in the construction and management of
below-market rate rental and owner units to strengthen the City’s supply of housing affordable to
low, very low, and extremely low income households. In particular, the City has worked with EAH
on two rental housing developments providing housing to very low and extremely low income
households (Drake’s Way, 24 extremely and very low income units- two units reserved for disabled
households-, and Edgewater Place, 28 very-low income housing units- two handicap accessible
units). To address the housing needs of ELI households, the City will continue to build upon its
existing relationships with affordable housing providers, encourage the construction of second
dwelling units, and provide permit fast-tracking and waive or defer fees for affordable housing
developments. (See policies and programs in Section 4 under objectives H6, H7, and H11 for
detailed descriptions of affordable housing programs.)

Special Housing Needs
In addition to overall housing needs, the City must plan for housing for special needs groups. To
meet the community’s special housing needs (including the needs of the local workforce, seniors,

people living with disabilities, the homeless, people with HIV/AIDS and other illnesses, people in
need of mental health care, single parent families, single persons with no children, and large
households), Larkspur must be creative and look to new ways of increasing the supply, diversity
and affordability of this specialized housing stock. Additionally, recent state housing law
amendments require the City to specifically identify and analyze potential constraints to housing for
ELI households and disabled residents. Twenty percent of the total 6,500 affordable housing units
in Marin County are reserved for seniors and the disabled. Households with children occupy fifty
percent of affordable housing units (Marin County Affordable Housing Inventory, 2008). The
Continuum of Housing and Services, a collaboration of over thirty Marin organizations providing
housing and related services to the low-income and homeless populations, recommends that one
out of five (20 percent) housing units built for very-low income households should be for the
special needs population. In Larkspur, the City should plan to provide 18 units of special needs
housing out of the total very low-income need of 90 units.

The Marin Housing Authority also manages the Section 8 voucher program for low-income families,
which uses federal funds to subsidize rents for very-low income households. The household pays
30 percent of its monthly income towards rent, and the remaining balance is paid by the Marin
Housing Authority. As of 2008, the Marin Housing Authority provided vouchers under the Section 8
Housing Choice Program for 2,104 households, with voucher recipients living in all Marin
jurisdictions (see Figure 4). However, the data set is incomplete as there is no city information
listed for 26 percent of households receiving the vouchers (Marin Housing Workbook, 2009).

7 percent were Hispanic. A little over half of the applications came from families, and just under
a quarter of applicants (22 percent) were disabled and another quarter (24 percent) were
homeless. Nine percent of applicants were elderly. The remaining 75 percent of applicants to
the waiting list were from outside Marin, primarily from Oakland, San Francisco, Santa Rosa or
Richmond. Although the Marin Housing Authority does not collect employment data for
applicants, it is possible that many of these applicants work in Marin County and cannot afford
to live there.
There is a range of housing types for special needs groups, including independent living
(owning or renting), assisted living (licensed facilities), supportive housing, transitional housing,
and emergency shelter. Further, the vast majority of special needs housing is service enriched.
In other words, services are offered to residents to help them maintain independent living as
long as possible. Additional programs offered by the Marin Housing Authority assist special
needs tenants in maintaining their housing. These programs target services to frail seniors,
families striving toward self-sufficiency, and at-risk populations with substance abuse and/or
mental health disability.
Seniors
Senior households can be defined, in part, by the age distribution and demographic projections
of a community’s population. This identifies the maximum need for senior housing. Particular
needs, such as the need for smaller and more efficient housing, for barrier-free and accessible
housing, and for a wide variety of housing with health care and/or personal services should be
addressed, as should providing a continuum of care as elderly households become less self-
reliant. There is a dramatic increase in debilitating mental disorders such as dementia and
Alzheimer’s as people reach 75 years of age, resulting in a significant need in Marin for facilities
providing extensive medical care. Cities should plan for and facilitate opportunities for seniors to
remain with their families in “granny” or “in-law” second units, as well as housing where an “in-
home” caregiver can reside.
As of 2000, there were 1,640 households in Larkspur headed by a senior, or a person aged 65
or older. Of those, 59 percent owned their home and 41 percent were renters (see Figure 6).
Senior populations are more likely to have difficulty obtaining affordable housing as they are
often living on fixed incomes and are unemployed. In Larkspur, 57 percent of senior renters
were cost-burdened (paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing needs) in the
year 2000, while 27 percent of senior homeowners were cost-burdened. There were 66 seniors
in Larkspur living below the poverty level in 2000. (U.S. Census, 2000)
The population of adults over the age of 60 is projected to comprise 48 percent of the County’s
population by 2035, an aging trend that will
most likely be mirrored in the City as well                   Figure 6. Senior Householders by Tenure

rental developments, congregate care facilities, licensed facilities, and skilled nursing homes.
The Marin County Division of Aging provides information and assistance to senior residents
regarding the availability and affordability of different housing and assistance programs within
the County.
Many of the licensed facilities in Marin will not accept low and very low-income seniors with
Supplemental Security Income or Section 8 vouchers. Average basic rent is approximately $3,500
per month for a single bed (room, bathroom, and three meals/day), with additional costs for
couples or skilled personal care. Aggregate monthly costs for Marin rental units range between
$2,175 and $6,600, and some facilities require purchase of the unit on top of monthly fees (Marin
Division of Aging, 2008). The Marin Housing Authority manages nine public housing complexes for
low-income families, seniors, and disabled persons with federally subsidized rents, in addition to
numerous below market-rate or subsidized assisted living and independent living facilities in Marin
County managed by non-profits throughout the county.
The Division of Aging regularly publishes “Choices for Living,” a guide to Marin County senior
housing which provides summaries of each public or private facility in the County and the costs
associated with them. Though there is an abundance of market-rate senior housing facilities,
affordable housing facilities often have waiting lists or are closed to new applications, causing a
shortage of availability (Marin Division of Aging, 2008). The Marin County Department of Health
and Human Services may place individuals with no other options outside of the county, a practice
that can be both costly to the County and disruptive for the individual (Baird + Driskell, 2004).
Many supportive housing developments for the elderly have been built using the U.S. Housing
and Urban Development’s (HUD) Section 202 grants and 202/8 conversion programs, which
provide direct grants to build new facilities for very low income seniors and facilitate conversion
of public housing to Section 8 housing for seniors if certain economic thresholds are met. Grants
are distributed either to non-profit organizations or for-profit and non-profit partnerships for the
construction costs of building new facilities or converting existing buildings into senior facilities
and for rental assistance (Congressional Research Service, 2008). HUD administers several
other grant programs to help maintain affordable housing for seniors, including Section 236
grants which subsidize mortgage rates for property owners (U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development). Non-profit organizations have been instrumental in obtaining the
resources to construct and operate the developments, but housing authorities and for-profit
developers are also potential development project sponsors.
Large Families
Large households, defined as households with five or more persons, tend to have difficulties
purchasing housing because large housing units are rarely affordable and rental units with three
or more bedrooms are not common. The 2000 Census data show that 7 percent of Marin’s
households were large families. Slightly over half (57.4 percent) of large households in the
County lived in owner-occupied units. In Larkspur, there are 159 large households, which
comprise 3.4 percent of all households, compared to 186 households in 2000 (Claritas, 2008;
U.S. Census, 2000). In 2000, 77 percent of large families lived in owner-occupied housing and
23 percent were renters (U.S. Census, 2000).
Larkspur’s housing stock offers a choice of housing to large families with above-moderate
income. In 2000, 66.3 percent of owner-occupied housing units had 3 or more bedrooms, and
                                                  27

8.2 percent of renter-occupied housing units had 3 or more bedrooms. Comparing the
population of large households (186 households) with the availability of large rental housing
units (252 rental units and 2,068 homeowner units), Larkspur’s supply of housing for large
households appears to be adequate. Whether the available housing is affordable, however, is
not guaranteed. (U.S. Census, 2000)
With rents for a 3-bedroom apartment averaging $2,729 in 2008, many low-income families
may not be able to afford housing even if large units are available, and with a current vacancy
rate under 5 percent, the availability of large units is uncertain. A shortage of affordable rental
units available for large families can contribute to overcrowding conditions. Indicators related to
overcrowded housing support this assumption, since large families typically represent a
significant portion of the population living in overcrowded housing conditions (Larkspur Housing
Element, 2004). In 2000, 2.6 percent of households in Larkspur were overcrowded; 1.2 percent
were overcrowded with 1.5 people per room, and 1.4 percent very overcrowded with more than
1.5 people per room (U.S. Census, 2000). There is a concrete need for the construction of new
affordable rental units with three or more bedrooms for large families in the City. Countywide
subsidized housing complexes for families, such as those managed by the Marin Housing
Authority, mostly consist of 2-bedroom units, with a reduced availability of 3-bedroom units,
and most have waiting lists which may make housing unavailable even for qualified applicants
(Marin Housing Authority, 2009).
People Living with Physical and Mental Disabilities
People living with disabilities represent a wide range of different housing needs, depending on
the type and severity of their disability as well as personal preference and lifestyle. The design
of housing, accessibility modifications, proximity to services and transit, and group living
opportunities represent some of the types of considerations and accommodations that are
important in serving this need group. Incorporating barrier-free design in all new multi-family
housing is especially important to provide the widest range of choice, and is required by
California and Federal Fair Housing laws. Special consideration also should be given to the issue
of income and affordability, as many people with disabilities may be in fixed income situations.
As the population ages, handicapped-accessible housing will become even more necessary.
Chapter 671, Statutes of 2001 (Senate Bill 520) requires localities to analyze potential and actual
constraints upon the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with
disabilities and to demonstrate local efforts to remove governmental constraints that hinder the
locality from meeting the housing needs of persons with disabilities. In addition, as part of the
required constraints program, the element must include programs that remove constraints or
provide reasonable accommodations for housing designed for persons with disabilities.
There were 1,605 disabled persons in Larkspur in 2000, accounting for 14 percent of the City’s
population. Approximately one-third (36 percent) of disabled adults age 21 to 64 were not
employed. Of the total disabled population in Larkspur, 612 were seniors, comprising 26.9 percent
of people over age 65 (U.S. Census, 2000).
In 1993, the City updated all of its zoning laws, policies and practices for compliance with fair
housing laws. Consistent with the law, the City permits group homes (handicapped or non-
handicapped) with up to six clients without a permit in any residential zoning district. Residential
care facilities with seven or more clients are allowed with a conditional use permit in the
                                                  28

Administrative-Professional district. The A-P district is primarily an office district; a proposal should
undergo further review for the ease of the operation of the facility and to insure the safe
interaction of all uses in the district. It has been the City’s practice to consider waiving parking and
other standards for senior developments, projects for persons with disabilities, and other special
needs groups, depending on project specific analysis including location and unit sizes. The City will
continue to evaluate its zoning ordinance and other policies to identify and eliminate potential
barriers to the construction of housing for people with disabilities, handicapped dwelling
conversions (or adaptability), and appropriate site design. Further, the City has drafted and will be
considering the adoption of a formal process for providing reasonable accommodations to zoning,
building codes, and permit procedures for all persons with disabilities.
Buckelew Programs, Lifehouse, and the Marin Center for Independent Living serve people living
with disabilities. Buckelew Programs provides affordable housing, employment training and
opportunities, and mental health services for those struggling with mental illnesses (Buckelew
Programs, 2009). The Marin Center for Independent Living provides services to approximately
4,000 disabled adults each year, with the goal of helping their clients achieve independence and
become active participants in society. Many of their clients have low or very-low income levels
(Marin Center for Independent Living, 2009).
In June of 2003, the City approved a 40-bed residential chemical dependency and trauma
recovery facility to be operated by Marin Services for Women. The facility includes space for up
to 10 infants and children as well as administrative offices and outpatient counseling and
classroom activities. The mission of Marin Services for Women is “to advance community
recovery by supporting individual women in achieving an integrated recovery which links
recovery from addiction with personal, relational, social, and economic empowerment.”
Single Parent and Female-Headed Households
Female-headed households may need affordable housing with day care and recreation
programs on-site or nearby, in proximity to schools and access to services. These households,
like many large households, may have difficulty in finding appropriately sized housing. Despite
fair housing laws, discrimination against children may make it more difficult for this group to
find adequate housing. Women in the housing market, including but not limited to, the elderly,
low and moderate-income earners and single-parents, face significant difficulties finding
housing. Both ownership and rental units are extremely expensive relative to the incomes of
many people in this population category.
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, households
                                                         Table 16. Female-Headed Households

Farmworkers
State law requires that housing elements evaluate the needs of farmworker housing in the local
jurisdiction. ABAG does not assess the regional need for additional farmworker housing in the
Bay Area. For the City of Larkspur, the 2000 Census identified nine individuals as farmers or
farm managers. Most, if not all, Larkspur residents employed in farming occupations are
employed in wholesale and horticulture businesses and there are no localized needs for
seasonal or other types of farmworker housing (Larkspur Housing Element, 2004).
Individuals and Families Who Are Homeless
In order to comply with Senate Bill 2, the City must analyze the housing needs of its homeless
population, including the need for emergency shelter, transitional and supportive housing.
According to the State Department of Housing and Community Development, emergency shelter is
defined as housing that offers minimal supportive services, limits occupancy to six months or less,
and is provided at no cost to the family or individual. Transitional housing units are rental units
that are available to program recipients for at least six months, which specify a specific time when
assistance is terminated and recipients must move on- hopefully to permanent housing. Supportive
housing has no such limit on occupancy, and provides on and off site services to assist its residents
in retaining housing, and maintaining health and employment (HSC Sec. 50801(e), 50675.2(h),
50675.14(b)).

After the need is identified, the City must designate at least one zoning district that would allow
emergency shelters as a permitted use in order to meet this need. The City must also evaluate
and eliminate any governmental constraints to the development of supportive and transitional
housing by designating this type of housing as subject to the same zoning conditions as
residential housing, not subject to discretionary conditional use permits. Emergency shelters are
a protected use under the Housing Accountability Act (expanded under SB2), which means it is
illegal for jurisdictions to prohibit development of such a shelter without state-specified findings
based on substantial evidence.
Individuals and families who are homeless have perhaps the most immediate housing need of
any population group. They also have one of the most difficult housing needs to meet, due to
the diversity and complexity of the factors that lead to homelessness, and to community
                                                                   30

opposition to the siting of housing that serves homeless clients. According to a 2007 estimate
by the National Alliance to End Homelessness, there are 159,732 homeless individuals in
California, accounting for approximately 0.4 percent of the state’s total population. About a
quarter of this population consists of homeless people in families. The definition of
“homelessness” varies between federal, state, and local agency programs. For federal agencies
that provide funding for homelessness aid programs, the definition varies according to the
specific program in question. For instance, under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development’s Supportive Housing McKinney Vento Programs, homelessness is defined as
anyone who is literally homeless, living either unsheltered or in emergency shelters.
Homelessness and near-homelessness is an important countywide concern. Marin County
Health and Human Services, in conjunction with Project Homeless Connect, conducted the 2009
Point in Time Count of Homeless Persons which collected data to satisfy both HUD’s Supportive
Housing Program definition of homelessness as well as a broader county-wide definition which
included those individuals and families who were at immediate risk of losing housing
(precariously housed). The Point in Time Count, conducted every two years, provides a one-day
snapshot of the homeless population in the county, so data cannot be extrapolated over long
periods of time. However, it provides the county with a representative profile of the homeless
population which can be used to more effectively and efficiently meet the population’s needs.
Some key findings of the study are as follows:
(1)    Approximately 2 percent of Marin’s population (4,798 individuals) were either
       homeless or were precariously housed at some point in 2009.
(2)    Individuals surveyed listed “lack of affordable housing” and “loss of job” as the top
       two reasons for their homelessness, showing the far-reaching impacts of the
       economic downturn and the County’s prohibitively high housing costs (particularly
       rental housing) which keeps housing out of reach for many low income families (see
       Figure 7 for summary of factors).
(3) Families are the fastest growing portion of the County’s homeless population.
(4)    Over two hundred families with children were homeless (sheltered or unsheltered),
       and 1,002 families with children were precariously housed.
(5)    Children and youth (under 18) make up 26 percent of Marin’s total homeless
       population.
The 2009 Point in Time Count found 623 unsheltered homeless individuals in the County and
1,147 sheltered homeless individuals, adding up to a total homeless population of 1,770
individuals (based on the County’s criteria for homelessness). A total of 351 unsheltered
individuals and 726 sheltered (1,077 individuals) were found to be homeless according to HUD’s
criteria. An additional total of 3,028 individuals (1,187 households) were precariously housed.
Sheltered individuals are those residing in transitional housing or emergency housing.
Unsheltered individuals include people residing outdoors, in a vehicle, at a campsite, or other
similar areas.
On a few occasions, homeless individuals have been spotted along the old railroad right-of-way in
the south end of town and in Miwok Park. However, the Police Department verifies that there have
not been situations of homeless individuals occupying neighborhood parks, streets, or other public
                                                 31

facilities for shelter. Because Larkspur is not on major public transportation routes and currently
provides no shelters or services for the homeless, persons who become homeless in Larkspur tend
to go elsewhere. As the Point in Time Count did not separate homeless populations by jurisdiction,
the estimates provided above (see Table 17) are a rough calculation based on the percent of the
total county population by jurisdiction. Appendix C summarizes the capacity of emergency,
supportive, and transitional housing within the county, though because most programs tend to
operate at nearly full or full capacity actual availability of beds may be significantly lower.

as permitted uses subject to ministerial review, after meeting certain objective standards.
Parcels in these districts are located close to or directly on established transit lines on Magnolia
Avenue and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, and are generally less than a mile away from grocery
and other retail services (see the Zoning District Map in Appendix A). As allowed by state law
(65583(a)(4)(A)), the City will establish objective operating and management standards,
including the following:
    - The maximum number of beds
    - The provision of on-site management
    - The proximity to other emergency shelters (state law limits to 300 feet)
    - Length of stay
    - Security
Other standards such as floor area ratio and off-street parking requirements would be subject to
the zoning regulations for that particular district, no differently than any other use in the district.
The City will work with the applicant to make sure the operating and management standards do
not unduly impede on the shelter’s operation. The Zoning Ordinance will be further modified to
define residential housing uses as including transitional and supportive housing. These zoning
ordinance amendments will be completed by August of 2011, one year after the Housing Element’s
adoption (see program H9.H). In addition, the City will continue to facilitate the development of
affordable housing and provide whatever financial support possible to homeless service providers.
The City will also continue to support countywide programs such as New Beginnings to provide for
a continuum of care for the County’s homeless residents, including emergency shelters, transitional
housing, supportive housing and permanent housing.
“At Risk” Housing
Government Code Section 65583 requires each city and county to conduct an analysis and
identify programs for preserving assisted housing developments. The analysis is required to
identify any low-income units that are at risk of losing subsidies over the next 10 years.
According to the Marin County Affordable Housing Inventory, there are 4,221 deed restricted
affordable housing units as of 2008 in Marin County.
Countywide, there were 825 units eligible to convert to market rate units in 2006, based on
funding restrictions, with some exceptions (Baird + Driskell, 2004). Of the 825 units, 58 units
were designated in the Below Market Rate (BMR) program managed by Marin Housing
Authority, and are generally restricted permanently with a slight cost increase to cover resale or
legal expenses. Beginning in the year 2007 through 2012 there are 266 units at risk of
converting to market rate in Marin County. Of these, 91 are BMR units subject to resale
controls.
In Larkspur, there are 139 deed restricted housing units located in five housing developments.
Developments with affordable units include:
    (1) Cape Marin –– 20 BMR units which are deed restricted until 2019.
    (2) Edgewater Place –– 28 deed restricted BMR units built and managed by EAH.
    (3) Larkspur Courts Apartments –– 37 deed restricted BMR units under income
        restrictions funded through RDA and CDBG.
    (4) Larkspur Isle –– 28 BMR units under income restrictions and were recently
        approved by the City to convert from rentals to ownership.

    (5) Magnolia Avenue- 2 very low income units, income-restricted in perpetuity.
    (6) Drake’s Way- 24 very low income units, deed restricted until 2065.
This Housing Element contains program actions to preserve at risk units, including working with
the property owners and/or other parties to ensure that they are conserved as part of the City’s
affordable housing stock. A key component of the actions will be to identify funding sources and
timelines for action, as described in Section 4, Housing Policies and Implementing Programs.

Section 2. Housing Opportunities Analysis
Evaluation of the Current Housing Element
Overview
State Housing Element law requires an evaluation of the achievements of the City’s housing
goals, policies and programs adopted in the 2004 Housing Element. There are many factors that
affect the success or apparent failure of a policy or program, including what the City has done
and what other agencies or groups have done to implement the program. Other factors
affecting program success include the effects of the economy in general, decreasing availability
of state and federal funding for new below market rate housing, or lack of opportunity to
implement the program.
Summary of Overall Accomplishments and Key Findings
The themes of the Larkspur General Plan are to:
    1) Retain Larkspur’s character including the historic downtown and the scale of residential
        neighborhoods;
    2) Protect the quality of life, even giving it greater importance than the mobility of traffic;
    3) Preserve and enhance open space.
Within this context, there are a number of guiding policies in the 2004 Housing Element to
address housing issues and needs. A number of policies are related to affordable housing,
including the creation of new affordable units and the preservation of existing affordable units.
Policies and programs contained in the 2004 Housing Element are reviewed and analyzed in
Appendix B.
Larkspur’s affordable units since 1988 have come from new development as a result of the
Housing Element’s inclusionary policies. The units are in four projects: Cape Marin, Larkspur
Courts Apartments, Edgewater Place, and Drake’s Way. Some current City housing policies
include:
(1)   The City’s Inclusionary/In-Lieu Fee requirements (adopted in 2005), which require
      residential developments of five to 14 units to be comprised of at least 15%
      affordable units, and developments of 15 or more units to be comprised of at least
      20% affordable units.
(2)   Control the conversion of apartments to condominiums and prohibit the conversion
      when the vacancy rate is less than 5%.
(3)   Support development and retention of housing meeting the needs of all segments of
      society (families, elderly, disabled, low and moderate income, city employees,
      homeless, etc.)
(4)   Support the development of second units.
(5)   Retain existing residential units in commercial areas and support new mixed-use
      developments.

(6)    Maintain neighborhood scale through the enforcement of the floor area ratio
       standards on remodels and new construction.
(7)    Retain existing mobile home parks.
(8)    Support actions that balance employment generation and housing development.
An important aspect of successful Housing Elements is the willingness on the part of local
government to take on a more proactive role in implementing housing programs. Actions that
the City of Larkspur can take to provide sufficient sites with potential for meeting the City’s
housing needs, especially for very low and low-income households, include General Plan
amendments, rezoning, and zoning text amendments. In addition, the City can help to
coordinate with non-profit housing sponsors and other agencies to build affordable housing.
The City’s Residential Second Unit standards are in Chapter 18.21 of the Zoning Ordinance.
The City allows second units in the R-1 (single family), R-2 (duplex), and R-3 (multi-family)
districts and as specified in the ordinances governing planned development-zoning districts. The
second unit can be attached or detached and up to a maximum of 700 square feet provided it
meets current zoning standards and, in addition to the parking requirements for the main
dwelling, one additional parking space is provided for the second unit. The second dwelling unit
ordinance allows the legalization of existing illegal units on the same basis as new units.
Legalization could result in these second units being added to the known housing stock.
In general, the goals, policies, and programs in this Housing Element have provided a
comprehensive set of actions to meet the City’s affordable housing needs and provide a
diversity of housing types. The entire General Plan, including this Housing Element, reaffirms
the following City’s goals by: (1) acting as a guide for municipal decisions which affect the
quality and quantity of housing; (2) maintaining housing growth within limits of available
services; and (3) maintaining Larkspur’s present quality of life by balancing the availability of
housing with other environmental considerations.
The following specific changes are recommended for consideration based on a review of the
current Housing Element:
    1) Strengthen the City’s Residential Second Unit program as a viable way to provide
         smaller, affordable units by considering changing the requirement that to have a
         second unit, the parking must be brought up to current standards for the main unit
         and to allow for a higher building height limit for second units built over parking
         garages. Another action to be considered is lowering the parking requirement for
         the main unit.
    2) Continue to support the creation of a Housing Assistance Team (HAT), coordinated
         by the Marin County Affordable Housing Strategist, that would be available to assist
         the staff in implementing Housing Element programs, maintaining Housing Element
         certification and providing technical assistance on housing matters.
    3) Continue to seek opportunities for mixed use and transit-oriented housing by
         investigating the feasibility of amending Planned District zoning districts, creating
         affordable housing overlay districts, and creating incentives to add residential uses
         to existing shopping centers, such as the Larkspur Landing and Bon Air Shopping

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                        City of Larkspur Housing Element
        Centers. Also, to increase the number of units likely to be added within the C-1 and
        C-2 Districts, consider allowing a height limit bonus and flexibility in applying
        development standards (FAR, lot coverage) for the construction of affordable
        housing units above commercial.
    4) Continue to participate in countywide housing activities and coordination with other
        jurisdictions and special districts.
In the previous Housing Element, the City proposed investigating the feasibility of using funds
from the Affordable Housing Fund to convert existing market-rate housing to affordable housing
as a means to meet the City’s need for low-income housing. However, after thorough
consideration of such a proposal, the City found that a number of current residents would be
displaced if such a conversion occurred, as they would not meet the minimum income eligibility
requirements for low income housing in order to remain in their units. Additionally, they did not
have the higher income required to relocate within the same area. As a result of this study, the
City found that some market-rate housing does provide affordable housing to a specific
economic segment of the community.
Ability to Meet the ABAG Needs
In response to State Housing Element law, the City is required to provide an inventory of known
sites available for housing development as well as vacant and/or underdeveloped sites that can
accommodate Larkspur’s housing development needs determined by ABAG between June, 2007
and June, 2014. Multi-family housing at higher densities, especially in coordination with a non-
profit housing sponsor, can provide opportunities for workforce and special needs affordable
housing to be built. One incentive that can be offered to encourage affordable housing is to
allow those developments that meet affordability criteria to develop their projects at higher
densities. This allows cost items such as land, site design and long-term management and
maintenance costs to be shared across a larger number of units, thereby bringing down the
per-unit cost, and making it easier to achieve affordability goals. Projects that receive such
density “bonuses” must guarantee units (above the City’s inclusionary requirements) at below
market rate prices for a specified period of time. Though the City drafted a density bonus
ordinance, it was ultimately not adopted due to changes in State law at the time of the drafting.
The City currently refers to State law, but plans to adopt its own density bonus ordinance in
2011 (as described in Section 4, Program H7.A).
There are few remaining vacant or underutilized properties where the topography is suitable for
high-density development. Table 19 includes the ABAG’s Regional Housing Need Allocation for
the City and the number of housing developments built or approved in Larkspur from July of
2007 through the present (as of July 2010). It also shows the total projected number of units
that can realistically occur within the 2007-2014 planning period.
The City’s policy approach for achieving adequate sites, as expressed in this Housing Element,
has several components:
    1) Look to new second units and mixed-use housing developments as potential
        sources of housing;
                                                37

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                          City of Larkspur Housing Element
    2) Identify “potential housing sites” which offer opportunities for higher density
        housing to be built in the near-term;
    3) Where possible, modify development standards, such as those for second units and
        for mixed use housing, to create incentives for this type of development to happen;
    4) Provide flexibility in how development standards, funding incentives and other
        incentives are applied for the desired development to occur;
    5) Continue to facilitate the processing of current residential project applications and
        projects (e.g., the Rose Garden/CLASP).
It is important that potential high-density housing sites be located near transit, shopping,
services and the freeway where people can have easy access to nearby amenities. Increased
activity in appropriate locations creates a vibrancy and vitality in these areas. Generally, there is
higher intensity of activities around the business centers of the City and lower intensity of land
use farther away. For example, the Larkspur Downtown Specific Plan and the Central Larkspur
Area Specific Plan (CLASP) focus in more detail on potential mixed-use developments and
redevelopment opportunities close to shopping and transit in downtown.
Multi-family and Mixed Use Housing Sites
Several sites have been identified in the Housing Element as having the potential to attain planning
approvals for a significant number of affordable housing units in the near term (see Table 19). This
potential is based on existing development patterns, recent development trends, recent project
approvals, the properties’ site characteristics and pending applications or discussions with
applicants or property owners. The City has and will take actions to promote the development of
affordable housing on these potential sites by the year 2014.

Unit Affordability: The Drakes Way project was built by a nonprofit housing developer, EAH,
and the 24 units are deed-restricted for affordability to very low income households (earning
50% or less of the area median income) for 55 years, taking effect upon occupancy. All units
are now fully occupied and rent from $269 for a one bedroom unit to $1393 for a three
bedroom unit. EAH has successfully developed and managed affordable housing developments
for over 40 years (including Edgewater Place, also located in Larkspur) and their developments
are not considered “at risk” of conversion to market-rate units.

General Plan: Low Density Residential (up to 5 du/ac)
Zoning:               R-1, First Residential District
Existing Uses: Single Family Dwellings
Topography and Environmental Constraints: Various
Proposed Units: 8 affordable units (1 very low, 6 low and 1 moderate income units)
Actions Required: Ministerial approvals
Facilitating Actions Taken/Status: Inquiries regarding second units have increased in
recent years and we expect at least another eight over the next planning period (i.e., an
increase of two over the previous planning period) as information regarding the ability to create
second units has spread.
Unit Affordability: Larkspur’s Residential Second Unit regulations (LMC Chapter 18.21)
restricts second unit dwelling area to a maximum of 700 square feet and a minimum of 320
square feet. The breakdown of affordability is based on a countywide survey conducted by the
Marin County Community Development Department (available in the Marin Housing Workbook),
which found 80% of second units were affordable to low income households; of those units, 10
- 20% were affordable to very low income households and 10-20% were affordable to ELI
households. The study also found that 100% of second units were affordable to moderate
income households. While rental prices vary by locale, the countywide study provides a picture
of broader market trends which remain applicable to specific jurisdictions including Larkspur.

                      All three parcels are located in the Larkspur Downtown Specific Plan Area.
Existing Uses: Vacant lots.
Topography and Environmental Constraints: Intensity constrained by traffic on Magnolia.
Potential Units: Parcel 1: 8 units (1 low and 1 moderate), based on proposals presented by
                       potential property purchasers (site is currently up for sale); units would be
                       primarily above commercial.
                       Parcels 2 and 3: 2 units above commercial on each lot based on recent
                       development in the Downtown area and the existing development pattern.
Actions Required: Design Review to ensure consistency with Historic Preservation Overlay
District.
Facilitating Actions Taken/Status: General Plan policies encourage residential above
ground floor commercial. The Downtown District is on the National Register of Historic Places
and design review is necessary to protect the historic character of the district; past
development approvals have shown that it is not a detriment to development or the
development of affordable units (e.g., Blue Rock Inn project, 484 Magnolia Ave.).
Unit Affordability: Affordability of units is based on similar development of second-story
residential units in the downtown area or (in the case of Parcel 1) on the City’s Inclusionary
Housing Ordinance. Affordability guarantees will be stipulated in any conditions of approval or
other final documents associated with future projects.
Lot Consolidation Potential: Lot consolidation for these parcels is highly unlikely, as they are
not adjacent to each other and have separate ownership.

                      Specific Plan Area
Topography and Environmental Constraints: Existing historic structures; parking
constraints
Realistic Development Potential:                   4 units (4 very-low; above existing storefront
commercial). The proposed number of units is consistent with recent development trends and
the existing development pattern in the downtown. Storefront and Garden Downtown zoning
regulations require a minimum floor area of 450 square feet for an affordable housing unit
above first story retail, and 700 square feet for a market-rate unit. The table above calculates
the maximum number of market-rate units that could be accommodated on the second story
(total unit capacity), either by converting existing office space or through new construction,
based on the square footage available and the floor area of existing 2nd story units. The unit
capacity calculations are meant only to show the downtown area’s capacity for second-story
housing units, not to propose that all potential units will be built or to analyze the likelihood of
their construction. Site capacity may increase depending on the size and affordability of
proposed units.
Facilitating Actions Taken/Status: The zoning ordinance allows for second-story residential
housing above downtown retail as a permitted use, subject to a 25 foot height restriction. The
Planning Commission may approve a height exception contingent on the required findings
stipulated in LMC 18.44.040. Second-story residential units over first-story commercial units are
exempt from floor area ratio restrictions and require only one parking space per unit. Since
2004, two very-low income units have been approved and constructed above 484 Magnolia Ave.
Following the construction of these units, the owner of an adjacent building announced their
interest in doing a similar project. There are an existing 35 residential units (both single and
multi-family) above the downtown retail. In addition, affordable housing units have existed in
the historic Blue Rock Inn building (above a popular restaurant) for several decades, evidencing
the viability of affordable units in the historic downtown area.
        For future units, design review will be required to ensure development is consistent with
the Historic Preservation Overlay District. However, the streamlined approval processes of
second-story residential units in the area indicate that design review does not pose a barrier to
affordable second-story housing development in the downtown. General Plan policies encourage
residential above ground floor commercial. Many downtown buildings have second-story offices
which may be converted to living space at relatively lower cost than building up from a single-

story structure. There is the potential for more than four units; however, four is the most
realistic estimate at this time.
Unit Affordability: Unit affordability is based on market prices of existing second-story units
above downtown commercial. A below-market rate agreement between the City and the
property owner was recorded upon completion of two second-story residential units; the City
will actively encourage owners to record below-market rate agreements. Past development
approvals have shown that it is not a detriment to development or the development of
affordable units (e.g., Blue Rock Inn project, 484 Magnolia Ave.).
Lot Consolidation Potential: Lot consolidation for these parcels is unlikely, as many parcels
are not adjacent to each other and have separate ownership. The existence of established retail
or commercial businesses on the ground floor makes transfers of ownership unlikely.

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                       City of Larkspur Housing Element
of vacant properties have approached the City to discuss options for revitalization, which may
include housing units.
Actions Required: Design Review.
Facilitating Actions Taken/Status: Zoning Text Change: revised the C-1 and C-2 Districts to
allow for second floor residential as a permitted use, and reduced the required parking for
residential to one space/unit as provided for in the Downtown District. Design review is
required, though as demonstrated by the Blue Rock Inn apartments and the affordable second
story units on Magnolia Ave., design review has not been a detriment to the development of
affordable housing above first floor retail or commercial. There is the potential for more than
seven units; however, seven is the most realistic estimate, and given the potential size of the
units, very-low is a reasonable expectation in terms of income levels.
Unit Affordability: The affordability of units is based on market prices of existing second-story
units in the downtown area. The Affordable Housing Regulatory Agreement and Declaration of
Restrictive Covenants for the affordable second-story units at 484 Magnolia stipulates that the
units be rented to households of very low income, in perpetuity. Past development approvals
have shown that it is not a detriment to development or the development of affordable units
(e.g., Blue Rock Inn project, 484 Magnolia Ave.).
Lot Consolidation Potential: Lot consolidation for these parcels is unlikely, as many are not
adjacent to each other and have separate ownership. Lot consolidation of the parcels that share
ownership would not likely influence housing development. The existence of established retail
or commercial businesses on the ground floor makes transfers of ownership unlikely.

  * Note: estimated unit capacity is simply a measure of capacity; the objective for these  parcels in this planning
  period is a total of 90 units.
Total Area Size: 710,366 ft² (16.6 acres)
General Plan:             Commercial. The Commercial designation encourages residential over first-
story commercial uses and exempts them from floor area ratio restrictions. Second story
residential density is limited by parking and height restrictions and mixed-use housing shall not
exceed 21 units per acre.
Zoning:                   Planned Development District. The Precise Development Plan for the Bon Air
Center allows, with a conditional use permit, multi-family dwellings and residential uses over
commercial; the allowable height limit is 35 feet, and the current overall shopping center
exceeds its parking by over 100 parking spaces.
Existing Uses: Successful strip shopping center with various commercial/retail businesses
including general and specialty retail shops, restaurants, grocery, banks, and drug store.
Though currently fully occupied, the majority of the center dates back to the mid-1980s with
portions dating back to 1972. The primary property owner recognizes that the existing buildings
are old and outdated. The older portions of the center would likely need to be rebuilt to
accommodate housing above the retail. For properties north of Corte Madera Creek, the City's
Circulation Assessment Permit policies do not allow for an increase of even one p.m. trip over
an existing use except for vacant parcels, single family homes, and a residential project that
includes the noted percentages of affordable housing. Therefore, there is a disincentive for a
property owner to replace old retail space with new retail space as they would not be able to
increase the amount of retail space even though they have excess parking. The management
company has expressed an interest in mixed use for the property and the manager has
attended seminars on the subject. They have also indicated that they would stage the
construction in a manner that would retain tenants.
Topography and Environmental Constraints: None identified.
Potential Units: 90 units (21 du/acre; 42 very low, 43 low income, and 5 moderate)
                                                           47

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                       City of Larkspur Housing Element
Actions Required: Amendment to the Planned Development District, design review, and a
conditional use permit.
Facilitating Actions Taken/Status:          Conceptual drawing by an architect for part of the
Shopping Center to determine feasible number of housing units. (Note: projected unit potential
is below the likely capacity of the center). Concurrent processing of the Precise Development
Plan amendment, design review, and conditional use permit would be accommodated. The
Planned Development District allows for flexibility in the development standards for the project.
The previous amendments to the City’s Circulation Assessment policies allow for an exception to
the circulation assessment permit requirements for projects providing affordable housing.
Unit Affordability: Unit affordability based on minimum density appropriate to accommodate
lower-income households, as established by HCD. For Larkspur (considered suburban with a
population of less than 25,000), the minimum density to accommodate lower income housing is
20 du/acre. The shopping center’s Precise Development plan allows residential development at
21 du/acre.
Lot Consolidation Potential: Because the majority of the Shopping Center is owned by the
same family-owned company that has owned it before and since it was developed, lot
consolidation would not be necessary to meet housing needs.
Potential Non-Governmental Constraints and Opportunities
State law requires an analysis of potential and actual governmental and non-governmental
constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing for all income
levels. The Housing Element must identify ways, if any, to reduce or overcome these
constraints in order to meet the City’s housing needs.
Land and Construction Costs
The price of housing has continued to rise at a much faster rate than household income.
Contributing factors are the cost of land, materials, labor, financing, fees and associated
development requirements, sales commissions, and profits. Another factor has been the
perception of housing as a commodity for speculation. The typical cost to build an average
quality wood frame single family detached home in Marin can range from $126 to $160 per
square foot and more for custom-built homes. Construction costs for an average multi-family
unit are range from $300 to $500 per square foot. (Marin Housing Workbook, 2009)
Development costs in Larkspur are higher than in comparable communities because most
remaining lots have steep slopes, irregular topography, access, or unstable soils. The technical
and engineering costs of dealing with these factors on remaining sites are likely to be
particularly high because those are the sites that have been skipped over in the past precisely
because of the difficulty and high cost of development.
The typical land value for a single family home lot in Marin County ranges between $300,000
and $900,000 in a jurisdiction like Novato, or $1 million and $5 million in a jurisdiction like
Tiburon (Marin Housing Workbook, 2009). Vacant land within Larkspur is very limited. Based on
an informal staff survey of residential land costs in February of 2010, the average cost of a
single family lot in Larkspur is approximately $600,000 ($3 million per acre, with an average lot
size of 0.2 acres). The value of residential land in Larkspur has not been significantly affected
by the recession, and high land costs remain a substantial factor in the cost of providing
housing. Major contributors to the cost of land are the amount of land available and the
                                                48

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                        City of Larkspur Housing Element
density of residential use allowed. Other factors such as site location, attractiveness of the
neighborhood, difficulty of construction, proximity to community services, and any restrictions
on development can affect cost.
Geographic Constraints
The natural beauty of the San Francisco Bay, the abundance of hiking and walking trails in the
ridges beneath Mt. Tamalpais, and rolling acres of protected open space are largely responsible
for making Larkspur a desirable place to live, work, or visit. However, while these beautiful
natural features make invaluable contributions to the high quality of life in Larkspur, they also
limit the City’s buildable area.
Larkspur is bordered on the east by the San Francisco Bay, on the west and south by the Corte
Madera Ridge, and on the north by the Southern Heights Ridge. These natural features
confined the City’s historic development along narrow corridors that have since become major
transportation arterials. The Corte Madera Ridge is part of the Northridge Open Space Preserve,
comprising approximately one quarter of the preserve’s 1,000 acres managed by the Marin
County Open Space District. A majority of the very few remaining vacant residential parcels in
the City directly abut the Corte Madera Ridge. Their steep hillsides pose not only a financial
obstacle to building housing (requiring extensive grading and slope stabilization), but a high risk
to life and property due to natural hazards such as landslides, debris flows, and wildfires. The
majority of Larkspur’s existing housing units are moderate to high density multi-family units and
are built on the most feasible parcels for such development. (See Appendix D, Natural Hazard
Maps, for maps of fire hazard areas and seismic stability. Fire Hazard areas are established in
Ordinance 846 [Larkspur Municipal Code 14.10].)
Most of the City’s low-lying land in the east, directly adjacent to the Bay, lies within the 100-
year flood hazard zone. Much of this land is already developed with both high density (Larkspur
Landing area) and low density (Greenbrae) residential, commercial and industrial development
(including Marin Country Mart and Bon Air Center). In addition to the existing flood risk, the
effects of accelerated sea level rise may put development in the flood zone at further risk of
inundation and expand the flood zone to inland areas not currently at risk of flooding.
Considering the potential risks posed to existing development, further intensification of
development in the flood zone should be carefully examined by developers, businesses, and the
City.
Infrastructure Availability
Infrastructure, services and utility needs for future development are addressed through the
development capacity established in the Larkspur General Plan. They do not represent a
constraint to development as policies and programs are in place to assure that infrastructure
and services will adequately serve new in-fill development. Sites closer to services and transit
offer opportunities to provide in-fill housing with limited impacts on traffic conditions. It is
noted, however, that much of the existing pipeline infrastructure is aging and, as monies are
available to the respective agencies, sewer and drainage pipes will need replacement.
The Marin Municipal Water District (MMWD) is a special purpose district with the responsibility
for providing water services throughout southern Marin County, including Larkspur. The District
obtains 75% of its water supply from seven reservoirs located throughout Marin and 25%
through the transfer of water from the Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA). There have
                                                49

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                         City of Larkspur Housing Element
been restrictions placed on new water connections in the past due to drought conditions, but
there is currently no moratorium on new hook-ups.
MMWD plans for long-term supplies based on the build-out of the general plans of cities it
serves. MMWD’s operational yield (the amount of water that can be supplied in all but the
driest years) is 28,400 acre-feet annually (afa), while the average annual use within the district
is 29,745 afa (MMWD, 2008). The drop in yield reflects the below-average rainfall experienced
in the County (and the State) in the past five years. MMWD projects a growing supply deficit
over the next fifteen years, mainly due to reduced pipeline capacity for the districts that supply
water from the Russian River (including SCWA and North Marin Water District; MMWD, 2007).
Additionally, in 2009 SCWA announced that it would be reducing service between 30% and
50% as a result of reduced rainfall and storage in the Russian River (MMWD, 2009).
Without implementation of new conservation programs, MMWD projects that the annual deficit
in water supplies will grow from 4,200 afa in 2010 to 6,700 afa by 2025 (MMWD, 2007). This
scenario would constitute a “serious water supply deficit” and could impact MMWD’s ability to
serve new housing developments (MMWD Water Conservation Master Plan, 2007). However, in
2007 the MMWD Board of Directors approved a $44 million conservation program to help
mitigate the impacts of reduced water supply.
MMWD partnered with the Las Gallinas Valley Sanitary District in 1981 to develop a water
recycling plant, which now provides over 650 acre-feet per year of recycled water for irrigation
and other non-potable industrial and commercial uses to 323 service connections (MMWD,
2009). MMWD is also exploring desalination of ocean water as a long-term source of potable
water. MMWD built a pilot desalination plant in 2005 in Richardson Bay in San Rafael, and in
August of 2009 the Board of Directors approved a permanent plant in the same location with
the initial capacity to deliver 5 million gallons per day (mgd) and the potential to expand to 15
mgd.
To be eligible for water service, a residential structure to be served must be within 125 feet of a
water main, either an existing main or an extension of the main. Otherwise, a variance to the
standard must be obtained. As of 2009, the connection fee is $29,260 per acre-foot of
estimated annual consumption (MMWD, 2009). California Government Code Section 65589.7
requires that public and/or private water and wastewater providers, in their current and future
resource or service allocations, give priority for service hook-ups to proposed housing
development projects for lower-income households that meet the community’s share of the
regional need for lower-income housing.
Larkspur’s wastewater collection is provided by Sanitary District #1 of Marin County, which
serves the Ross Valley. Wastewater treatment is provided by Central Marin Sanitation Agency
(CMSA) at the plant located on Anderson Drive in San Rafael. CMSA is a joint powers agency
whose member agencies include the San Rafael Sanitation District, Sanitary District #1 (Ross
Valley Sanitary District), Sanitary District # 2 of Marin County, and the City of Larkspur. Sewer
capacity is not a constraint to housing development in Larkspur.
Financing
Financing for above moderate or market rate housing is not constrained for those who can
qualify. It is difficult, however, for first-time homebuyers without capital or equity to qualify for
                                                   50

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                            City of Larkspur Housing Element
financing without incomes of $100,000 or greater. For example, the income required for a
$400,000 mortgage at 7.5% is about $100,000, which requires a monthly payment of about
$2,800. In response to the faltering real estate market, lenders have also required developers
to shoulder more of the cost of development, making loans difficult to obtain both for
homebuyers and builders. Non-profit affordable housing organizations, which raise most
funding for housing developments from donations from the private sector, may also have
difficulty securing funds in the down economy. (Marin Housing Workbook, 2009)
Nationwide, there was a sharp drop in multi-family housing construction during the 1990’s that
contributed to low vacancy rates and rising rents. According to a study conducted by University
of Southern California demographer and planner Dowell Myers, the reason for the drop was due
to the loss of federal tax credits, local resistance to apartment construction, litigation and
liability issues, and population changes. Until the 1990’s single-family and multi-family permits
were fairly evenly matched in California, but in the past decade multi-family permits have
represented only 22 percent of the total (Baird +Driskell, 2004). Rental construction has
become increasingly costly due to the same economic factors affecting single-family home
construction. For these reasons many developers prefer to use scarce land to build units for
sale in order to realize an early profit and minimize risk. Units for sale are also easier to finance
during construction.
The current nationwide economic recession and flailing housing market have left many previous
homeowners in foreclosure, many of whom are now turning to the rental market. With the flood of
new renters into the housing market, multi-family housing may become more desirable for local
communities, thereby eliminating some of the financial disincentives to building rental multi-family
housing. However, as foreclosure rates in Larkspur are still relatively low, there is no indication that
demand for multi-family housing will be substantially greater in response to the economic crisis.
Community Concerns
Potential opposition to affordable housing exists in many communities throughout the Bay Area.
Design plays a critical role in creating new developments that blend into the existing
neighborhood, especially in higher density developments that might otherwise seem out of
place. Good design can help ensure that high-density developments are not bulky or out-of-
scale. Through sensitive design, a building’s perceived bulk can be significantly reduced to
create a development that blends with the existing character of the neighborhood. Design
strategies, which the City often requires of multi-family developments to minimize the
perception of bulk and create a blending with the community, do not necessarily increase costs.
These include:
(1)     Minimize building heights;
(2)     Break-up the building “mass” in its architecture and detailing (e.g., create several
        smaller buildings instead of one large building);
(3)     Vary the roofline;
(4)     Create a three-dimensional facade (rather than a massive, flat facade);
(5)     Step-back the building height, with the lowest part of the building towards the street
        and adjacent properties, locating the highest part of the building towards the center
        of the property;
(6)     Site the building appropriately in relation to surrounding buildings;
(7)     Use architectural design, landscaping, materials and colors that fit with the area;
(8)     Use landscaping to blend the buildings with the natural setting;
                                                    51

(9)    Provide for open space and pathways throughout the development.
The community’s most often expressed concerns are about the impact new development of any
kind will have on traffic congestion and the character of the community. These are very valid
concerns. Therefore, it is important that housing not only be designed to fit into the character
of the community but also be spread out throughout the community. For example, much of the
housing need can be met by mixed-use developments on various existing commercial sites, and
not solely concentrated on the few remaining vacant sites. Building on sites that are already
utilizing parking areas and traffic corridors reduces major impacts to congestion and may
enhance community character by locating residences within walking distance to employment
areas, shops, restaurants, grocery stores, and public transportation.
Working with Non-Profit Housing Developers
The key to the success of non-profit developers lies in three areas:
(1)    In their ability to draw upon a diversity of funding sources and mechanisms to make
       their developments work financially;
(2)    In their commitment to working cooperatively and constructively with the local
       community, including local officials as well as neighborhood residents;
(3)    In their long-term commitment to ensuring excellence in design, construction and
       management of their developments, thereby creating assets that are valued by the
       people who live in the developments as well as their neighbors and others in the
       community.
The Nonprofit Housing Association of Northern California (NPH) serves as a local networking
agency, advocacy group and resource organization for affordable housing developers in the Bay
Area and elsewhere in California. Some of the affordable housing developers and housing
services providers that have been active in Marin County in recent years include EAH, North Bay
Housing, Citizens Housing, and BRIDGE Housing Corporation. Though funding from the private
sector may be more difficult to obtain in the current down economy, non-profit developers have
remained dedicated to providing affordable housing throughout Marin, and the City will continue
to cooperate and collaborate with non-profit developers to ensure that housing is provided even
under depressed economic conditions. EAH’s Drake’s Way project overcame several financial
obstacles with the aid of government grants, private financing from local banks, and reduced or
waived fees from the City.
Potential Governmental Constraints and Opportunities
The City of Larkspur is approximately four square miles. The varied topography of this limited
area impacts opportunities for additional housing development. As with other cities, Larkspur’s
development standards and requirements are intended to protect the long-term health, safety,
and welfare of the community. The City of Larkspur charges fees and has a number of
procedures and regulations it requires all developers to follow.
Land Use Policies
There are many locally imposed land use and building requirements that can affect the type,
appearance, and cost of housing built in Larkspur. The Larkspur General Plan establishes the
locations where housing can be built and the density of units per acre. The Zoning Ordinance
sets physical standards for development (e.g. lot size, setbacks, height limits, floor area ratio,
                                                  52

parking requirements) and, when design review is required, it defines the issues to be
addressed. Table 20 below shows the City’s zoning districts which permit residential
development and their associated residential development standards.
Land-use controls can be viewed as a constraint in that they determine the amount of land to
be developed for housing and establish a limit on the number of units that can be built on a
given site. The General Plan land use designation “Low Density” allows up to five dwelling units
per acre. “Medium Density” allows up to 12 units per acre, and “High Density” allows up to 21
units per acre. Each of these densities can be increased by 25% for projects meeting the
requirements for an affordable housing density bonus as provided for by State Law.
The commercial land use categories in the General Plan encourage the development of
residential units above storefront commercial. In 2004, under the previous Housing Element,
the City’s C-1, Restricted Commercial, and C-2, Commercial, zoning districts were amended to
allow residential units to be constructed over storefront commercial as was already allowed in
the SD, Storefront Downtown, zoning district. Policy C of the Circulation Element of the
Larkspur General Plan states “Except for single-family homes and vacant properties, proposed
changes in existing use shall not add traffic to Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.” In 2004, this Policy
was amended to allow for the potential development of affordable housing units on existing
commercial sites north of Corte Madera Creek, as mixed-use projects, particularly for senior
housing.
Zoning and Development Standards (Including Permit Processing)
Zoning. Larkspur has traditionally encouraged, but not specifically required, high architectural
standards for new development. Current City zoning regulations require Design Review
approval for development or remodeling of planned developments and multi-family
developments and to ensure consistency with the City’s Historic Preservation Overlay Districts.
Most of the remaining developable sites have significant environmental constraints, which
require extensive review and analysis by the City (e.g., slope use permits). All City building
requirements are consistent with the California Building Code. General Plan and Zoning
Ordinance amendments adopted pursuant to 2004 Housing Element programs provide
additional incentives for multi-family housing, and allow increased densities in certain zones to
make affordable housing more feasible. Table 20 shows current residential zoning standards.
Government policies and procedures affect the supply and cost of housing. Land use controls,
such as zoning, have the greatest direct impact, but development approval procedures, permit
fees and building codes affect housing costs as well. Larkspur has historically permitted more
multi-family housing development than any other community in southern Marin County, and
multi-family units are the most common type of housing found in the City. Multi-family
development will continue in areas with immediate access to major roads and commercial
areas; however, much of the remaining residentially zoned land will be limited to single-family
housing due to the physical constraints of the property (e.g., access problems, visual
prominence, heritage trees, steep slopes and geological problems).
Though Larkspur encourages developers to submit proposals reflecting high architectural
standards, it is not a condition of development, and the design review process has helped to
assure “quality” development within the city. The City recognizes that high design standards
can increase construction costs and may conflict with the economics of low- and moderate-
                                                 53

income housing development. It has been found, however, that non-profit housing groups
(such as EAH) strive for a certain level of quality that has been acceptable to the City with little
change. The City has also allowed for design modifications to reduce construction costs, as
demonstrated in the Drake’s Way project.

The City’s parking requirements for single-family homes and second units (i.e., two parking
spaces plus two guest spaces for single-family homes) can be a factor in increased housing
costs. The parking ratios for multi-family developments are significantly less and vary according
to the number of bedrooms per unit and whether the units are rentals or condominiums. A
condominium project of 20 two-bedroom units, for example, must provide 47 parking spaces,
including guest spaces. These standards may need reexamination to allow for reductions in
parking for affordable housing projects or units located close to public transit. In the
commercial districts, parking over commercial requires only one space per unit. Under the
CLASP, parking standards for age-restricted units or affordable units may be reduced by the
Planning Commission, as was done for the age-restricted multi-family units in the Rose Garden
project. Parking standards for the CLASP and Downtown Specific Plan are listed in Table 21.
Parking requirements have not posed a barrier to single and multi-family housing project
approval or feasibility.
The City enforces energy conservation standards enacted by the State, in addition to its own
Green Building Ordinance (LMC 18.17) that encourages energy and water conservation (see
page 66, “Opportunities for Energy Conservation”). The standards may increase initial
construction costs, but over time will result in energy and fiscal savings.

Through the City’s code provisions for Planned Development and Residential Master Plan
Districts, the City is open to investigating ways to reasonably apply open space requirements
and to allow for flexibility in applying other development standards, such as FAR, height limits,
density, parking, etc., based on the location and design of the development, compatibility with
adjacent uses, and the type, size, and income levels of the occupants of the housing. In this
regard, it is recognized that smaller, more affordable housing near transit and services will
generate fewer trips, lesser area-wide impacts and will require less parking.

Development Standards. In addition to zoning and subdivision regulations and the policies of
the City’s General Plan and Specific Plans, the City has development standards (or “design and
improvement standards”) for subdivisions that are outlined in an Interim Design and Improvement
Standard Resolution dated December 1977. Currently, the City is relying on adopted ordinances
from Marin County and the City of Novato in the update process. A comparison of the City’s
current standards with other cities indicates that the City’s existing standards are not significantly
different from other jurisdictions in Marin County (i.e., Monahan’s Drake’s Cove subdivision was
approved with 30’ roadway right-of-ways). Likewise, curbing, sidewalks, street widths, and utility
standards are also similar or not significantly different. It is further noted that the driveway and
parking standards were modified to accommodate the EAH Drake’s Way development, which is
built on a steep hillside.
Because the City is relying on ordinances from other Marin County cities it is unlikely that, when
they occur, the resulting updated standards will differ significantly from the other jurisdictions.
The development standard update process will include an analysis of whether there are any
standards that could be modified to facilitate the development and improvement of affordable
housing (e.g., allowing the integration of curbs and sidewalks to reduce costs). It is important to
note, however, that there are few remaining sites in Larkspur where development has not already
been approved, which would require significant subdivision improvements. The street widths,
sidewalk, and utility standards are already established, and in most cases already in place, for infill
parcels.
Dedications and Fees. The cost of building permits and payment of impact fees can act as a
constraint to the development of affordable housing. Portions of building permit costs are
intended to provide cost recovery to the City for plan checking and building inspections.
However, according to the 2001 Marin County Grand Jury Report, Larkspur’s building permit
fees were only recovering 60% of the cost to provide the service. Since then Larkspur has
raised its fees in order to better account for the actual costs absorbed by the City; however,
they are still below full recovery. Therefore, while building permit costs are a financial factor to
                                                            55

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                         City of Larkspur Housing Element
be considered in the development of housing, for the foreseeable future, the fees are less than
the cost of providing the service and less expensive than many other jurisdictions. Table 22
outlines the City of Larkspur’s residential Planning and Building permit fee schedule (current as
of February 2010).
When development projects reach certain levels of increased traffic generation in the peak
commute hour, they are required to pay traffic impact fees. The fees are used to make
improvements to the primary circulation routes of the City to facilitate the increase in traffic.
Section 18.15.040 of the zoning code specifically exempts development of low and moderate
income housing units, second dwelling units, and single-family residences constructed on lots in
existence prior to 1986 from payment of the fees. Other market rate residential projects are
required to pay $3,399.00 per vehicle trip generated in the p.m. peak hour beyond the traffic
generated by the prior use of the property.
The City has also enacted a Street and Roadway Impact Fee to provide for the repair and
maintenance of streets and roads damaged by construction activity. This fee is 0.0075 percent
of a building permit’s valuation, except that, upon written request, the City Council may waive
the fee if the project is directly related to the construction of affordable housing units
(Resolution 11/03).
Park dedication or payment of in-lieu fees for the development of housing is required to
mitigate the recreational demand created by additional city population. Section 17.13.150 of the
Municipal Code allows the City Council to waive payment of the fees upon making the finding
that the housing is affordable housing as defined in the Housing Element. Likewise, it has been
the practice of the City Council to waive the in-lieu fee. Development of market rate residential
units are required to pay in-lieu fees based on the building type ranging from $5,677 per
detached single family residence to $3,429 per multi-family unit.
The City of Larkspur’s fees are not a significant constraint to the development of residential and
affordable housing for several reasons:
     1) Most planning fees are limited to time and materials consistent with State law and are
         comparable to fees charged by other cities in Marin (see Table 23).
     2) Fees are fairly standard and are not unduly burdensome or considered to be an
         impediment to development.
     3) Impact fees are the minimal necessary to support the infrastructure to serve the new
         homes and have not been updated in recent years, and therefore do not reflect the true
         impact costs.
     4) By ordinance, the City can, and has, reduce(d) planning and building permit fees for
         affordable units.
Development fees not controlled by the City include sewer and water connection fees and
school impact fees. These fees are assessed and administered by the individual districts. Sewer
and water hook-up fees can add significant costs to residential development and may present a
barrier to the development of affordable housing. In 2008, the Marin Municipal Water District
reduced its fees for second units and waived a deed restriction requirement for affordability for
cities in its jurisdiction (the deed restriction requirement was reinstated in 2009). MMWD has
                                                   56

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                                 City of Larkspur Housing Element
also regularly granted fee reductions to low income housing units, including multi-family units
and second units, since the early 1980s. These policies encourage and facilitate the
development of affordable housing units. The Ross Valley Sanitary District does not currently
have an established policy to reduce fees for second units and affordable developments, but the
City continues to support the creation of such a policy (see Section 4, program H8.B).

Permit Costs and Processing Time. Costs associated with the time it takes to obtain
planning permits for development can be significant (basic fees charged by the City are
summarized in Table 22). These costs are highly variable and are related to developer
overhead, financing, and start-up costs, as well as the length of the permit-processing period. It
is generally accepted in the building industry that the cost of construction increases as
processing time increases.
The cost to process planning permits for development is based on time and materials. However, as
Program H7.G in this Housing Element states, the City will “Consider waiving or deferring
development fees for housing projects targeted to lower-income households when needed to
ensure project feasibility.” It has also been the City Council’s practice to waive planning processing
costs incurred by staff. However, the fees charged by outside consultants hired by the City to work
on the project cannot be absorbed by the City and are the financial responsibility of the applicant.
Frequently, for large or complicated development projects, a planning consultant is hired to
process the application because a consultant can devote concentrated time to the application and
expedite the processing. It is, and continues to be, the policy of the City (Policy H7.6 and Program
H7.F) to “provide priority processing for all development applications that provide more low-and
moderate-income units than are required by the city’s inclusionary policy to reduce the required
processing time.” So, to the extent that an application can be processed quickly, the cost of the
consultant is partially offset in saved time.
A development application for a single-family house generally takes less time to review than an
application for a multi-family development. Currently, when a proposed single-family residence
is not subject to special environmental constraints and is in conformity with zoning, then only

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                            City of Larkspur Housing Element
design review is required. Once an application is deemed complete, it is generally scheduled for
hearing within a month, and after approval it is possible to process the required building
permits in one month. The design review process was adopted due to a concern about the
construction of “monster” homes on infill lots and the potential loss of existing smaller homes.
Inclusionary Housing Requirements and Affordable Housing Fund. The City’s Inclusionary
Housing regulations (LMC 18.31) require at least 15 percent of units in residential developments of
five to 14 units to be affordable to low and very low income households (rental) or low and
moderate income households (ownership). At least 20 percent of developments of 15 or more
units must be affordable to low and very low income households (rental) or low and moderate
income households (ownership). The ordinance also requires subdivisions of two or more parcels
where five or more additional units could be constructed to set aside developable parcels to allow
for the future development of the equivalent percentages of affordable units as outlined above.
The applicant or another for-profit or nonprofit applicant may develop the set aside land. The units
may be rental or owner-occupied. The method of providing inclusionary units from lot subdivisions
would be specified in the conditions of approval of each applicable subdivision.
A developer can meet the inclusionary housing requirements by an alternative equivalent action,
established by the ordinance as including following:
     - Dedication of vacant land suitable for housing to a non-profit housing development (fully
         improved, free of toxic substances, appropriately zoned, and large enough to at least
         accommodate the required number of units).
     - Transfer of inclusionary unit credits.
     - Construction of affordable units on another site or enforcement of required rental/sales
         price restrictions on existing market-rate dwelling units consistent with the ordinance’s
         household income restrictions.
     - Development of second dwelling units (may only satisfy 50 percent of the required
         affordable units).
In order to use an alternate equivalent action, the developer must show how the alternate action
will further the City’s affordable housing opportunities to an equal or greater extent than providing
the inclusionary units. The City Council has sole approval of alternate equivalent actions.
A developer of five to 14 units may satisfy the inclusionary housing requirements by paying in-lieu
fees for the affordable units. A request for in-lieu fee payment must include: a report containing
sufficient independent financial data showing why developing the affordable units is infeasible; all
overriding conditions that prevent the development from meeting the inclusionary requirements;
and an analysis of why the overriding conditions cannot be mitigated by incentives and
concessions offered by the City. Concessions and incentives include reducing site development
standards and reducing, waiving, or reimbursing fees. Projects that provide more than the
minimum required affordable units would be eligible for density bonuses and other financial
incentives (to be reviewed and approved by the City Council). Current in-lieu fees are listed in
Table 24.
Affordability of inclusionary housing units may be established by regulatory agreements, resale
restrictions (ownership units), or in deeds of trust in perpetuity, unless reduced by the City Council
to a specific term to meet the requirements of a financing institution or subsidy program. Thus far,
the City has not collected any in-lieu fees from approved developments, as the developments have

either accommodated the required affordable units or an alternate equivalent action. The Rose
Garden project met its inclusionary unit requirement by providing second units, cottages, and
affordable units within the market-rate development. The Drake’s Cove project donated vacant
land to non-profit housing developer EAH as an alternate equivalent action, thus facilitating the
construction of 24 very low income units at Drake’s Way.

Design Review. Multi-family development proposals are subject to design review. In practice,
the design review of a project by the Planning Commission has not added processing time to an
application, since most multi-family development proposals require Planning Commission
approval of a slope use permit, circulation assessment permit or tentative map due to the site
location or the applicant’s wish to subdivide or build condominiums. Discretionary permits are
always processed concurrently. Further, though design review is subjective to some extent, the
policy of the City Council and Planning Commission has been to focus on concerns with bulk and
mass and how the architecture accentuates or minimizes these components rather than the
specific details of the design.
The City’s design review criteria, as outlined in the Zoning Ordinance, are typical and
straightforward. They include the following:
      • The need for the design to be done by a person who under the building code is
         designated as legally competent to submit the project application.
      • The preservation of the natural landscape, particularly the preservation of heritage
         trees.
      • The relationship between structures within the development and with the neighborhood
         and other surrounding development.
      • The materials and colors used for siding, glazing, roofs, and concrete surfaces (what is
         acceptable is clearly explained in the ordinance).
      • Walls, fences or screening.
      • Design of drives, parking and circulation
      • Garbage and refuse collections areas
      • Signs
      • Exterior lighting sources
      • Landscaping
      • Construction impacts.
The findings for slope use permits focus on impacts on views and environmental characteristics
of the site (e.g., geological features, drainage ways, etc.), construction management measures,
best engineering practices, fire safety measures, health, safety, and welfare of persons residing
or working in the neighborhood, and General Plan consistency. Findings for Circulation
Assessment Permits focus on consistency with the General Plan and any applicable Specific
Plan, peak hour trip generation and impacts on intersections and roadway segments relative to
the General Plan standards, provisions for specific transportation system improvements that
                                                   60

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                             City of Larkspur Housing Element
may be required, payment of applicable traffic impact fees, and the public benefit of the
project.
As evidenced by the past approvals of affordable housing projects and projects with an
affordable housing component, e.g., Edgewater Place, Cape Marin, and Drake’s Cove/Drake’s
Way, the City’s criteria and design review process has not been detrimental to the construction
of affordable housing. It is also noted that in recent years the non-profit housing organizations
have recognized the need for designs that are compatible with the community and the aesthetic
quality of their projects further facilitate the design review process.
Environmental Review- CEQA. Many major projects, however, also require environmental
reviews (either negative declarations or environmental impact reports), public hearings and
extensive local review. The total length of time from the initial developer contact with local officials
to final map and approval can exceed two years. The City has taken actions to reduce processing
time and potential delay for residential projects by encouraging developers to meet with
neighborhood residents and allowing the combined processing of certain applications, and hiring
consultants that are able to focus on the project. Multi-family development proposals proposed on
non-environmentally sensitive land and in a multi-family zone can be acted upon within 60 days of
a complete application submittal. However, except for the Sanitary District Property and the
Central Larkspur Specific Plan area for which precise development plans have been approved,
there is very little vacant residential land remaining that is not environmentally sensitive. Much of
the remaining developable land in the City has significant environmental and land development
constraints, such as access problems, visual prominence, steep slopes and geological problems,
which require extensive review and analysis of proposed projects to assure appropriate site
planning and design. This is indicative of the fact that the City is close to build-out.
The City of Larkspur follows the procedures set forth in the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) and Guidelines and processing time for multi-family projects is dependent on whether
an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required. Barring significant environmental constraints,
CEQA Section 15332 (“Infill Development Projects”) allows the City to categorically exempt from
CEQA review infill development consistent with the Larkspur General Plan and Zoning
requirements.
Environmental review for projects, which are not categorically exempt and have no significant
impacts or which mitigate impacts to less than significance, normally takes less than 60 days to
accomplish, and is required by law to be completed in no more than 105 days from the time a
completed application is submitted. If the development 1) has potential environmental impacts
which are not determined to be mitigated to less than significant levels, or 2) requires further
study to determine the significant impacts, appropriate mitigations and/or project alternatives,
processing time may take longer depending on the complexity of the project and the scope of
impacts, mitigations, and alternatives to be analyzed. State law requires that all development
projects, not requiring legislative actions, be approved within six months from the date a
completed application is submitted if a negative declaration is prepared and processed.
Environmental review and action on a project must occur within one year if the project has
significant impacts and an environmental impact report is prepared.
However, the City, whenever possible, has taken steps to reduce the processing time on
housing developments relative to environmental review. For example, the City was able to
                                                   61

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                      City of Larkspur Housing Element
issue a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Drake’s Way/Drake’s Cove developments. Also,
the City prepared an expanded initial study and Mitigated Negative Declaration for the 2000
Larkspur Landing project. Most remaining residential sites in Larkspur, however, are on heavily
vegetated steep slopes that are more expensive to develop due to geotechnical and access
problems. Further, environmental protection requirements, including protection of endangered
species, may make it such that CEQA Section 15332 does not apply and additional time and
cost is necessary to process development permits including evaluating the effects of the project
and identifying appropriate measures to mitigate adverse impacts.
Another step the City takes in facilitating the processing of applications is to encourage pre-
application consultations with City staff. The purpose of the consultations is to help the
applicants understand the City’s development codes and regulations and issues that may arise
from community concerns. Applicants are also encouraged to meet early with community
groups and neighbors concerned with the proposed project as well as with any responsible or
potentially interested agencies. The City also has an internal Development Review Committee
comprised of planning staff and representatives from Public Works, Building, Fire Department,
and Customer Service staff. The Committee meets weekly to review and discuss recently
submitted applications and applications in process, as needed.
Ultimately, though, time requirements for review of the merits of a project are contingent on
project complexity, its environmental impacts, and the adequacy of the application submittal. A
single-family residence requiring Planning Commission approval, such as design review, can be
processed within 30 days or less of the submittal of a complete application and building permit
processing times are usually between one and three weeks after Planning Commission approval
and a complete building permit application has been submitted. The processing time is the
same for other types of small multi-family complexes or mixed-use developments (e.g., small
downtown commercial projects) that do not require preparation of a negative declaration or an
environmental impact report and are consistent with the historic character of the site or area, if
applicable.
Planned Development Districts. Larger development projects in a Planned Development
District begin with submittal of a Preliminary Development Plan that consists of written and
graphic materials describing a general development scheme and the parameters of
development. The Planned Development District allows flexibility in determining building
placement, height, bulk, and mass that will be most suitable for the site. The findings required
by the Planned Development District ensure consistency between the project and the goals and
policies of the City’s General Plan and any applicable specific plans. Generally, unless the
project is significantly complex, Planning Commission hearings are held within 30 days of when
the environmental review is complete. Final action is then taken by the City Council and this
can occur within 30 days of when the Commission has completed their hearing.
Subsequent to obtaining City Council approval of the Preliminary Development Plan, submittal
and approval of a Precise Development Plan by the City Council is required based on the
recommendations of the Planning Commission. The Precise Development Plan is more detailed
than the Preliminary Plan, but must be consistent with the development scheme of the
approved Preliminary Plan. Final action on Precise Development Plans usually takes 45 to 60
days after the application is determined to be complete. The subdivision of property also
requires submittal and approval of a Tentative and Final Map. Tentative Maps are often
                                               62

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                        City of Larkspur Housing Element
submitted and processed concurrently with the Precise Development Plan. Action on a Final
Map is taken after the conditions of the Tentative Map have been met. After obtaining approval
of the Precise Development Plan and the Final Map, the applicant normally applies for building
permits. Future development of individual lots within a Precise Development Plan area generally
require only building permits if the development is consistent with the approved plan. The
Planned Development process provides an alternative method to the variance process for
granting exceptions to the zoning ordinance. In the case of Drakes Way, exceptions were
granted for parking to allow reductions in grading; exceptions were also granted to density for a
hillside lot, covered parking requirements, minimum lot area per dwelling unit, building height
limits, and rear-yard requirements.
Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of Larkspur adopts the California Building Standards Code and subsidiary codes that
set minimum standards for building construction. The standards may add material and labors
costs but are the industry standard and considered to be the minimum necessary for the safety
of those occupying the structure. The City has amended specific provisions contained in the
Uniform Codes which can impose additional costs on residential development, particularly in
High Hazard Fire Zones: 1) Achievement of Class A roofing standards and fire sprinklers are
required for all structures in excess of 120 square feet that are located within a High Hazard
Fire; and 2) plastic pipe is not permitted in any structure exceeding two stories in height. The
City also uses the State Historic Building Code, as may be appropriate, to facilitate preservation,
rehabilitation, and restoration of historic structures.
In addition, the City enforces provisions of Title 24 of the California Building Code, specifically
those related to energy conservation and efficiency. While these requirements have tended to
be strengthened over time, resulting in increased construction costs, greater energy efficiency
results in lower operating costs for residents.
The City’s code enforcement program is complaint-driven. The Building and Code Enforcement
Officer enforces building and zoning codes with assistance from Planning staff. Most complaints
are resolved voluntarily through corrective action by property owners, although some require
additional actions through hearings and assessment by fines. In instances where work is done
without permits, double-fee penalties are assessed and the work must meet current code
standards.
Potential Housing Constraints for Persons with Disabilities
The City has not identified any specific constraints within the zoning or building codes relative
to the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities.
Consistent with Senate Bill 520 (2002), however, the City will continue to regularly evaluate its
zoning ordinance and other policies to identify and eliminate potential barriers to the
construction of housing for people with disabilities, handicapped dwelling conversions (or
adaptability), and appropriate site design.
The most likely types of constraints that would occur would be relative to the placement of
access ramps or other structures designed for access into a designated setback area or
exceeding the height limit for an elevator shaft or related mechanical equipment. These types
of issues are partially addressed through the listed exceptions for structures that can extend
into the setback areas and the types of structures that exceed the height limit. The exceptions
                                                   63

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                       City of Larkspur Housing Element
to the setbacks do not specifically list wheelchair ramps but a ramp would be similar to a
landing place and outside stairway, which are listed as exceptions. Elevator shafts are
specifically listed as exempt from the height limit as long as they are minimum necessary for
the normal function of the elevator. With respect to parking standards, all new development is
expected to meet the City’s standards; however, when existing parking areas are upgraded and
are modified to provide handicapped parking, the City recognizes that a space or spaces may be
eliminated to accommodate the handicapped parking and allows for this to occur.
The City also has a variance process, which a person can apply for to seek relief from the
zoning regulations if necessary. To date, the City has been able to accommodate building
permits for accessible facilities and no variances have been requested. Further, the Larkspur
Zoning Ordinance has previously been updated to define “family” within the context of Fair
Housing laws and to allow for group homes as a permitted use in each of the residential
districts as well as in the downtown and general commercial districts. Pursuant to Program H9.H
in this Element, the definition of group homes (both handicapped and non-handicapped) will be
amended to specify the inclusion of transitional and supportive housing.
The Ordinance does not restrict the number of persons living in a group home for the
handicapped, but limits other group homes to six clients or less. Except for this limit on group
homes for the non-handicapped, there are no particular conditions or use restrictions for group
homes, including those that provide transitional, supportive, or other services on-site, and the
City does not regulate the siting of special need housing in relationship to one another. With a
ministerial approval, the City’s Zoning Ordinance permits group homes for the handicapped (no
limit on number of persons) and group homes for the non-handicapped (up to six persons) in all
of the residential zoning districts (R-1, R-2, R-3 and MHP-Mobile Home Park) and the General
Commercial District (C-2).       Residential care homes are conditionally permitted in the
Administrative and Professional District (A-P). In June of 2003, the City approved a conditional
use permit for Marin Services for Women to develop a 40-bed residential care facility in the A-P
District to meet the needs of individual women in receiving integrated recovery assistance,
including space for infants and children.
Although these methods of addressing the accommodation needs of persons with disabilities
have been adequate so far, the City recognizes the need for a formal procedure or policy of
handling requests for reasonable accommodations that require exceptions to the zoning and
building codes. A reasonable accommodation ordinance has been drafted, but needs further
internal and public review before adoption is considered. A program to address this need has
been included in the implementing programs of this Element (Program H9.C).
Second Units
A second dwelling unit is a small unit, attached or detached to the main house, which provides
complete independent living facilities for one or more persons. In 2003, the State of California
adopted legislation that required the permitting of second units to be a ministerial process,
meaning that local jurisdictions must allow the construction of second units by-right, though
subject to jurisdiction-defined building and design standards. Consistent with State law, the City
amended its Zoning Ordinance to allow the construction of second units by-right, subject to
building and design standards specified in the Residential Second Dwelling Unit Ordinance (LMC
18.21).
Second units must meet the following standards as specified in LMC 18.21:
                                                 64

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                         City of Larkspur Housing Element
    a) Only one second unit allowed per parcel developed with a single-family home, either
        attached or detached from the main unit.
    b) The floor area must be between 320 and 700 square feet.
    c) Either the single-family unit or the second unit must be occupied by the property owner.
    d) Detached second units must meet the requisite setback and height limitations for
        accessory buildings in the appropriate zoning district. Attached second units must meet
        the same requirements for the main dwelling in the appropriate zoning district.
    e) One parking space, covered or uncovered, must be provided in addition to the existing
        parking spaces required for the main dwelling, subject to topographical, fire and safety
        hazard conditions.
    f) The second unit must be rented, leased, or provided without compensation.
    g) The second unit may be either a studio or one-bedroom unit.
    h) The design of the second unit must be compatible with that of the existing main unit,
        and impacts on neighboring properties must be minimized (i.e. opaque glass on second-
        story second units).
According to a countywide survey conducted in 2008, 80 percent of second units are affordable
to low income households, with 10 to 20 percent affordable to ELI households and 10 to 20
percent affordable to very low income households. About 10 percent of units are occupied by
family relatives, caretakers, or employees who pay no rent. Additionally, second units are
between four and 14 percent more affordable than similarly sized rental units in apartment
complexes. In Marin County, almost 90 percent of second units are one-bedroom units, with
studio and two-bedroom units comprising the remaining 10 percent in fairly equal proportions
(Marin County Community Development Agency, 2009). In Larkspur, second units may only be
studio or one-bedroom units. One-bedroom units are particularly suited to the needs of single-
person senior households, which constitute 15 percent of households in Larkspur, in addition to
other low-income single or two-person households.
Some of the unique benefits of second units are as follows:
(1)   They provide flexibility for the owner of the main home (they can be an apartment for
      elderly parents or other family member, or a source of income);
(2)   When rented they help make home-ownership affordable for the owner of the home;
(3)   They can provide flexibility for seniors or other homeowners who rent their primary
      dwelling because they still want to live in the same neighborhood;
(4)   They provide lower cost housing because the units tend to be small and there are no
      extra land costs (surveys show that no rent is collected for half of the units);
(5)   To fit in to existing neighborhoods the units are small, limited to no more than 700
      square feet.
Between 1999 and 2006, the City issued permits for six second units, two of which were
affordable to ELI households and four affordable to moderate income households. In the 2007
to 2014 planning period, the City anticipates to produce the same volume at similar affordability
levels, meeting two percent of the very low income housing need and five percent of the
moderate income housing need.

Housing Opportunities Analysis                                             City of Larkspur Housing Element
Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Housing Elements are required to identify opportunities for energy conservation. Energy costs
can be a substantial portion of housing costs. Effective energy conservation measures built into
or added to existing housing can help residents manage their housing costs over time and keep
lower income households operating costs affordable. There are a number of programs offered
locally through Pacific Gas & Electric, local non-profit organizations, and the State of California
that provide cost-effective energy saving programs. PG&E’s Energy Partners program provides
income-qualified customers free energy efficient appliances, energy education, and home
weatherization to help reduce their energy use. State and federal appliance standards now
require manufacturers to produce and sell appliances according to specified energy-
consumption performance criteria, and the Energy Crisis Intervention Program, funded by the
State Department of Economic Opportunity, helps low income residents pay delinquent energy
bills to avoid interruption of service. The City has made information about these energy
conservation programs available to the public.
The California Human Development Corporation runs a “weatherization” program for low-
income households and additional programs may be forthcoming with recent increases in
energy costs. Other significant areas in which the City of Larkspur is encouraging energy
conservation in new and existing housing include:
     1) Application of State residential building standards that establish energy performance
         criteria for new residential buildings (Title 24 of the California Administrative Code).
     2) Appropriate land use policies and development standards that reduce energy
         consumption, such as promoting more compact, walkable developments and housing
         close to transit, jobs, community facilities and shopping; encouraging in-fill
         development; planning and zoning for multi-use and higher density development;
         permitting common walls and cluster development; and promoting passive and active
         solar design elements and systems in new and rehabilitated housing.
     3) The adoption of a Green Building Ordinance in 2007, designed to encourage water and
         resource conservation, reduce construction waste, increase energy efficiency in
         buildings, and promote buildings that are efficient and economical to own and operate.
         The Ordinance applies to any new construction project 500 square feet or greater,
         including residential or commercial building additions. Projects must comply with green
         building standards and guidelines established by the U.S. Green Building Council (LEED
         standards), Build it Green, or any other standards identified by the City Council. (Please
         see Larkspur Municipal Code 18.17 for full text of ordinance). The Ordinance may be
         replaced in the future with the State’s CALGreen building code, which has similar
         requirements and standards for new construction.
     4) Through participation in Marin Green BERST, a countywide collaborative of municipal
         employees and industry experts formed to create uniform green building standards as a
         model for all County jurisdictions.
Through these and other conservation measures the City seeks to help minimize the percentage of
household income that must be dedicated to energy costs as well as minimize the use of
nonrenewable resources.

Section 3. Housing Vision, Goals, and Objectives
Vision for Housing in Larkspur
The purpose of the Larkspur’s Vision of Housing in the Year 2020 helps to define what the
community of Larkspur values, and to take a positive, constructive look at Larkspur and how
housing fits into its future. With a clearer idea of what it is we want our community to be like,
we can chart a more meaningful and effective course to get there. Further, it is important for
the vision and values expressed in the Housing Element to be consistent with those of the
entire Larkspur General Plan. (Note: Though the following vision statements appear relevant
today, they will be reviewed as the community looks to the year 2030 through the General Plan
update process to ensure they continue to reflect the community’s values and vision.)
The following Vision of Housing expresses the values of the community:
1.      People can live, work and play here.
2.      We have housing choices to fit different needs. We have a mix of residential and non-
        residential in our downtown area, a significant percentage of rental apartments, and
        variety of housing types.
3.      We value human dignity and continue to enhance our economic diversity.
4.      We have and encourage creativity in design and types of housing.
5.      We have support systems and housing in place to help the disenfranchised (homeless,
        elderly, disabled, and others in need).
6.      Open spaces, environmentally sensitive areas, and the coastline have been sustained. The
        natural environment is beautiful and fragile natural systems work well.
7.      Our City is friendly, with lots of civic pride, tradition, interaction and community
        involvement.
8.      We coordinate with other jurisdictions to address important housing issues in creative and
        effective ways.
Housing Goals
The City of Larkspur is committed to working with other agencies and non-profit organizations
to maximize affordable housing opportunities that may exist. It is also important to ensure a
“fit” of new housing with Larkspur’s high quality residential and commercial neighborhoods. The
Housing Element strives to achieve the following goals:
HG Goal 1:       Ensure the City’s commitment to meeting housing needs.
HG Goal 2:       Protect and enhance existing housing, community character and resources.
HG Goal 3:       Provide new housing and address affordable housing and other special needs
                 housing.
Housing Objectives
Policies and programs establish the strategies to achieve the Housing Element goals outlined
above and the maximum number of units that can be rehabilitated, conserved, or constructed.
The City’s objectives (or targets) are described under each program and summarized in
Appendix A. Assumptions are based on past program performance, modifications proposed to
the programs to achieve better results, construction trends, land availability, and future
                                                   67

        Objective:          Provide equitable public services throughout the City.
        Timeframe:          Ongoing
H3. Housing Design: Assure that new housing is well-designed and of an
appropriate scale to enhance our neighborhoods and community as a whole.
H3.1    Design that Fits into the Neighborhood Context. To maintain neighborhood
        identity, sense of community and prevent overbuilding of the property, the design of
        new housing should have a sensitive transition of scale and compatibility in form to the
        surrounding area.
        Implementing Programs
             H3.A Family Housing Criteria. Encourage developers to submit proposals that
        conform to the following family housing criteria:
        a) Variety. For a family housing project to attract families with a wide range of
              incomes, a plan should contain a variety of unit and lot sizes. Structures on smaller
              than standard size lots should be built in a scale appropriate to the lot, and the
              various-sized units should be interspersed throughout a project.
        b) Identity. Each dwelling unit should be designed with an architectural character that
              promotes a sense of identity for the residents.
        c) Autonomy. Where possible, legal constraints should be removed and family dwellings
              should be so designed as to allow the owner the freedom to make modifications that
              are not detrimental to a project as a whole.
        d) Storage, including attics and basements. Family units have a critical need for
              storage and should be provided with an ample volume. These spaces can also
              provide area for many of the recreation needs of a family.
        e) Private open space. A family unit should have a significant amount of useable open
              space that is a direct extension of the interior living area, directly accessible to the
              unit. The area should be suitable in terms of solar orientation and security for
              activities such as passive and active play, gardening, entertaining, etc. In some
              instances, it may be appropriate to provide increased common areas to compensate
              for reduced private open space.
                                                   71
Housing Policies and Implementing Programs                              City of Larkspur Housing Element
        f) Number of bedrooms. A family housing project should have a reasonable mix of
              two- and three- bedroom units.
        g) Floor area. Ample floor area should be provided for each unit consistent with the
              variety and number-of-bedrooms criteria. Living areas in a variety of sizes should be
              provided.
        h) Laundry. Each unit should have space and hookups necessary for the provision of a
              washing machine and dryer.
        i) Kitchens. Kitchens should have ample counter space and storage and a natural light
              source.
        j) Intangibles. Security, privacy, and accessibility are three interrelated characteristics
              of housing that cover a great deal of territory, and individual families would feel
              varying degrees of need for each. Some of the more obvious needs are for visual
              privacy in the private outdoor space, acoustical privacy between units, security
              provided by access to neighbors and physical security against intruders.
        k) Solar access. Each unit should be designed to maximize solar access to the extent
              feasible.
        Responsibility:     Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
        Financing:          Staff time; application fees.
        Objectives:         Family housing that is compatible with the neighborhood.
        Timeframe:          Ongoing
H4. Existing Housing and Neighborhoods Preservation: Protect and enhance the
housing we have and ensure that existing affordable housing “at risk” of conversion
to market rates will remain affordable.
H4.1    Preservation of Residential Units. The City will discourage the conversion of
        residential units to other uses and regulate conversions, to the extent permitted by law.
H4.2    Condominium Conversions. Prohibit conversion of existing multi-family rental units to
        market rate condominium units unless the City’s rental vacancy rate is above 5.0 percent,
        as determined by the State of California Finance Department annual Population Estimates
        or an alternative source approved by the City Manager and Planning Director. Exceptions
        include limited equity cooperatives, co-housing and other innovative housing proposals that
        are affordable to low- and moderate-income households.
H4.3    Protection of Existing Affordable Housing. The City will strive to ensure that
        affordable housing provided through government subsidy programs, incentives and deed
        restrictions remains affordable over time, and intervene when possible to help preserve
        such housing.
H4.4    Maintenance and Management of Quality Housing and Neighborhoods. The
        City will encourage good management practices and the long-term maintenance and
        improvement of existing housing. The City will encourage programs to rehabilitate
        viable older housing and to preserve neighborhood character and, where possible, retain
        the supply of very low to moderate-income housing.
H4.5    Community Preservation. Assure the retention of the character of older residential
        areas by protecting the residences of greatest significance, and ensure the safety of
                                                     72

        market rates and work with the property owners and/or other parties to ensure that
        they are conserved as part of the county’s affordable housing stock. Identify funding
        sources and timelines for action, and prepare an ordinance requiring a one year notice
        to residents, the City and the Marin Housing Authority of all proposed conversions of
        affordable housing units to market rents.
        Responsibility: Planning Department, City Manager, and City Council in cooperation
        with the County
        Financing:          Staff time
        Objectives:         Protection of affordable housing (conserve the 113 deed restricted

         H4.C Inspections of Multi-Family Residences. The Larkspur Fire Department
        will continue to provide inspections of multi-family residences that are most at risk for
        fire or other life-safety hazards. As appropriate, the Fire Department, Building
        Inspector, and Customer Service personnel will provide information to property owners
        regarding the availability of housing rehab programs and other financial resources.

        Objective:          Protection of existing housing stock.
        Timeframe:          Ongoing
H5. Housing and Jobs Linkage: Promote the creation of housing near the workplace
and, if it makes sense in the future, establish non-residential use contributions to
affordable workforce housing.
H5.1    Housing for Local Workers. City will strive to provide an adequate supply and variety
        of housing opportunities to meet the needs of Larkspur’s workforce and their families,
        that is within the range of their household income.
H5.2    Contributions for Workforce Housing from Non-Residential Uses. Local housing
        needs for local workers must be considered when reviewing non-residential development
        proposals. At such time that it appears job generation will substantially increase in the
        future the City will investigate and consider a requirement that non-residential uses
                                                    73

Housing Policies and Implementing Programs                               City of Larkspur Housing Element
        contribute to the provision of affordable workforce housing by techniques such as in-lieu
        fees, provision of housing or other alternatives of equal value. Currently, job generation
        is projected to decrease to about 1 percent between 2010 and 2015 (Marin Housing
        Workbook,2009).
        Implementing Programs
         H5.A Identify Existing Employee Housing Opportunities. As appropriate, work
        with local school districts, other public agencies, and existing businesses to seek
        opportunities, as they become available, for helping their employees find needed
        housing. Seek the commitment of other organizations, such as the Marin Board of
        Realtors to have their members encourage employers to address employee-housing
        opportunities.

        Objectives:         Employee housing opportunities provided by local entities.
        Timeframe:          Ongoing, as time allows.
H6. Variety of Infill and a Balance of Housing Choices: Maintain a diverse population
by providing a variety of choices in the type, size, cost and location of new housing
and more efficient use of existing housing, including the creative and efficient use of
vacant land and the redevelopment of built land within established development
areas to support local transit and services, maximize sustainability, and help
maintain our environment and open space.
H6.1    Diversity of Population. Consistent with the community’s housing goals, it is the
        desire of the City to meet its share of the regional housing need and to maintain a
        diversity of age, social and economic backgrounds among residents throughout Larkspur
        by matching housing size, types, tenure, and affordability to household needs.
H6.2    Variety of Housing Choices. In response to the broad range of housing needs in
        Larkspur, the City will strive to promote a diversity of housing types, including single-family
        detached and attached residences, mobile homes, multi-family rental and ownership units,
        second units, and units combined with non-residential uses.
H6.3    Transit-Oriented Development Incentives. The City will maintain existing higher
        land use densities near public transit systems, and will provide incentives for housing
        developments within an easy walking distance of transit stops, where reduced
        automobile use and parking requirements are possible.
H6.4    Regional Transportation/Housing Activities.                   The City will facilitate the
        development of transit-oriented housing development by using the incentives and other
        means provided through regional transportation plans, to the extent they apply to
        Larkspur.
H6.5    Mixed         Use    Housing.      Well-designed     mixed-use      residential/non-residential
        developments are highly encouraged by the City where residential use is appropriate to
                                                   74

Housing Policies and Implementing Programs                             City of Larkspur Housing Element
        the setting and development impacts can be mitigated. The City has provided the
        following incentives to encourage mixed use development in appropriate locations:
        modified the Circulation Assessment Permit Ordinance to allow for the development of
        affordable housing north of Corte Madera Creek; developed more flexible parking
        requirements to reflect peak period overlap for mixed use projects; and related
        permitted residential density and parking requirements to unit size (i.e., allowing fewer
        parking spaces for small units, affordable housing, or units restricted to seniors).
H6.6    High Potential Housing Opportunity Areas. Given the diminishing availability of
        developable land, the City will identify housing opportunity areas and sites where a
        special effort will be made to provide workforce and special needs affordable housing.
        The City will take specific actions to promote the development of affordable housing
        units by the year 2014 on these sites (identified in the Implementing Programs).
H6.7    Retention and Expansion of Multi-Family Sites at Medium and Higher Density.
        The City will protect and strive to expand the supply and availability of multi-family infill
        housing sites for affordable workforce housing by making the most efficient use of these
        sites in meeting local housing needs and striving to make sites competitive for subsidies.
        The City will not redesignate or rezone residential land for other uses or to lower
        densities without redesignating or rezoning equivalent land for higher density multi-
        family development.
        Implementing Programs
         H6.A Work with Developers. The City will work with developers of non-traditional and
        innovative affordable housing approaches in design, construction and types of housing that
        meet local housing needs, especially for extremely and very low income households.

        Timeframe:          Ongoing.
         H6.D Implement Mixed Use Development Opportunities. Encourage mixed
        residential/commercial uses on those parcels where a mix of uses is feasible and
        appropriate, consistent with the General Plan, including: (1) residential over first floor
        commercial in the C-1 and C-2 commercial zoning districts, (2) live/work units in the
        commercial and industrial districts, (3) reduced parking requirements for mixed-use with
        residential in commercial and industrial districts, and (4) allow for the construction of
        affordable housing, particularly housing for seniors consistent with modifications to the
        Circulation Assessment Permit Ordinance and Planned Development Zoning Districts
        made under previous Housing Element programs.

        Timeframe:          Ongoing
         H6.F Facilitate Development at Potential Housing Opportunity Sites.
        Facilitate the construction of affordable housing at key sites to meet the jurisdiction’s
        “fair share” of the regional housing need for lower income households, including
        extremely low and very low income households. Ensure that local affordable housing
        developments will be competitively positioned to access affordable housing finance
        sources (such as tax credits and tax-exempt bonds). Specific steps and the schedule (in
        parenthesis) are as follows:
        a) Facilitate the development of affordable housing, especially for very low and
              extremely low income housing, by using in lieu housing funding resources and other
              means to assist in on-and off-site mitigation that may be required.
        b) Consistent with CEQA Section 15332 (“Infill Development Projects”), seek
              opportunities for infill development consistent with the General Plan and Zoning
              requirements that can be categorically exempt from CEQA review.
        c) Investigate the feasibility of implementing variable density requirements as a tool to
              encourage developers to build a greater volume of smaller, affordable units in
              certain zoning districts (i.e. R-3, commercial, etc.).
        d) Investigate amending the Zoning Ordinance to require minimum densities in multi-
              family residential and mixed-use districts to discourage underutilization of parcels
              and encourage tailored development envelopes.

         H6.G Implement Actions to Address Remaining Very Low Income Housing
        Need. Work with developers, other agencies and the community to address the very
        low and extremely low income portion of Larkspur’s housing need by offering incentives
        such as density bonuses, options for clustering units, mix of unit types, second units,
        “in-lieu” housing funds, fast-track processing, and reduced fees.

        H6.H Implement Actions for the North End of Magnolia Avenue and other
        Commercial Zoned Lands. Encourage mixed residential/commercial uses on those
        parcels where a mix of uses is feasible and appropriate, consistent with the General
        Plan. Refer to Program H6.F above.
        H6.I Implement Actions for the Tiscornia Winery Site on Magnolia Avenue
        and the McLaren Property off of Estelle Avenue (Potential Housing
        Opportunity Sites). Promote development of both market-rate and affordable
        housing on the Tiscornia Winery Site on Magnolia Avenue (23 units, 5 affordable) and
        the McLaren Property off of Estelle Avenue (17 units, 4 affordable). The properties are
        both privately owned. The topography of the Tiscornia Winery Site is extremely steep
        and development will likely have to be clustered; therefore, the minimum density is
        projected for the property. The existing structures on the site have been identified as
        potentially eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The McLaren Site is
        relatively flat and includes two existing historic dwellings.
        a) Offer Development Incentives. As has been the City’s practice, the City will
              consider incentives for affordable housing (e.g., floor area ratio exceptions, density
              bonuses, flexible parking standards, and deferred fees).
        b) Fast Track Processing. The City will offer fast track processing with the hiring of
              a consultant, if necessary, to facilitate permit processing.

        Financing:          Staff time; General Fund
        Objectives:         Facilitate development of affordable housing
        Timeframe:          Though discussions regarding the potential development of the
                            Tiscornia Winery site have taken place, the property owner is not
                            interested in developing the property at this time. The developer of the
                            McLaren property decided to delay his development proposal, but has
                            recently expressed renewed interest in developing the site.
        H6.J Implement Actions for North of Corte Madera Creek -The Bon Air
        Center (Potential Housing Opportunity Site). Promote development of mixed-use
        affordable housing (i.e., residential above commercial) on the Bon Air Shopping Center
                                                     77

Housing Policies and Implementing Programs                                City of Larkspur Housing Element
        site. Two property owners primarily own the properties. Depending on the size of the
        units the proposed 90 units could be built on two or more of the four properties listed.
        On one of the properties, the buildings date back to 1972 and are due for upgrades,
        which allows for the potential redevelopment of the property for mixed use. The
        General Plan designation allows for up to 21 units per acre, subject to height and
        parking restrictions. The height limit in this Planned Development District is 35 feet and
        the parking required for units above commercial is one parking space per unit. The site
        has more than 100 parking spaces over that required in the Planned District.
        It is noted that the Development District process is described on pages 62 and 63 of this
        Element. As described, the Preliminary Development Plan provides the general
        development scheme and parameters of development. The Precise Development Plan is
        the more specific development plan showing the specific development proposal. It must
        be consistent with the development parameters provided in the Preliminary
        Development Plan. In this case, as the Preliminary Development Plan allows for
        residential uses, the Precise Development Plan would need to be amended to show how
        the uses would be laid out on the site (i.e., the design of the project) along with
        parking, landscaping, etc. consistent with the concepts and parameters of the
        Preliminary Development Plan. As described in the Element, the Precise Development
        District allows for flexibility in the development standards that might be needed at the
        time a development is proposed.
        a) Offer Development Incentives. The City will evaluate on a biennial basis through
        the Annual Progress Report the status of this program and the effectiveness of the
        incentive programs outlined in this Element, including but not limited to flexible
        development standards and implementation of the following programs:
        Program H7.A, Enact Density Bonus and Other Incentives;
        Program H7.D, Participation by Property Owners in Federal Programs; and
        Program H7.G, Waive/Defer Development Fees.
        b) Fast Track Processing. In addition, Program H7.F, Priority Processing, provides for
        fast track processing with the hiring of a consultant, if necessary, to facilitate permit
        processing.

        encourage the redevelopment of underutilized sites identified as housing opportunity
        sites in this Housing Element, especially to provide very low and extremely low income
        housing. Actions include reducing development standards as appropriate, meeting with
        developers and property owners to discuss redevelopment options for specific
        properties, and making information available about the City’s existing incentives and
        zoning regulations that reduce or waive certain fees for affordable developments.

H7. Long-Term Affordable Housing: City seeks to provide its “Fair Share” of very-
low, low and moderate income housing and to ensure affordable housing remains
affordable over a long term.
H7.1    Density Bonuses and Other Incentives for Affordable Housing Developments.
        The City will use density bonuses and other incentives to help achieve housing goals
        while ensuring that potential impacts are considered and mitigated.
H7.2    Long-Term Housing Affordability Controls. The City will apply resale controls and
        rent and income restrictions to ensure that affordable housing provided through
        incentives, and as a condition of development approval, remains affordable over time to
        the income group for which it is intended. Inclusionary units shall be deed-restricted to
        maintain affordability on resale to the maximum extent possible (typically in perpetuity).
H7.3    Preserve Existing Affordable Housing Stock. The City will strive to preserve its
        existing affordable housing stock.

H9.4    Housing for the Homeless. Recognizing the lack of resources to set up completely
        separate systems of care for different groups of people, including homeless-specific
        services for the homeless or people “at risk” of becoming homeless, the City will work
        with other jurisdictions, as appropriate, to develop a fully integrated approach for the

        construction of housing for people with disabilities, handicapped dwelling conversions
        (or adaptability), and appropriate site design. To insure that the City’s zoning and
        building codes relative to housing for persons with disabilities do not impede the
        construction of such housing, or necessary adaptations to existing structures, the City
        has developed a draft policy for developing and adopting a formal process for providing
        reasonable accommodation to zoning, building codes, and permit procedures for all
        persons with disabilities. Once adopted, information regarding the process for requesting
        reasonable accommodations will be made available at the City’s Customer Service,

H13.2 Organizational Effectiveness. In recognition that there are limited resources
        available to the City to achieve housing goals, the City will seek ways to organize and
        allocate staffing resources effectively and efficiently to implement the programs of the
        housing element.
H13.3 Housing Element Monitoring, Evaluation and Revisions. The City will establish a
        regular monitoring and update process to assess housing needs and achievements, and
        to provide a process for modifying policies, programs and resource allocations as needed
        in response changing conditions.
        Implementing Programs
        H13.A Conduct an Annual Housing Element Review. Develop a process for the
        assessment of Housing Element implementation through annual review by the Larkspur

                    Evaluation of the 2004 Housing Element
2004 Housing Element
As the 2010 Housing Element is not a completely new Element but an update to the 2004
Housing Element, Section 4 of the Element retains most of the programs and policies from the
2004 Element. As appropriate, these policies and programs have been updated to
reflect changes in the programs based on the following analyses of the
appropriateness, effectiveness, and progress in program implementation. Where
programs have been successful, it is noted that the program is ongoing. If the action related to
the program has been completed this is also noted.
H1. Sense of Community and Creation of Successful Partnerships: Enhance our
sense of community by identifying shared responsibilities from all sectors within the
community (government, business, neighborhoods, non-profits, etc.) that
effectively address the City’s housing needs.
Implementing Programs
H1.A Gather and Prepare Information and Conduct Outreach on Housing Issues.
Coordinate with local businesses, housing advocacy groups, neighborhood groups, and the
Chamber of Commerce and participate in the Marin Consortium for Workforce Housing in
building public understanding and support for workforce and special needs housing. Gather
and, as necessary, prepare informational handouts.
Responsibility: Planning Department; City Manager; City Council
Financing:        Staff time; the City may use funding sources such as Community Development
                  Block Grant (CDBG) funds and City-generated affordable housing funds to
                  implement this program.
Objectives:       Handouts, City website, and presentation material
Timeframe:        January 2003; ongoing thereafter
Evaluation: Since this program’s implementation in January of 2003, the City has coordinated
with housing advocacy groups and the Larkspur community to promote public understanding
and acceptance of affordable housing projects. The City’s facilitation of the Drake’s Way project
(EAH) is the most recent example of the successful implementation of this program. The project
had little to no opposition. Drake’s Way has been embraced by the Larkspur community as a
valuable asset that provides affordable housing and fits aesthetically with the community
character. To further the program, staff will add material and resource links to the City website,
as appropriate, in accordance with the website’s upcoming redesign in early 2011. The City
Council and City staff will continue to provide information about affordable housing to the public
at large and other interested parties. The most effective approach to garnering public support
for affordable housing is referring those concerned to projects already completed, including
Edgewater Place and Drake’s Way. The City’s General Plan Update Citizen Advisory Committee
will host at least one public workshop on housing in Larkspur and regional housing needs that
will highlight the success of the City’s existing affordable housing developments and solicit
public comment on future affordable housing developments.
Program status: Continue program.

Appendix B                                                             City of Larkspur Housing Element
H1.B Collaborate in an Inter-Jurisdictional Strategic Action Plan for Housing. Work
toward implementing, whenever possible, agreed-upon best practices, shared responsibilities
and common regulations to efficiently and effectively respond to housing needs within a
countywide framework. The Strategic Action Plan program should be coordinated by the Marin
County Affordable Housing Strategist and be available to assist participating cities.
Responsibility:   Planning Department; City Manager; City Council
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Coordination with other jurisdictions on housing matters.
Timeframe:        2002 and ongoing
Evaluation: Since this program was implemented, the City has cooperated with the County’s 11
jurisdictions in creating the Marin Housing Workbook (strategic action plan for housing), a
compendium of best-practices, up-to-date housing and population data, and state law
requirements. The Workbook is a very effective tool for comparing housing policies and
programs across the County and was regularly referenced by City staff during the Housing
Element update process. A position for a Marin County Affordable Housing Strategist was
established in the early 2000’s, but was absorbed by the position of Principal Planner for the
Marin County Redevelopment Agency due to budget constraints. The Principal Planner and
other County staff have since managed the Marin Housing Workbook process.
Program Status: Continue program, to the extent of participating in future Marin Housing
Workbooks and sharing common regulations. The City would assist with funding the position of
Affordable Housing Strategist should the County’s economic climate become more favorable in
the future and monies are available.
H2. Equal Housing Opportunities: Promote equal housing opportunities for all
persons and assure effective application of Fair Housing law.
        Implementing Programs
  H2.A Update Ordinances. Update the zoning code ordinances to be in compliance with
any amendment to the Fair Housing Act.
Responsibility:   Planning Department; City Attorney
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Effective implementation of anti-discrimination policies
Timeframe:        As needed.
Evaluation: City staff has implemented this program successfully, integrating amendments to
the Act into the zoning ordinance, as applicable.
Program Status: Continue program, as needed to implement amendments to the Fair Housing
Act.
  H2.B Respond to Complaints. The City will refer discrimination complaints to the
appropriate legal service, county, or state agency, or Fair Housing of Marin. If mediation fails
and enforcement is necessary, refer tenants to the State Department of Fair Employment and
Housing or HUD, depending on the nature of the complaint.
Responsibility: Customer Service Counter
                                                 B-2

Appendix B                                                            City of Larkspur Housing Element
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Respond to discrimination complaints.
Timeframe:        As needed.
Evaluation: Though the City has not received such complaints since this program’s adoption,
helping to resolve and prevent discrimination in housing is a goal the City strives to meet. The
City has up to date resources for victims of housing discrimination (see evaluation below) that
will be available whenever the need arises.
Program Status: Continue program.
   H2.C Public Information. The City will maintain brochures and other written material on
services, education and information offered by agencies related to discrimination in housing.
The material will be available at the Customer Service counter and in the library at City Hall and
at other public facilities. It will also be distributed to neighborhood groups and associations
and, as the opportunity arises, in community mailings to property owners and residents.
Responsibility:   Planning; Customer Service
Financing:        Staff time
Objective:        Promote public information on housing discrimination.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: The City has brochures and other written materials on public display at the
customer service counter. The Planning Department and Library also keep materials on hand.
Informational mailings have been limited due to budgetary and conservation efforts. The City
will add, as appropriate, material to the City website, concurrently with the forthcoming website
redesign in early 2011.
Program Status: Continue program. Consider expanding availability of resources to City website.
   H2.D Equitable Public Services. The City will continue to provide equitable public services
throughout the City, including crime prevention, police protection, street lighting, trash
collection, recreational facilities and programs, and schools.
Responsibility:   City Manager; City Council
Financing:        General Fund
Objective:        Provide equitable public services throughout the City.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: The City has fully implemented this program in all its public service efforts.
Program Status: Continue program.
H3. Housing Design: Assure that new housing is well-designed and of an
appropriate scale to enhance our neighborhoods and community as a whole.
        Implementing Programs
                                                  B-3

Appendix B                                                               City of Larkspur Housing Element
   H3. A Amend the Design Review Ordinance. Amend the Environmental and Design
Review ordinance to provide findings that the project will be compatible in design and scale
with its surroundings. Maintain findings that are the minimum necessary to ensure a design that
is compatible with the site and neighborhood and not detrimental to the construction of
affordable housing. For example, findings should focus only on visual scale, bulk, capability with
the site and surrounding structures, minimization of impacts on views and solar access,
functional site layout, and the protection of public health and safety. If and when the design
criteria are updated, ensure that the criteria support the findings and continue to be clear and
objective so as not to create new barriers to housing.
Responsibility:    Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:         Staff time
Objectives:        Revised design review findings.
Timeframe:         Completed June 2004
Evaluation: The Environmental and Design Review Ordinance (LMC 18.64) was amended in
June 2004 by Ordinance 933. The findings established in amended (and renamed) Design
Review Ordinance are as follows:
A. The applicant has demonstrated that the visual scale and bulk of the proposed structure(s) are
    compatible with the surrounding structures and uses, and the district in which they are
    situated.
B. The applicant has demonstrated that the proposed project is compatible with the physical
    characteristics of the site. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, the scale of the
    principal trees, major rock croppings, stream courses, landforms, existing structures on the
    site, and the dimensions of the lot.
C. The applicant has demonstrated that the proposed structure(s) will not be responsible for
    significantly affecting the views from and solar access for adjacent structures.
D. The location, size, design, and characteristics of the proposed structure(s) will be compatible
    with and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, comfort, privacy, and welfare of
    persons residing in or working in the proposed structures or in developments adjacent to the
    proposed project. For multiple-unit residential, mixed use, or non-residential projects, this
    includes the layout of structures, parking, circulation, pathways, landscaping, and other
    amenities are functional and appropriate to the site and use, and compatible to surrounding
    structures and uses.
E. The project is consistent with any applicable specific or area plans and conforms to the
    standards and regulations of all applicable provisions of the Larkspur Municipal Code.
Since the ordinance was amended, the City received applications for multi-family housing
developments (including Drake’s Way and the Rose Garden) which triggered design review.
Meeting the findings stipulated by design review proved not to be burdensome to the
developers and did not pose a barrier to the projects’ approvals. Further, EAH was required to
revise their original design for Drake’s Way to reduce costs and the revisions were approved
without difficulty.
                                                  B-4

Appendix B                                                             City of Larkspur Housing Element
Program Status: Completed.
   H3.B Family Housing Criteria. Encourage developers to submit proposals that conform to
the following family housing criteria:
a) Variety. For a family housing project to attract families with a wide range of incomes, a plan
should contain a variety of unit and lot sizes. Structures on smaller than standard size lots
should be built in a scale appropriate to the lot, and the various-sized units should be
interspersed throughout a project.
b) Identity. Each dwelling unit should be designed with an architectural character that
promotes a sense of identity for the residents.
c) Autonomy. Where possible, legal constraints should be removed and family dwellings should
be so designed as to allow the owner the freedom to make modifications that are not
detrimental to a project as a whole.
d) Storage, including attics and basements. Family units have a critical need for storage and
should be provided with an ample volume. These spaces can also provide area for many of the
recreation needs of a family.
e) Private open space. A family unit should have a significant amount of useable open space
that is a direct extension of the interior living area, directly accessible to the unit. The area
should be suitable in terms of solar orientation and security for activities such as passive and
active play, gardening, entertaining, etc. In some instances it may be appropriate to provide
increased common areas to compensate for reduced private open space.
f) Number of bedrooms. A family housing project should have a reasonable mix of two- and
three- bedroom units.
g) Floor area. Ample floor area should be provided for each unit consistent with the variety and
number-of-bedrooms criteria. Living areas in a variety of sizes should be provided.
h) Laundry. Each unit should have space and hookups necessary for the provision of a washing
machine and dryer.
i) Kitchens. Kitchens should have ample counter space and storage and a natural light source.
j) Intangibles. Security, privacy, and accessibility are three interrelated characteristics of
housing that cover a great deal of territory, and individual families would feel varying degrees
of need for each. Some of the more obvious needs are for visual privacy in the private outdoor
space, acoustical privacy between units, security provided by access to neighbors and physical
security against intruders.
k) Solar access: Each unit should be designed to maximize solar access to the extent feasible.
Responsibility:   Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Family housing that is compatible with the neighborhood
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: This ongoing program has successfully achieved its aims as evidenced by recently
approved or built multi-family housing projects (the Rose Garden project and Drake’s Way).
Both have been successful in providing almost all of the characteristics outlined in this program
in the project design. Staff works closely with project developers and architects upon project
submittal to orient them to the City’s community and design principles, and have found multi-
family developers to be amenable to staff suggestions and feedback and interested in meeting
these criteria.
Program Status: Continue program.

H4. Existing Housing and Neighborhoods Preservation: Protect and enhance the
housing we have and ensure that existing affordable housing “at risk” of conversion
to market rates will remain affordable.
Implementing Programs
H4.A Monitor “At Risk” Units. Monitor assisted properties at risk of conversion to market
rates and work with the property owners and/or other parties to ensure that they are conserved
as part of the county’s affordable housing stock. Identify funding sources and timelines for
action, and prepare an ordinance requiring a one year notice to residents, the City and the
Marin Housing Authority of all proposed conversions of affordable housing units to market rents.
Responsibility: Planning Department, City Manager, and City Council in cooperation with the
                  County
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Protection of affordable housing (conserve the 113 deed restricted units).
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: There are five affordable housing developments in Larkspur: Drake’s Way and
Edgewater Place are rental developments managed by EAH with deeded income restrictions;
Larkspur Courts and Cape Marin are rental developments that have recorded income restriction
agreements between the developer, the City, and the Marin Housing Authority; and Larkspur
Isle is a development of deed-restricted BMR ownership units. The long-term affordability of
these developments beyond their deed-specified terms (with the exception of the ownership
BMR units) is subject to the financial solvency of the organizations that manage them; namely
EAH and the Marin Housing Authority. EAH and the Housing Authority are two of the premier
providers of affordable housing in Marin and have built up extensive networks for financial
support, whether from government grants and loans, local financial institutions, or donations
from private sources.
The City is aware of all applicable dates of termination of financial assistance, and works with
organizations to ensure continued affordability of units in perpetuity. For example, in 2001 EAH
proposed an affordable homeownership program for the 28 affordable rental units it owned in
the Larkspur Isle development. The City worked closely with EAH during the program’s creation,
providing direction and comments regarding the program’s specifics, and coordinating review of
the program with the Marin Housing Authority.
Program Status: Continue program, with the identification of funding and creation of an action
timeline in the future, if an ordinance is required.
H4.B Conduct Presale Inspections. The City will continue to inspect all residential units
prior to resale. The inspection reports point out safety related matters to assure that the units
meet basis life safety standards.
Responsibility:   Building Department
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Safety and proper maintenance of existing housing.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
                                                  B-6

Appendix B                                                              City of Larkspur Housing Element
Evaluation: The City employs a part-time Fire Marshal who conducts all resale inspections. The
Building Inspector or Fire Chief conducts inspections in the Fire Marshal’s absence. Resale
inspections are performed regularly and with integrity on the part of the Fire Marshal or other
City representative.
Program Status: Continue program.
H4.C Amend Zoning to Protect Existing Housing. The City will amend the zoning
ordinance pursuant to the Downtown Specific Plan to prohibit the conversion of existing
residential units to commercial or office space.
Responsibility:   Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Elimination of conversions of residential units to commercial uses.
Timeframe:        November, 2004
Evaluation: This program was completed successfully with the adoption of Ordinance 939 by the
City Council in 2004. The Zoning Ordinance Chapter 18.41 was amended to require a
conditional use permit for conversion of residential units to commercial or office space, on sites
where residential uses are no longer appropriate. The ordinance also increased the required
parking for commercial uses, acting as a disincentive to conversion. No such conversions have
occurred since the Zoning Ordinance was amended.
Program Status: Completed.
H4.D Expand the Historic Resources Inventory. The Historic Resources Inventory will be
expanded to include significant single family residences in the older neighborhoods. The criteria
for designation include architecture and historic events or persons. Remodels, additions and
demolitions will be subject to the historic resource provisions of CEQA.
Responsibility: Planning Staff, Heritage Preservation Board, City Council
Financing:        General fund for consultant to evaluate properties; staff time
Objective:        Preservation of single family residences that collectively create the historic
                  character of the neighborhood.
Timeframe:        Phase I completed-August 2003; Phase 2-Fiscal year 2004-2005
Evaluation: The City hired a consulting historic architect in 2002 to complete both phases of this
program, which was completed in 2008. The changes to the inventory recommended by the
consultant were examined at several public hearings held by the Heritage Preservation Board
and the City Council. After considering public input, the City Council adopted the amendments
to the Historic Resources Inventory in 2008 with Resolution 33/08.
Program Status: Completed.
H4.E Inspections of Multi-Family Residences. The Larkspur Fire Department will
continue to provide inspections of multi-family residences that are most at risk for fire or other
life-safety hazards. As appropriate, the Fire Department, Building Inspector, and Customer
Service personnel will provide information to property owners regarding the availability of
housing rehab programs and other financial resources.
Responsibility: Fire Department; Building Inspector; Customer Service

Appendix B                                                               City of Larkspur Housing Element
Financing:          Staff time
Objective:          Protection of existing housing stock.
Timeframe:          Ongoing
Evaluation: The Fire Marshal inspects multi-family housing developments every year or every
other year to check for fire-safety and other life-safety hazards in the common area of the
developments (individual units are not inspected). Among the points of inspection are verifying
that exits are accessible and up to code, that fire escapes are cleared, and that pool areas are
appropriately fenced to protect children. This program has effectively maintained the safety of
residents in multi-family units.
Program Status: Continue program.
H5. Housing and Jobs Linkage: Promote the creation of housing near the workplace
and establish non-residential use contributions to affordable workforce housing.
Implementing Programs
H5.A Complete Commercial/Housing Nexus Study.                          Review the Marin County
Jobs/Housing Linkage Study to determine appropriate and possible contributions for affordable
housing from residential and non-residential uses, and to document the relationship between
job growth and affordable housing needs of various types of development.
Responsibility: Planning Department; City Council
Financing:          Staff time
Objectives:         Legal basis for non-residential to housing linkage.
Timeframe:          December, 2004
Evaluation: The analysis of the Marin County Jobs/Housing Linkage Study was completed in
December of 2004. Given the historically low level of new non-residential construction for which
a linkage fee would be most practical, the City found that a jobs/housing linkage fee would not
be practical at this time.
Program Status: Completed. Staff may consider reinstating program at a later date if
construction trends change.
H5.B Establish Job/Housing Linkage Fee Program. Considering for adoption a
Jobs/Housing Linkage Fee Ordinance with consideration of the following exaction requirements:
    a) Set exaction requirements for dwelling units and/or in-lieu fees according to
    empirically based evidence and comply with all other legal tests.
    b) Include affordable housing units within hotels, office, other commercial, or industrial
    buildings if feasible (options may include housing on-site, off-site, subsidizing mortgages
    or rents, in-lieu fee for housing production), or
    c) Establish a Housing Trust Fund for the collection of in-lieu fees based on a dollar
    amount per square foot of office, commercial, and industrial building development.
Responsibility:     Planning Department; City Manager; City Council.
Financing:          Staff time
Objectives:         Establish requirements for non-residential uses.
Timeframe:          December, 2004
                                                   B-8

Appendix B                                                            City of Larkspur Housing Element
Evaluation: See evaluation of program H5.A above.
Program Status: Deleted. The City did establish a Housing Trust Fund for in-lieu fees for
residential projects, but with little development and required affordable housing being
incorporated into projects, to date, no in-lieu fees have been paid. Staff may consider
reinstating consideration of a job/housing linkage free program at a later date if construction
trends change.
H5.C Identify Existing Employee Housing Opportunities. Work with local school
districts, public agencies, and existing businesses to seek opportunities for helping their
employees find needed housing, such as purchasing or leasing larger facilities to provide local
housing opportunities, mortgage buy-downs or subsidies, rent subsidies, etc. Seek the
commitment of other organizations, such as the Marin Board of Realtors to have their members
encourage employers to address employee-housing opportunities.
Responsibility:     Planning Department; City Manager
Financing:          Staff time
Objectives:         Employee housing opportunities provided by local entities.
Timeframe:          Ongoing
Evaluation: In implementing this program, staff found that the lack of time and financial
resources necessary to fully implement the program’s objectives limited its effectiveness and
practicality. Thus, this program has been amended (see program H5.C in Section 4 of this
Housing Element) to acknowledge the strains on staff time and budget and give staff more
flexibility in its implementation. The program’s objectives continue to be important and staff
strives towards its full implementation.
Project Status: Amended and continued.
H6. Variety of Infill and a Balance of Housing Choices: Maintain a diverse population
by providing a variety of choices in the type, size, cost and location of new housing
and more efficient use of existing housing, including the creative and efficient use of
vacant land and the redevelopment of built land within established development
areas to support local transit and services, maximize sustainability, and help
maintain our environment and open space.
          Implementing Programs
H6.A Implement Actions for Central Larkspur Area Specific Plan (CLASP) Housing.
Amend the General Plan, Downtown Larkspur Specific Plan, and Rezone parcels in the Plan Area
consistent with the land use designations and density/intensity specified in the CLASP; certify
environmental impact report and approve the CLASP.
Responsibility:     Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:          General Fund; Staff time; future reimbursement by developers
Objectives:         Additional housing units
Timeframe:          October/November, 2004
Evaluation: The CLASP, all associated General Plan, Downtown Specific Plan, and zoning
amendments were adopted in 2006 by the City Council with Resolutions 46/06, 47/06 and
                                                  B-9

Appendix B                                                             City of Larkspur Housing Element
48/06. The CLASP’s housing goals include achieving mixed-use in Subareas 1 and 2 through
construction of housing units above existing retail and commercial spaces, and allows for multi-
and single-family housing at a mix of income levels in Subarea 3. The Plan’s land use objectives
include creating a community center of mixed uses near the downtown area, minimizing traffic
and vehicle trips, and promoting development that maximizes community benefits. Pursuant to
the CLASP, the Rose Garden development was approved by the City Council in January of 2010
for Subarea 3 and includes a mix of single family and multi-family housing types (20 percent of
which will be affordable).
Program Status: Completed.
H6.B Work with Developers. The City will work with developers of non-traditional and
innovative affordable housing approaches in financing, design, construction and types of housing
that meet local housing needs.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Manager; City Council.
Financing:       Staff time
Objectives:      Additional housing units
Timeframe:       Ongoing
Evaluation: This program is intended to maximize the City’s remaining developable vacant
parcels and to encourage creative mixed-use solutions for developed parcels. Staff works with
architects and developers as new project applications come in to implement the objectives of
this program. The Rose Garden development is a successful example of design addressing a
variety of community housing needs, as stipulated in the development agreement. The mixed-
income level development combines multi-family style senior housing, single-family homes, and
small cottages on a parcel close to public transportation and other services in the downtown
area. The developer has also set aside a portion of land for a community facility. The City’s
Inclusionary Housing Ordinance facilitates the construction of affordable housing units within
market-rate developments, or allows developers to donate land or provide some other alternate
equivalent action to provide for affordable units. The City will continue to work with developers
and implement the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance to meet local housing needs.
Program Status: Continue program.
H6.C Continue to Work with the School District. As the opportunity presents itself, the
City will work with the Larkspur School District and Tamalpais Union High School District toward
development of affordable housing on any surplus properties.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; City Manager; City Council, and School Districts
Financing:       Staff time
Objectives:      Development of affordable workforce housing.
Timeframe:       Dependent on opportunity
Evaluation: The Larkspur and Tamalpais Union High School districts are sizeable employers in
the Larkspur area, and providing affordable or workforce housing on surplus district properties
would help reduce in-commuting by district employees who can’t afford to live near their
workplace. While there are currently no surplus properties under the ownership of the two
school districts, the City has and will continue to monitor any changes in use of school
                                                B-10

Appendix B                                                                 City of Larkspur Housing Element
properties. Should a property become available, the City will work with the districts to develop
affordable housing on the site(s) as this program intends.
Program Status: Continue program.
H6.D Review and Update Parking and Other Development Standards. Review and
update parking and other development standards based on the most up-to-date empirical
studies to allow for more flexible parking requirements to help facilitate infill, transit-oriented
and mixed use development.
Responsibility: Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       More flexible parking and development standards that are reflective of
                  development types.
Timeframe:        November, 2004
Evaluation: Amendments to parking and other development standards were adopted in 2004
and 2007 by Ordinance Nos. 939 and 940 (November 2004). These ordinances amended
parking standards to increase commercial parking requirements if converting from residential to
commercial uses and amended the commercial regulations to require only one parking space
per unit for residential over first-story commercial. The Ordinances also amended the City’s
commercial districts to exempt second-story residential units over first-story commercial from
FAR restrictions and required a conditional use permit for the conversion of residential to
commercial or office space. The circulation assessment permit requirements were amended to
exempt projects that contain no less than 15% of units dedicated to very-low income and 10%
to low and 25% to moderate, or 50% of units dedicated to senior or disabled persons.
Commercial and industrial districts were also amended to allow live/work units.
Program Status: Completed; continue program to facilitate ongoing review.
H6.E Implement Mixed Use Development Opportunities.                                   Encourage mixed
residential/commercial uses on those parcels where a mix of uses is feasible and appropriate,
consistent with the General Plan, through the following and other means, if appropriate: (1)
zoning text amendment to allow residential over first floor commercial in the C-1 and C-2
commercial zoning districts, (2) zoning text amendment to allow live/work units in the
commercial and industrial districts, (3) modifications to parking requirements for mixed-use with
residential in commercial and industrial districts, and (4) modifications to the Circulation
Assessment Permit Ordinance and Planned Development Zoning Districts to allow for the
construction of affordable housing, particularly housing for seniors, north of Corte Madera
Creek. Continue to permit residential uses as a conditional use in commercial district
regulations (i.e., multi-family) and light industrial (i.e., caretaker units) zoning districts.
Responsibility:   Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Small mixed use units.
Timeframe:        January, 2005
Evaluation: This program was completed in 2004 when the City Council adopted ordinances 939
and 940. Ordinance 939 amended the C-1 (Restricted Commercial) district to allow second-story
residential as a permitted use and exempted second-story residential units from floor area ratio
restrictions. It also amended the C-2 (Commercial) district to allow multiple dwellings and
                                                 B-11

Appendix B                                                           City of Larkspur Housing Element
residential units above first-story commercial as permitted uses exempt from FAR restrictions. It
also amended the Circulation Assessment Permit regulations to exempt developments providing
affordable housing at the minimum percentages stipulated in the City’s inclusionary housing
ordinance or to developments with at least 50% of the units dedicated to seniors. Ordinance
940 amended the C-1, C-2, and L-1 (Light Industrial) districts to allow live/work units as a
conditional use, subject to meeting certain objective standards including a minimum square
footage of 750 square feet, and subject to the district’s FAR restrictions. Though the City does
not have much development, the program has been successful in encouraging the
redevelopment of a small commercial property downtown with mixed use (commercial first
floor; affordable units above. It has also resulted in inquiries by other downtown property
owners and the owners of the Bon Air Center.
Program Status: General Plan, zoning amendments completed; implementation ongoing.
H6.F Review of Planned Development Plans. During the application and review process
for new or revised Planned Development Districts, ensure they provide for a diversity of housing
types to the extent possible.
Responsibility:   Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Increased diversity in housing types.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: The success of this ongoing program can be seen in the approval of the mixed-use
development at 2000 Larkspur Landing Circle (zoned PD) with Ordinance Nos. 948 and 951 and
Resolution 34/05. The LLC project’s Precise Development Plan allows for 126 residential
ownership units at a mix of income levels, a hotel, and new sanitary district facilities. The Rose
Garden project’s Precise Development Plan allows for 85 dwelling units and six second units,
with 50 of the units reserved as senior housing (42 multi-family units and eight cottages) and
29 single-family homes directly adjacent to transportation and grocery and retail shops. The
project includes a donation of 2.79 acres of land to the City for use as a public park or facility.
As with any submitted project application, staff works closely with architects and developers to
encourage creative housing design that meets a variety of community needs. Staff intends to
continue using this approach to all future new or revised PD developments.
Program Status: Continue program.
H6.G Facilitate Development at Potential Housing Opportunity Sites. Undertake a
General Plan Amendment, Rezoning and other implementing actions to facilitate the
construction of affordable housing at key sites to meet the jurisdiction’s “fair share” of the
regional housing need for lower income households. Ensure that local affordable housing
developments will be competitively positioned to access affordable housing finance sources
(such as tax credits and tax-exempt bonds). Specific steps and the schedule (in parenthesis)
are as follows:
a) Draft General Plan and Zoning Ordinance Amendments (completed for Omnibus Zoning
Amendments; underway for CLASP and Sanitary District Property; October/November, 2004)
                                                B-12

Appendix B                                                            City of Larkspur Housing Element
b) Conduct environmental review and begin preparation of an EIR, if necessary, for General
Plan Amendments, Zoning Ordinance changes and Rezonings (underway or completed for:
Omnibus Zoning Amendments; CLASP and Sanitary District Property; October/November 2004).
c) Certify the environmental review (October/November 2004).
d) Modify General Plan Land Use designations for specific sites as needed and initiate rezoning
the potential sites as appropriate. (October/November 2004).
e) Facilitate the development of affordable housing by using funding resources and other
means to assist in on-and off-site mitigation that may be required (ongoing).
f) Consistent with CEQA Section 15332 (“Infill Development Projects”), seek opportunities for
infill development consistent with the General Plan and zoning requirements that can be
categorically exempt from CEQA review (ongoing).
Responsibility:   Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:        Staff time; General fund; project applicants
Objectives:       Facilitate development of designated potential housing opportunity sites.
Timeframe:        Some actions concurrently with adoption of the updated Housing Element,
                  others per schedule above.
Evaluation: a) The General Plan and Zoning Ordinance amendments associated with the CLASP
were adopted in 2006, and those associated with the Sanitary District property (2000 Larkspur
Landing Circle) were adopted in 2005 and 2006 (see evaluations of programs H6.A and H6.L).
Both projects have a 20 percent affordable housing component.
b,c) The EIR for the CLASP was certified and CEQA findings adopted by Resolution 46/06.
d) General Plan and Zoning Ordinance amendments for specific housing sites were adopted in
various omnibus zoning amendment Ordinances in 2006 and 2007.
e) The City has not had the financial resources to provide direct monetary support to projects to
assist in on- and off-site mitigation, but has waived or reduced fees to facilitate project
completion (e.g., Drake’s Way).
f) The City promotes infill development in the CLASP, as well as in approving infill projects such
as the 2000 Larkspur Landing Circle project.
Due to the completion of objectives A-D (with objectives E and F ongoing), staff amended the
program to include new objectives including:
a) Facilitate the development of affordable housing by using in-lieu housing funding resources
and other means to assist in on- and off-site mitigation that may be required.
c) Investigate the feasibility of implementing variable density requirements as a tool to
encourage developers to build a great volume of smaller, affordable units in certain Zoning
Districts (e.g. R-3, C-1 and C-2, etc.)
d) Investigate amending the Zoning Ordinance to require minimum densities in multi-family
residential and mixed-use districts to discourage underutilization of parcels and encourage
tailored development envelopes.
Program Status: Specific objectives completed; program objectives and timeframe amended to
continue ongoing program objectives and complete feasibility analysis by December, 2011 (see
Program H6.F in the 2010 Housing Element).
                                                B-13

Appendix B                                                             City of Larkspur Housing Element
H6.H Implement Actions to Address Remaining Very Low Income Housing Need.
Work with developers, other agencies and the community to address a portion of Larkspur’s
housing need by offering incentives such as density bonuses, options for clustering units, mix of
unit types, second units, “in-lieu” housing funds, fast-track processing, and reduced fees, as
appropriate to the development at the following sites:
Responsibility: Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council
Financing:        Staff time; General Fund
Objectives:        Facilitate development of very-low income housing units.
Timeframe:         Ongoing
Evaluation: This program’s success can be seen in the Drake’s Way development, a
development dedicated exclusively to very-low income households. The City facilitated the
transfer of land from the original developer (Monahan) to EAH as part of the market-rate
project approval. Though the difficulties of the unimproved site posed a great cost to the
project’s development, the project was completed and is now fully occupied. The City has since
adopted its inclusionary housing ordinance which requires donated land to be fully improved to
prevent such situations from reoccurring. The incentives employed by the City for this project
included waiving fees, expedited permit processing and approval of design changes for
purposes of project feasibility. The City will continue to work with developers to identify
opportunities for meeting the very-low and ELI housing need.
Program Status: Continue program.
H6.I Implement Actions for Blue Rock Inn. Consider approval of Design Review for
restoration of the Blue Rock Inn, including the legalization of 11 affordable units.
Responsibility:   Planning Department; Planning Commission; Heritage Board; City Council.
Financing:        Staff time; project applicant
Objectives:       Legalization of affordable housing units
Timeframe:        Design Review approved and building permits issued; as of June 2004,
                  under construction.
Evaluation: The application for Design Review was approved in May of 2003, leading to the
legalization of seven very-low income units and 4 low-income units in 2004.
Program Status: Completed.
H6.J Implement Actions for the North End of Magnolia Avenue and other
Commercial Zoned Lands. Encourage mixed residential/commercial uses on those parcels
where a mix of uses is feasible and appropriate, consistent with the General Plan. Refer to
Program H6.E above.
Evaluation: See evaluation of Program H6.E above.
Program Status: Completed.
H6.K Implement Actions for the Monahan/EAH Project on East Sir Francis Drake
and Larkspur Landing Circle. Consider approval of a Preliminary Development, Precise
Development Plan, Design Review, and Tentative Map for the 23 unit market-rate housing
                                                B-14

Appendix B                                                            City of Larkspur Housing Element
development proposed off of East Sir Francis Drake Blvd. and the 24 unit affordable housing
development proposed off of Larkspur Landing Circle.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:       Staff time; project applicants
Objectives:      Additional housing units, both market-rate and affordable
Timeframe:       The Preliminary and Precise Development Plans and the Design Review have
                 been approved for both projects. No further discretionary actions are required
                 for the affordable housing development. A Vesting Tentative Map has been
                 approved. Final Map has been submitted for review. As of June, 2004, under
                 construction (preliminary grading).
Evaluation: This program is complete. Construction of the Drake’s Way development was
completed in November of 2009 and the development is now fully occupied. Construction on
Drake’s Cove has stalled due to unfavorable economic conditions. See evaluation of program
H6.H above for description of City actions facilitating this development.
Program Status: Completed.
H6.L Implement Actions for the Sanitary District Property off of Larkspur Landing
Circle. Consider approval of a General Plan Amendment (from Administrative and Professional
Office and Medium Density Residential, up to 12 du/ac, to High Density Residential, up to 21
du/ac), Preliminary Development, Precise Development Plan, Design Review, and Tentative Map
for 120 housing units on 10.67 acres, including 24 affordable units for the Sanitary District
Property located off of Larkspur Landing Circle. An applicant for the site has applied for 126
dwelling units on 7.65 acres of the site. An Administrative Environmental Impact Report has
been prepared for a previous mixed-use proposal and, based on that information, it is
anticipated that Mitigated Negative Declaration will be issued for the revised project.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:       Staff time; project applicants
Objectives:      Additional housing units, both market-rate and affordable
Timeframe:       Applications submitted and Initial Study underway; Application approvals
                 including General Plan Amendment-October 2004.
Evaluation: The City Council passed Resolution 34/05 in 2005, adopting the necessary General
Plan amendments to the Land Use Element and Land Use Map. The Precise Development plan
and Design Review for the residential component of the project were approved in 2005 and
2006, with approval of Ordinances 948 and 951, respectively.
Program Status: Completed.
H6.M Implement Actions for the Casitas de Larkspur Site at 220/224 Lower Via
Casitas. Consider approval of a Tentative Map for six market-rate housing units located on
Casitas de Larkspur.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:       Staff time; project applicants
Objectives:      Additional market rate housing unit
Timeframe:       Tentative Map approved; City waiting for filing of the Final Map by the
                 developer.

Evaluation: This program was completed in July of 2004 with the approval of the Tentative
Map. The units have been built and are currently occupied.
Program Status: Completed.
H6.N Implement Actions for the College of Marin Site (Potential Housing
Opportunity Site). Promote development of affordable housing units. The College of Marin
currently owns the 13-acre parcel. Initiate discussions with the College of Marin regarding the
development of a portion of the College property for affordable housing.
Responsibility: Planning Department; City Manager; City Council
Financing:       Staff time; General Fund
Objectives:      Facilitate development of very-low income housing serving persons
                 with specials needs.
Timeframe:       Begin work within twelve months of adoption of the updated Housing Element.
Evaluation: The City spoke with campus officials on several occasions in 2004 and 2005 in order
to determine what kind of development would be best for that site. Ultimately, the college felt
that housing development of the site is not consistent with the College’s Master Plan. The City
decided against pursuing it further as the site is immediately adjacent to and encompasses
marshlands.
Program Status: Completed.
H6.O Implement Actions for the Conversion of Existing Market Rate Housing to
Affordable Housing. Investigate the feasibility of, and opportunities for, the purchase of
existing market rate housing to affordable housing in compliance with Government Code
Section 65583.1. Work with interested non-profits and willing property owners.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; City Manager; City Council
Financing:       Staff time; General Fund
Objectives:      Conversion of existing market-rate multi-family housing to affordable units.
Timeframe:       Begin investigation of the feasibility of, and opportunities for, this program
                 within six months of adoption of the updated Housing Element.
Evaluation: Staff had the opportunity to investigate the feasibility of market-rate conversions to
affordable units when a developer approached the City with the intent to convert some of
market-rate units on Bon Air Hill. The proposed units were already affordable to moderate and
low-income households. If these units were converted to affordable units with income
restrictions, most of the existing low and moderate income residents would be displaced as they
would not qualify for the restricted income housing. In April of 2007, the City Council
determined that the proposed conversions would have too severe an impact on existing
moderate and low income residents, and this program was no longer considered.
Program Status: Completed.
H6.P Implement Actions for the Tiscornia Winery Site on Magnolia Avenue and the
McLaren Property off of Estelle Avenue (Potential Housing Opportunity Sites).
Promote development of both market-rate and affordable housing on the Tiscornia Winery Site
                                               B-16

Appendix B                                                              City of Larkspur Housing Element
on Magnolia Avenue (23 units, 5 affordable) and the McLaren Property off of Estelle Avenue (17
units, 4 affordable). The properties are both privately owned. The topography of the Tiscornia
Winery Site is extremely steep and, it is likely, development will have to be clustered; therefore,
the minimum density is projected for the property. The existing structures on the site have
been identified as potentially eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The McLaren
Site is relatively flat and includes two existing historic dwellings. The City will take the following
specific actions to:
a) Amend the Land Use Element and Rezone the Property. The 1.46 acre McLaren
Property is designated Low Density Residential (up to 5 du/ac) in the General Plan and zoned R-
1, Residential First District. Environmental review shall be conducted to assess the impact of
designating the site to Medium Density Residential (up to 12 du/ac) and R-2, Residential
Second District. (Note: General Plan Amendments and Rezoning are not required for the other
property. The Tiscornia Winery Site is currently designated Low Density Residential [up to 5
du/ac] in the General Plan and zoned Residential Master Plan. The steep topography limits
development to 1 du/ac.)
b) Offer Development Incentives. The City will offer incentives for affordable housing
(e.g., floor area ratio exceptions, density bonuses, flexible parking standards, and deferred
fees).
c) Fast Track Processing. The City will offer fast track processing including the hiring of a
consultant, if necessary, to facilitate permit processing.
Responsibility:    Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council
Financing:         Staff time; General Fund
Objectives:        Facilitate development of affordable housing
Timeframe:         Concurrent with, or within six months of adoption of the updated Housing
                   Element the McLaren property will be processed for a General Plan amendment
                   and rezoning. The property owner has expressed interest in providing
                   affordable housing and has presented a preliminary concept plan for the site.
                   Discussions regarding the potential development of the Tiscornia Winery site
                   have taken place.
Evaluation: Though discussions regarding the potential development of the Tiscornia Winery
site have taken place, the property owner is not interested in developing the property at this
time. In the event that the property owner wishes to develop the site in the future, staff will
implement the objectives of this program to facilitate project development. The developer of
the McLaren property decided to delay his development proposal, but has recently expressed
renewed interest in developing the site. Staff will continue to discuss the potential of the site
with the developer and will apply the incentives and strategies outlined in this program as they
become appropriate.
Program Status: Ongoing.
H7. Long-Term Affordable Housing: City seeks to provide its “Fair Share” of very-
low, low and moderate income housing and to ensure affordable housing remains
affordable over a long term.

H7.A Enact Density Bonus Zoning and Other Incentives. Amend the Zoning Ordinance
to add Density Bonus regulations, consistent with State law, to encourage an increase in the
supply of well-designed housing for very low, low and moderate income households.
Responsibility:   Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Create flexibility for well-designed affordable housing development.
Timeframe:        March 2004
Evaluation: The City has been relying on State density bonus regulations, and due to the
changing nature of the regulations in the mid-2000’s, the City Council put a City density bonus
regulation on hold. However, as time has passed and the State regulations have been clarified,
the City now plans to adopt density bonus regulations by February 2011.
Program Status: Continue program; timeframe amended to “February 2011”.
H7.B Impose Resale or Rent Controls on Affordable Units Receiving City Financial
Assistance. Impose resale or rent controls on all affordable units that receive city financial
assistance or state housing density bonuses for perpetuity.
Responsibility:   Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Preserve affordable units.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: Affordability restrictions for all of the affordable housing developments in Larkspur
are either integrated into the deed of the property or are otherwise stipulated in the project’s
approval (i.e., in the Precise Development Plan, Development Agreement, etc.). Pursuant to
other programs in the Housing Element, the City will work with developers and affordable
housing organizations to maintain affordability of units in the long-term.
Program Status: Ongoing.
H7.C Impose Resale or Rent Controls on Affordable Units Provided through the
Inclusionary Housing Program. Impose resale or rent controls on all affordable units
provided through the inclusionary housing program or city subsidies to ensure that they remain
affordable for perpetuity.
Responsibility:   Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Preserve affordable units.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: See evaluation for program H7.B above.
Program Status: Continue program.
H7.D Participation by Property Owners in Federal Programs. Encourage and facilitate
to the extent possible, participation by property owners in federal for-sale and rental housing
assistance programs that maintain affordability for very low and low-income residents.

Objectives:       Increase number of affordable units.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: The City has historically encouraged property owners to participate in federal
assistance programs, and facilitated the acceptance of Section 8 housing at the Larkspur Courts
apartments (approved in the 1980’s). The City continues to provide information about such
programs to interested property owners at its Customer Service and Planning counters.
Program Status: Continue program.
H7.E Revise Inclusionary Housing Regulations. Amend Chapter 18.16 Regulations for All
Districts of the Zoning Ordinance to require non-market rate housing to be included as part of
residential projects, as follows:
a) 15 percent of the units in a rental housing project of five to fourteen units and 20 percent of
the units in a rental housing project of fifteen or more units shall be affordable to very low- and
low-income households.
b) 15 percent of the units in a for-sale project of five to fourteen units and 20 percent of the
units in a for-sale project of fifteen or more units shall be affordable to low- and moderate-
income households.
c) Alternative methods of meeting the intent of the inclusionary requirements, such as the
provision of land for the required inclusionary units or the payment of an in-lieu fee, may be
permitted under certain circumstances.
d) The inclusionary units shall be constructed concurrently with market-rate units when
feasible.
e) The long-term affordability of the inclusionary units shall be guaranteed.
Consider providing a program of incentives (e.g., fee deferral, priority processing, local public
subsidy, and reduced design standards for such elements as setbacks, infrastructure, open
space, landscaping, outdoor amenities, and parking) to assist developers in meeting the
inclusionary housing requirements.”
Responsibility:   Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Amend the Zoning Ordinance.
Timeframe:        October, 2004
Evaluation: The City Council adopted the objectives of this program with Ordinance 941 in 2005,
amending the zoning ordinance to include a new chapter 18.31, Affordable Housing Fund and
Inclusionary/In-Lieu Fee Requirements. The ordinance also established an affordable housing fund
to finance the development of affordable housing.

The City Council adopted in-lieu fees in 2007 with Resolution 40/07, as follows:
                                       In-Lieu Fees per Market Rate Housing Unit
            Project Type          Projects of 5-14 units         Projects with 15+ Units
            Rental Units                 $31,990                          $42,653
            For-Sale Units               $50,719                          $67,625
                                        In-Lieu Fees per Affordable Housing Unit
            Project Type                  Note: The fees per affordable unit do not
                                                change based on project size.
            Rental Units                                 $213,267
            For-Sale Units                               $338,126
The Fee amounts are adjusted annually on July 1 by the same percentage as the annual change in
the "Engineering News Record" Construction Costs Index for the San Francisco Bay Area. The City
Council may adjust fee amounts based on significant changes in the factors used in the Fee
methodology as defined in the EPS Technical Memorandum dated August 29, 2007.
Program Status: Completed.
H7.G Work with the Marin Housing Authority. Continue to implement agreements with
the Marin Housing Authority (MHA) for management of the affordable housing stock in order to
ensure permanent affordability, and implement resale and rental regulations for low and
moderate income units and assure that these units remain at an affordable price level.
Responsibility: Planning Department; City Attorney.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Implement agreements to maintain affordability of deed restricted housing
                  units.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: As discussed in several related programs’ evaluations, this program has been
successful, and the City continues to work with the Marin Housing Authority and other
affordable housing organizations (EAH) to maintain the affordability of existing affordable units
and establish affordability for proposed units.
Program Status: Continue program.
H7.H Priority Processing. Provide a planning consultant to process applications that
include more affordable housing than required under the inclusionary policies and/or give the
project priority over other applications in getting to a public hearing at the Planning Commission
or set up special Planning Commission public hearings to facilitate speedy processing,
notwithstanding the requirements of CEQA and the Permit Streamlining Act.
Responsibility:   Planning Director; Planning Commission; City Manager
Financing:        Cost of consultant is the responsibility of the applicant.
Objective:        Reduce the cost of affordable housing.
Timeframe:        Ongoing

Evaluation: While budget constraints preclude the hiring of a City-paid consultant to provide
priority processing, the City does give projects that include affordable housing priority over
other applications in terms of staff time and scheduling of public hearings. Staff will continue to
implement this program.
Program Status: Continue program.
H7.I Waive/Defer Development Fees. Consider waiving or deferring development fees
for housing projects targeted to lower-income households when needed to ensure project
feasibility.
Responsibility:   City Council
Financing:        General Fund
Objective:        Facilitate construction of affordable housing.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: The City has waived or deferred development fees for housing developments
including Drake’s Way, which facilitated the project’s feasibility and hastened its construction.
The City will continue to consider waiving or deferring fees on a case-by-case basis.
Program Status: Continue program.
H8. Second Dwelling Units: Encourage well-designed, legal second units in all
residential neighborhoods.
         Implementing Programs
H8.A Legalization of Existing Second Units. Consider establishing an amnesty program,
that takes into account site specific conditions, to allow for and encourage the legalization of
existing second unit.
Responsibility: Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Increase the number of legal second units within the City and encourage
                  existing units to be brought up to code.
Timeframe:        Completed December 2004—not the preference of the City Council to grant
                  amnesty to persons that violated the law; revisit in January, 2005 with a more
                  limited scope.
Evaluation: The City Council considered this program in 2004. While recognizing the importance
of legalizing existing units (both for public safety and to get a more accurate picture of the
City’s housing supply), the Council decided that it was not the City’s policy to grant amnesty to
those who had broken the law. A more refined amnesty program was not considered. Staff is
suggesting that the Council consider the amnesty program again in spring of 2011, as the
General Plan update commences with the assistance of the Citizen Advisory Committee.
Program Status: Continue program.

H8.B Amend the Second Dwelling Unit Ordinance. Review and reconsider provisions of
the existing Second Dwelling Unit ordinance including submittal requirements, required
minimum lot size, required separate utility metering, whether detached units should be allowed,
and parking requirements.
Responsibility:   Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Remove barriers to the creation of second units.
Timeframe:        Completed, July 2003.
Evaluation: The City Council amended Chapter 18.21 of the Larkspur Municipal Code with the
adoption of Ordinance 921 in July of 2003 and Ordinance 953 in May of 2007. The ordinance
was amended in response to changes in state law requiring that local governments process
applications for second units ministerially; i.e., the City would not conduct discretionary review
as long as the application met certain City-determined, objective standards.
Under the amended ordinance, second dwelling units are allowed as a permitted use in all three
residential zoning districts, as well as in the Planned Development district (subject to ordinances
governing PD districts). It also established design standards including minimum and maximum
floor area, and requires one parking space in addition to the parking spaces required for the
main unit. The program has been successful in meeting the objectives as over the 1999-2006
RHNA period, the City issued six building permits for second dwelling units. Two of the units
were affordable to ELI households and four were affordable to moderate income households
(affordability levels determined using the County-wide survey of second unit affordability,
available on the Marin Housing Workbook website: www.marinhousingworkbook.com). The City
has projected the same number of second units to be built during the 2007-2014 RHNA period.
Program Status: Completed.
H8.C Sewer and Water Hook-Up Fees for Second Units. Support the efforts of other
local jurisdictions and work with the sanitary and water districts to reduce or waive fees for
affordable units and second units, thereby encouraging and facilitating development of these
types of housing units.
Responsibility:   Planning Department; City Manager; City Council
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Remove barriers to the creation of second units.
Timeframe:        Completed February 2004
Evaluation: In response to the lobbying efforts of Marin jurisdictions, the Marin Municipal Water
District Board of Directors revised its Low-Income/Affordable Housing Policy (Board Policy No.
12) to extend a 50 percent reduction in water connection fees for second dwelling units in all
jurisdictions in its service area (including Larkspur) in 2007. The Board adopted a policy
establishing reductions in connection fees to developers providing affordable housing beginning
in 1985. The policy currently grants a 50 percent reduction fee for both for-profit and non-profit
developments providing a certain percentage of affordable housing.
The Ross Valley Sanitary District currently has no formal policy reducing sewer connection fees
for affordable housing developments or second units. The City will continue to advocate for
such a fee reduction, along with the other jurisdictions served by the District.

Program Status: Partly completed; City will continue to support a reduction or waiver of fees for
affordable and second units.
H8.D Second Unit Requirement for Large Houses. Consider requiring projects with two
or more units and/or homes over 2,000 sq. ft. to provide a second unit(s) or the space and
adequate parking for a conversion to a second unit.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council
Financing:       Staff time
Objectives:      Increase the number of second units
Timeframe:       Complete July 2004
Evaluation: After consideration of this program and its implications, the City Council determined
not to pursue it due to safety issues inherent with the varied shape, slope and size of lots which
might preclude the construction of a second unit, and that a generalized requirement would be
unrealistic for many lots. Therefore, this program has been discontinued.
Program Status: Deleted.
H9. Special Needs Housing: Provide housing for population groups who require
special assistance (special needs groups include: homeless persons; people with
disabilities; the elderly; people with serious illnesses, substance abuse or in need of
mental health care; large families; single parent households; and other persons in
the community identified as having special housing needs).
        Implementing Programs
   H9.A Adaptable Units for the Disabled. Depending on the appropriateness (e.g. number
of units, ease of access), the City may require as a condition of approval new housing
developments include units that can be adapted for use by disabled residents.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:       Staff time
Objectives:      3% of the units built by July, 2006 (10 units)
Timeframe:       Ongoing
Evaluation: One example of this program’s successful implementation can be seen in the
Central Larkspur Specific Plan (adopted 2006), which requires that senior housing in the CLASP
subareas use universal design principles to ensure adaptability and accessibility for disabled
persons.
Program Status: Ongoing. The program continues in the 2010 Housing Element and specifies
that new construction will conform to the applicable California Building Code regulations
addressing accessibility requirements for disabled persons. The timeframe for implementation
has been amended to be subject to amendments to the California Building Code.
H9.B Density and Parking Standards for Elderly Housing Projects. Consider waiving
density and parking standards for elderly housing projects if the city finds that 1) potential
impacts to traffic and the environment are acceptable and 2) development is compatible with
neighborhood scale.
Responsibility: Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:       Staff time

Objectives:       Encourage additional housing for the elderly
Timeframe:        April, 2004
Evaluation: This program has been implemented successfully in the Rose Garden project
(CLASP Subarea #3), which received reduced parking requirements for its 50 senior housing
units. The program gives the City flexibility in determining when it is appropriate to grant
parking requirement reductions, while not impeding the practice.
Program Status: Continue program. Timeframe has been amended to “Ongoing.”
H9.C Zoning and Building Codes. Consistent with Senate Bill 520 enacted in January 1,
2002, the City will continue to evaluate its zoning ordinance and other policies to identify and
implement any provisions needed to address constraints to the construction of housing for
people with disabilities, handicapped dwelling conversions (or adaptability), and appropriate site
design. To insure that the City’s zoning and building codes relative to housing for persons with
disabilities do not impede the construction of such housing, or necessary adaptations to existing
structures, the City is in the process of developing and adopting a formal process for providing
reasonable accommodation to zoning, building codes, and permit procedures for all persons
with disabilities. Once adopted, information regarding the process for requesting reasonable
accommodations will be made available at the City’s Customer Service, Planning and Public
Works counters and on the City’s web site.
Responsibility: Planning Department; Planning Commission; Building Official, City Council.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Maintain zoning and building codes as fair and equitable and in accord with
                  State law.
Timeframe:        Ongoing; Approve formal request process-October 2004.
Evaluation: The City continues to update its zoning ordinance to reflect the objectives of this
program. Staff recognizes the importance of accommodating the needs of disabled persons and
has drafted a reasonable accommodation ordinance and plan to bring it to the City Council in
April of 2011. On the one occasion where an accommodation has been requested with
supporting documentation (e.g., a doctor’s letter) for the need and the request, the
accommodation has been granted administratively. Upon the Ordinance’s adoption, the City will
make information regarding requesting reasonable accommodations available to the public at all
venues listed in this program.
Program Status: Continue program. Timeframe amended to April, 2011.
H9.D Waive/Defer City Fees. Consider waiving or deferring City fees for housing projects
that meet special needs when necessary to improve the financial feasibility of such projects.
Responsibility:   City Council
Financing:        General Fund
Objective:        Facilitate construction of housing projects that meet special needs.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: This program was successful when the City granted fee waivers to the Drake’s Way
project, which includes housing units specifically reserved for households with disabled persons.
The City will consider similar waiver requests for any future housing projects that provide
accessible units or other special needs accommodations.

Program Status: Continue program.
H9.E Rental Units for Larger Families. Require apartment projects receiving financial
incentives from the City to include units with more than two bedrooms.
Responsibility:   Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council
Financing:        Staff time
Objective:        Facilitate construction of housing projects that serve larger families.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: Since the last Element update, Drake’s Way is the only project to request financial
incentives and the original project proposal included units with more than two bedrooms.
Program Status: Continue program.
   H9.F Building Codes. Review City building codes to determine consistency with HUD
regulations and State law concerning housing for persons with disabilities. Require developers
to strictly comply with these regulations in order to increase the stock of housing accessible to
persons with disabilities.
Responsibility: Building Official, City Council.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Maintain zoning and building codes as fair and equitable and in accord with
                  State law.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: This program states the City’s commitment to proactively follow and respond to
changes in State or federal laws governing the provision of housing for disabled persons. The
City’s Building Official provides direction to staff and the City Council when updates to City code
are required. The City has been and will continue to be responsive to changes in housing law.
Program Status: Continue program.
H9.G Support Countywide Programs. The City will support countywide programs that
provide for a continuum of care for the homeless including emergency shelter, transitional
housing, supportive housing and permanent housing.
Responsibility:   City Council.
Financing:        General Fund
Objectives:       Provide housing for the homeless.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: The City has historically been supportive of emergency, transitional, and supportive
housing throughout the County and in the City itself. The City is home to Marin Services for
Women, a residential substance-abuse rehabilitation facility that provides both transitional and
supportive housing for women enrolled in the program and their children. Many of the women
enrolled in the program have either been homeless or precariously housed in the past or are
currently homeless (program participants share their stories on the MSW website). Additionally,
program H9.H in this Element states the City’s intent to allow permanent emergency homeless
shelters as a permitted use in the Administrative-Professional and Commercial districts. The City
will continue to look for opportunities to provide housing for the homeless and will continue to
support countywide efforts to do the same.

Program Status: Continue program.
H9.H Emergency and Transitional Shelters. The City will allow emergency and
transitional shelters as permitted uses in conjunction with an existing Church and other places
of religious assembly, and in appropriate districts (residential and commercial) either by right (6
or less persons) or by use permit (7 or more persons) to facilitate the provision of such shelters.
Responsibility:    Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council
Financing:         General Fund
Objectives:        Provide emergency and transitional shelters.
Timeframe:         April, 2004
Evaluation: Pursuant to this program, the zoning ordinance was amended to allow group
homes, handicapped or non-handicapped, as permitted uses in the C-2 (General Commercial),
R-1, R-2, and R-3 (all residential) districts. Group homes are defined in the Larkspur Municipal
Code as “A family dwelling unit licensed or supervised by any federal, state, or local
health/welfare agency which provides twenty-four hour non-medical care of unrelated persons
who are handicapped [or not handicapped] and in need of personal services, supervision, or
assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living or for the protection of the
individual, in a family-like environment.” The number of individuals in a handicapped group
home is not limited by the Zoning Ordinance. Group homes for non-handicapped individuals are
limited to six clients.
The Zoning Ordinance defines any facility serving more than six clients (non-handicapped) as a
residential care facility, allowed as a conditional use in the R-3 district. Residential care facilities
are defined as “A facility licensed or supervised by any federal, State, or local health/welfare
agency which provides twenty-four-hour nonmedical care of unrelated persons who are not
handicapped but are in need of personal services, supervision, or assistance essential for
sustaining the activities of daily living or for the protection of the individual in a family-like
environment. The number of persons living in such a facility is seven or more clients.”
These uses allow for transitional, supportive, and emergency housing for those in need.
However, the number of clients is limited for non-handicapped group homes, and the
requirement for a “family-like environment” in a family dwelling unit precludes a permanent
shelter using dormitory-style housing or more intense uses. Additionally, the definitions of
“group home” and “residential care facility” do not explicitly state what types of housing (i.e.
emergency, transitional, or supportive housing) they are intended provide, nor does the zoning
ordinance define emergency, transitional, and supportive housing. In response to these
inconsistencies, and to the requirements of SB 2, the City has amended this program in the
updated Housing Element. The revised program will amend the zoning code to allow at least
one permanent emergency shelter by right in the A-P (Administrative-Professional) or C-2
(General Commercial) districts. It will also include new definitions of transitional and supportive
housing (as established in the California Health and Safety Code) and clarify that the definitions
of “Group Home,” handicapped and non-handicapped, encompass transitional and supportive
housing.
Program Status: Continue program, as amended, to November 2011 (per state law, the City has
up to one year after the Element’s adoption to update the zoning ordinance).

H9.I Residential Care Facilities. The City will work Marin Services for Women to allow
the creation of a 40-bed residential care facility, including space for infants and children, to
meet the needs of individual women in receiving integrated recovery.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council
Financing:       General Fund
Objectives:      Provide residential care facility for women and children..
Timeframe:       June 2003, approved by the Planning Commission
Evaluation: This program was successfully completed in 2003 when the Planning Commission
approved the project. The zoning ordinance was amended to allow residential care facilities in
the R-3 as a conditional use.
Program Status: Completed.
H10. Special Needs Support Programs: Provide housing assistance for special needs
and link housing to Health and Human Services programs helping meet the needs of
seniors, people with disabilities, homeless and others.
        Implementing Programs
H10.A Assist in the Effective Use of Available Rental Assistance Programs. Develop
and implement measures to make full use of available rental assistance programs. Actions
include:
a) Maintain descriptions of current programs to hand out to interested persons.
b) Provide funding support, as appropriate.
c) Refer interested parties to the Marin Housing Authority for rental housing assistance
programs, such as Shelter Plus Care, AB 2034, HOPWA, the Rental Assist Line, Rental Deposit
Program, and Welfare to Work Program.
Responsibility:  Customer Service; MHA; City Council; Marin Community Foundation.
Financing:       Staff time
Objectives:      Continued use of rental housing programs at current funding levels.
Timeframe:       Ongoing
Evaluation: The City provides pamphlets and other information to interested persons at its
customer service and planning counters, and makes referrals to the Marin Housing Authority
(Marin Housing) as necessary; it is difficult, however, to determine the success of the program
as no data is available. The City monitors the status of programs offered by Marin Housing and
updates its information accordingly (for instance, the City has updated its information to reflect
the suspension of the Rental Assist Line and the creation of the Homeless Prevention Program).
The City may add information to its website concurrent with the website’s redesign in 2010. The
City does not have the financial resources to fund rental assistance programs at this time.
Program Status: Continue program.
H10.B Engage in Countywide Efforts to Address Homeless Needs. Actively engage
with other jurisdictions in Marin to provide additional housing and other options for the
homeless, supporting and implementing Continuum of Care actions in response to the needs of
homeless families and individuals. Participate and allocate funds, as appropriate, for County
and non-profit programs providing emergency shelter and related counseling services.

Responsibility: Planning Department; City Manager; City Council.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Assist in addressing emergency shelter needs in a comprehensive, countywide
                  manner.
Timeframe:        Annual participation, as appropriate
Evaluation: The City supports and participates in several countywide efforts to addressing
homeless needs. These efforts include the bi-annual “Point-In-Time” homeless population count
coordinated by the County, and the Marin Housing Workbook process, which brings together
City and County officials and representatives from organizations providing services to the
homeless (among other organizations). The City values the work of non-profit organizations
providing housing and treatment services, and facilitated the approval of the Marin Services for
Women facility in 2003. The City recognizes that homeless needs are growing and difficult to
address by any one jurisdiction.
Program Status: Continue program.
H11. Funding for Affordable Housing: Be aggressive and creative in finding ways to
increase ongoing local funding resources for low income special needs housing.
        Implementing Programs
H11.A Adopt a Housing Trust Fund Ordinance and Operating Procedures. If
appropriate, adopt a Housing Trust Fund Ordinance, specifying that monies paid into the fund
will be used to develop or rehabilitate units affordable to very low and low-income households,
or for the purchase of market rate units for conversion to affordable housing units. Explore
other streams of financing to add to or match these funds, and establish administrative
guidelines for land acquisition for affordable housing; capital improvements for affordable
housing developments; and other implementation actions.
Responsibility: Planning Department; Affordable Housing Strategist; City Manager; City
                  Council.
Financing:        Staff time; Larkspur’s proportionate share for the hiring of the Affordable
                  Housing Strategist
Objectives:       Provide funding to facilitate implementation of Housing Element programs.
Timeframe:        2006
Evaluation: The City Council adopted a Housing Trust Fund and established operating
procedures in 2005 with the adoption of Ordinance 940. The ordinance added a new Chapter
18.31 to the Larkspur Municipal Code entitled “Affordable Housing Fund and Inclusionary/In-
Lieu Fee Requirements.” The ordinance also establishes the percentages and affordability levels
of rental and ownership projects and sets guidelines for alternate equivalent actions. Alternate
equivalent actions include donating developable land to a non-profit housing developer and
development of second units. The City does not have a redevelopment agency and, due to the
built out nature of the community, has few projects from which to collect in-lieu fees. However,
the City’s efforts to secure the construction of or obligation for affordable units through other
means (inclusionary requirements, alternate equivalent actions) have been successful.
Program Status: Completed.
                                                 B-28

Appendix B                                                               City of Larkspur Housing Element
H11.B Seek Additional Local Sources of Funding. Develop permanent local sources of
funding to support affordable housing, including consideration of:
a) In-lieu fee payments under inclusionary requirements (residential and non-residential
developments).
b) Voluntary donations.
c) Increase in the Transient Occupancy Tax (as an alternative, increased revenue from the
increase in the number of transient occupancy rooms could be used to support affordable
housing).
Responsibility:   City Manager; City Council.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Create additional sources of funding.
Timeframe:        June, 2004
Evaluation: As discussed previously, the City has adopted an Affordable Housing Fund and an
inclusionary housing ordinance, though in-lieu fees have not yet been collected. Though
voluntary donations would gladly be accepted, the City does not wish to compete with the
number of established organizations providing affordable housing in the region (such as EAH,
Bridge Housing, and others) in the solicitation of private funding. An increase in the Transient
Occupancy Tax would not be practical at this time in assisting with housing needs, as these
revenues are getting difficult to collect due to online reservations, and are proposed to be
appropriated by the State during the current fiscal crisis. However, the City will retain this
aspect of the program as the economic climate may shift.
Program Status: Continue program. Timeframe has been amended to “Ongoing.”
H11.C Coordinate Funding Among Development Proposals. Recognizing that limited
resources are available from the State and other sources, and accessing such resources is
highly competitive, the City of Larkspur will participate in efforts to establish administrative
procedures to create a data base of development proposals throughout the County and their
anticipated funding sources. The purpose of the data base is to ensure that local projects are
competitive for outside funding sources and these resources are used in the most effective
manner possible. Potential sources of funding include, but are not limited to:
a) CDBG/HOME.
b) Marin Community Foundation.
c) Applications for mortgage revenue bonds and/or mortgage credit certificates.
d) Housing Trust Fund.
e) Tax Credit Allocation.
f) California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA)
Responsibility:   City Manager; City Council.
Financing:        Staff time
Objectives:       Efficient use of available funding for high priority developments.
Timeframe:        Ongoing
Evaluation: The City participates in a countywide database managed by the County of Marin
that tracks all residential and commercial development projects under review, approved, under
construction, or completed. This “PROPDEV” database is updated annually. However, the
database does not track the funding sources or eligibility of funding for each project, most likely
due to lack of resources both on the County and municipal level, and that a majority of the
funding sources are private for market-rate development. The City will continue to participate in
                                                 B-29

Appendix B                                                              City of Larkspur Housing Element
the annual PROPDEV database survey and will support the inclusion of funding sources in the
database if possible.
Program Status: Continue program.
H11.D Contacts with Nonprofit Housing Organizations. Maintain contacts with
nonprofit housing organizations to benefit from their expertise in developing and supporting
affordable housing. Refer potential developers of housing to these organizations for assistance.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; City Manager; City Council.
Financing:       Staff time
Objectives:      Efficient use of available funding for high priority developments.
Timeframe:       Ongoing
Evaluation: The City maintains relationships with several local and regional non-profit housing
organizations and has facilitated projects between those organizations and developers. The
donation of land from private developers to EAH to facilitate the construction of Drake’s Way is
a recent example of the City’s role in connecting non-profits with developers. The City will
continue to make such referrals as opportunities become available in the future.
Program Status: Continue program.
H12. Energy Conservation: Encourage energy conservation in housing.
        Implementing Programs
H12.A Evaluation of Residential Projects. Continue to evaluate residential projects for
consistency with Section 66473.1 (Energy Conservation) of the Subdivision Map Act during the
development review process.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:       Staff time
Objectives:      Energy conservation.
Timeframe:       Ongoing
Evaluation: The City checks plans both in-house and with outside consultants to insure
consistency with all applicable state laws, including the Subdivision Map Act. Projects not
meeting required standards are advised as such so the inconsistencies can be addressed in
revised plans.
In order to better address the intent of Policy H12, the City has added two new programs to
this Element (H12.B and H12.C) which address the City’s recently adopted Green Building
Ordinance (2007). The Green Building Ordinance, Chapter 18.17 of the Larkspur Municipal
Code, applies to any construction project over 500 square feet subject to design review.
Resolution 23/07 establishes the standards of compliance and compliance thresholds. This
includes requiring new single-family homes to meet the green building guidelines promulgated
by Build it Green or LEED (the two most widely accepted and supported green building
organizations in the U.S.). The new programs address the City’s intent to implement and
enforce the Green Building Ordinance and to regularly evaluate the ordinance and update it to
                                                B-30

Appendix B                                                            City of Larkspur Housing Element
reflect the most up to date standards and recommendations. Staff is revising the City’s Green
Building Ordinance relative to the recommendations of the Marin Green Building, Energy
Retrofit and Solar Transformation Committee (or BERST, a countywide collaborative formed to
develop uniform green building policies within the county), and the State’s new CALGreen code.
Program Status: Continue program.
H13. Effective Implementation and Monitoring: Take a proactive approach in
sharing resources and making organizational changes to effectively create and
respond to opportunities to achieve housing goals.
         Implementing Programs
H13.A Conduct an Annual Housing Element Review. Develop a process for the
assessment of Housing Element implementation through annual review by the Larkspur
Planning Commission and City Council. Provide opportunities for public input and discussion, in
conjunction with State requirements for a written review by July 1 of each year. (Per
Government Code Section 65400). Based on the review, establish annual work priorities for
staff, Planning Commission and City Council.
Responsibility: Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:       Staff time
Objectives:      Annual review of the Housing Element
Timeframe:       Annually in March of each year, prior to the budget cycle.
Evaluation: State law now requires the annual report due on April 1 of each year. The City has
and will continue to comply with the annual reporting requirements. Prior to submitting the
evaluation of the Housing Element to the state, the City Council holds a public hearing to
receive public input on the Housing Element and the report. The annual report analyzes the
effectiveness and appropriateness of Housing Element programs and policies, and allows staff
and the public to reexamine programs in more detail. Thus far, the reviews have found the
programs to be adequate and effective on the whole. Neither the public nor City staff has
identified necessary updates or amendments to the Element outside of the state-mandated
update schedule.
Program Status: Continue program; program text amended to reflect new due date of April 1.
H13.B Update the Housing Element Regularly. Undertake housing element updates as
needed, including an update to occur no later than June of 2007, in accordance with State law
requirements.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; Planning Commission; City Council.
Financing:       Staff time
Objectives:      Comprehensive update of the Housing Element.
Timeframe:       June, 2007
Evaluation: The state-mandated update for the current RHNA period was shifted from June of
2007 to June of 2009. The City began work on the Housing Element in December of 2008 but
did not submit the Draft Housing Element to the State until April of 2010 (following City Council
review and direction), due to a lack of staffing and financial resources. The City strives to meet
                                                B-31

Appendix B                                                             City of Larkspur Housing Element
all required deadlines but must take into account the difficulties of balancing current and future
planning needs with strained resources.
Program Status: Completed, and continued to next planning period.
H13.C Support Establishment of a Countywide Housing Assistance Team (HAT).
Support through coordination and other means, as determined appropriate for the City, the
establishment of a Housing Assistance Team who can advise and assist staff in implementing
housing programs and facilitating development of partnerships with affordable housing
developers for specific projects. The HAT can consist of a pool of specialists with the following
specialties: A local architect, an individual with knowledge regarding underwriting housing
financing and available funding sources, a local community representative who is
knowledgeable about local issues.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; City Council
Financing:       Marin County; possible contributions by the City (Housing Fund).
Objectives:      Establishment of HAT to assist in program implementation.
Timeframe:       January, 2005; implementation thereafter
Evaluation: Due to budgeting and staffing constraints, an official countywide HAT has not been
created. However, the County’s 11 jurisdictions collaborate in the sharing and development of
housing policies and programs. In particular, the Marin Housing Workbook process is a
successful multi-jurisdictional collaboration that analyzes current housing trends and housing
needs, and shares “best practice” inclusive and proactive housing policies. The jurisdictions also
met with affordable housing advocates, homeless services providers, and other non-profits
organizations to share strategies for meeting the housing needs of vulnerable populations
within the County. Because of the unlikelihood of funding for an official Housing Assistance
Team in this planning period, this program has been deleted.
Program Status: Deleted.
H13.D S    upport Establishment of a Permanent County “Affordable Housing
Strategist” Position. Investigate and consider supporting, through coordination and other
means, as determined appropriate for the City, the establishment of a full-time, permanent
County Housing Strategist position with adequate support staffing to work with the City in
creating affordable housing opportunities. The role of the Affordable Housing Strategist and
supporting staff will be to implement the recommendations of the Inter-Jurisdictional Strategic
Action Plan for Housing and coordinate the HAT, as described above.
Responsibility:  Planning Department; City Council
Financing:       Marin County; possible contributions by the City (Housing Trust Fund)
Objectives:      Establishment of Affordable Housing Strategist
Timeframe:       January, 2005; implementation thereafter
Evaluation: An Affordable Housing Strategist position was created by the County in the early to
mid 2000’s, working within the Community Development Agency. Due to funding constraints
this position was absorbed by the Marin County Redevelopment Agency’s Principal Planner
position. The City continues to support the positions objectives and feel that the Redevelopment
Agency Principal Planner performs the duties of the Affordable Housing Strategist sufficiently.
Thus, this program has been deleted. The City may consider reinstating the program if the
economic climate improves in the future.

Appendix B                                                              City of Larkspur Housing Element
Program Status: Deleted.
H13.E Support Establishment of a Countywide Housing Data Clearinghouse.
Coordinate with other jurisdictions, as determined appropriate for the City, the establishment of
a central housing data clearinghouse, under the Housing Strategist position (see program
H13.D above), with up-to-date information on housing conditions in the County (by
jurisdiction), best practices, State law, funding opportunities, and related housing information.
Responsibility:   Planning Department
Financing:        Marin County; possible contributions by the City (Housing Trust Fund)
Objectives:       Establishment of data methodologies; effective data collection and monitoring
Timeframe:        January, 2005; implementation thereafter
Evaluation: This program describes the Marin Housing Workbook process (discussed throughout
the Housing Element), in which the City has been an active participant. The housing data
clearinghouse is accessible on the Marin Housing Workbook’s website as well as on CD, and
contains up to date information on housing conditions within the City and County as well as
technical memos regarding best practices, new state laws, funding opportunities, and other
information. The Housing Workbook process has been valuable to the City during the current
update of the Housing Element and the City intends to continue to participate in this Countywide
effort.
Program Status: Continue program; this program has been reclassified as program H13.C in the
Housing Element. The timeframe has been amended to reflect the “ongoing” nature of the
program.

                         Chapter 1. Introduction
This is the 1990 Larkspur General Plan. It supersedes the 1972 General Plan
and any and all elements of the general plan subsequently adopted, except
for the Housing Element which was adopted by the City in October 1988
and which was revised and re-adopted in November 1990 to be consistent
with this General Plan.
The Larkspur General Plan is a comprehensive, integrated, and internally
consistent statement of Larkspur's development policies for the city and its
Sphere of Influence ("Sphere of Influence": The probable ultimate physical
boundaries and service area of a city or district as approved by Local
Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) of the County.), also referred to as
the Planning Area. (For maps of the Planning Area, see Figure 1-1and
Figure 4-1) All Planning Area lands outside of the City limits of the City of
Larkspur are regulated by the County's General Plan and the County's

zoning designations. However, State law permits the City to plan for areas
outside of its immediate jurisdiction, if those areas have a direct relationship
to the City's planning needs. Larkspur has chosen to make its General Plan
coterminous with its Sphere of Influence, and to work with the County to
assure that County land use decisions within the Larkspur Sphere of
Influence are compatible with this General Plan.
WHAT IS THE GENERAL PLAN?
The General Plan responds to, and its authority derives from, the California
Government Code, Section 65302. It is the principal policy document for
guiding future conservation and development of the city. It represents an
agreement among the citizens of Larkspur on basic community values,
ideals, and aspirations to govern a shared environment. The Plan has a long-
term horizon, addressing a 20-year time frame. Yet it brings a deliberate,
overall direction to the day-to-day decisions of the City Council, its
commissions, and City staff. The Plan--
       Organizes the desires of Larkspur residents in regard to the physical,
        social, economic, and environmental character of the city;
       Defines a realistic vision of what the city intends to be in 20 years;
       Charts the course of conservation and development that will
        determine the future character of Larkspur and the nature of its
        environment; and
       Serves as a collective community memory of issues raised and
        directions chosen during the process that updated the Plan.

ORGANIZATION OF THE PLAN
The Plan is made up of a text, diagrams, and other illustrations. The text is
arranged in chapters.
Starting with Chapter 2, each chapter begins with a description of existing
conditions or a discussion of problems or both. Desired future conditions are
stated in the form of Goals, Policies, and Programs which are the essence of
the Plan.
Goals, Policies, and Programs
Goals are long-range in nature; policies and programs are intermediate or
short-range. Goal, policy, and program are defined below, printed with the
numbering system and typeface used in Chapters 2 through 8.
Goal 1: A general, overall, and ultimate purpose, aim, or end toward
which the City will direct effort.
Policy a: A specific statement of principle or of guiding actions which
implies clear commitment but is not mandatory (The word "shall" makes
mandatory those policies in which it appears.). A general direction that the City
elects to follow, in order to meet its goals.
Action Program [1]: An action, activity, or strategy carried out in response
to adopted policy to achieve a specific goal.
In summary, goals determine what should be done, and where. Policies and
programs establish who will carry out the goals, how, and when. Together
they will determine the nature of the environment and the future character of
Larkspur. Explanatory language that immediately precedes or follows a
policy or program has the same force or obligation as the policy or program
it explains.
The reader is directed to the specific goals, policies, and programs in each
chapter. For convenience, the major themes of the Plan are grouped and
paraphrased, below.
Chapter 2, Land Use
       Preserve and enhance Larkspur's unique physical and natural setting,
        while accommodating suitable new development. Maintain the city's
        overall residential character and the scale of its neighborhoods. At
        the same time, encourage a diverse demographic (especially age and
        family and social) mix.
       Enhance the attractiveness and viability of existing commercial

         areas. Ensure that they provide neighborhood-serving businesses and
         are accessible by means other than the auto. Preserve the historical
         character of Downtown and its surrounding neighborhoods. Establish
         a town center or civic nucleus.
        Maintain the present mix of uses in the area east of Highway 101,
         especially the mobile homes affordable to seniors and to young
         families.
Chapter 3, Community Character
        Preserve, enhance, and strengthen Larkspur's livable and attractive
         environment, its community identity, and its special "sense of place."
         Promote a greater awareness of and sensitivity toward Larkspur's
         historic and archaeological heritage.
Chapter 4, Circulation
Provide safe and efficient transportation facilities for moving people and
goods within Larkspur. At the same time, give quality of life and protection
of the environment a higher priority than "traffic mobility," and do
everything possible to ameliorate the negative impacts of local and regional
traffic on Larkspur.
        Assure adequate transit service in Larkspur (bus, ferry, airport
         limousine) as alternatives to the auto.
        Improve the connections between the several parts of Larkspur and
         with neighboring communities, as well as access from Larkspur to
         the freeway.
Chapter 5, Community Facilities and Services
        Provide park facilities and recreation programs for all age groups.
         Cooperate with the several school districts to share resources and
         provide a high level of cultural, recreational, and community use of
         public buildings and lands. Preserve all existing school sites for
         future public use, giving school use the highest priority. Renovate
         and expand public buildings and facilities to meet growing demands
         for services over the next 20 years.
        Ensure the availability of quality child care in Larkspur.
Chapter 6, Environmental Resources
        Preserve and enhance open space features, including marshes and
         wetlands along San Francisco Bay and Corte Madera Creek, wildlife

        habitats, view corridors, and ridgelines. Maintain the Corte Madera
        and Southern Heights Ridges as open space and as community
        separators between Larkspur and Mill Valley and between Larkspur
        and San Rafael.
       Protect open space and shoreline/marsh conservation areas from any
        degradation that could result from public facility improvements such
        as roads, paths, sewers, or flood control projects.
       Reduce water consumption.
       Reduce the total volume of the city's waste stream.
Chapter 7, Community Health and Safety
       Do what the City can, within reason, to protect the community from
        injury, loss of life, and property damage resulting from natural
        disasters and hazardous conditions. Increase public awareness of
        flooding, seismic, landslide, fire, and other natural hazards, and of
        methods to avoid or mitigate their effects. Deter development in
        areas prone to such hazards.
       Protect Larkspur from accidental exposure to hazardous materials
        from spills, leaks, vapor releases, and improper or illegal storage and
        disposal.
       Reduce the adverse effects of noise upon persons living or working
        in Larkspur, especially the escalation of sound levels in areas where
        noise sensitive uses exist.
Chapter 8, Trails and Paths
       Make it easier to move around Larkspur without having to use a car.
        Provide safe, paved, bicycle and pedestrian paths to schools,
        shopping areas, recreation facilities, and open space preserves.
        Improve traffic safety for bicyclists and pedestrians.
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS
State law requires cities to prepare general plans covering at least seven
subjects-land use, circulation, housing, open space, conservation, noise, and
safety. Figure 1-2 at the end of this chapter shows the relationship of the
Larkspur General Plan chapters to the issues that State law requires to be
addressed.
Maps and Diagrams
Accompanying this text as an integral part of the General Plan is the official
Land Use and Circulation map. The map is provided at two different scales:
one inch to 400 feet and one inch to 800 feet, on a 1989 base map.
Maximum allowable population densities and building intensities are
presented in Chapter 2, Land Use, for each category shown on the Land Use

and Circulation map.
What is Adopted
The Land Use and Circulation and the noise contour maps are adopted. Also
adopted, and shown on separate maps as part of Chapter 8, Trails and Paths,
is the city-wide system of existing and proposed trails, paths, and bikeways.
All other maps and graphic illustrations and their captions, unless otherwise
specified in the related text and their titles, are illustrative or provide basic
information, and are not adopted as statements of policy. Appendixes A, B,
and C are informational only, and are not adopted as statements of policy.
GLOSSARY
Chapter 9 is a glossary of terms. It is provided to assist the reader in
understanding the Plan and to ensure that the terms used in the Plan are
clearly defined to establish intent and to prevent misinterpretation. The
glossary will be compared to the definitions in the City's zoning ordinance
so that any conflicts may be promptly remedied at the time of Plan adoption,
or soon thereafter.
TECHNICAL APPENDIX
A separate Technical Appendix contains background material used in the
preparation of the General Plan, such as the Final Environmental Impact
Report; three background reports on Land Use, Public Facilities and
Infrastructure, and Circulation; and a description of Larkspur's
neighborhoods. The background reports provided the Citizens Advisory
Committee with a foundation for formulating and recommending Goals,
Policies, and Programs to the Planning Commission. The Technical
Appendix, while important to a thorough understanding of the General Plan
process, is not adopted as policy by the City, nor is it essential to the day-to-
day use and implementation of the Plan. Anyone wishing to review the
Technical Appendix may do so at the Planning Department in City Hall.
THE GENERAL PLAN PROCESS
In 1988, the City decided to consolidate and update its General Plan to
provide public decision-makers and private developers with clearer and
more effective policy guidance. The two-year planning process to prepare
the Plan began in January 1989 and culminated in the adoption of a new plan
late in December 1990. Highlights of that process include:
        Appointment by the City Council of a Citizens Advisory Committee of
         65 persons with a variety of talents and interests and representing all
         of Larkspur's neighborhoods as well as many business interests. The
         Committee met six times between February and June 1989 and

         regularly during the public hearing process.
        Consultant preparation of detailed background reports on Land Use,
         Public Facilities and Infrastructure, and Circulation. The reports
         (which can be found in the Technical Appendix) describe existing
         conditions and potential planning opportunities, and were used by the
         Citizens Advisory Committee to help formulate the General Plan's
         Goals, Policies, and Programs.
        Eighteen public hearings before the Planning Commission and City
         Council.
The result of this effort is a new General Plan built upon the ideas of
Larkspur's citizens - a guide in text and maps to opportunities and conditions
for new development based on an optimal balance among the social,
environmental, and economic needs of (and costs to) the community.
ADMINISTERING THE GENERAL PLAN
Once adopted, the General Plan does not remain static. State law permits up
to four General Plan amendments per mandatory element per year
(Government Code �65358[b]). Most amendments propose a change in the
land use designation of a particular property. As time goes on, the City may
determine that it is also necessary to revise portions of the text to reflect
changing circumstances or philosophy.
State law provides direction on how cities can maintain the plan as a
contemporary policy guide: It requires each planning department to report
annually to the City Council on "the status of the plan and progress in its
implementation" (�65400 [b]). In addition, the City should
comprehensively review the Plan every five years to determine whether or
not it is still in step with community values and conditions.
AMENDING THE PLAN
Any citizen wishing to amend the General Plan would follow the procedure
generally outlined below. (More detailed information on processing and
timing is available from the Planning Department.)
1. Prior to filing an official application for a General Plan amendment, the
prospective applicant or his or her agent should discuss the proposed
amendment with the City's Planning Director. This gives the applicant a
first-hand opportunity to find out the details of the amendment process as
well as any concerns the City may have about the proposed changes.
2. Should the applicant decide to proceed with an amendment, the next step
is to file an official application with the Planning Department and pay the

required processing fees.
All applications requesting a change in land use designation must be
accompanied by a development plan of sufficient detail to ascertain the
potential impacts of the proposed project on the site and the surrounding
area. What constitutes sufficient detail is determined by the Planning
Director on a case-by-case basis.
Environmental review in accordance with the provisions of the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) will be required of every General Plan
amendment.
3. Once an application is submitted, it will be placed on an agenda for
public hearing before the City Planning Commission according to the
schedule established by the Planning Commission for General Plan
amendments. Prior to the Planning Commission hearing, the City, in
accordance with State Government Code, will provide notice to the public of
the hearing date and the item to be discussed. For an individual amendment,
this typically involves a legal notice in the The Twin Cities Times or the
Marin Independent Journal or both, and a notice mailed to all property
owners within 300 feet of the subject property. (Major amendments affecting
the entire community, such as this update of the Plan, are noticed differently
because of their scale and impact. In such cases, State law provides
alternative methods of notification that do not require notice to be mailed to
individual property owners.)
4. Planning Department staff will prepare a report to the Planning
Commission for the public hearing, describing in detail the proposed
amendment, any environmental or other impacts that may result, and
comments from other City departments or affected governmental agencies.
The staff also will state whether the Commission should recommend the
amendment to the City Council for approval or denial. The staff report is
sent to the Commission and the applicant. The staff report, comments from
the applicant, and other public testimony become factors in the
Commission's action.
State law requires that any decision on a General Plan amendment must be
supported by findings of fact. These findings are the rationale for making a
decision either to approve or deny a project. At least the following standard
findings should be made for each General Plan amendment:
1. The proposed amendment is deemed to be in the public interest.
2. The proposed General Plan amendment is consistent and compatible
with the rest of the General Plan and any implementation programs that may
be affected.
3. The potential impacts of the proposed amendment have been assessed
and have been determined not to be detrimental to the public health, safety,
or welfare.
4. The proposed amendment has been processed in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the California Government Code and the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
City-initiated amendments, as well as amendments requested by other public
agencies, are subject to the same basic process and requirements described
above to insure consistency and compatibility with the Plan. This includes
appropriate environmental review, public notice, and public hearings leading
to an official action by Council resolution.

                            Chapter 2. Land Use
This chapter describes the pattern of land development in Larkspur,
identifies where change may occur, and presents Goals, Policies, and
Programs to guide change. It defines land use categories and explains the
General Plan "Land Use and Circulation Plan" map. This chapter brings
together all land use issues, limitations, and opportunities, and balances them
with community needs and desires.
The General Plan is the official policy guide for government decision-
makers, within and outside Larkspur, on all matters related to land use. It is
also a reference for Larkspur citizens, who want to know what is planned for

their city and to property owners, who want to know the potential use of
their land.
THE LARKSPUR PLANNING AREA
According to State planning law, a city's general plan may cover "any land
outside its boundaries which in the planning agency's judgment bears
relation to its planning." By this definition, the Larkspur Planning Area
encompasses the adjacent unincorporated land in its "Sphere of Influence"
(SOI)--the probable ultimate physical boundaries and service area of the city
as determined by the Marin County Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCo)[Larkspur's Urban Service area" (see definition in Glossary) is not
cotermininious with its SOI on the west. The urban service area emcompasses only those
lands outside the city to which the City is committed to supplying municipal services "now
or in the next 5-10 years," and includes Murray Park, west Greenbrae, and the southeast
portion of the San Quentin Peninsula.]. The lands within the SOI consist of well-
established, built-up communities on one side, and a state prison on the
other. None of the area within the SOI is interested in annexing to Larkspur.
The established communities include Kentfield, Kent Woodlands, and part
of Greenbrae. They curve around Larkspur's northwestern boundaries and
cover a land area about two-thirds the size of Larkspur. The state prison (San
Quentin) occupies most (432) of the 450 acres that lie between Larkspur's
eastern boundary and the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.
Kentfield, Kent Woodlands, Greenbrae, and the San Quentin Peninsula have
strong social, economic, and transportation ties to Larkspur and could be
covered in the Larkspur General Plan. However, Kentfield, Kent
Woodlands, and Greenbrae prepared their own Community Plan (approved
by the Marin County Board of Supervisors, May 1987). The Community
Plan covers most of the subject areas typical of general plans. It presents
clear statements of the goals and policies needed to preserve the single-
family character and natural amenities of those communities. Generally, the
Community Plan and the Larkspur General Plan are in harmony.
A clear statement of goals is not available for the San Quentin Peninsula.
However, the State has no plans for closing San Quentin Prison or otherwise
changing the use of land it owns in the area (Lt. Cal White, Public Information
Officer, California State Prison, San Quentin, May 1989.) . Nevertheless, this General
Plan provides policy direction for development on the San Quentin
Peninsula if the prison is ever closed or reduced in size.
LAND USE PATTERN IN LARKSPUR
Growth was gradual in Larkspur until the move to the suburbs that followed
the completion of the Golden Gate Bridge in 1937. Figure 2-1, below,
illustrates the rapid increase in growth after 1940. Larkspur more than
tripled in population between 1950 and 1970. Ninety percent of its housing
was built after 1940 (Larkspur Housing Element, Table H-11, page H-21).
                                    Figure 2-1
                        Larkspur Population, 1910-1980
                                  [to be inserted]
Reflecting its past as a summer home retreat and its more recent role as a
"bedroom community," Larkspur is primarily residential. Thirty-eight
percent of its almost 2,000 acres is devoted to single-family and multiple-
family residential uses, while only 7 percent is commercial and industrial. Of
the residential units, 56 percent are multi-family and 34 percent are single-
family. The remaining developed land is in public use such as schools and
fire stations (6 percent), City parks (3 percent), and utilities, roads, and
railroad right-of-way (13 percent). As Figure 2-2 shows (next page), the
distribution of land uses has remained about the same since the City began
keeping track 25 years ago, except that the share of land devoted to
residential use has gradually increased (from 25 to 38 percent), while
undeveloped land dropped from 49 percent of the city in 1965 to 28 percent
in 1989.
A little over half of Larkspur's undeveloped land is publicly-owned (the
Northridge Open Space Preserve), and the other half is privately-owned.
About 76 acres of the privately-owned land in Larkspur (Little King
Mountain and saddle, and parcels on Redwood Avenue) are being acquired
by the Marin County Open Space District. (As of September 1990, the
property was in escrow.) Once those lands have passed into public
ownership, the percentage of privately-owned undeveloped land in Larkspur
will decline from 13 to 9 percent.

  Larkspur in 1989 covered 1,957 acres of land and water, seven more acres than in 1983.
The total acreage figures for 1965 and 1973 are not considered reliable and are not
presented here, but the percentage of land in each category are viewed as reliable. Note that
percentage of "Developed Land" in 1989 include land area for which development was
approved, but not yet built.
                                        Figure 2-3
                         Existing and Approved Land Use

                                      [to be inserted]
These percentages show that Larkspur is a mature city. The amount of land
available for development or redevelopment is shrinking dramatically. In
1983, there were about 203 acres of vacant or marginally-used land.
Between 1983 and 1989, about 105 acres were developed or approved for
development, leaving about 52 acres of vacant land and another 46 acres
with redevelopment potential. (Land designated for open space acquisition is
not included in the figures above.)
Another way of looking at existing development is in terms of the amount of
commercial and industrial floor area Larkspur has. According to the Marin
County Planning Department, Larkspur had 1,707,625 square feet of
commercial and industrial floor area in 1987. The square footage is divided
among six major categories of land use.

The data in Figure 2-4, above, were developed by the Marin County
Planning Department from the County Assessor's files, from Planning staff
surveys of land use, and through review by city planning staffs.
LAND USE CATEGORIES
All land within Larkspur can be grouped into categories, as shown on the
Land Use and Circulation map provided with this report. Listed below are
the land use categories that appear on the Land Use map, along with their
definitions. By law, "standards of population density and building intensity"
must be determined. However, in the event of a discrepancy between
residential units per acre and persons per acre, the unit (not the population)
density shall govern. For residential uses, the densities shown (in dwelling
units and in persons per acre) are maximums which are to be allowed only to
those developments that successfully promote social and economic diversity.
Even then, the figures do not constitute an entitlement, nor is there is any
guarantee that any individual project will be able or will be permitted to
achieve the maximum densities shown. For the commercial and industrial
categories, the specific uses mentioned are illustrative only.
Residential
Open Residential. This single-family residential category allows up to 0.2
units per gross acre, which translates into up to 2 people per 5 acres.
Minimum lot size is 5 acres, but smaller existing parcels would not be
precluded from developing one housing unit.
Very Low Density Residential. This single-family residential category allows
up to 1 unit per gross acre (up to 2 people per acre). Minimum lot size is 1
acre, but smaller existing parcels would not be precluded from developing
one housing unit.
Low Density. This category allows up to 5 dwellings per gross acre, which
translates into approximately 10 persons per acre. One house is allowed on
each lot, unless a use permit is granted for a second unit. The addition of
second units could increase density up to 10 dwellings (20 persons) per
gross acre. The lowest minimum lot size is 7,500 square feet on parcels that
are flat or on slopes up to 10 percent. (Some lots predate zoning restrictions
and do not meet these requirements, but they are legal building sites.) On
slopes greater than 10 percent, minimum lot sizes increase to 43,560 square
feet (one acre) where slopes are 45 percent or more. The City may require
minimum lot sizes as large as 10 acres for areas with Residential Master
Plan zoning. Maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for low density residential is
0.40 (lower for hillside properties with greater than 10 percent slope).
Medium Density. This category allows up to 12 dwellings per gross acre,
which translates into about 24 persons per acre. Maximum density decreases
with slope to a minimum of two units per gross acre for slopes greater than
45 percent. Maximum FAR for medium density residential is 0.50 (lower for
properties with greater than 10 percent slope).
High Density. This category allows up to 21 units (about 42 persons) per
acre on a flat site (less than 10 percent slope). Maximum density decreases
with slope to a minimum of two units per gross acre for slopes greater than
45 percent. Maximum floor area ratio for high density sites is 0.60 (lower for
properties with greater than 10 percent slope).
It is also the intent of this General Plan that single-family homes be allowed
in medium and high density districts.
Mobile Home Park. This is a residential category that allows only mobile
homes and accessory uses, up to 14 units (about 28 persons) per gross acre.
Its primary purpose is to protect existing mobile home parks from being
converted to other residential or non-residential use. (Recreational vehicle
parks are allowed with a conditional use permit.)
Commercial/Industrial
Administrative and Professional Offices. This designation provides areas for
office activities which serve local and regional needs. It allows
administrative, executive, medical, dental, and business offices, some
service establishments, medical supply sales, and laboratories. It is intended
that Administrative and Professional Office areas will be characterized by
buildings of low intensity and landscaped grounds. Floor area ratio should
not exceed 0.35, and landscaped areas (including patios and walks) should
cover at least 30 percent of the lot area.
Restricted Commercial. This designation provides for neighborhood
shopping areas to meet the frequent and recurring needs of nearby residents.
Customers can be expected to arrive on bicycle or on foot, as well as by car.
This category allows "retail" - apparel, art galleries, florists, grocery stores,
photo, sporting goods, shoes, and the like; "personal services" (e.g., laundry
and dry cleaners, shoe repair); bars and restaurants; and finance, insurance,
real estate, administrative, executive, and business offices, and the like.
Second-story housing is encouraged. Buildings are low intensity (maximum
two stories) and have a maximum floor area ratio of 0.4.
Commercial. This designation provides for neighborhood shopping needs
and the broader goods and service needs of residents of Larkspur and
adjoining communities. It is characterized by businesses that rely on
customers making trips by car, and those uses which do not necessarily
benefit from the high-volume pedestrian concentrations found in shopping
centers and Downtown. These include auto accessory stores, carpet stores,
catering establishments, department stores, and the like, as well as uses
allowed in Restricted Commercial areas. Second-story housing is
encouraged. Buildings are comparable in scale to those in the Restricted
Commercial category and have a maximum floor area ratio of 0.4.
Downtown. This designation applies to Larkspur's Downtown. It allows most
of the same uses as those allowed in the Commercial designation, but with
the goal of promoting personal services and retail sales of convenience
goods while enhancing the vitality and character of the historic commercial
area. All uses are to be compatible with the present mix of small-scale
restaurants, drug stores, retail shops, book stores, and art galleries. Second-
story housing is encouraged. The present two-story scale of buildings is to
be maintained, and off-street parking is required for new development. Floor
area ratio should not exceed 1.0.
Industrial and Service Commercial. This designation provides for a wide
variety of commercial, wholesale, service, and processing uses which are of
value to the community at large. It allows warehousing, heavy commercial,
auto sales and repair, food and drink processing, construction yards, print
shops, and similar uses. Floor area ratio should not exceed 0.4.
Public and Government
Schools. This designation applies to public schools and their grounds. Floor
area ratios should not exceed 0.25.
Public Facilities. This designation applies to federal, State, County, special
district, and publicly-owned City facilities, not including schools and
colleges. Floor area ratio should not exceed 0.25.
Open Space
Parkland. This designation applies to active and passive parks, and linear
parks (landscaped paths) in urban areas. The only structures allowed are
shelters, restrooms, storage sheds, and other structures needed to
accommodate public use or provide for maintenance of the land. Floor area
ratio should not exceed 0.10.
Open Space Area. This designation applies to any parcel of land or water
which is essentially unimproved and is devoted to the preservation of natural
resources, views, and wildlife habitats, the managed production of resources,
outdoor recreation and education, or public health and safety. It may include
publicly-owned lands as well as privately-owned lands set aside as open
space through conditions of development approval. The only structures
allowed are shelters, restrooms, storage sheds, and other structures needed to
accommodate public use or provide for maintenance of the land. The floor
area ratio should not exceed 0.10.
Shoreline/Marsh Conservation Area. This designation applies to lands
containing tidal marshes, seasonal marshes, beaches, rocky shorelines,
mudflats, wetlands, low-lying grasslands overlying historic marshlands,
streams, and riparian vegetation. It may include publicly-owned lands as
well as privately-owned lands set aside as open space through conditions of
development approval. Land uses which provide or protect wetland or
wildlife habitat, and/or which do not require diking, filling, or dredging, are
encouraged. Other uses which do not require diking, filling, or dredging but
are less protective of habitat value may be permitted when it can be proven
that the resulting public benefit exceeds environmental costs and liabilities.
Public benefits shall include but not be limited to: public access,
recreational, educational, or scientific opportunities, provision of essential
water conveyance, transportation or utility services, and protection from
flood or other natura l hazards. The only structures allowed are shelters,
restrooms, storage sheds, and other structures needed to accommodate public
use or provide for maintenance of the land. Floor area ratio should not
exceed 0.10.
Educational/Environmental Resources Area. This designation applies only
to the College of Marin campus in Larkspur. It allows outdoor athletic and
recreational programs and activities; landscape management and
horticultural educational, environmental science, and nature study, and
floodplain and wildlife habitat. No additional structures are allowed on the
land, except for classrooms, consistent with State law which gives
community college districts independence from local zoning where their
educational programs are involved.
Water Area. This designation applies to the channels of Corte Madera and
Larkspur Creeks, the lagoon within the Greenbrae Marina development, and
San Francisco Bay.
LARKSPUR'S RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
Single-Family
Each of Larkspur's single-family neighborhoods has a distinct character
which derives from its period of development or natural setting. Detailed
descriptions of each neighborhood can be found in Appendix B.
Multiple-Family
More than half of the housing in Larkspur is in multiple-family
developments. In 1989, the State Department of Finance estimated that 56
percent of Larkspur's housing was multiple-family versus 35 percent that
was single-family. This ratio is unusual for suburban communities, where
the percentages normally are reversed. Larkspur is second only to Sausalito
in the percentage of housing that is multiple-family, and it has been City
policy to preclude increases in the percentage. Multiple-family
neighborhoods are also described in Appendix B.
DESCRIPTIONS OF COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS
Downtown
Downtown Larkspur is the historic center of the community. It is a
pedestrian-oriented commercial strip - one lot deep on both sides of
Magnolia Avenue, between William Avenue and Doherty Drive that serves
the immediate retail and service needs of the surrounding neighborhoods,
but also provides services to Larkspur as a whole. The City's historic City
Hall sits on a small rise near the south end, and a relatively new shopping
center anchors the other end. Across from City Hall is St. Patrick's Church
and School. Other significant landmarks are the Blue Rock Inn and the Lark
Theater.
The area is designated as "Downtown" on the Land Use map. It is covered
by an Historic Preservation District Overlay zone which requires Heritage
Preservation Board review of zoning changes and building, demolition, and
grading permits. The Historic District was officially recognized by the State
of California in 1981 and was listed on the National Register of Historic
Places in 1982. Its buildings, shops, and streets have been kept small-scale,
pedestrian-oriented, and compatible with the area's historic character.
Niven Nursery
Just around the corner from Downtown, on Doherty Drive, is the 18-acre
Niven Nursery property. A retail nursery occupies the northeastern corner of
the property, and a wholesale flower nursery (in existence since 1921)
occupies the greenhouses to the west and south. The entire site has been
zoned Light Industrial in recognition of the City's desire to foster the
continued operation of the existing nursery, and Larkspur's historic
consultant has stated that the nursery has potential for landmark designation
based on its industrial use. However, to prepare for potential future
redevelopment, this General Plan designates the site low density residential.
North Magnolia
The North Magnolia area is about four-fifths of a mile northwest of
Downtown. Like Downtown, it is a long narrow strip only one lot deep on
both sides of Magnolia Avenue, between Murray Avenue and the
northwestern city limits. The area is characterized by small shops, some with
on-site parking, which serve the retail and service needs of the neighborhood
and, to some extent, the Lower Ross Valley. The area is newer and therefore
more auto-oriented than Downtown easier to drive to and harder to walk
between stores. The establishments are small, and it remains the City's intent
that most parking will be provided on-site. The west side is designated
Commercial, and the east side is designated Restricted Commercial.
Medical Office Area
Marin General Hospital, the largest hospital in Marin County, lies just
outside the Larkspur City Limits on Bon Air Road. The presence of the
hospital has had a significant influence on land use along Bon Air Road and
South Eliseo Drive, where medical and dental offices with some 175 doctors
and 25 dentists serve central Marin. While offices are the primary use in the
area, which is designated with the Administrative and Professional Office
land use category, related retail and personal service uses and small
convalescent hospitals also are allowed.
Sohner Plaza, at the northwest corner of Bon Air Road and Magnolia
Avenue, also houses medical and administrative offices and related retail
and personal services that benefit central Marin. Across Bon Air Road is a
small Commercial area. The buildings, which formerly housed a Safeway
supermarket and a Pizza Hut, were vacant as of 1990.
PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
Bon Air
Bon Air Shopping Center and Drake's Landing Office Center are the major
commercial components of the 70-acre Bon Air Master Plan development on
Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. The shopping center which was expanded by
80,000 square feet to 166,000 square feet in 1987 is anchored by a Petrini's
grocery store and supported by specialty retail businesses, small offices, and
banks. The office center (122,000 square feet) is also new. The Bon Air
Master Plan also accommodates 42 new town houses and 129 new single-
family houses.
A small Commercial area, with a mix of offices and retail uses, lies just west
of the Bon Air Shopping Center on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.
San Quentin Peninsula
The western end of the San Quentin Peninsula is another master-planned
area. Within its 150 acres (east of the NWPRR right-of-way) are the Wood
Island Office Complex, Larkspur Landing shopping center, several new
office buildings, a hotel, three City parks, and the Lincoln Village
apartments. The shopping center contains a supermarket, restaurants, and
stores that provide retail goods and office and food services to central Marin
as well as the entire Bay Area. One of the office buildings is built around the
historic Remillard Brick Kiln, which is protected by Historic Zoning.
Surrounded by the quarried hillsides behind the Larkspur Landing shopping
center are 348 apartments. Construction of another 248 units was underway
in 1990. The master plan showed another 350 townhouses and apartments on
the two remaining parcels. Additional residential and office development
could also occur on the parcel owned by Sanitary District No. 1.
Physically separated from the rest of the city by Highway 101, San Quentin
Peninsula development has a regional focus. This is particularly so because
of its proximity to a major interchange with Highway 101, the Larkspur
Ferry Terminal with service connecting Marin County to San Francisco, and
the Richmond/San Rafael Bridge which provides easy access to the East Bay
and an improved Highway 580. In 1989, some of the 375,000 square feet of
office space in this area was reported to be the most expensive in Marin
County (as high as $36 per square foot per year)[Grubb and Ellis Co., San Rafael].
GREENBRAE EAST
The 30 acres of land lying east of Highway 101 and south of Corte Madera
Creek is an area of very mixed uses in a range of building sizes and types.
Located there are about 300 mobile home sites in two trailer parks, a small
retail center (Marin Central Plaza), industrial uses (ready-mix concrete
company, construction business, glass-making), and some service industries
(auto repair). The uses are a product of an earlier stage in Larkspur's history
when manufacturing, heavy commercial uses, and mobile homes developed
in central Marin. Today, the unusual variety of commercial uses helps to
meet several community needs, and the mobile homes provide affordable
housing. In 1989, the City rezoned portions of the area to a new Mobile
Home Park district to ensure that the mobile homes would not be forced out
by other uses. These areas are designated Mobile Home Park on the Land
Use map.
PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Three public schools in Larkspur, one in Corte Madera, and two in Kentfield
are designated Public Schools on the Land Use map. Current enrollments
and projections are covered in Chapter 5, Community Facilities and
Services.
1. Redwood High School, a 60-acre site on the south side of Doherty Drive
between the Niven Nursery property and a commercial area in Corte
Madera, is in the Tamalpais Union High School District. The district offices
and corporation yard and two alternative high schools are also on the site.
2. Henry C. Hall Middle School occupies a 9.7-acre site on the north side of
Doherty Drive. Piper Park wraps around the east and north sides of Hall, and
Boardwalk No. 1, a residential area, is on its west side. Hall Middle School
is in the Larkspur School District.
3. Larkspur-Corte Madera School, a 5.3-acre school site on Magnolia
Avenue near the Larkspur/Corte Madera city limits, is no longer used as a
public school because of declining enrollment. The buildings are occupied
by the Larkspur School District offices and a private school, and the grounds
(and playground equipment provided by the private school) are open to
public use.
The following school lies outside Larkspur but is attended by Larkspur
children in the Larkspur School District.
Neil Cummins School, a 10-acre site on Mohawk Avenue in Corte Madera
bounded by Corte Madera Town Park and single-family homes.
The following two schools lie outside the City of Larkspur but are attended
by Larkspur children who are in the Kentfield School District.
Anthony G. Bacich Elementary School (K-5), a 9.5-acre site on McAllister in
Kentfield bounded by Creekside Park, Marin Catholic High School, and
single-family homes.
Adaline E. Kent Middle School (6-8), an 8.7-acre site at College Avenue and
Stadium Way in Kentfield bounded by Creekside Park, Marin Catholic High
School, and commercial uses.
Larkspur also has two private schools which are included in the same land
use category as surrounding uses: St. Patrick's School, 120 King St.; and
Marin Primary School, 20 Magnolia Avenue (the Larkspur/Corte Madera
School site).
Marin Catholic High School is at the corner of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard
and Bon Air Road in Kentfield, in the Larkspur Sphere of Influence.
PUBLIC FACILITIES
City Hall and Fire Station No. 1 share a site at the corner of Magnolia
Avenue and King Street. Fire Station No. 2, Drake's Landing, is on Barry
Way near Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.
The Larkspur Ferry Terminal is located on 25 acres owned by the Golden
Gate Transit District, on the south side of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard east
of Highway 101. Commuters embark for San Francisco from the ferry
terminal. Most of the site is occupied by surface parking.
The Police Administration Building/Corporation Yardoccupies about 1.5
acres in the southern portion of Piper Park.
Public facilities outside Larkspur but in its Sphere of Influence include:
San Quentin Prison, 432 acres which lie between the eastern City Limits,
Highway 580, and the San Rafael city boundary.
Marin General Hospital, a 16-acre site on Bon Air Road.
Kentfield Fire District's Fire House, located on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard
at its intersection with College Avenue.
OPEN SPACE AREAS
Parks
Larkspur's nine neighborhood parks and one community park are shown as
Parkland on the Land Use map. A wide landscaped path along the east side
of Magnolia Avenue between Bon Air Road and Dartmouth Drive is also
designated Parkland. The neighborhood parks range in size from one-third
acre to eight acres, and vary in use from nature observation to active
recreation. The community park is Piper Park, which has 22 acres. A
complete description of Larkspur's parks can be found in Chapter 5,
Community Facilities and Services.
Creekside Park, 13 acres on the northerly side of Corte Madera Creek just
west of Bon Air Road, is in the Larkspur Sphere of Influence, and is owned
and operated by the Marin County Parks Department.
Hillside and Railroad Open Space
About 260 acres of land in the southwestern corner of Larkspur is designated
Open Space. This area is part of the Marin Open Space District's Northridge
Open Space Preserve which covers more than 1,000 acres on the Blithedale
and Corte Madera Ridges that connect to Mount Tamalpais. Another 76
acres within Larkspur (131 acres including unincorporated areas) is being
added to the preserve. (As of September 1990, the property is in escrow.)
The 20-acre ridge above Larkspur Landing is designated as open space
because it must remain open under conditions of development approval of
the Lincoln Terraces apartments. Portions of the railroad right-of-way along
Holcomb Avenue, used as bike and pedestrian path and owned by the
County, are also shown as open space.
Shoreline/Marsh Conservation Areas
Portions of the shoreline along Corte Madera Creek are designated
Shoreline/Marsh Conservation areas. The Shoreline/Marsh Conservation
areas are not continuous along the creek because of preexisting
development. The designation applies to a 600-foot long strip on the south
side of the creek between Larkspur Plaza Drive and Bon Air Road. The
width of this strip ranges from about 60 to 145 feet (where it expands into a
wetland mitigation area) and covers 2.8 acres of marshland, drainage
ditch/view corridor, and bike path (Fish and Wildlife Services maps were the source
for this information. The Audubon Society, in a communication of March 10, 1990, notes
that "Tidal marshes exist in a continuous strip alog Corte Madera Creek, except in a few
locations along South Eliseo Drive where buildings have been constructed over the creek,
where interrupted by bridges, and where substrate has been covered by riptide or boat docks
at the Greenbrae marina.").
Other areas designated Shoreline/Marsh Conservation are (1) the marsh that
borders Redwood High School on the south and east, which varies in width
from 150 feet to 450 feet, with the widest expanse at the southeast corner of
the high school grounds; and (2) a strip of land between the properties on
Harvard Drive and Corte Madera Creek.
East of Highway 101, the land between Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and
San Francisco Bay, as well as the periphery of Wood Island and land
beneath the Greenbrae interchange, are designated Shoreline/Marsh
Conservation areas.
College of Marin
Most of the College of Marin is in unincorporated Kentfield. The 25.7 acres
of within Larkspur is designated Educational/Environmental Resource Area.
The Larkspur City Council adopted this designation in 1988 in response to
an initiative petition. Uses are limited to outdoor athletic and recreational
programs and activities, landscape management and horticultural
educational, environmental science, and nature study, and floodplain and
wildlife habitat. No additional structures are allowed on the land, except for
classrooms, consistent with State law which gives community college
districts independence from local zoning where their educational programs
are involved.
LAND USE GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
This section, combined with the Land Use map, contains Larkspur's Land
Use Goals, Policies, and Programs. Their overall aim is to preserve and
enhance Larkspur's unique physical and natural setting, and its
basically residential character, while accommodating suitable new
development. This includes protecting Larkspur's hillsides and creeksides,
and the vegetation, views, and general peacefulness associated with these
natural characteristics.
Neighborhoods
Goal 1: Maintain the overall residential character of Larkspur.
Goal 2: Preserve the integrity, cohesiveness, historic character, and
residential environment of existing neighborhoods.
Goal 3: Encourage a diverse demographic (especially age, family, and
income) mix in Larkspur.
The Housing Element of the General Plan includes an objective (#3), a
policy (3.1), and a program (3.2.1) aimed at developing a greater share of
housing attractive to families. At the same time, Larkspur wants to keep the
many desirable physical and social characteristics its neighborhoods now
have. To protect the integrity and cohesiveness of existing residential
neighborhoods, incompatible land uses and densities must not be allowed.
The Land Use map and the following policies and programs are designed to
provide those protections.
Policy a: Residential density standards shall consider neighborhood
characteristics, existing uses, surrounding uses, impact on the traffic
capacity of the street system, access to services, geotechnical conditions, and
natural resources.
Policy b: Residential development should not be at such a high density that
it has an unacceptable impact on the street system serving the area.
Action Program [1]: Apply open residential standards (up to 0.2 unit per
gross acre) to areas having special open space value. This designation is
also suitable for areas with limited development potential because of their
unusual configuration (e.g., railroad right-of-way) or difficult access.
Action Program [2]: Apply very low density residential standards (up to 1
unit per gross acre) to hillside areas with landsliding, seismic, or other
geotechnical problems. This designation is also suitable for areas with
special open space value.
Action Program [3]: Apply low density residential standards (up to 5
dwellings per gross acre) to hillsides and other environmentally sensitive
areas, as well as within established low-density neighborhoods.
Action Program [4]: Apply medium density residential standards (up to 12
dwellings per gross acre) to areas near commercial districts, such as Old
Downtown, if consistent with adjacent land uses.
Action Program [5]: Apply high density residential standards (up to 21
dwellings per gross acre) only in areas within easy reach of arterials, public
transit, and commercial centers that provide a range of goods and personal
services.
Policy c: Allow maximum densities in the medium and high density
residential categories as described in this Plan only in those developments
that promote social and economic diversity and environmental benefits, and
only where care is taken to preserve neighborhood scale and ambiance. (It is
intended that this policy be in harmony with Goal 4, below.)
Goal 4: Maintain the existing neighborhood scale.
As land costs rise, property owners seek to maximize their investments by
extensively remodeling and expanding existing houses. In some cases, they
may even find it economical to tear down an existing house in poor
condition and replace it with a new, larger house. This is especially true in
older neighborhoods where houses were built many years ago as summer
cottages.
While the private redevelopment of single-family homes increases property
values for their owners and their neighbors, it may also threaten the
character and scale of existing neighborhoods. Some of the large new houses
literally overshadow their smaller neighbors, although they meet all zoning
ordinance requirements. Others are proposed that can't meet today's setback,
site coverage, floor area ratio, and parking requirements. Property owners
then seek approval of a variance, use permit, or exception (depending on the
requirement). For floor area ratio exceptions, the Planning Commission must
make a finding that the visual scale and bulk of the new house is compatible
with the pattern in the neighborhood before approving the application.
Policy d: Limit the visual bulk of houses so that they fit in with
neighboring homes and the physical setting.
Action Program [6]: Explore, and implement as feasible, general standards
or Design Review Board requirements to control the bulk of second story
and other major additions to single-family houses.
Retail and Commercial Areas
Larkspur has seven retail and commercial areas. Each of the seven
commercial areas plays a separate role in serving the shopping, office, and
service needs of the community and the region.
Goal 5: Enhance the attractiveness and viability of existing commercial
areas.
Goal 6: Encourage existing commercial districts (1) to provide an
adequate mix of neighborhood-serving businesses, and (2) to be
accessible by means other than the auto.
Policy e: Maintain existing retail commercial areas in attractive physical
condition, and work to retain their special character and amenities.
Action Program [7]: For each defined commercial district, allow and
encourage only those uses that reinforce the district's role, function, and
scale.
Policy f: Discourage the creation of new commercial areas.
Policy g: Allow expansion of existing commercial areas only under
conditions that will not be detrimental to the surrounding residential
community or existing retail uses in the city, that will improve the City's
economic base, and that will reinforce the role or function of the areas as
defined in Action Program 7.
Action Program [8]: Require applicants for development approval to
demonstrate conformance to Policy "g" satisfactory to the planning
commission and city council.
Action Program [9]: Develop floor area ratios to limit the intensity of
commercial, retail, industrial, and professional office development.
Maximum floor area ratios are given in the definitions of each land use
category shown on the Land Use and Circulation map.
Policy h: Protect the integrity and cohesiveness of existing commercial
areas.
Action Program [10]: Minimize through traffic.
Action Program [11]: Require new development to incorporate design
features (building orientation, building materials, parking location,
landscaping) that encourage pedestrian use and emphasize positive
relationships with neighboring buildings and uses.
Downtown
As the historic center of Larkspur, Downtown is unique among the City's
commercial districts.
Goal 7: Preserve the character of Old Downtown (especially its historic
character) and its surrounding neighborhoods.
Goal 8: Preserve the current mix of commercial, public and
institutional, residential, and professional office uses in the Old
Downtown and the residential areas nearby.
Goal 9: Enhance the commercial vitality of Old Downtown.
One major threat to preserving Downtown is the heavy commute traffic
passing through Downtown on the Tamalpais Drive/Magnolia
Avenue/College Avenue route that connects Highway 101 in Corte Madera
with Upper Ross Valley communities. The Circulation chapter of this
General Plan includes policies and programs to deal with the commute
traffic. Policy "n" and Action Program 18 below also address Downtown
circulation issues.
Another threat to Downtown is competition from large shopping centers and
discount stores, both within Larkspur and in nearby communities.
Downtown Larkspur should capitalize on its Historic District status, walking
scale, and other assets to improve its economic standing. A 1989 survey
found that Downtown businesses were viewed as friendly and personal, but
that there was not enough diversity, and Downtown needed to improve its
appearance (Larkspur Community Association survey, February 1989). The
City of Larkspur should cooperate with business organizations to enhance
the physical environment of the Downtown and attract a diversity of new
businesses. Community-serving business should be encouraged, while taking
into consideration the economic viability and the street vitality of the Old
Downtown. Building preservation, restoration, and any new construction
should be in harmony with the street scale and historic periods represented.
Policy i: Maintain the existing scale of commercial establishments (smaller
services and retail business), and the pedestrian orientation of the Old
Downtown.
Action Program [12]: Develop incentives to promote the retention and
development of rental residential units on the upper floors of buildings in the
Old Downtown.
Action Program [13]: Prepare a Specific Plan for the Old Downtown
which addresses appropriate uses, traffic, parking, economic vitality,
building preservation, and design of new development, as well as the link
between the Old Downtown, the Larkspur Plaza (Lucky) Shopping Center,
and North Magnolia Avenue.
Action Program [14]: Join the California Main Street Program.
The California Main Street Program, administered by the State Department
of Commerce, assists cities with promotional programs, design advice, and
plans to improve their downtowns. Although a Larkspur application to the
Main Street Program in 1986 was denied, the City should try again to join
the Program.
Policy j: Maintain and enhance the architectural character of Old
Downtown.
Policy k: Maintain and enhance Downtown landscaping.
Action Program [15]: Require landscape screening of off-street parking.
Action Program [16]: Develop design guidelines for use by the
Environmental and Design Review Board and the Heritage Preservation
Board in reviewing Downtown development.
Goal 10: Create a "sense of place," a focus, along Magnolia Avenue to
serve as a town center for Larkspur.
Policy l: Reinforce the image of Old Downtown as the clearly identifiable
town center of Larkspur.
Policy m: Strengthen the tie between the Magnolia Avenue shops and the
newer shopping center at the corner of Magnolia Avenue and Doherty Drive.
Action Program [17]: Create a town square at or near the Ward-Magnolia
intersection.
Development proposals for Downtown properties within the Specific Plan
Area (designated on Figure 2-6, following page 42) will not be considered
until completion of the Specific Plan called for in Action Program 13. It is
intended that the Specific Plan respond to the goals and policies for
Downtown, beginning with Goal 7.
A major focus of the Specific Plan should be the block on which the
Chevron/ Walker property is located - a property which may be a good
location for a town square. This 1.3-acre property consists of a vacated gas
station and a section of abandoned railroad right-of-way with two historic
railroad buildings. There are other potential locations for a plaza on this
block, each of which has merits: the existing public parking lot at Ward
Street and Magnolia Avenue, in which case a new parking lot could be built
on the former gas station, and the right-of-way between the Larkspur Plaza
shopping center and the Chevron property. A plaza strategically located on
this block can tie together the old Downtown and the Larkspur Plaza
shopping center at the corner of Magnolia Avenue and Doherty Drive. A
Specific Plan for this block and its surroundings can also address ways to
create a transition from the shopping center to the Niven Nursery property.
Policy n: Improve access to Old Downtown, but do not encourage or permit
new thoroughfares parallel to Magnolia Avenue, or one-way streets.
Action Program [18]: Create additional non-vehicular (pedestrian and
bicycle) access points to Downtown to supplement Magnolia Avenue.
The Downtown Specific Plan should consider, among other things: (1)
benches or other public seating; (2) a farmers' market, open-air fresh food
arcade, or similar facility at a future town square or other Downtown
location; (3) the possibility of using the Lark Theater as a public or private
cultural center as well as a movie theater; and (4) creating additional non-
vehicular (pedestrian and bicycle) access points to Downtown to supplement
Magnolia Avenue, such as completing the trail link on the Northwestern
Pacific Railroad right-of-way. (New thoroughfares parallel to Magnolia
Avenue, or one-way streets, should not be permitted.)
Greenbrae East
The Larkspur Planning Department conducted a special study of the "East of
101" area (now called Greenbrae East) in 1987. A community survey at the
time found that most residents and property and business owners preferred to
maintain the status quo, rather than encourage changes in land use. As one
result of the study, the City Council created the Mobile Home Park Zone
District, which allows only mobile home and recreational vehicle parks. The
new zone district was applied to 10.7 acres of land where there are existing
mobile home and recreational vehicle parks.
The "East of 101" Study also identified flooding and protection of adjacent
marshes as major land use issues. The Corte Madera Ecological Preserve
borders the Greenbrae East area on the east, and the Corte Madera Shorebird
Marsh borders it on the south and southeast.
Goal 11: Maintain the present mix of retail, service, industrial, and
residential uses in the Greenbrae East area.
Goal 12: Maintain and provide housing in Greenbrae East affordable
to seniors and to young families.
Policy o: Encourage trailer parks to remain in the Greenbrae East area.
Action Program [19]: Require new or expanded uses in Greenbrae East to
be compatible with existing residential uses or to be sufficiently buffered
from them to mitigate any negative impacts.
Policy p: Ensure that new development in Greenbrae East retains a sense of
the area's physical setting by providing vistas of the ridgelines and access to
the adjacent creek, marshlands, and the Bay beyond.
Policy q: Ensure that existing uses and new development in Greenbrae East
are sensitive to the fragile environment of the adjacent marsh.
Action Program [20]: Allow access to the marshlands by people and pets
only in designated areas.
Most of the old Northwestern Pacific railroad right-of-way to the east and
the marshlands beyond are in the City of Corte Madera. Between the two
cities there is a small unincorporated pocket - a portion of the railroad right-
of-way and the Greenbrae Boardwalk. Greenbrae Boardwalk is a houseboat
colony of 50 houses stretching along the south shore of Corte Madera Creek
near where it enters the Bay. This area is in the Corte Madera Sphere of
Influence, although access is entirely from Larkspur. Residents must park
their cars in a lot in the City of Larkspur and walk along the boardwalk to
reach their homes. In 1989, the Marin County Planning Department
recommended that this area be in the Larkspur Sphere of Influence, so that if
it is ever annexed to a city, it will be annexed to Larkspur (Draft Community
Facilities Element, Marin Countywide Plan, May 1989, page 5.).
Vacant Properties and Those With Redevelopment Potential
As Larkspur reaches "build-out," community attention focuses on the City's
few remaining parcels of land with development or redevelopment potential.
To prepare for change on those parcels, this General Plan proposes specific
development guidelines.
Goal 13: On those lots where development or redevelopment is
expected to occur, integrate natural features into new development, to
the greatest extent reasonably feasible.
Goal 14: Maintain Larkspur's small-town character.
Policy r: Establish guidelines for the use and development of properties
where change is expected to occur.
Action Program [21]: Encourage a vital and active use of the Chevron/
Walker property that will also set aside appropriate public space and
maintain the historic value and open space of the adjacent railroad right-of-
way.
Action Program [22]: For a change in land use to other than the existing
nursery uses, prepare a Specific Plan for the Niven Nursery property that
identifies community desires for future use.
Action Program [23]: The City wants to encourage mixed use on the
Safeway/Pizza Hut properties. The intent is that medium density housing will
be provided as part of any redevelopment (As used in this action Program,
redevelopment means the demolition of existing buildings and the construction of new
buildings; or an increase in the overall floor area on the property; or both - whether or not
there is any change in land use.). The City also wants to encourage retail uses
that will be small in scale and will serve nearby offices or residences. To
these ends, a Specific Plan will be required for these properties to determine
the appropriate mix of uses before the properties are redeveloped. The
precise density of any residential component will be determined at the time
of adoption of the Specific Plan. Higher residential densities will be
considered for housing that is affordable to seniors and others. The
development is to take into account the properties' flood plain aspects, and
the City is to establish conditions of p roject approval that will preserve path
options along the creek. Prior to redevelopment of these properties, the
existing buildings may be used for Commercial, as that term is defined in
this Plan (see page 19), and with a use permit, for medical and dental
offices.
Action Program [24]: Develop conditions of project approval for other sites
with development or redevelopment potential.
Railroad Right-of-Way
Portions of the old Northwestern Pacific Railroad right-of-way remain
undeveloped in Larkspur. There is a north/south segment paralleling
Holcomb Avenue from the south city boundary into Downtown, and an
east/west segment paralleling William Avenue and the south boundary of
Redwood High School. The latter segment continues in an easterly direction
through Corte Madera and connects to a north/south segment on the east side
of Highway 101.
Goal 15: Maintain the Northwestern Pacific Railroad right-of-way for
public benefit.
Policy s: Maintain the sylvan setting of the right-of-way west of Highway
101.
Policy t: Preserve the station buildings near Ward Street and the electric
booster station on William Avenue.
Policy "s" refers to the portion of the right-of-way on the west side of
Highway 101 where the years of abandonment have allowed trees and
shrubs to grow up the sides of the embankment and into the right-of-way.
The Circulation and Trails and Paths chapters of the General Plan (Chapters
4 and 8) contain goals, policies, and programs on use of the right-of-way for
transit and paths.
San Quentin Peninsula
Goal 16: Allow flexibility in the use and re-use of the Airporter site.
Policy u: Support retention of the present Airporter use on its 1.5-acre site
near Larkspur Circle.
The City will be flexible with respect to the overall use of the property
provided the Airporter or a similar transit-related use is retained.
Action Program [25]: Designate the Airporter site as Public Facility to
permit transit-oriented use, but also allow other uses that will enhance and
not interfere with transit-related uses.
Goal 17: Retain all or a portion of the San Quentin Prison site for park
or other public use if prison use is discontinued.
San Quentin Prison was built in a beautiful natural setting. It would be a
prime location for a park, either in its entirety or along its Bay frontage.
However, there is little reason to expect that the prison will close. In 1989,
the prison underwent a $28 million renovation to convert it from a maximum
to a medium security facility. As of 1990, the State of California was
considering expanding the prison by 2,900 beds by 1993 (Communication with
Vernell Crittendon, Warden's Administrative Assistant, San Quentin Prison, Octobwer 4,
1990.). While it is wise for Larkspur to state its goals for future use of the
site, it is not timely to do more detailed planning.
Policy v: Work with the State, the County, and the City of San Rafael to
prepare for eventual reuse of the San Quentin Prison property; continue to
monitor prospects for future growth and change.
Policy w: Preserve the Bay frontage adjacent to Larkspur for public parks
and open space, and the ridgeline as open space.
Regional Relationships
Larkspur lies within Marin County's eastern urban corridor, where most of
the county's population lives and which contains 97.5 percent (23 million
square feet) of the county's commercial and industrial floor area (Marin
County Planning Department, April, 1989.). Highway 101 is the major tie
that binds the communities in the eastern urban corridor together. Larkspur
is also part of a smaller sub-region, the Lower Ross Valley, with which it is
even more closely linked by Corte Madera Creek which flows through the
valley, by traffic arterials, and by public service and school districts which
cross city boundaries. In an urban area such as central Marin County, land
use, transportation, and environmental problems transcend the boundaries of
individual cities. Many of these problems can be solved only through a
pooling of efforts that cuts across political and geographical boundaries.
Goal 18: Cooperate with other jurisdictions in solving regional
problems, in protecting environmental resources, and in providing
public services.
Policy x: Continue to participate with other communities in regional and
countywide planning studies.
Policy y: Work with other communities to develop common policies for
protection and enhancement of natural resources such as Corte Madera
Creek.
Action Program [26]: Work with the communities of Fairfax, San Anselmo,
Ross, and Kentfield on a set of common policies for Corte Madera Creek.
LAND USE CHANGES
This General Plan changes the land use designations of several areas and
parcels of land from the designations shown on the 1973 General Plan. In
some cases the changes simply sharpen the boundaries between land uses.
(The 1973 General Plan was more schematic.) In other cases, they are actual
changes in land use consistent with the goals of this General Plan. In
addition, this General Plan shows changes in land use designations approved
by the City Council between 1973 and 1989 and applies land use
designations to areas within the Bon Air and San Quentin Planned
Developments in a change from the previous practice of calling them Mixed
Use with a list of potential uses.
Boundary Clarifications
The following boundaries have been adjusted: the Open Space area in the
southwest corner of the city to reflect the present boundaries of the
Northridge Open Space Preserve; the Open Space area on Little King
Mountain to reflect the Tiscornia Estate addition to the Northridge Open
Space Preserve; and the San Quentin Peninsula (Southern Heights) Ridge to
correspond to the San Quentin Peninsula Master Plan.
Changes Approved by the City Council, 1973-1989
Several new parks are shown: Bon Air Landing, Greenbrae School,
Hamilton, Heatherwood, Neighborhood, Miwok, Niven, and Remillard.
The new single-family subdivision on the former Greenbrae School site is
designated Low Density Residential. The College of Marin campus within
the City of Larkspur is shown as Educational/Environmental Resource Area
consistent with the City Council's 1988 action amending the General Plan.
Mixed Uses
Rather than being shown as Mixed Use, Downtown, the Niven property,
Bon Air, and the western part of the San Quentin Peninsula are given land
use designations consistent with existing or proposed uses.
New Land Use Category
Shorelines and marshes along Corte Madera Creek, Wood Island, San
Francisco Bay, and Redwood High School are shown as Shoreline/Marsh
Conservation. Most of these areas were formerly shown as Open Space.
Their boundaries have also been more carefully delineated consistent with
development approvals.
Land Use Changes
(Paragraph numbers below are not consecutive. They correspond to the
numbers used in Figure 2-5 on page 42 and Figure 2-6, the fold-out map
following page 42.)
1b. Most of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad right-of-way parallel to
William and Holcomb Avenues has been changed from Open Space to Open
Residential. This difficult-to-develop area will remain predominantly open,
but the designation will allow some economic use of the land. Two segments
of the right-of-way owned by Marin County remain as Open Space. The
Bicycle/Pedestrian Circulation Plan in Chapter 8 shows that a path is
planned for the right-of-way.
4. The Historic Preservation Overlay Zone should be applied to the
Tiscornia Property (site of the Historic Escalle Winery) on Magnolia
Avenue to support the preservation and restoration of the historic winery
buildings.
9. The 17.9-acre Niven Nursery property fronting on Doherty Drive is
designated Low Density Residential. However, the present wholesale and
retail nursery uses on the site are viewed as desirable and will be allowed to
remain indefinitely. Therefore, the property will retain its present zoning of
L-1, Light Industrial, and the zoning ordinance will be amended to restrict
the property to its present use. The property will be rezoned when it is no
longer used for nursery, and a Specific Plan will be required before the
property is redeveloped in any use other than nursery. (See Action Program
22 on page 35.) Some parts of this site may have potential for higher density
residential - such as housing that is affordable to seniors and others - and
commercial development, but potential problems with traffic, as well as
transition to adjacent uses, must be addressed first.
11. The land use designation for the Chevron/Walker property will remain
Downtown Commercial, but development proposals will be considered only
after a Specific Plan is completed for the Downtown. (See Action Program
13, page 32.) A public plaza may be located somewhere in the block. (See
page 33, Action Program 17 and the text following.)
The plaza location decision should be viewed in the larger context of what
will be developed in the entire area from the intersection of Ward Street and
Magnolia Avenue north to Doherty Drive encompassing the western edge of
the Niven property and the existing shopping center. For that reason, the
General Plan designates this a special study area that requires preparation
of a Specific Plan before any further development is allowed.
12. The land use designation for the two parcels known as "Lincoln III" is
changed from Mixed Use to Low Density Residential, which will allow up
to 5 dwelling units per gross acre. Although the master plan for this part of
the San Quentin Peninsula called for a maximum density of up to 14 units
per gross acre on Lincoln's two remaining parcels, conditions have changed
significantly since passage of the ordinance that adopted the master plan.
Traffic has grown to the point where it strains the capacity of Sir Francis
Drake Boulevard, and new information about soils and environmental
hazards has confirmed the fragility of the site. The General Plan therefore
recommends a designation that will allow up to 90 dwelling units on the two
parcels. The ultimate number of units will depend on the application of the
slope ordinance to these properties.
14. The 1.5-acre Airporter site near Larkspur Landing Circle has been
changed from Mixed Use to Public Facility to permit future transit-related
use. The parcel could be used for a transit station and parking lot if the
adjacent railroad right-of-way becomes a transit line as recommended by
this and other Plans. (See Goal 16, Policy "u," and Action Program 25 on
pages 36-37.)
15. The 9.9-acre Sanitary District No. 1 site (which is surplus sanitary
district property) has been changed from Mixed Use to Medium Density
Residential except for about four acres fronting directly on Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard which is designated Administrative and Professional Offices. The
office use would be compatible with adjacent uses on Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard and would buffer the multiple-family area behind (north of) it
from traffic noise. Access to the office area should be from Larkspur
Landing Circle for reasons of safety and traffic flow. Some park space
should be provided as a buffer from and access to Tubb Lake. The area may
need archaeological reconnaissance.
18. The marsh area along the south and eastern boundaries of Redwood
High School has been changed from Public to Shoreline/Marsh
Conservation.

                            Chapter 3. Community Character
The City has set as a major goal to preserve, enhance, and strengthen community identity.
The first part of this chapter briefly discusses the elements of Larkspur's community
character, its boundaries, the natural and built environment, and the gateways to Larkspur.
(Appendix A describes "gateways" into the city, and Appendix B portrays each of the city's
27 neighborhoods.) The section concludes with a set of Goals, Policies, and Programs that
relate to community character.
This chapter also discusses historic and archaeological resources and concludes with a set
of Goals, Policies, and Programs relating to the preservation of those assets.
THE ELEMENTS OF LARKSPUR'S CHARACTER
Larkspur is an unusual and fortunate community. Its character - tangible and identifiable -
results from the combination of its small "Main Street" focus (Magnolia Avenue); the
town's magnificent natural setting among mountains, valleys, and water; and its older
residential areas, with their mature trees, immediately around Magnolia Avenue.
Boundaries
Larkspur's boundaries are not clear. Larkspur lies within Marin County's eastern urban

corridor, where most of the county's population lives, and is one of several communities in
the Lower Ross Valley. Curving around Larkspur in the shape of a horseshoe on its
northwest are the unincorporated communities of Kentfield and part of Greenbrae. The San
Quentin Peninsula (east of Larkspur Landing to the Richmond/San Rafael Bridge) is also
adjacent and within Larkspur's Planning Area.
In addition to the adjacent unincorporated areas, Larkspur is bounded by the cities of San
Rafael on the north and Mill Valley and Corte Madera on the south. While highly visible
ridges form natural boundaries between Larkspur and San Rafael and between Larkspur and
Mill Valley, the city's boundaries with Corte Madera and unincorporated Greenbrae and
Kentfield are not at all apparent. The absence of typical boundaries - creeks, major
roadways, distinct changes in land use - makes it very difficult to identify where the
transition occurs from one community to another. Indeed, half of Greenbrae is in the City of
Larkspur and half is unincorporated, and its separate identity is reinforced by its postal zip
code - Greenbrae 94904 (part of San Rafael's Post Office)--versus Larkspur 94939.
The Natural Environment
Throughout Marin County, open space - particularly along hillsides and ridgelines - has
played a major role in shaping urban form. The general physical form of Larkspur and
Corte Madera together can be described by viewing the left hand from above, with thumb
and index finger separated and extended: The thumb represents the Corte Madera Ridge
(Official USGS nomenclature. Its eastward extension between Corte Madera and Mill Valley is more
commonly known as North Ridge (of Mill Valley).), which separates Larkspur from Mill Valley;     the
index finger represents the Southern Heights Ridge (Official USGS nomenclature), which
separates Larkspur from San Rafael and extends eastward to form the San Quentin
peninsula. The area between the thumb and index finger represents the flatter and more
urbanized areas of Larkspur and Corte Madera. Where the thumb and index finger join, the
Lower Ross Valley narrows and extends northwest into Kentfield and Ross. At the open
end of the two fingers is the San Francisco Bay.
The only topographical separations between Larkspur and Corte Madera are Palm Hill and
the right-of-way and embankments of the former Northwestern Pacific Railroad. Also,
because Greenbrae is built on the visible south-facing slope of the "Southern Heights
Ridge," the separation between Larkspur and San Rafael is not as clear.
Major highway routes have also been greatly affected by topography. Excluding Highway
101, there are only two continuous routes through Larkspur, and both were sited to conform
to topography. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard is the east-west connection between West
Marin, the Upper Ross Valley, Larkspur, San Quentin, and the East Bay. After coming east
through the center of the Ross Valley, the road hugs the base of the Southern Heights Ridge
(Greenbrae), and after passing north of Wood Island and the Ferry Terminal (two important
landmarks), the road follows the shoreline of the Corte Madera Channel before diverting
northward over the ridge and around San Quentin to the Richmond Bridge. The north-south
route (College Avenue, Magnolia Avenue, Corte Madera Avenue, and Camino Alto) hugs
the base of Ross Hill (opposite College of Marin) and the base of King Mountain (at Bon
Air Road).
Most of the area between these roads is flat land, water, and marsh. Major exceptions are
Bon Air Hill, Wood Island, and Palm Hill. Corte Madera Creek flows through the center of
the valley floor. Although the once natural lines of the creek have been engineered into a
wide flood-control channel, the creek still meanders in several "S" curves. Overall, it is a
pleasant looking waterway, and northwest of Bon Air Road, bicycle/pedestrian paths run
along both banks.
The Built Environment
All of Larkspur's "flatland" housing lies in the valley between Magnolia Avenue and Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard. The community's hillside houses are located on Palm Hill (a
small landmark hill of single-family houses), on Bon Air Hill (a larger landmark, all
multiple-family), in Greenbrae (north of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard to the top of Southern
Heights Ridge, and all single-family), west of Magnolia (primarily single-family, with
Skylark Apartments being a major exception), and east of Highway 101, north of Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard (all multiple-family).
In very general terms, residences first developed in Larkspur west of the Northwestern
Pacific Railroad; second, they were built north of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard (Greenbrae);
and only third, did housing move into the flatland areas toward the creek. Greenbrae is the
city's largest neighborhood and represents the second wave of houses. The third wave - the
newest developments - lie east of Magnolia Avenue, north of Doherty Drive, south of Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard.
These are very diverse areas. Many of them have views of and access to mountains and
ridges, or to the creek and Bay, or both. Appendix B discusses each neighborhood in terms
of its particular personality and amenities.
No discussion of the urban form or community character of Larkspur can overlook the role
of Corte Madera Creek. While the creek is an obvious open space resource and provides a
focus along the length of the community, it also divides north Larkspur from south
Larkspur. Between College Avenue on the northwest and US Highway 101 on the east, only
Bon Air Road bridges the creek. The result is that from the easterly sections of the
community, one must go "out of town" - on a tortuous route through Corte Madera - to
travel between north and south Larkspur.
Gateways
One's general impression of Larkspur depends on the point from which the community is
entered or the place from which the city is observed. Larkspur is entered at six major
gateways - one from the east (from East Sir Francis Drake Boulevard alongside San
Quentin Prison); one from the north (descending from the Southern Heights Ridge
southbound on US Highway 101); two from the west (southbound on College Avenue from
the College of Marin, and eastbound on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard from Wolfe Grade
Drive); and two from the south (northbound on Magnolia Avenue from Corte Madera, and
northbound on US Highway 101 above the NWPRR right-of-way and just south of - before
- the Lucky Drive intersection). The visual impressions from each of the gateways is quite
different; they are reviewed in Appendix A.
NEIGHBORHOODS
While there is some recognition of a larger image of community, most Larkspur citizens
also see themselves as coming from a specific neighborhood. Many of these neighborhoods
are named after the original development, which may have had only a few dozen homes.
The size and location of these neighborhoods is a direct product of the scale and pace of
development in Larkspur over the years. Thus, one way to define Larkspur is as a collection
of neighborhoods.
Appendix B divides the city into five planning areas and 27 neighborhoods. (These are
shown on Figure B-1 in Appendix B.) First the location and boundaries of the
neighborhoods are described. Then, for each neighborhood, a more detailed description is
provided.
GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
Larkspur's many assets include the historic and compact Downtown, the variety and
individuality of the city's neighborhoods, the cohesiveness of several recent projects and
planned developments, mature street and yard landscaping, many bicycle paths, etc.
Detracting from the assets are the fragmentation of the community, the undefined
boundaries, overhead utility lines, and traffic intrusion from other communities. (Regarding
traffic intrusion, while it is true that Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and Magnolia Avenue
carry traffic to other communities, that traffic does not pour through Larkspur's
neighborhoods. In that respect, Larkspur is indeed fortunate.)
The following Goals, Policies, and Programs are designed to preserve and enhance the
positives and eliminate the negatives.
Goal 1: Preserve, enhance, and strengthen community identity.
Policy a: Streets should be named for trees, natural features in the area, or local historic
persons or places.
Goal 2: Maintain Larkspur's livable and attractive environment.
Policy b: Preserve the desirable features of the built environment as well as the remaining
natural environment - trees, marshes, creeks, hillsides - as components of Larkspur's
community character and identity.
Action Program [1]: Start a tree-planting and preservation program that will encourage
sensitive site planning, the retention of existing trees, the planting of new trees (especially
native species), and the replacement of trees that are removed.
Policy c: Seek ways to strengthen the ties between neighborhoods while preserving
neighborhood individuality and uniqueness.
Action Program [2]: Prepare an Urban Design Plan for Larkspur.
The Plan will identify the relationship between existing and proposed development and the
natural setting, and will identify the characteristics of the natural and constructed
environment that are considered desirable. Goals, policies, and programs will be developed
to preserve and strengthen community character; to improve the design quality of new
development, major remodelings, and public improvements; and, thus, to guide the design
of development in the city into the next century.
Action Program [3]: Link neighborhoods with paths.
Policy d: Visually integrate the various sections of the community.
Action Program [4]: Make consistent use of common design elements such as street
lamps, signs, street trees, the Larkspur banners, and landscaping.
For example, (1) Larkspur's distinctive pennant/banners could be installed at all public
buildings and, in clusters, at all entrances to the City; (2) Victorian or other older-looking
street lamps could be installed Downtown, with more modern lamps used elsewhere in the
city. (Were the latter example implemented - to strengthen community identity - probably
no more than two or three types of lamps should be used in the entire city, with each type
carefully selected in terms of appearance, function, cost, maintenance, and ability to
withstand vandalism.)
Policy e: Draw the community together; psychologically and socially integrate the various
sections of the community.
Action Program [5]: Sponsor community-wide events and programs and community
improvement programs.
Policy f: Seek to eliminate overlapping political and geographical divisions within
Larkspur.
Policy g: As opportunities arise, modify the boundaries for municipal functions (police,
fire, land use, sewage, storm drainage, school districts, etc.) so that they become more
coterminous.
Larkspur already provides police and fire service and regulates land use within its
boundaries, but the city is divided among several school districts. Greenbrae and Kentfield
are divided among police, fire, and land use. All of these areas have in common their trash
collection service, water supply, and flood control.
Action Program [6]: Pursue annexations and de-annexations as necessary to foster more
rational service area boundaries.
Appropriate environmental analyses should be undertaken for all annexations and de-
annexations pursuant to this program.
HISTORIC RESOURCES
This Historic Resources portion of this chapter replaces the 1978 Heritage Preservation
Element which established the City's comprehensive program for identifying and preserving
historic resources.
Much of Larkspur's charm and character derives from its rich architectural heritage. Its
historic resources are irreplaceable assets that contribute to the special and unique character
of the city and are a source of identity and pride for its residents. In recognition of the
importance of these resources to its community image, Larkspur has made a major
commitment to historic preservation, in both the public and private sector.
In the 1970s, the Larkspur Heritage Committee took the first steps toward an historic
preservation program by surveying the city to identify historic buildings, places, and
organizations. Their survey resulted in the publication of Larkspur Past and Present, a
comprehensive 140-page document which organizes all the identified historic places into
eight geographical areas: Downtown Larkspur; Central Larkspur; "The Loop"; Baltimore
(Madrone) Canyon; Baltimore Park; Boardwalk #1 (Larkspur Boardwalk) and the Magnolia
Avenue Victorians; North Larkspur (Murray Park and Escalle); and Greenbrae, San Quentin
Peninsula, and Greenbrae Boardwalk.
The survey provided the foundation for action by the Larkspur City Council in 1978 to
adopt an historic preservation program. The Council added a Heritage Preservation Element
to the General Plan; created an Historic Preservation Board; added an Historic District to
the Larkspur zoning ordinance; and approved an Historic Resources Inventory.
The City's historic resources inventory - based on the list in Larkspur Past and Present - is
described by ordinance as "structures, sites, areas, and natural phenomena" which fit one or
more of the following criteria: reminders of events and persons important in history,
examples of once-common structures, unique or irreplaceable assets, examples essential to
maintaining the overall historic character of an area, or structures having architectural
significance.
The "H" Historic combining zone has been applied to Downtown properties fronting on
both sides of Magnolia Avenue between William Avenue and Doherty Drive, and has also
been applied to the Remillard Brick Kiln on East Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. In addition
to the local designation of historic places, the Remillard Brick Kiln, the Dolliver House at
58 Madrone, the Alexander Avenue Bridge, and the entire Downtown have been placed on
the National Register of Historic Places. The Brick Kiln is also a State Historic Landmark
(Conversation with Nancy Curley, Larkspur Heritage Preservation Committee Board, May 17, 1989.) .
The Dolliver House is said to be the first house constructed in the new township of
Larkspur in 1888.
The Alexander Avenue Bridge is a concrete structure which arches over the old
Northwestern Pacific Railroad tracks between Alexander and Acacia Avenues. It was built
in 1927.
Thirty historic buildings and sites, including City Hall, are in the Downtown Historic
District. The buildings "present a capsule history of the town," according to Larkspur Past
and Present, because all periods of the city's history are represented.
The Remillard Brickyard was a booming operation from 1891 to 1915. The kiln was
restored as part of the construction of an office development on the site (Larkspur Past and
Present (Larkspur Heritage Committee, 1979).
The heritage preservation program is designed to be a community activity, relying on
citizen participation for its effectiveness. The program establishes a framework for the
identification, establishment, and protection of sites, structures, and artifacts of
architectural, historical, archaeological (see next section) or cultural significance. Also
protected are significant natural resources, geologic features, trees, and other plant
materials.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
The Coast Miwok Indians lived along Larkspur's marshes and creeks, and hunted in the
heavily wooded hills around Mount Tamalpais until the 1800s. Their ancestors lived in the
area as long as 3,600 years ago. Evidence of their prehistoric presence has been found in
eleven "shell mounds" within the Larkspur Sphere of Influence (five of them within the city
limits), as well as a habitation site near College of Marin, CA-MRN-406, and a quarry site,
CA-MRN-525, within the city limits)[Communication with Vicki Beard, California Archaeological
Inventory, Northewest Information Center, June 30, 1989. The shell mounds are sites CA-MRN-67 through
79 and CA-MRN-255.]. Finds of prehistoric material have included chert and obsidian flakes,
projectile points, mortars and pestles, shells and bones, and human burials.
The exact location of these sites is kept confidential by the California Archaeological
Inventory (CAI) to prevent vandalism and artifact hunting and to protect landowners from
trespass (California Government Code (6254.10 exempts archaeological site information from the California
Public Records Act which otherwise requires that public records be open to public inspection.) . Access to
site location information is usually limited to landowners, cultural resource consultants,
planners, and scholarly researchers. Those granted such access sign an agreement to keep
the information confidential and not to disclose it to unauthorized individuals or in
documents distributed to the public.
In addition, one unrecorded site is known to exist within the Sphere of Influence, near the
upper end of Baltimore Canyon. A possible site on Wood Island has been mentioned
locally, but CAI has no records of an archaeological site at that location. It should be noted,
however, that less than five percent of the Larkspur Sphere of Influence has been surveyed
for cultural resources, and there is a high probability of additional unrecorded sites
(Communication from Vicki Beard, California Archaeological Inventorty, Northwest Information Center,
June 30, 1989.). Therefore, before any ground-disturbing activity occurs, it is important that
archival or field studies or both be conducted on a project-specific basis.
Goals, Policies, and Programs for Historic and Cultural Resources
Goal 3: Assure the survival of Larkspur's special "sense of place."
Policy h: Encourage broad-based community interest in and support of preservation
activities.
Policy i: Identify significant archaeological, historic, and natural resources representing all
of the ethnic, cultural, and economic groups that have lived and worked in Larkspur.
Action Program [7]: Maintain an up-to-date inventory of existing historic resources,
including artifacts, structures, sites, areas, and natural phenomena.
Action Program [8]: Maintain a City-adopted list of historic, archaeological, and natural
resources worthy of preservation.
Action Program [9]: Map the location of historic districts and historic and natural
resources.
Policy j: Safeguard and maintain significant historic, archaeological, and natural resources.
Action Program [10]: Administer the heritage preservation ordinance so as to provide for
the appropriate development and maintenance of historic resources and their environments.
Action Program [11]: Maintain and support the Heritage Preservation Board.
The Heritage Preservation Board is the body that recommends to the City Council the
designation of historic resources either for landmark or historic district status, or for "H"
zoning. In conducting its work, the Board prepares forms and submits applications for
properties determined to be worthy of being listed as State Landmarks or placed on the
National Register of Historic Places. It issues certificates of recognition for locally
designated historic resources.
Under the "H" zoning, all applications for building, grading, or demolition permits, or on
any other work which might be authorized by zoning, are subject to review and action by
the Heritage Preservation Board. The Board may recommend conditions of approval to the
appropriate City review person or body.
Action Program [12]: Apply the "H" Historic zone to other historic buildings or places,
such as the Escalle Winery.
Insofar as possible, seek the cooperation of property owners for historic designation and
zoning.
Policy k: Accommodate anticipated development and population growth in ways that will
not damage Larkspur's historic, archaeological, and natural resources.
Action Program [13]: Provide a quick-response mechanism for saving resources
threatened by construction or demolition.
Action Program [14]: Establish design guidelines for property owners, developers, and
public agencies to use with respect to land use and building construction in areas of
identified historic, archaeological, or natural significance.
Action Program [15]: Review all public policies, and modify them as necessary, to
support the policies of this chapter to protect and preserve historic, archaeological, and
natural resources while protecting the general health, welfare, and safety of the public.
Action Program [16]: Direct capital improvement programs toward protecting,
preserving, rehabilitating, and enhancing historic, archaeological, and natural resources.
This effort might include locating existing federal, State, regional, and local funding
resources to underwrite preservation and rehabilitation; exploring private funding sources
for the same purpose; and developing training programs in the crafts and skills needed for
preserving historic, archaeological, and natural resources.
Action Program [17]: Provide local incentives for restoring and maintaining historic,
archaeological, and natural resources.
These might include reduction or elimination of application, permit, or hook-up fees;
flexibility in land uses allowed; or increases in density.
Action Program [18]: Coordinate City and other public agency programs so that the
City's objectives and standards for preserving historic, archaeological, and natural
resources are met.
For example, the City should assure that the State's alternative building code requirements
for historic structures are followed.
Action Program [19]: Use the principles and practices of land use planning to promote
the preservation of historic, archaeological, and natural resources.
The City should review its existing zoning regulations to identify deficiencies relating to
preservation, and should then adopt amendments to foster preservation.
Goals, Policies, and Programs for Archaeological Resources
Goal 4: Promote a greater awareness of and sensitivity toward Larkspur's
archaeological heritage.
Policy l: The City shall cooperate with the CAI toward the protection and preservation of
artifacts in those areas already identified as containing archaeological remains.
Policy m: The City shall cooperate with the CAI in the development of information which
will allow the prediction of additional sites likely to contain archaeological remains.
Action Program [20]: Programs of public information will be initiated to make property
owners aware of background data on archaeologically significant structures or sites on
their properties.
Action Program [21]: All development applications and public projects that require EIRs
will routinely be sent to the "California Archaeological Inventory - Northwest Information
Center" at the Department of Anthropology, Sonoma State University, for review and
recommendations regarding archaeological findings.
In those areas identified as being the actual or probable sites of archaeological remains, any
projects on City land or requiring the issuance of permits by the City will be investigated
during plan review to determine whether valuable archaeological remains will be affected
by the project. Upon the first discovery of any archaeological findings, development
activity will be halted until professional archaeological examination and preservation is
accomplished.
Policy n: The City shall take all possible precautions to insure that no action by the City
results in the loss of the irreplaceable archaeological record present in the City's planning
jurisdiction, and shall work with the County toward that end.
Action Program [22]: The City shall promote the preservation of archaeological sites by
considering any significant remains in its planning for parks.
Funds from federal, State and local sources should be sought to acquire archaeological sites
for park or other public purposes, and to preserve any artifacts.
Action Program [23]: The City may permit land uses other than those designated on the
General Plan Land Use and Circulation map on sites with archaeological merit, in order to
preserve the archaeological record.
The substitute use would have to be compatible with the surrounding area or the proposed
development of the surrounding area. The effect of this program is to permit a land use
other than the use called for on the General Plan Land Use and Circulation map, if that
substitution will preserve archaeological qualities.
Action Program [24]: Where an archaeological site is in proximity to a project under
review, City staff in conjunction with CAI will determine the particular qualities to be
preserved and the methods of preservation.

                             Chapter 4. Circulation
This chapter describes the existing circulation system and travel characteristics
in and around the City of Larkspur. It also projects future demand for travel,
based on "build-out" of the Land Use Plan and the anticipated circulation
deficiencies that would result, and suggests potential ways to alleviate these
inadequacies. At the conclusion, these technical analyses are brought together
with practical community needs and desires, and presented as the Circulation
Goals, Policies, and Programs.
Figure 4-1 (next page) shows Larkspur's relationship to the regional
circulation system. Circulation in the city and its Sphere of Influence (which
includes the unincorporated areas of Greenbrae and Kentfield) is heavily
influenced by its location at the junction of U.S. Highway 101 (the north-south
spine of eastern Marin County) and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, the only
east-west roadway that completely spans the county. As a result, the city is
traversed by many "through" travelers.
Travelers move about Larkspur in a number of ways: roadways, fixed route
local and commuter bus transit, airport feeder service (to San Francisco
International), ferry service, para-transit, taxi, and bicycle, pedestrian, and
equestrian paths. The 1980 census provides some insight into how Larkspur's
citizens travel to work. Although home-to-work trips are only one element of
the traffic flow, they make up a large portion of peak hour traffic the time
when most congestion occurs (see Figure 4-2). Most Larkspur citizens either
drive to work alone (58 percent) or share a ride (15.6 percent), for a total of
almost three-quarters of commuters. Close to 17 percent took transit, and the
remaining 10 percent used others methods, such as walking, bicycling, or
motorcycling, or stayed at home.
It is also interesting to see where people work (see Figure 4-3). Almost equal

numbers of people work in Marin County (46.6 percent ) and San Francisco
(46.3 percent ). About 12 percent live and work in Larkspur. Smaller
percentages work in other counties in the Bay Area.

ROADWAY CIRCULATION
Larkspur is served by three main traffic arterials which carry both local and
through traffic (see Figure 4-4):
        Sir Francis Drake Boulevard;
        Corte Madera Avenue, Magnolia Avenue, and College Avenue; and
        Doherty Drive.
In addition, Highway 101 provides regional access. Other roads also serve
important circulation functions in Larkspur:
        Bon Air Road, which connects Sir Francis Drake Boulevard to
         Magnolia Avenue.
        Wolfe Grade, which provides access to D street in San Rafael from
         Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.
        Madrone Avenue, a collector serving the area west of Magnolia, south
         of Downtown.
        Redwood Highway, which parallels Highway 101 in the vicinity of
         the Lucky Drive/ Industrial Way interchange.
Other roadways in Larkspur provide local access to property. Although these
are important, the main focus of the General Plan is on roads of city-wide
significance.
Circulation options in the Larkspur area are relatively constrained. First, there
are only the three through-corridors described above. Virtually all trips made
in Larkspur travel on one or more of these roads. Second, there are only three
crossings of Corte Madera Creek: one at College Avenue, another at Bon Air
Road, and the third at Highway 101. Quite a bit of local travel uses the
freeway just to get over Corte Madera Creek.
How Congested Are the Roads?
Traffic flow in urban settings is usually constrained by the manner in which
traffic passes through intersections. Other factors that can reduce the ability
of a roadway to handle traffic flow relate to frequency of driveway access,
width of the roadway, and grade. Considering these characteristics of urban
traffic flow, a measurement technique known as "Level of Service" is used by
transportation engineers to compare conditions.
The Level of Service Concept
The Level of Service analysis results in a letter grade for each intersection
studied, from A through F, with A being free flow with insignificant delays,
to F, which is a gridlock condition. As part of its Circulation Assessment
Permit (CAP) ordinance, the City of Larkspur has implemented a policy that
intersections should not be worse than Level of Service (LOS) D during peak
periods. However, some intersections on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard are
operating at LOS E during peak periods.
Different techniques are used to evaluate Level of Service depending on the
type of control at the intersection.

 Report No. 209, Transportation Research Board,
 Washington, D.C., 1985.
       Signalized Intersections. At signalized intersections, an overall
        relationship of the volume using the intersection to its capacity is
        translated into the Level of Service grade. Figure 4-5 (preceding page)
        provides definitions of each of the Level of Service grades, and their
        corresponding volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio. The Level of Service D
        threshold is represented by a V/C ratio of between 0.80 and 0.89.
       Unsignalized Intersections (Minor Street Stop). For unsignalized
        intersections where stop control is provided on the minor street only
        (e.g., Magnolia Avenue intersection with William Avenue), each
        traffic movement that must yield to another movement is given a letter
        grade, based on the availability of gaps in the conflicting traffic flow
        to make the turn. Usually, the left-turning traffic from the minor street
        (e.g., William Avenue) onto the major street (e.g., Magnolia Avenue)
        has the worst Level of Service. Figure 4-6 on the preceding page
        summarizes the Level of Service definitions for two-way stop-
        controlled intersections. It should be noted that this type of
        intersection may generally operate with little delay, but left-turning
        traffic from the minor street could have difficulty finding a gap in the
        traffic flow on the major street, resulting in an "F" grade.
       Unsignalized Intersections (All-way Stop). For unsignalized
        intersections with all-way stop control (e.g., Magnolia Avenue at King
        Street), an overall Level of Service indication for the intersection is
        possible, based on the relationship of volume to overall capacity.
        However, it is only possible to determine whether the intersection is
        better or worse than LOS C.
Note that it is not appropriate or possible to directly compare the Level of
Service grade of one type of intersection (e.g., signalized) with another type
(e.g., unsignalized).
Key Corridors
The following describes each key corridor in the city, its overall traffic flow
characteristics under existing conditions, and as appropriate, Level of Service

ratings at critical locations. Two illustrations have been prepared to highlight
traffic conditions in Larkspur. Figure 4-7 shows estimated average daily
traffic volumes at selected key locations on the city's circulation system.
Figure 4-8 illustrates locations where the Level of Service is approaching, at,
or over the threshold of D ordained by the city.

Highway 101. Route 101 is usually quite congested in the vicinity of the Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard interchange (also called the Greenbrae
interchange), especially north of the interchange going up Cal Park Hill.
Traffic from the northbound Sir Francis Drake Boulevard on-ramp merging
onto the freeway exacerbates the capacity-reducing impact of the upgrade. In
the southbound direction, there are conflicts between traffic entering the
freeway and cars exiting at Lucky Drive. At the Lucky Drive interchange,
the southbound on- and off-ramps meet Fifer Avenue and Nellen Avenue at
the ramp terminus, resulting in difficulty for through-traffic on Nellen.
Recent Caltrans studies indicate that there is little excess capacity on the
freeway on the Greenbrae interchange ramps as they are currently
configured. The 1987 volume south of the interchange was estimated by
Caltrans to be 160,000 vehicles per day; north of the interchange Caltrans
estimates 135,000 vehicles per day.
Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. This is a key east-west through-road in Marin
County, stretching from Point Reyes on the west to the San Quentin
Peninsula on the east. In the Larkspur Sphere of Influence, it begins on the
west at the boundary with Kentfield as a four-lane, undivided roadway with
some twists and turns, but becomes divided on the approach to College
Avenue. In the commercial area east of College Avenue near the College of
Marin, limited on-street parking is allowed. Further east, Sir Francis Drake
passes the Bon Air Shopping Center, where significant turning traffic tends
to cause delays in through-traffic flow.
As the road approaches the Greenbrae interchange, only the left lane
continues through to East Sir Francis Drake Boulevard - the right lane
becomes the southbound Route 101 on-ramp. For westbound traffic near the
interchange, only one lane serves through-traffic, while two left-turn lanes
lead to the southbound on-ramp. The interchange itself is an intricate
assembly of ramps that separates conflicting traffic flows, with some non-
standard characteristics. For example, traffic desiring to proceed northbound
on Route 101 from the Redwood Highway on ramp just south of the
Greenbrae interchange must first cross Sir Francis Drake Boulevard at grade.
This additional traffic tends to degrade the Level of Service at this
intersection to the D level currently experienced.
Just east of the interchange, East Sir Francis Drake Boulevard has two
through lanes in each direction and a median as it passes the Golden Gate
Transit Ferry Terminal and the Larkspur Landing mixed use development.
East of Larkspur Landing, Drake becomes a two-lane undivided roadway
with refuge for left-turning traffic. It continues past the State prison and
intersects with Andersen Boulevard in San Rafael, then leads directly onto
the I-580 eastbound on-ramp and the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.
On Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, morning traffic flow is heavy, but not
gridlocked. The area in front of the Bon Air Shopping Center (near Eliseo
Drive), tends to experience some back-ups. In the evening, the situation is
much worse, with long back-ups from Wolfe Grade eastward to the freeway.
On the east side of the Greenbrae interchange, traffic also backs up through
the old railroad trestle from a combination of traffic from the Golden Gate
Transit Ferry Terminal, Larkspur Landing, and traffic heading from the
Richmond-San Rafael Bridge towards Route 101 southbound. Average daily
traffic volumes in 1988 on this road ranged from about 20,000 at the eastern
city limit to about 52,000 just east of Eliseo Drive.
In particular, the intersections of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard with La
Cuesta Drive and Eliseo Drive are either approaching or at capacity (LOS F
- see Figure 4-8). Other locations of concern are unsignalized intersections
where turning traffic from the minor street has difficulty finding a gap -
Larkspur Landing Circle (east), Andersen Drive, and El Portal.
Magnolia Avenue. Magnolia Avenue begins north of the City of Corte
Madera, at the intersection of Branch Avenue. South of this intersection, this
non-freeway north-south corridor parallels Route 101, taking the name Corte
Madera Avenue, Camino Alto, and Miller Avenue. For travelers to and from
Larkspur, the combination of Magnolia Avenue and Redwood Avenue/
Tamalpais Drive (in Corte Madera) provides convenient access to Route
101.
Northbound Magnolia Avenue first passes through the older Downtown area
where it is a two-lane, slow moving facility with many driveways and
intersections (most of which are stop-sign controlled) and on-street parking.
Intersections in this area are tightly spaced (sometimes less than 200 feet
apart), and left-turn pockets are not provided. There are also numerous
pedestrian crossings, especially in the Old Downtown. These conditions
combine to create congestion, where it is often difficult for pedestrians to
cross, and where turning vehicles cause long queues because they do not
have the protection of a turn lane. The Average Daily Traffic (ADT) on
Magnolia Avenue in the vicinity of King Street was about 12,000 in 1988, a
heavy volume for a constricted two-lane roadway.
North and west of Doherty Drive, Magnolia Avenue becomes more free-
flowing, with fewer intersections and driveways. Further along, Magnolia
Avenue runs through another commercial area, also with on-street parking,
although the roadway is somewhat wider than in the Downtown area, and
congestion is less. At the city limit, Magnolia Avenue becomes College
Avenue, where it passes the College of Marin to end at Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard. The ADT at this northern terminus was about 14,500 in 1988.
Only the Corte Madera Avenue/Redwood Avenue intersection (not in the
city or its Sphere of Influence) is rated in the unacceptable range (LOS F,
see Figure 4-8, page 63). However, traffic conditions through Downtown
Larkspur are cause for concern because of restricted room to maneuver,
sight-distance problems, and the pedestrian/auto interface. In response to
these problems and recent accidents, the City changed the traffic control at
the Magnolia Avenue/King Street intersection (adjacent to City Hall) to all-
way stop control. (Previously Magnolia Avenue traffic did not have to stop.)
This configuration tends to cause congestion at this location, with queues
sometimes extending to adjacent intersections. However, it is easier for
pedestrians to cross Magnolia Avenue. Many times each year, Magnolia
Avenue is gridlocked when traffic diverts from Highway 101 because of an
accident.
Doherty Drive. This corridor provides both local access for community
facilities (e.g., Piper Park, Redwood High School, Henry C. Hall School, the
Twin Cities Police Department) and several residential neighborhoods, and
also serves as a through facility between Larkspur and Highway 101. The
eastern portion of this through corridor passes through the neighboring city
of Corte Madera, via Lucky Drive, Fifer Avenue, and Nellen Avenue. The
ADT in the Larkspur portion of this corridor at Larkspur Plaza was about
8,800 in 1988.
At its western terminus, Doherty Drive is a wide, two-lane facility, with
pedestrian crossings near the Hall School (at Larkspur Plaza Drive, and at
Larkspur Boardwalk). Further east is another pedestrian crossing at Riviera
Circle, serving the high school. This intersection also has four-way stop
signs to provide the necessary control for pedestrians to cross safely. Just
east of Riviera Circle is the Corte Madera city limit beyond which travelers
to the freeway must turn left onto Lucky Drive. An additional turn onto Fifer
Avenue is required for freeway traffic. There, southbound traffic can enter
the freeway ramp directly, while northbound traffic must use Nellen Avenue
to circle under the freeway to Redwood Highway, where the Industrial Way
ramp is used.
Traffic generally flows reasonably well along this corridor, despite the twists
and turns and stop sign controls. The heaviest flow occurs between 7:30 and
8:00 AM and between 3:00 and 3:30 PM, related to the start and end of the
school day. Two intersections operate at LOS F, Fifer Avenue at Nellen
Avenue (in Corte Madera), and Industrial Way at Redwood Highway (at the
northbound freeway ramps). Both of these intersections are unsignalized.
Wolfe Grade. Wolfe Grade is a two-lane, undivided, winding, hilly road that
connects Sir Francis Drake Boulevard to downtown San Rafael at D Street.
It had a 1988 ADT of 13,700, and is often used, in conjunction with Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard, to bypass Highway 101 when the freeway is
congested.
Bon Air Road. Bon Air Road is a two-lane divided roadway where it passes
Marin General Hospital. Just north of the hospital, it becomes a four-lane
divided road. It serves mainly to connect Sir Francis Drake Boulevard with
Magnolia Avenue, and provides access to Marin General Hospital and the
residential neighborhood on Bon Air Hill.
Madrone Avenue. This road is narrow and winding, and serves many homes
west of Magnolia Avenue. Portions of the road are paved around old
redwood trees.
Redwood Highway. This road parallels Highway 101 on the east side,
serving as part of the Doherty/Lucky/Fifer/Nellen/Redwood freeway access.
It also serves the industrial land use, trailer park, and Greenbrae Boardwalk,
east of Highway 101.
Traffic Accident Patterns
A summary of accident frequency for the five year period between 1984 and
1988 was obtained from the Twin Cities Police Department. Figure 4-9
shows the total number of traffic accidents reported at locations on the
primary street system where generally more than one accident occurred per
year. Locations in bold are those that exceed the average number of
accidents at all locations.
While this is not a definitive accident study, it does indicate the relative level
of accidents at key locations in the city. The highest number of accidents
over the five-year period occurred at the intersection of Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard with the Route 101 northbound ramps (78 accidents, compared to
an average of 22 per intersection). At this intersection, the high traffic
volumes, combined with confusing geometrics and narrow channels under
the railroad trestle, create hazardous conditions.

Note: Boldface indicates where number of accidents exceed the average.
The second highest accident location was Larkspur Landing Circle (east) at
Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. A traffic signal has since been approved for
this location, with installation scheduled for January 1991.
Other locations where the accident frequency was above the city average are
clustered on Magnolia Avenue, in the Downtown area, and near Bon Air
Drive.
Projected Future Conditions
In the 1970s and 1980s, a number of traffic studies, which were made for
individual development projects, provided forecasts of future traffic on
portions of the Larkspur street system. The most recent comprehensive study
prior to this General Plan was undertaken in 1988 by Robert L. Harrison, in
support of the City's Traffic Impact Fee Ordinance. His report combined
estimates of growth in Larkspur and surrounding communities with regional
estimates of travel growth through the year 2005 in order to forecast traffic
volumes and the resultant service levels in Larkspur. The report also
recommended a mitigation program which was adopted by the City Council
and used as the basis for a Traffic Impact Fee (TIF) for new development.
The results of the Harrison study were summarized in the background
document, Larkspur General Plan Circulation Report, which is part of the
General Plan Technical Appendix. This information, together with
discussions at several citizens' committee meetings, was used to develop the
Goals, Policies, and Programs of the Circulation and Land Use chapters.
State law requires that the Circulation and Land Use elements be internally
consistent. This was in part accomplished in Larkspur by coordination
between the Land Use and Circulation sub-committees during the plan
development process. The implications of the land use plan were then
evaluated using a local area traffic model for the City of Larkspur and its
environs.
Model Method and Assumptions
A traffic impact model was developed by DKS Associates to help quantify
the effect that future development, allowed by this General Plan, would have
on the road system in Larkspur. A traffic impact model is based on the
assumption that traffic generated by new development will simply be added
to existing travel patterns and volumes. In this process, no adjustments are
made to travel patterns and volumes to and from existing development. This
is a reasonable simplifying assumption to make in an area that is as close to
"build-out" as Larkspur is, especially considering that no new major
roadways are anticipated. The model uses TRACS( software to aid the
analyst in estimating the impacts of new development on traffic levels in
Larkspur. The model's overall procedure was to:
        Evaluate traffic conditions from PM peak hour counts of turning
         movements at key intersections in the study area. For this study,
         1988 was considered "existing." Existing Levels of Service were then
         calculated.
        Estimate the location and description of potential future development
         based on the General Plan Land Use chapter. The peak hour trip
         generation that would result from these developments was estimated.
        Determine travel paths to and from these developments.
        Estimate distribution of these trips on the different paths based on
         previous studies in Larkspur (see Figure 4-10).
        Estimate through traffic (see Figure 4-11).
        Load added traffic to existing volumes and calculate service levels.

          Traffic Mitigation Fee Program,
          Final Project, November 1988
Note: Service Level is not shown for intersections operating at LOS C or
better.
Effect of Growth on Level of Service. To best illustrate the effect of growth
on traffic service levels in Larkspur, three future scenarios were evaluated:
       Existing plus Approved Projects.
       Build-out.
       Build-out with roadway improvements.
Note that the "Existing plus Approved Projects" scenario includes
anticipated growth in through traffic that does not originate or terminate in
Larkspur. It therefore represents what will happen if Larkspur halted all
growth not yet approved.
Figure 4-12 (table) and Figure 4-13 (map) show the anticipated Levels of
Service under each of these conditions.
       Sir Francis Drake Boulevard Corridor. The effect of future
        growth on traffic conditions in Larkspur will be most heavily felt in
        the Sir Francis Drake Boulevard corridor. All intersections from
        Andersen Drive to Bon Air Road (with the exception of the
        southbound Highway 101 ramps) would operate at either LOS E or F
        in the PM peak hour, even considering only the effects of currently
        approved development plus through traffic. When the higher level of
        traffic anticipated at build-out is considered, all of these intersections
        would be in the F category, except for Bon Air Road, which would
        have a V/C ratio of 0.99, putting it almost at capacity.
        In addition to the traffic service levels projected, further congestion

  can be expected on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard from three sources:
  (1) construction on I-80 in the East Bay; (2) completion of the I-580
  Freeway from I-80 to the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge; and (3) the
  opening of the Richmond Parkway from I-580 near the Richmond-
  San Rafael Bridge to I-80 at Hilltop. Nevertheless, East Sir Francis
  Drake can be made to operate at acceptable Levels of Service by:
 Signalizing the Andersen Drive intersection (in San Rafael).
 Signalizing the Larkspur Landing Circle (east) intersection.
 Widening Sir Francis Drake and making other intersection
  improvements at Larkspur Landing Circle (west) and the Highway
  101 northbound ramps.
  On the west side of Highway 101, however, only widening Sir
  Francis Drake Boulevard to three through-lanes in each direction
  would provide the capacity improvements needed to accommodate
  the anticipated traffic volumes. During the course of the citizens'
  committee meetings, there was a clear consensus that this was not an
  acceptable solution. The plan does not, therefore, include specific
  capacity improvements in this area, aside from provision of a traffic
  signal at El Portal, and minor approach widening at Eliseo Drive.
  Other potential improvements to Sir Francis Drake Boulevard that
  could have a beneficial effect on traffic congestion include increasing
  transit service in the corridor and providing shuttle service to the
  Larkspur Ferry terminal.
 Magnolia Avenue Corridor. Along the Magnolia corridor,
  conditions would not be as intense as along Drake, but there would
  still be locations with poor service levels. Most of the intersections in
  this corridor are stop-sign controlled. The one- and two-way stop-
  controlled intersections generally operate effectively, although there
  is some lack of available capacity for left turning traffic from the side
  streets onto Magnolia at most intersections, but especially at
  Madrone, Alexander, Wiltshire, and Redwood (in Corte Madera). An
  initial analysis shows that none of these would warrant a traffic
  signal, with the exception of Redwood. The worst condition is at
  Madrone, where poor sight distance exacerbates the capacity
  problem.
  Based on the changes to the Land Use map as initially proposed by
  the Draft General Plan, the intersections of Magnolia with King and
  with Skylark/ Dartmouth would operate at less than LOS C.
  However, the City Council has determined to keep the all-way stops
  to control the speed and flow of traffic on Magnolia Avenue, and to
  make it safer for pedestrians to cross.
  The intersection of Corte Madera Avenue with Redwood Avenue in
  Corte Madera appears to meet warrants for a traffic signal. Corte
  Madera, however, has consistently opposed new traffic signals.
 Doherty Drive Corridor. The Doherty Drive corridor covers

        intersections that are in both Larkspur and Corte Madera. The
        Riviera Circle intersection with Doherty Drive (an all-way stop)
        would experience capacity difficulties, but would not warrant a
        traffic signal.
        In Corte Madera, the intersection of Nellen Avenue with Fifer
        Avenue and the Highway 101 southbound ramps would become even
        worse than it already is. Corte Madera is considering realigning
        Nellen Avenue so that it intersects with Tamal Vista Boulevard, thus
        removing some of the traffic from the freeway ramps intersection.
        The result of this improvement would be LOS D at the new
        Nellen/Tamal Vista intersection, and LOS A/A at the Fifer/ Nellen
        intersection.
System-wide Considerations
The future roadway conditions discussed above are based on the assumption
that current travel patterns will remain relatively the same, and that there
would be no diversion of traffic away from congested corridors to less
congested ones. Thus, the conditions represent the demand for travel in the
different corridors. As a practical matter, it is not possible for an intersection
to accommodate more traffic than its capacity. As a result, the actual traffic
flow on Larkspur streets will be different from that described above. The
experience of traffic engineers in similar situations is that a combination of
three things will occur:
       The peak period will lengthen, because some of the traffic that had
        been accommodated in the peak hour will begin to travel at another
        time.
       Some trips will use modes other than automobile, or will not be made
        at all.
       Some trips will be diverted to less congested routes.
This may be a policy by default, but lacking major improvements to the
system, the critical intersections in the west Drake corridor will operate at
capacity during the evening peak hours. Some traffic will be accommodated
as in the first two bullets above, but some will be diverted to less congested
routes, such as the Magnolia and Doherty corridors. It is also possible that
some traffic will divert into San Rafael, along Second and Third Streets, and
Red Hill Avenue. The result will be that an equilibrium will be reached,
whereby all routes have approximately similar travel times, and have one or
more sections that are at or approaching capacity.
Ride-sharing
Ride-sharing can take the form of an informal arrangement among co-
workers who live and work close to each other, or can be arranged through a
ride-sharing service. In Marin County, Rides for Bay Area Commuters uses
a computerized matching service to help people organize car or vanpools. It
will also assist with the lease of vans.
Parking
Larkspur, with its mix of older activity centers such as the Downtown, and

newer, more auto-influenced areas such as Bon Air Shopping Center,
Drake's Landing, and Larkspur Landing, has a variety of parking needs.
Parking issues are discussed separately for each of the following areas:
        Downtown.
        North Magnolia.
        New Developments.
        Residential Areas.
Downtown. Parking Downtown is provided in a number of ways. The most
obvious is the extensive on-street parking on Magnolia Avenue, which is
signed as restricted to two hours duration between 7:00 AM and 6:00 PM.
Additional on-street parking on side streets such as Ward Street is restricted
to two hours. A City-owned parking lot has capacity for 27 cars - also
restricted to two hours. In addition, many of the buildings provide their own
off-street parking.
Overall, it appears that Downtown parking is generally adequate for current
uses, except in the case of special events. If, however, there is an
intensification of use, or if Downtown Larkspur becomes more attractive as
a place to shop, thus increasing the demand for parking, then parking supply
could become a constraining factor to economic revitalization.
North Magnolia. This area is home to businesses that cater primarily to
local needs (e.g., hardware, fruit/vegetable store, etc.). On-street parking is
available on the southwest side of the street. Many businesses have their
own parking facilities. Parking appears to be adequate in this portion of
Larkspur.
New Developments. All new developments in Larkspur are required to
provide off-street parking. There generally is adequate parking in these
areas.
Residential Areas. Issues related to parking in existing residential areas are
discussed on pages 83-84 under Policy "i."
Future Issues. In general, as long as new development provides adequate
parking, there should be no reason for concern about parking in Larkspur.
TRANSIT
Although travel in and through Larkspur is primarily oriented to the private
automobile, several transit operators provide important services for those
who cannot or prefer not to use cars. As noted earlier, over 16 percent of
Larkspur residents use transit to get to work. These include: local bus
service, commuter and basic bus service, ferry feeder and ferry service, para-
transit, airport feeder service, and taxi service. There are also limited park-
and-ride facilities in Larkspur.
Local Bus Service

Local bus service is provided by Marin Transit, which contracts with Golden
Gate Transit for fixed route service. The following local transit routes serve
Larkspur:
       Route 1. From Novato and San Rafael, service along Sir Francis
        Drake Boulevard in Larkspur, terminating at the College of Marin.
       Route 17. Supplemental local bus service on school days, in Corte
        Madera and Larkspur, serving Hall Middle and Redwood High
        schools.
       Route 21. Service from College of Marin to Mill Valley.
Until recently, Marin Transit also provided service commonly known as the
FAST route, serving Fairfax and San Anselmo. There had been discussions
about Larkspur tying into this system. However, lack of funding caused the
FAST route to be discontinued. Feasibility studies were underway in 1990
for expanding Marin Transit.
Commute and Basic Bus Service
Commute buses are operated by Golden Gate Transit, and provide service
from communities in Marin and Sonoma Counties to San Francisco. Several
routes serve Larkspur:
       Route 18. Commuter service from the College of Marin, along
        College and Magnolia Avenue, then to Highway 101 via Tamalpais
        Drive, and to San Francisco (Financial District, Civic Center, and
        Transbay Terminal).
       Route 20. From the Canal Street area of San Rafael, providing basic
        (local) service seven days per week, terminating in San Francisco
        (Civic Center and Transbay Terminal). There are several stops in
        Larkspur along Magnolia Avenue.
       Route 24. Originating in Inverness, with service along Sir Francis
        Drake Boulevard. Stops in the Larkspur area at the College of Marin,
        Eliseo Drive, and the Lucky Drive bus pad. In San Francisco, it stops
        in the Financial District and at the Transbay Terminal.
       Route 30. From Canal Street in San Rafael, along Andersen Drive,
        stopping at Larkspur Landing, with commute service to the Financial
        District in San Francisco.
There is the potential for service enhancement on Route 30, which serves
Larkspur Landing. This service expansion would be coordinated with
implementation of a park-and-ride facility at the Golden Gate Transit yard
on Andersen Drive. No additional service is anticipated in Larkspur west of
the freeway.
Ferry Feeder and Ferry Service
Golden Gate Transit runs ferry service from its terminal off East Sir Francis
Drake Boulevard to the Ferry Building in San Francisco. Access to the ferry
terminal is by private automobile, passenger drop-off, and bus feeder
service. Ten bus routes serve the ferry terminal, only two of which actually
serve Larkspur:

        Route 15. From the College of Marin to the Ferry Terminal via
         College Avenue, Magnolia Avenue, Tamalpais Drive, and Highway
         101.
        Route 19. From Fairfax to the Ferry Terminal along Sir Francis
         Drake Boulevard.
The ferry runs as frequently as every half hour in the morning and afternoon
peak hours on weekdays, at one-hour intervals during the rest of the day, and
every two hours on weekends.
Para-transit Service
Para-transit is a specialized service for people with special needs (e.g.,
elderly or handicapped), or in areas that are not efficiently served by fixed-
route transit. In Marin County, this service is provided through Marin
Transit, which currently contracts the service out to Whistlestop Wheels.
This dial-a-ride service operates seven days a week and evenings.
Airport Feeder Service
The Marin Airporter operates from the Larkspur Landing area to the San
Francisco International Airport. It runs every 30 minutes, from 5:00 AM to
10:00 PM. The Marin Airporter currently leases its terminal space from
Golden Gate Transit District (GGTD). It is possible that this space will be
used by GGTD for other purposes. The Citizens' Advisory Committee
recommended that the site be retained in public ownership to support the
proposed transit-way along the adjacent rail right-of-way. City policy is to
support retention of the present Airporter use on the present site. (See Land
Use Policy "u" on page 37.)
Taxi Service
Taxi service in Larkspur is provided by two local companies, Larkspur
Yellow Cab and Larkspur Taxi. In addition, two companies from nearby
cities also serve Larkspur: Radio Cab and Bel Air Cab Service.
Park-and-Ride
Park-and-ride facilities in Larkspur are limited. Some spaces for ride-sharers
are provided at the western edge of the Bon Air Shopping Center. Golden
Gate Transit is considering opening a park-and-ride facility at its yard on
Andersen Drive in San Rafael, after which Route 30 bus service to San
Francisco would be expanded.
REGIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
As noted several times in the discussion above, the geographic location of
Larkspur results in a high volume of through traffic, i.e., traffic that does not
begin or end in the city. As a result, actions in other communities, both from
a development as well as an infrastructure perspective, can have a significant
effect on travel in Larkspur.
The following is a summary of regional circulation issues that could affect

Larkspur:
      Marin County General Plan. In 1989, Marin County was in the
       process of updating its general plan. Along with this, a countywide
       traffic model was being developed. Policies in this plan could have
       an effect on circulation patterns in Larkspur.
      Sir Francis Drake Signal Interconnection. The County has
       connected the traffic signals on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard between
       College Avenue and Highway 101. This allows for better progression
       of traffic along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, and a small increase in
       capacity.
      Use of the NWP Railroad Right-of-Way East of Highway 101. The
       Marin Transportation Authority has been analyzing options for use of
       this corridor for transit. How transit enters Larkspur and interacts
       with the ferry terminal will have important implications for traffic
       patterns.
      Highway 101 Interchanges. In 1989, Caltrans prepared project study
       reports (PSRs) for improvements to the Greenbrae and Lucky Drive
       interchanges. Proposals include closing off the existing Lucky
       Drive/Industrial Way interchange and rebuilding it as a standard
       diamond interchange at the point where Nellen Avenue passes under
       the freeway. The result of the study was that these changes will not
       be made until improvements are made to the main lanes of Highway
       101.
      Cal Park Hill Auxiliary Lane. Caltrans plans to construct a
       northbound auxiliary lane from the Greenbrae interchange to the
       Bellam Boulevard interchange. This project is in the 1988 State
       Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), and is programmed for
       funding in 1992/93.
      Highway 101 High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes. Caltrans has
       a continuing project to construct HOV lanes on Highway 101 in
       order to complete the system from Novato to the Golden Gate
       Bridge. Lanes are currently in place south of Sir Francis Drake. The
       Regional Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP) lists
       completion of HOV lanes from I-580 to Sir Francis Drake. No
       funding source has been identified for this project.
      Local Growth. Residential and employment growth in Corte Madera,
       Ross, San Anselmo, Fairfax, San Rafael, and other areas will impact
       transportation in Larkspur. Larkspur needs to maintain liaison and
       coordinate with these communities on matters of growth and
       infrastructure improvements.
CIRCULATION GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
This section, combined with the Land Use and Circulation map, contains
Larkspur's Circulation Goals, Policies, and Programs.
The circulation plan for the City of Larkspur is based on goals and policies
to provide safe and efficient transportation facilities that operate at
acceptable Levels of Service, while not degrading the quality of life in

the community. To develop a consistent, implementable set of Goals,
Policies, and Programs for Larkspur, the following factors were considered:
       Traffic conditions can be expected to degrade to unacceptable levels
        even if no additional development occurs in Larkspur beyond that
        already approved. Potential future development will, however,
        contribute to additional worsening of traffic conditions.
       The key bottleneck to travel through Larkspur is Sir Francis Drake
        Boulevard. This bottleneck could be relieved by providing an
        additional through-lane in each direction from Bon Air Road to
        Highway 101. Even this measure might not be sufficient to relieve
        congestion in the corridor, since Sir Francis Drake Boulevard is
        unlikely to be widened to more than two lanes west of College
        Avenue through Ross. The County project coordinating signals in
        this corridor provides some benefit for through traffic, but will not
        significantly affect the Level of Service.
       All-way stop control at several intersections on Magnolia Avenue
        tends to create bottlenecks to through-traffic, even under existing
        conditions. The bottlenecks will become much worse in the future.
       There was consensus in the Citizens' Advisory Committee that Sir
        Francis Drake not be widened, and that Magnolia be de-emphasized
        as a through-route and emphasized as access to Downtown.
       In 1989, Caltrans prepared plans to add a northbound auxiliary lane
        from the northbound on-ramp at Sir Francis Drake, over Cal Park
        Hill to the Bellam Boulevard ramp in San Rafael. This will
        encourage through traffic to stay on Highway 101, rather than using
        Drake as a through-route.
       Caltrans has not been able to find an acceptable solution to the
        Greenbrae/ Nellen/Lucky interchange configuration. Corte Madera
        appears to be seriously pursuing the realignment of Nellen Avenue to
        connect directly with Tamal Vista Boulevard. This will have the
        effect of partially relieving safety and congestion problems at the
        intersection of the southbound Highway 101 ramps with Nellen
        Boulevard and Fifer Avenue.
       It is likely that some form of transit-way will eventually be built
        along the NWP right-of-way parallel to Highway 101, providing
        service between Marin and Sonoma counties, and terminating near
        the Larkspur Ferry terminal. While this transit-way should provide
        benefits for regional travel, it has the potential to increase local
        traffic congestion.
Probably not all of the above factors will be realized. The Larkspur
Circulation Plan seeks to make the most of existing conditions, anticipated
changes beyond the direct control of the City, and changes recommended in
other chapters of the General Plan.
Quality of Life
Goal 1: Regard quality of life in Larkspur as more important than
mobility of traffic.

Goal 2: Provide safe and efficient local-serving transportation facilities
and services for the movement of people and goods.
Goal 3: Ameliorate the impact of traffic on Larkspur's quality of life.
Goal 4: Improved local or regional transit service should not
negatively affect Larkspur.
The circulation system in Larkspur needs to grow and change with the
community. Transportation facilities and services need to respond to
changes in the community so long as the circulation changes do not
adversely affect the quality of life in the city. In other words, while almost
any traffic problem can be solved, some solutions can create conditions
detrimental to other important aspects of the quality of life. Therefore, it is
important to emphasize that the City's priorities lean toward quality of life
where implementation of transportation facilities and services is concerned.
It also will be important to make the circulation system as useful and safe as
possible, and to have a coordinated program of implementing improvements.
Policy a: Develop a coordinated system of roads, bike paths, foot paths,
public transit, and Transportation Demand Management (TDM) programs.
Policy b: Remove hazards from the traffic system.
Policy c: Except for singly-developed single-family homes and vacant
properties, proposed changes in existing use shall not add traffic to Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard.
Policy d: Wherever possible, maintain standards for acceptable traffic
Levels of Service during peak periods. Acceptable Level of Service (LOS)
shall be defined for signalized intersections at the D level using planning
procedures defined in Transportation Research Circular 212 or successor.
The City acknowledges that LOS E exists at the following intersections and
that most measures which would alleviate traffic congestion there would not
be desirable:
       Sir Francis Drake Boulevard at Eliseo Drive;
       Sir Francis Drake Boulevard at La Cuesta Drive; and
       Sir Francis Drake Boulevard at Bon Air Road.
For unsignalized intersections, service level C shall be the lowest level
acceptable during peak periods. Because poor service levels at unsignalized
intersections do not represent the same level of delay to motorists as at
signalized intersections, the City should develop specific requirements on a
case-by-case basis.
Policy e: Conform to standard traffic engineering practices where practical.
Policy f: Encourage through traffic to use designated major arterials.

Policy g: Do not permit thoroughfares to divide the city.
Policy h: Design circulation facilities that minimize disruption of
neighborhoods and communities.
Policy i: Prevent an increase in the number of cars parked on neighborhood
streets.
Cars parked on narrow, winding, hillside roads block views of pedestrians
and oncoming cars and impede access for fire trucks. Excessive on-street
parking also creates an appearance of overcrowded neighborhoods. Larkspur
requires that each single-family house provide two permanent off-street
parking spaces for residents and two parking spaces for guests. Under
standards established by ordinance, guest parking may be provided on the
street if the street is wide enough. These parking requirements only apply to
new houses or lots where a second unit is being added. In older
neighborhoods, many houses do not meet these requirements.
Policy j: Prepare a program of traffic capacity improvements to ease traffic
congestion.
Policy k: Give higher priority to preserving the existing configuration of
streets and buildings downtown than to moving traffic through downtown.
Policy l: Do not permit heliports in the Larkspur Planning Area.
Policy m: Sir Francis Drake Boulevard shall not be widened to allow
additional through-traffic lanes.
Policy n: Do not make capacity improvements to Magnolia Avenue that
would encourage additional through traffic.
Action Program [1]: Perform an annual review of the circulation plan with
respect to changing conditions. Prepare a priority list of capital
improvements, maintenance, and programs.
Action Program [2] Actively cooperate with the County of Marin to seek
workable capacity improvements to Sir Francis Drake Boulevard that are
not disruptive to the community.
Action Program [3]: Maintain and improve the existing median strip
landscaping on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.
Action Program [4]: Add, maintain, and improve landscaping on
thoroughfares to the maximum extent possible.
An example is Tamalpais Drive in Corte Madera.
Action Program [5]: Perform the following specific capacity and safety
related improvements:
        Signalize the intersection of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard with
         Larkspur Landing Circle (east).

       Remove the railroad trestle from the roadway of Sir Francis Drake
        Boulevard, east of Highway 101.
       Make capacity enhancing improvements on East Sir Francis Drake
        between Larkspur Landing Circle (west) and Highway 101, as
        follows:
            o on the northbound approach on Larkspur Landing Circle
                (west), add a left turn lane, and re-stripe the existing
                through/left lane as an exclusive through-lane.
            o on the eastbound approach to Larkspur Landing Circle (west),
                add a second left-turn lane.
            o extend the southbound-to-westbound merge lane at Larkspur
                Landing Circle (west) to the Highway 101 northbound ramps
                intersection, and create a third westbound through-lane at that
                intersection, with an exclusive right-turn lane.
            o add an eastbound through-lane at the Highway 101
                northbound ramps intersection.
       Add a southbound-to-eastbound left-turn lane on Eliseo Drive at the
        intersection with Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.
       Signalize the intersection of Redwood Highway and Industrial Way,
        and add a northbound left-turn lane.
       Signalize the intersection of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard with El
        Portal.
Transportation Alternatives
Goal 5: Encourage attractive alternatives to the use of single-occupant
automobiles.
Goal 6: Increase transit service in Larkspur.
Goal 7: Aim for lower levels of peak hour automobile traffic.
Goal 8: Keep airport transit service for Larkspur.
Goal 9: Reduce transportation-related sources of air pollution.
Larkspur probably has the most complete transit coverage of any city in
Marin County, including local transit, commuter bus lines, and ferry service.
As Larkspur and the surrounding communities grow, the use of transit will
need to play an even larger role. How to increase transit use is a bigger
problem than Larkspur alone can solve. Marin and Sonoma Counties are
addressing future problems through the Highway 101 Task Force. One of the
main directions of this task force is to find a reasonable transit use for the
NWP railroad right-of-way. Although no formal commitments have been
made, it appears that some future use of this right-of-way for a rail system is
possible, with a connection to the Larkspur Ferry Terminal likely.
Discussions have also started again regarding extending BART, or BART-
type service to Marin County.
>From Larkspur's perspective, it will be important to develop and implement

policies to encourage additional transit for its own citizens. It will also be
important to continue to work with other agencies to come up with a
regional transit option that serves Larkspur, but does not adversely affect it.
Policy o: Coordinate circulation and development so higher intensity uses
such as commerce, professional offices, public services, and higher density
residences are near major transit routes and are served by public transit
facilities.
Policy p: Encourage increased transit ridership and use of Transportation
Demand Management (TDM) techniques.
Policy q: Tailor public and private transit to the needs of older people.
Policy r: Encourage all employers to cooperate in reducing peak hour
automobile traffic.
Policy s: Encourage continuation of the Larkspur Ferry terminal site as a
transit hub if the Golden Gate Ferry should cease operation.
Policy t: Require adequate park-and-ride facilities.
Policy u: Work with transit operators to provide service in Larkspur and to
resolve any parking difficulties through designation of parking facilities
controls as needed.
Policy v: The following are the City's policies regarding future regional
transit service in the Highway 101 Corridor:
                Minimize the impact on Larkspur and the existing road
                 system.
                Use discrete or separate rights-of-way.
                Support a direct rail connection from the north via a new
                 grade separation with Sir Francis Drake Boulevard along the
                 approximate alignment of the existing trestle.
                Encourage eventual expansion of the rail line to the south.
Action Program [6]: Adopt a Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
ordinance that sets specific goals for reducing the demand for travel by
single-occupant private automobiles.
Action Program [7]: Cooperate with Golden Gate Transit, Marin Transit,
and private transit providers to periodically review, modify, and upgrade
transit service to best meet the needs of Larkspur residents, businesses, and
schools.
Action Program [8]: Cooperate with the transit agencies to provide
amenities at transit stops, such as benches, shelters, lights, maps, and
telephones.
Action Program [9]: Using a Transportation Demand Management

ordinance, encourage employers to allow flexible work hours and to help
employees create vanpools or carpools.
Action Program [10]: Cooperate with Caltrans, Marin County, and the
transit agencies to expand opportunities for park-and-ride and shared-ride
parking lots in or around Larkspur.
Action Program [11]: Promote an exclusive mass transit corridor along
the railroad right-of-way east of Highway 101.
Action Program [12]: Encourage shared-ride service to or from
transportation terminals, and consider an ordinance to allow jitney service.
Internal and External Circulation Linkages
Goal 10: Create better ties between Larkspur, neighboring
communities, and the region.
Corte Madera Creek is a natural boundary that separates the north and south
portions of Larkspur. There are only three ways to cross in and around
Larkspur: College Avenue, Bon Air Drive, and U.S. 101. It is important that
Larkspur cooperate with its neighbors in planning new local circulation
routes.
Policy w: As improvement programs are developed for freeway
interchange redesign, take advantage of the improvements to provide links
between parts of Larkspur.
Policy x: Work with regional agencies to ensure that Larkspur's needs and
concerns are recognized.
Action Program [13]: Encourage and cooperate with the appropriate
jurisdictions to accomplish the following specific improvements:
        Signalize the Sir Francis Drake Boulevard/Andersen Drive
         intersection.
        Signalize the intersection of Redwood Avenue/Corte Madera
         Avenue.
        Realign Nellen Avenue to connect directly to Tamal Vista
         Boulevard. Close the existing connection from Nellen Avenue to
         Fifer Avenue.
Freeway Access
Goal 11: Obtain safe freeway access for Larkspur.
The freeway interchange system that serves Larkspur is confusing and
substandard. Caltrans has been studying improvements to both interchanges.
It is important that Larkspur stay abreast of these planning and engineering
efforts, and provide whatever input is necessary to improve this freeway.
Policy y: Redesign and rebuild both U.S. 101 interchanges (Sir Francis
Drake and Lucky Drive/Redwood Highway).
Action Program [14]: Actively cooperate with Caltrans, County of Marin,
City of Corte Madera, and City of San Rafael to find workable capacity and
safety improvements to the Greenbrae and Lucky Drive interchanges with

Highway 101.
Larkspur is strongly committed to seeing the interchanges improved.
Travel To and Between Retail Areas
Goal 12: Reduce the need for long distance and/or frequent shopping
travel by private automobile.
This goal is consistent with those in other sections of the Plan, such as
encouraging neighborhood-serving businesses and keeping the Downtown at
a scale that will encourage people to walk or bike to the shops. Most of the
policies and programs that would result in attaining this goal are in the Land
Use chapter.
Policy z: Encourage means of travel to and between retail areas other than
by private automobile.
Policy aa: Create stronger links between retail areas.
Policy ab: Reduce demand for parking at retail areas.
Action Program [15]: Explore the feasibility of providing a free shuttle
service on one or more routes connecting Downtown, North Magnolia, Bon
Air Shopping Center, Larkspur Landing, the Village in Corte Madera, and
the Corte Madera Town Center.
Downtown Circulation Goal 13: Enhance Downtown as a destination
rather than as a corridor. Magnolia Avenue currently serves the dual
purpose of "Main Street" of Larkspur, and a through-route for traffic
bypassing freeway congestion. Goal 13 is a land use goal that can be
partially brought about by circulation policies. Policy "f" would contribute to
attainment of this goal. In addition, the following policies and program
specifically address Downtown policies.
Policy ac: Maintain adequate off-street parking Downtown.
Policy ad: Explore the use of in lieu fees, assessment districts, and other
financing mechanisms to improve and increase the parking supply in
Downtown Larkspur.
Action Program [16]: Explore the feasibility of requiring developers of
Downtown property to provide off-site parking supplemented by shuttle bus
service to Downtown.
Safety
This section covers transportation safety in Larkspur. The need for safe
circulation must be recognized as a priority, even at the expense of traffic
efficiency.
Goal 14: Reduce the number and severity of transportation-related
accidents.
Goal 15: Provide good fire access and traffic safety in neighborhoods.
Policy ae: Place higher priority on safety as opposed to efficient traffic
flow and speed.
Policy af: Identify streets that create a problem for fire or traffic safety.
Action Program [17]: Install stop signs, pedestrian cross walks, and other
safety-related improvements as warranted.
Action Program [18]: Work with the County and State Prison to provide
safer access and related improvements to the section of East Sir Francis
Drake Boulevard frequented by persons engaged in surf-sailing. One or
more of the following actions should be considered: a small paved area for
short-term parking; prohibition of parking on the north side of Drake; and
longer term parking near the entrance to San Quentin Prison. (See also
Chapter 5, page 107, Policy "e" and Action Programs 7 and 8.)
Action Program [19]: Implement single-side-of-street parking regulations
(to include signing and enforcement) where needed.
Circulation and Environmental Protection
Goal 16: Circulation improvements should not adversely affect the
environment.
Policy ag: Ensure that transportation facilities do not impinge upon
irreplaceable resources (such as Corte Madera Creek, the Bay and its
shoreline, important open space lands, and recreational facilities).
Policy ah: Minimize air, water and noise pollution due to transportation.
Policy ai: Consider seismic and geotechnical factors in the planning,
location, design, and construction of new transportation facilities.
Policy aj: Seek public participation in the preparation and execution of
regional and local circulation plans.
Action Program [20]: Encourage removal of the NWPRR drawbridge over
Corte Madera Creek, and the bridge abutments.
To carry transit, the bridge would be replaced by a modern span designed to
preclude interference with water traffic, open space, and habitat.
Action Program [21]: Landscape new circulation facilities in harmony
with the environment and safety considerations.
Implementing Circulation Improvements
Goal 17: Mitigate the traffic impacts of new developments.
Policy ak: Development should contribute to measures to mitigate local and
regional traffic impacts.
Policy al: Developers should pay for improvements to the existing street
system to mitigate unacceptable impacts where such improvements are
appropriate.
Policy am: Improvements based on traffic mitigation are not to be
considered the only way to reduce traffic impacts.
Action Program [22]: Continue to collect a traffic impact fee from
developers to fund improvements.
Such improvements should include the traffic capacity measures described
in the General Plan.
Action Program [23]: Develop programs to take advantage of any sales tax
revenue for transportation improvements.
Action Program [24]: The City will use its traffic mitigation fees to carry
out projects as soon as sufficient funds are received.

              Chapter 5. Community Facilities and Services
 This chapter provides information about the level of public facilities and
 related services available in Larkspur now and in the future. "Public
 facilities" include parks, schools, and other public buildings. "Related
 services" are those that the facilities are designed to provide - recreation,
 education, child care, and general city government. An exception is fire and
 police services. These are covered in the Safety section of Chapter 7 while
 their facilities are covered here.
 PARKS AND RECREATION
 This section discusses Larkspur's urban parks and their use for active

recreation. It does not cover Larkspur's 300-plus acres of publicly-owned
open space, detailed discussion of which is reserved for Chapter 6,
Environmental Resources.
1972 Master Plan
Larkspur adopted a Park, Recreation, and Open Space Master Plan in 1972.
The Master Plan notes that a major consideration for park planning in
Larkspur is that most of its residential neighborhoods are in hillside areas.
The hilly terrain makes it very difficult, both economically and
environmentally, to provide parkland near to where people live. Because of
the topographical constraints, the Master Plan said that school sites must
serve as neighborhood parks and provide the large flat spaces needed for
group and team sports such as baseball, softball, basketball, and soccer.
Nevertheless, the Plan stated that individual lots should be acquired,
wherever possible, in hillside and other areas, to provide mini-parks within
walking distance of residents.
The City has carried out the policies in the Master Plan by acquiring seven
new parks since 1972. The City is also maximizing the use of school sites to
supplement City parks. Larkspur's parks are well distributed considering the
topography and opportunities for park acquisition and development.
Existing Parkland and Recreational Space
Larkspur has 51.3 acres of public parkland. This yields a public parkland-to-
population ratio of 4.5 acres per thousand (based on an estimated 1989
population of 11,300). This is approximately 175 percent of the 1972 ratio of
2.6 acres per thousand. The 51.3 acres include two new mini-parks (Niven
Park and Greenbrae School Park, each with 1.5 acres). It also includes the
open areas of the closed Larkspur-Corte Madera School site - which remain
in Larkspur School District ownership while used by the City. Not included
in the 51.3 acres is 17 acres of community fields on the Redwood High
School campus that are available to the public under certain conditions.
Additional recreational land accessible to the public can be found on school
property besides Redwood High School. Henry C. Hall Middle School in
Larkspur, and Bacich and Kent Schools in Kentfield, offer a variety of
recreation facilities.
Figure 5-1 lists the parks and their acreages as well as the acreage of schools
located in Larkspur.
Figure 5-2 shows the locations of those parks and schools.
The City of Larkspur offers a variety of recreation programs for all ages,
from preschool to senior citizens, through its Recreation Department. The
Department sponsors the Larkspur Larks, a senior citizen organization that
meets twice a month for speakers, entertainment, picnics, and field trips. The
Recreation Department also publishes a semi-annual newsletter describing
the programs it offers. Through it the City not only invites the public to get
involved in organizing and participating in recreational activities, but also
solicits their involvement in civic affairs.
In a unique public/private partnership, Larkspur offers a special opportunity
to learn and participate in rowing through the private Marin Rowing Club.
The City of Larkspur has entered into a Joint Powers Agreement with the
Club, enabling it to erect a club house and boat dock on City-owned
property behind the Drake's Landing Office Center. In exchange for use of
City-owned land, the Club will provide rowing lessons on Corte Madera
Creek through the Larkspur Recreation Department.

 SCHOOLS SERVING LARKSPUR
 Four public school districts serve Larkspur (College of Marin is described under
 "OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS," page 104). The Larkspur School District
provides primary education in the area generally south of Corte Madera
Creek. Primary students living north of the creek and in the Murray Park
neighborhood are in the Kentfield School District; students living north of
the creek and east of 101 (the San Quentin Peninsula including Larkspur
Landing) are served by the San Rafael City School District. Most
secondary students in Larkspur are in the Tamalpais Union High School
District, but those living on the San Quentin Peninsula are in the San
Rafael City School District. Figure 5-3 on page 98 shows the boundaries
of the elementary school districts serving Larkspur and its Sphere of
Influence.
Larkspur children in the Larkspur School District attend Neil Cummins
Elementary School (grades K-5) located in Corte Madera, and Henry C.
Hall Middle School (grades 6-8) on Doherty Drive next to Piper Park.
Larkspur children in the Kentfield School District attend Anthony Bacich
School (grades K-5) in Kentfield and Kent School (grades 6-8) near the
College of Marin. Larkspur children in the San Rafael School District
attend Bahia Vista Elementary School (grades K-5), Davidson Middle
School (grades 6-8), and San Rafael High School (grades 9-12).
Larkspur students in grades 9-12 attend Redwood or San Rafael high
schools or one of two alternative high schools operated by the Tamalpais
Union High School District on the Redwood High campus. The two
alternative high schools are San Andreas School, an opportunity school for
students who may benefit from a non-traditional high school; and Mewah
Mountain High School, a continuing education program for students who
have returned to school after taking time off. Students at San Andreas and
Mewah schools come from throughout the district.
There are two private schools in Larkspur for students in kindergarten
through eighth grade. Marin Primary had a 1988-89 enrollment of 93
(Statistical Bulletin No. 6, Marin County Office of Education, February 1, 1989.). St.
Patrick's School enrolled 267 students during the 1988-89 academic year
(ibid. There are no private high schools in Larkspur. However, Marin
Catholic High School - located just outside the Larkspur city limits on Bon
Air Drive at Sir Francis Drake Boulevard - had an enrollment of 800
students in 1988-89.

Enrollment Trends
The Larkspur School District and Tamalpais Union High School District
have both experienced significant decreases in enrollment. These changes
reflect both national trends and local conditions.
The U.S. Census Bureau reported in May 1989 that "in recent years total
births have begun to creep up again, largely because the 'Baby Boom'
generation is in its prime child-bearing years." ("Average Household Shrinking,"
Peninsula Times Tribune, May 5, 1989, page A-13.) While this   trend is somewhat
evident in Larkspur area schools, it was the new residential development that
was expected, until recently, to contribute most of the growth in the district.
However, the Marin Municipal Water District moratorium on future
connections to the water system will slow residential growth, at least until
new sources of water are found. (See Water Conservation and Water
Quality, page 120.) Against this backdrop of uncertainty regarding new
development, the following is a discussion of enrollment trends at the
schools attended by most Larkspur students.
Larkspur Area Enrollment
Enrollment at Redwood High School has declined dramatically since 1975
when the school had 2,629 students. The school is functioning at less than
half its 2,623 capacity, with 1,081 students enrolled in Fall 1989.
Consequently, the Tamalpais Union High School District offices, which are
on the same site, were relocated to a Redwood High School classroom
building during the summer of 1989.
Use of the former District office building for non-school purposes is
restricted to "conditional" uses allowed under the R-1 zoning classification.
Conditional uses allowed with a use permit are colleges and schools,
churches, community club houses, nursery schools, child care, public utility
or public service uses, rest homes, and homes for exceptional children. In
1989, the tenant was "New Perspectives," a public service organization
providing drug counseling services to youths (Communciation with Jan Vasquez,
Planning Department, City of Larkspur, August 11, 1989.).
According to school district projections, enrollment at Redwood and San
Rafael high schools will continue to decrease until 1991, and then will start
to increase. (See Figure 5-4 on the page 101.) Redwood High is projected to
have 200 more students (16 percent) in 1996 than in 1988 (Eight-year
Enrollment Projections, Tamalpais Union High School District, Fall 1987.). San Rafael
High is also expected to gain, but will still have 200 fewer students in 1994
than it did in 1984.
Enrollment at San Andreas High and Mewah Mountain High alternative
schools has also declined. San Andreas High enrolled 95 students in 1985,
and 76 in 1989. Enrollment at Mewah was 66 in 1989.
In the summer of 1989, voters in the Tamalpais Union High School District
approved a measure to impose a $98 special tax on property owners. The tax
will be levied annually over eight years to maintain and reinstate academic
and extra-curricular programs. Revenue from the special tax will also be
used to finance maintenance of school district facilities. The Redwood
campus is one of three in the district that will benefit from the special tax.
Because of (1) the special tax, (2) rising enrollments at area elementary
schools, and (3) the relocation of the District offices to Redwood High
School, District officials do not anticipate that a high school will have to be
closed in the foreseeable future.
Hall Middle School has experienced fewer dramatic drops in enrollment and
some upswings; nevertheless, a drop of 30 percent has occurred since 1982
when enrollment was 336 (Revised Chart B, Larkspur School District Enrollment
Projections, 1989). Projections for Hall show a decrease in enrollment in 1990
followed by modest increases in 1992 and 1993, to return to the 1988 level
(ibid). (See Figure 5-5 on the following page.)
Declining enrollment forced the Larkspur-Corte Madera School to close in
1979. The Larkspur School District uses some of the buildings for offices,
and the rest are leased to a private school (Marin Primary). Recently,
kindergarten enrollment in the Larkspur school district has rebounded.
Enrollment projections anticipated a continuing increase, but the moratorium
on water hook-ups will preclude the new housing development that would
have provided some school-age children.
Kentfield School District enrollment is increasing. Enrollment for the 1987-
88 school year was 671 (Kentfield School District Enrollment, 1988-89, February 3,
1989). The following year (1988-89) the District increased by 39 students,
and by 1989-90, had reached an enrollment of 803, a 20 percent increase
over 1987-88. The enrollment increase is concentrated in grades K-4,
reflecting population growth in the Kentfield/Greenbrae area.

   Revised Chart B, Larkspur School District Enrollment Projections, 1988.
Enrollment at Marin Primary and St. Patrick's in Larkspur has grown
progressively from 1979 through the 1987-88 academic year. Marin Primary
has more than tripled its 1979 enrollment, while St. Patrick's has grown by
23 percent over the period (Statistical Bulletin No. 6, Marin County Office of
Education, Febraury1 1989.). On the other hand, Marin Catholic High School's
enrollment has decreased since 1985. In 1984-85, Marin Catholic had 892
students (ibid). In 1989-90, enrollment was 730, an 18 percent drop from
1985.
CHILD CARE FACILITIES AND SERVICES
Many families with working parents rely on child care services within
Larkspur. Child care can be informal (a hired babysitter) or formal (a
licensed family day care provider or day care center). All ages, ranging from
infants through elementary school children, need child care. Working
parents need day care services for the entire day and throughout the year.
The City of Larkspur has operated a child care program for the Larkspur
School District for 15 years. The center is located at Neil Cummins School.
The City provides a portable classroom and the child care staff. A second
portable purchased in the summer of 1989 allows the child care program at
the school to serve 100 children.
Child care services offered at Neil Cummins School include a preschool
program (for ages 31/2 to 5) Monday-Friday until noon, with extended care
available until 2:30 PM. A before-and-after-school program is available for
children in grades K-5. User fees pay all costs associated with the service.
There are two private day care centers in Larkspur - the Children's Cottage
Co-op located in Neighborhood Park on Larkspur Landing Circle, and Marin
Primary at Larkspur-Corte Madera School - and three in Kentfield. In
addition, day care homes provide care for six or fewer children. Project Care
for Children, a countywide child care referral and advocacy agency in San
Rafael, provides referral services for Larkspur and other Marin County
cities.
LARKSPUR PUBLIC FACILITIES
Police
In 1980, Larkspur and Corte Madera merged police services into a
consolidated Twin Cities Police Department. The Department currently has
two offices: One is located in Larkspur on Doherty Drive next to Piper Park
(see Figure 5-2, page 97) and the other is in Corte Madera at Town Park on
Tamalpais Drive. The Larkspur office is used primarily for dispatch, patrol
operations, and executive offices. It contains the Emergency Operations
Center, which is activated during emergencies. The Corte Madera office is
mainly used for juvenile services and administration.
The separation of police administrative services into two locations creates
two problems. One concerns information storage and retrieval. Materials and
confidential documents must be transmitted by hand - which the police
consider to be costly and time-consuming - or via facsimile, which is
considered risky. The second problem concerns day-to-day personal
interaction: Decisions and events at one station sometimes occur without the
knowledge or input of personnel at the other station. The Department is
therefore considering a single, central location.
Fire
The Larkspur Fire Department provides fire and medical emergency service
to the City of Larkspur from two stations. Station #1 is next to City Hall, and
Station #2 is located just off Sir Francis Drake Boulevard in the Bon Air-
Drake's Landing area. The two stations are adequate to meet present and
future demand for fire and medical emergency services since the City is
substantially developed.
Fire Station #2 was demolished and replaced on the same site with a new
station in 1990. The new station is designed in two modular sections, one for
an engine room, the other for an office/living unit.
Fire Station #1 is scheduled to undergo extensive rehabilitation, including
structural repairs to bring the station up to seismic safety requirements, and
redesign to better accommodate its use as a fire station.
City Hall
City Hall is a Mission Revival style building completed in 1913. It houses
the City library and all City offices except that of the Fire Chief and the
Building Inspection Department, which are located next door in Fire Station
#1, and the Police Department (discussed earlier). Like Fire Station #1, it
also is undergoing rehabilitation. Corporation Yard
The City's corporation yard is located on a half-acre behind the police
building in Piper Park. Public Works repair and maintenance personnel are
headquartered at the yard, which has several buildings in which to store tools
and vehicles.
OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS
College of Marin
The College of Marin, Kentfield campus, is a community college located on
66 acres straddling the boundary between Larkspur and unincorporated
Kentfield. It was established in 1926 with 40 students when the Kent family
granted some of its farmland for a college. The Kentfield campus enrollment
is 6,500 students in the daytime and 8,500 at night. Some 275 faculty and
staff are employed there.
Construction of new buildings is unlikely. Enrollment swelled to 12,000-
14,000 students during the 1960s, overcrowding existing facilities and
requiring the erection of temporary facilities, most of which have since been
removed. Although the College has grown by 3-5 percent annually over the
past four years, officials anticipate that enrollment will level off, given
county population trends. Also, the College has renovated its permanent
buildings so that they may be used more efficiently. Offices previously
located in the temporary buildings have moved to the permanent space. Six
temporary structures have been removed, and the remaining four are
scheduled to be removed by 1991. College officials note that there is a
shortage of on-campus parking and that the grounds where the temporary
buildings were located are being used for parking.
The Larkspur portion of the campus is largely open space, consisting of
athletic playfields, marshland, and a former classroom. Under zoning
approved by the City of Larkspur in 1988, the College cannot use this 26-
acre portion of the campus for anything except educational and
environmental purposes (e.g., playfields and classrooms).
Marin General Hospital
Marin General Hospital is located just outside Larkspur's northwestern City
Limits on the southeast side of Bon Air Road. It is surrounded by Larkspur
on three sides. The 235-bed hospital is operated by the Marin Hospital
District which covers all of Marin County. The hospital opened in 1952 and
has just undergone a major modernization project to update surgery,
coronary and intensive care, and orthopedic nursing facilities. A new wing
was built, but no new beds were added. Road and parking improvements
were a part of the project. The hospital employs about 1,100 full- and part-
time employees (or 800-850 full-time equivalents).
San Quentin Prison
San Quentin Prison is a 432-acre facility east of Larkspur within the City's
Sphere of Influence. A large part of the prison property is open land, with
major facilities and parking located close to the San Francisco Bay
shoreline. The prison employs 1,300 people and has a payroll of $67 million
a year. It housed 3,900 inmates in 1989.
San Quentin underwent a $28 million renovation in 1989, in which it was
converted from a facility for maximum security prisoners to one for medium
security prisoners (prisoners entering the system for the first time and parole
violators). There are no plans for its closure. Indeed, as of 1990, although
there are no "final numbers," the State plans to expand the facility by at least
2,600 beds for the Department of Corrections, and another 300 beds for the
County. The expansion would be completed in 1993 (Communication with
Vernell Crittendon, Warden's Administrative Assistant, San Quentin Prison, October 4,
1990). The total number of inmates would be 6,800, a 175 percent increase
over present occupancy.
Post Office
The U.S. Post Office serving Larkspur is on Ward Street in downtown
Larkspur. The Post Office has operated from its present 1,900-square foot
building for 30 years. The building is owned by the owner of the Blue Rock
Inn, which - as of 1990 - was for sale. If the Blue Rock Inn is sold, the Post
Office expects to negotiate a new lease with the new owner, since the
facility is adequate to handle the retail traffic (Communication with Dan
Navarrette, Acting Director of Field Operations, North Bay Post Office. October 4, 1990).
The Larkspur Post Office serves primarily as a post office box station (with
640 box holders) and retail customer service facility, but there is no on-site
customer parking. The Larkspur Post Office has only a three-person staff,
but for a facility of its size does a lot of business - approximately $1,500,000
per year whereas $250,000 would be normal. That is because the facility is
centrally located, and other surrounding post offices (San Rafael, Kentfield,
Corte Madera, Mill Valley, and Sausalito) are equally busy or busier (ibid.).
Mail delivery to Larkspur residents living generally south of the creek is
from the Corte Madera Post Office, and delivery to residents living generally
north of the creek is from the San Rafael Post Office.
COMMUNITY FACILITIES & SERVICES GOALS, POLICIES, &
PROGRAMS
This section contains the Larkspur General Plan Goals, Policies, and
Programs pertaining to all public facilities and certain public services in
Larkspur and its Sphere of Influence.
Parks and Recreation
Goal 1: Provide park facilities and recreation programs for all age
groups.
Policy a: When appropriate, continue to acquire individual lots for mini-
parks.
Action Program [1]: Update the City's "Park, Recreation, and Open Space
Master Plan."
Action Program [2]: Identify potential park sites that could be acquired
either as a condition of development approval or as park development
opportunities that may someday arise.
Policy b: Continue to maintain Piper Park as a recreation area with a
balance of organized play facilities and natural areas.
Policy c: Seek to meet the park and recreation needs of children of all ages,
from toddlers to teenagers, in a variety of locations.
Action Program [3]: Provide "tot lots" with safe and imaginative play
equipment where space is available in City parks.
Action Program [4]: Explore providing a teen/preteen center.
Policy d: The City encourages programs and recreation facilities for
seniors.
Action Program [5]: Work with the Larkspur Larks, the Larkspur
Recreation Department, and Marin County Older Adult Services and similar
groups to identify the available programs and facilities for seniors, and look
for ways to augment them where appropriate.
Action Program [6]: Utilize seniors as community resources and maximize
use of their expertise, talents, and time for benefit of the community.
Policy e: Work with the County and the State to limit the development of
Remillard Park and to enhance the safety of windsurfers, boaters, and other
users of the beach between Remillard Park and San Quentin Prison.
Action Program [7]: Work with the Golden Gate Transit District and other
responsible jurisdictions to delineate travel lanes for ferries and safe areas
for windsurfers. (Cf. EIR, page F-62.)
Action Program [8]: Provide restrooms for windsurfers, boaters, and other
users of the beach between Remillard Park and San Quentin Prison.
At present, the strip of beach between Remillard Park and San Quentin
Prison is heavily used by windsurfers. Upwards of 60 cars may be parked on
the shoulders on both sides of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard at peak times.
While developing this site as a public facility would be desirable, there are
inherent problems. One is the difficulty of providing safe, off-road parking.
The second is that the windsurfers sail in the same area as the Golden Gate
ferries that ply to and from the Larkspur Ferry Terminal. This conflict could
worsen if newer, high-speed catamarans replace the ferries currently in use.
The dilemma is whether to improve the currently unsafe conditions on land
(which may lead to an increase in water sport activity and a consequent
increase in danger on the water) or to leave the land conditions as they are.
Policy f: Cooperate with neighboring communities, public agencies, and
school districts to provide recreational facilities and programs to Larkspur
residents.
If San Quentin Prison ever closes, its Bay frontage should remain in open
space and parkland.
Policy g: Work with the school districts in Larkspur to expand community
use of their facilities during non-school hours.
Action Program [9]: Establish liaison between senior citizens and the
schools to provide access to buildings for senior citizen educational
opportunities.
Action Program [10]: Look into joint powers agreements that enable the
City to make public use of school sites in return for the City maintaining
them.
Action Program [11]: Work with school districts to see that school playing
fields, gymnasiums, meeting halls, and auditoriums are retained for public
use even though school buildings may be leased for other than public school
purposes.
Action Programs 9, 10, and 11 will promote the use of school facilities for
park and recreation purposes and maintain them in public ownership. Their
focus is on property that remains in District ownership but may be either
used or leased out by a school district for non-school but public recreational
and cultural purposes. The net result of these Action Programs is to benefit
both the City (by providing community facilities) and the school districts (by
providing them with lease revenues or City maintenance services). See also
Policies "h" through "l" and Action Programs 12 and 13 below.
Schools
Goal 2: Preserve all existing school sites for future public use, with
school use having the highest priority.
Policy h: Encourage school districts not to sell school sites, but to preserve
them for community and future school use.
Policy i: Look for ways to ease the financial burden on the school districts
so that school sites can be retained in public ownership.
Action Program [12]: Work with the school districts to examine
alternatives to school closure and sale early in the process of responding to
declining school enrollments.
Policy j: When school districts apply for interim reuse of surplus facilities,
the City encourages that school playing fields, gymnasiums, meeting halls,
and auditoriums be retained for public use.
In summary, Goal 2 and its policies and action programs will allow non-
school uses in some or all of the school buildings - uses that would be
compatible with the neighboring areas - in exchange for (1) retention of the
school sites in District ownership, and (2) use of the schools' cultural and
recreational facilities by the public.
Goal 3: Achieve greater cooperation between the City and the school
districts in sharing resources.
Policy k: Encourage school boards to work with Larkspur and recreation
departments of other cities to expand community use of school facilities
(pools, gyms) during non-school hours.
Policy l: Encourage school districts to make use of public safety and other
City staff members to teach students about fire prevention, CPR, drug abuse,
bicycle safety, and other subjects.
Action Program [13]: Identify City staff, facilities, and programs that can
be shared with the school districts for educational purposes.
For example, the City Library is used by students from St. Patrick's School
and could be used by students from other schools, if appropriate.
Child Care
Goal 4: Ensure that quality child care is available to Larkspur
children.
Policy m: Cooperate with the Larkspur School District in operating a child
care program.
Policy n: The City encourages continued operation of a child care center
serving up to 100 children at Neil Cummins School or any other suitable
site.
Public Facilities
Goal 5: Provide for a higher level of public use (cultural and
recreational activities, community meetings) of public buildings and
lands.
Policy o: Consolidate like functions (for example, corporation yards) of
several public agencies on one site.
This would make some existing corporation yards available for sale or other
public use.
Action Program [14]: Investigate the feasibility of consolidating
Larkspur's corporation yard with that of another public agency, and moving
it from Piper Park.
Action Program [15]: When designing new public buildings, accommodate
multiple uses (for example, a youth/senior center in a new community
building). Cf. Action Program 4, page 106.
Goal 6: Renovate and modify public buildings to meet future demands.
Policy p: Renovate public buildings to conform to seismic safety
requirements, space needs, and use of new technology, while respecting
historic values.
Action Program [16]: Rehabilitate City Hall and Fire Station #1 in
accordance with structural and design studies.
In 1990 City Hall was 76 years old and Fire Station #1 was 52 years old.
Both are in need of structural and other improvements, and engineering
studies have been completed. Architectural plans have been prepared for
remodeling the fire station, and a space study of City Hall was being
contemplated in 1990.
Action Program [17]: Explore the relocation of Fire Station #1 to allow
potential future expansion of city services such as planning, library,
recreation, etc., in the existing historic building.
Policy q: Coordinate with the Town of Corte Madera to consolidate the two
existing police stations of the Twin Cities Police Department at one location.
Action Program [18]: Survey potential sites, and study the financing and
timing for development of a single police station.
Action Program [19]: Consider moving the current police facility to a
location other than Piper Park

               Chapter 7. Community Health and Safety
This chapter covers safety, as prescribed by Safety Element provisions of the
Government Code, Section 65302(g); and noise, as covered by Noise
Element guidelines of the Government Code, Section 65302(f). It also
includes air quality. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District
(BAAQMD) has strongly urged cities to address air quality in their general
plans.
Community health and safety involves the protection of the community from
natural hazards such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, and fires. It also

involves protection from man-made hazards such as air pollution, noise, and
hazardous materials. This chapter describes the scope of these hazards, as
well as the actions that the City can take to eliminate or reduce the
probability of these hazards leading to a major disaster. The overall purpose
of this chapter is to--
  Protect the community from injury, loss of life, and property damage
        resulting from natural disasters and hazardous conditions.
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
In the event that a disaster does occur, Larkspur must be prepared to
respond. Quick action can reduce injuries and damage. Larkspur has an
Emergency Plan for natural disasters, technological incidents (such as
hazardous materials accidents), and nuclear defense operations. The Plan
establishes an emergency management organization with the City Manager
as the Director of Emergency Services and the department heads as the
Emergency Management staff. Each department head has a specific
assignment in a major emergency. Depending on the magnitude and type of
disaster, the City may have to work closely with other levels of government.
These relationships are also spelled out in the Plan.
The Plan describes how various disasters might affect Larkspur. It defines
scenarios for responding to a major earthquake, a major transportation
accident (airplane crash or highway accident involving multiple casualties),
wildland fire, flood, landslides, and hazardous materials incident. Although
the effects of these disasters may vary, the emergency responses would be
similar in many cases.
Preparedness Goals, Policies, and Programs
Goal 1: Increase public awareness of flooding, seismic, landslide, fire,
and other natural hazards, and of methods to avoid or mitigate the
effects of these hazards.
Goal 2: Prepare to make a planned, coordinated response to a disaster.
Policy a: Maintain an updated emergency response plan.
Policy b: Identify essential emergency facilities and make provisions to
ensure that they will function in the event of a disaster.
Policy c: Strive to educate the community about environmental hazards,
measures which can be taken to protect lives and property, and methods for
responding to various disasters.
Policy d: Cooperate with other public agencies to store, organize,
distribute, and administer emergency medical equipment, supplies, services,
and communications systems.
Action Program [1]: Continue to update the City's emergency plan.
Action Program [2]: Identify specific facilities and lifelines critical to
effective disaster response, and evaluate their abilities to survive and
operate efficiently immediately after a major disaster.
Action Program [3]: Evaluate the structural integrity of the Bon Air
Bridge to withstand earthquakes, and assess the feasibility of increasing its
weight-carrying capacity.
Major transportation links (highways and bridges), gas, electric, and water
lines, ambulance and paramedic services, emergency broadcast services, and
power substations are critical. The bridges over Corte Madera Creek will be
critical to maintaining ties between north and south Larkspur.
Action Program [4]: Designate alternative facilities for post-disaster
assistance in the event that primary facilities become unusable.
Part of an emergency plan is identification of those facilities that will be
relied upon in the event of catastrophe. Critical facilities in (or near)
Larkspur are Marin General Hospital, the two fire stations, and the police
station which includes the Emergency Operations Center. Public facilities
such as schools and auditoriums may be designated as alternative facilities.
Action Program [5]: Correct known structural deficiencies.
Avoidance of hazards is another form of preparedness. By establishing and
enforcing appropriate land use, design, and construction standards, and
avoiding or minimizing development in areas having a history or threat of
natural hazards, Larkspur can reduce its losses.
Goal 3: Avoid development in areas prone to natural hazards.
Policy e: Allow land uses in areas prone to natural hazards only with
appropriate mitigation.
Action Program [6]: Continue to regulate development to assure the
adequate mitigation of safety hazards on sites having a history or threat of
slope instability, seismic activity (including liquefaction, subsidence, and
differential settlement), flooding, or fire.
Hazard mitigation measures, specific to the type of hazard, are discussed in
the following sections on flooding, seismic and geologic hazards, fire,
hazardous materials, air pollution, and noise.
FLOODING
Flood hazards fall into three categories: natural flooding, mud and debris
flows, and dam inundation. Larkspur has experienced natural flooding when
Corte Madera and Larkspur Creeks have overflowed during extreme rainfall.
Larkspur has also suffered major damage from mud and debris flows on
steep hillsides, particularly in recent years. The inability of the topography
and drainage system to handle torrential rains has exacerbated these flooding
problems (Flood Insurance Study for the City of Larkspur, Federal Emergency
Management Agency, 1983, page6). Larkspur is not likely to be affected by
flooding from dam failure. A new spillway and other remedial work have
reinforced the Phoenix Lake dam, the nearest dam upstream from Larkspur
(The dam was buttressed on the downstream side in 1970, to survive a "design earthquake."
In 1988, the spillway was built and lowered six feet. Any flood damage resulting from flood
inundatio would largely be confined to areas northwest of Larkspur-i.e., to the narow Ross
Valley down to and including the College of Marin and the College park subdivision (18
homes ). From there downstream, the canyon widens into a broad alluvial flood plain where
dam flood waterss would rapidly dissipate. Source: Dana Raxon, Marin Municipal Water
District, August 1989 and May 14, 1990).
Significant flood damage occurred in 1955, 1958, 1973, and 1982. The flood
of late December 1955 caused serious damage in the Heather Gardens
neighborhood where many families had to be evacuated by rowboat.
Torrential rainfall in April 1958, and two back-to-back storms in January
1973, also caused severe flooding in Larkspur.
The January 1982 storm was the worst in the state since 1955. In Marin
County, 12 inches of rain fell in 36 hours. Unlike the earlier floods in
Larkspur, the greatest loss of property was due to mudslides - or more
accurately, debris avalanches which start suddenly and move quickly. Four
homes, two in Madrone Canyon and two in the Murray Park area, were
destroyed, as well as eight apartments at Skylark. Public and private damage
was estimated at $3 million (Carolyn Campbell, Public Works Director, City of
Larkspur, 1989).
Larkspur consistently receives greater rainfall amounts than the majority of
Marin County because it is in the shadow of Mount Tamalpais. Kentfield,
which is upstream from Larkspur, has the highest average annual rainfall in
the Bay Area--52.5 inches. The lower areas of Larkspur receive about 38
inches a year. Also, the nature of the soil in Larkspur is such that very little
water percolates into the ground, and runoff is high (Storm Drain Master Drain
Study, City of Larkspur, May 1988).
Large areas of Larkspur south of Corte Madera Creek are within the 100-
year flood zone, meaning that there is a probability of their being flooded
once every 100 years (or a one percent chance of being flooded in any one
year). The boundaries of the 100-year flood zone are shown on Figure 7-1.
                                        Figure 7-1
                                 100-Year Flood Zone
                                      [to be inserted]
Most of the flood zone is so designated because of the potential for flooding
during a 100-year high tide, rather than from excessive rainfall.
Flood Control and Storm Drainage Improvements
In 1968, the Army Corps of Engineers began to dredge, straighten, and line
Corte Madera Creek with concrete. By 1972, the project had been completed
from the mouth of the creek to the Town of Ross, a distance of about 3.5
miles (Flood insurance Study). However, Ross opposes placing the creek in
a concrete channel, and work on the last phase, through the town, has been
stalled. Until the last phase has been completed, Larkspur will not be
adequately protected from freshwater flooding. Even then, the improvements
will not provide protection from tidal flooding.
The portion of Larkspur Creek (also known as Arroyo Holon) between
Monte Vista Avenue and about Meadowood Drive has been diverted to a
culvert. A 1989 study also recommended an earthen berm and a concrete
floodwall be constructed along a section of the creek near Meadowood
Drive.
In 1988, Larkspur undertook a Storm Drain Master Plan Study of the older
portion of Larkspur - the area south of Corte Madera Creek and west of
Highway 101. Historically, most of Larkspur's flooding has occurred in this
area. Also, certain areas adjacent to Corte Madera Creek have experienced
significant settlement over the years, exposing them to increased flooding
(Storm Drain Study).
Most of the storm drain system in the study area is 30 to 40 years old. The
system evolved piecemeal as it was gradually extended upstream to serve
new development and as problems occurred. A significant portion of the
system has settled and deteriorated, causing maintenance and flooding
problems. Also, because much of it is located on private property, the system
lacks adequate capacity to convey runoff.
The study recommended a series of improvements (trash racks, catch basins,
use of concrete pipe, and annual inspections of open channels on private
property) to reduce flooding problems. It also concluded that more pumping
stations will be needed to protect against high tides inundating low-lying
developed land.
Flooding problems east of Highway 101 and south of Corte Madera Creek
have been somewhat alleviated by the installation of a new storm drain
system and pump station. However, it is still necessary to sandbag the low-
lying area near the creek because of tidewater flooding. Flood walls and a
tide gate are needed to provide permanent protection.
Rise in Sea Level
Recent scientific studies indicate that sea level is rising at an accelerated
rate. A global climate change caused by the accumulation of "greenhouse"
gases in the atmosphere (carbon dioxide, methane, and chlorofluorocarbons)
is projected to raise the temperature of the earth's atmosphere, melting some
of the earth's glaciers and polar ice caps. If recent historic trends continue,
global sea level should increase between four and five inches in the Bay in
the next 50 years and could increase approximately one and one-half to five
feet by the year 2100.
Although the phenomenon is not fully understood, the rising sea level has
implications for Larkspur and other cities along San Francisco Bay. Tidal
circulation could change and wave action could increase. Drainage would be
impeded, and ground water could be contaminated. The Bay Conservation
and Development Commission, which regulates land use along the Bay,
recommends that local governments take the predicted rise into
consideration in land use planning and development review (Marin General
Plan, Environmental Hazards Element, Draft Technical Reposrt #1, Flood Hazards:
Existing Conditions and Recent Studies, Feb. 1988; and Amendment 3-88 to "San Francisco
Bay Plan," Bay Conservation and Development Commission).
Flood Hazard Goals, Policies, and Programs
Goal 4: Protect Larkspur from the risk of flood damage.
Policy f: Seek to have the Corte Madera Creek flood control improvements
completed upstream from Larkspur.
Action Program [7]: Work with the Marin County Flood Control District,
the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Town of Ross to develop and
implement an improvement plan that protects against flooding.
Policy g: Work with other cities in the Ross Valley to develop a
comprehensive master plan for flood control and management of Corte
Madera Creek.
The Kentfield/Greenbrae Community Plan recommends that the Corte
Madera Creek master plan consider flood heights under present and future
conditions and under various flood frequency intervals (10, 30, 50, and 100-
year floods). The influence of future urbanization and rising sea level should
be evaluated. The plan should also consider the possibility of retention
structures on parking lots, roofs, etc., curtailment of development, and
planting and maintenance of vegetation to enhance bank stability, aesthetic
values, and recreational opportunities.
Policy h: Regulate land uses in flood-prone areas and allow development in
those areas only with appropriate mitigation.
This policy, in meeting the general goal of protecting Larkspur from flood
damage, has two specific objectives: one is to protect property; the other is
to maintain an adequate cross-section for the discharge of flood waters.
A map of possible inundation resulting from a failure of the dam at Phoenix
Lake has been prepared by the Marin Municipal Water District (MMWD).
(The dam was buttressed on the downstream side in 1970, to survive a "design earthquake."
In 1988, the spillway was built and lowered six feet. Any flood damage resulting from flood
inundatio would largely be confined to areas northwest of Larkspur-i.e., to the narow Ross
Valley down to and including the College of Marin and the College park subdivision (18
homes). From there downstream, the canyon widens into a broad alluvial flood plain where
dam flood waterss would rapidly dissipate. Source: Dana Raxon, Marin Municipal Water
District, August 1989 and May 14, 1990).The map is available to the public at the
City Planning and Public Works departments and the MMWD offices.
Action Program [8]: Establish standards for minimum grades and
minimum finished floor elevations that take into consideration the rising sea
level during the expected life of the project.
Based on historic trends, the 100-year maximum high tide is projected to
reach an elevation of 6.4 feet NGVD (National Geodetic Vertical Datum)
along Corte Madera Creek, but other factors (wave runup, siltation, and the
predicted rise in sea level) can be expected to raise it higher. Because of
these factors, Larkspur has raised its minimum standard for finished floor
elevations from 8 to 9.4 feet.
Policy i: Continue to upgrade the City's drainage system.
Action Program [9]: Implement the recommendations of the 1988 Storm
Drain Master Plan study.
Action Program [10]: Construct flood walls and a tide gate in the area east
of Highway 101.
Action Program [11]: Balance required protection measures with the need
to protect environmental resources, and do so in such a way as to integrate
design improvements with the protection of natural resources.
Action Program [12]: Require site plans to locate structures outside or
above the 100-year flood zone wherever possible.
SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
The geology of Larkspur plays a major role in assessing the city's exposure
to seismic and geologic risks.
Three major groups of geologic materials underlie Larkspur. Sedimentary
rock of the Franciscan Formation is the bedrock beneath the ridges and
slopes forming Larkspur's northern and southern boundaries and Bon Air
Hill. See Figure 7-2.
                                      Figure 7-2
                                        Geology
                                    [to be inserted]
A large part of the Franciscan Formation underlying Larkspur is Franciscan
melange, a mix of rock types embedded in crushed rock materials. Melange
has highly erratic slope stability characteristics.
Fingers of alluvial stream deposits (clay, sand, silt, and gravel) extend down
the hillsides in swales and creek beds to gently sloping alluvial fans and
floodplains. These soils were eroded from the steep slopes and transported
by flooding streams. The older area of Larkspur (Downtown and the nearby
residential neighborhoods) lies in a wide flat alluvial valley. Occasional
erosion-resistant hills or knolls such as Palm Hill and some of its small
neighbors protrude above the otherwise flat plain.
The third type of geological material is Bay mud, which lies in a broad band
between Magnolia Avenue on the south and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard on
the north (excluding Bon Air Hill). The older Bay mud reaches a thickness
of 40 feet at the mouth of Corte Madera Creek. Bay mud is an
unconsolidated jelly-like material that is both highly compressible, and
subject to lateral flow when loads are placed on it (Information on geology was
obtained from Geologic Report and Selected Geologic Aspects of Larkspur, James C.
Bangert, 1974; Preliminary Geologic Map of Marin (and other) Counties, United States
Geological Survey, 1974; and Marin County General plan, Environmental Hazards Element,
Draft Technical Report #3, Seismic and Geologic Hazards in Marin County, August 1988).
Seismic Hazards
A seismic hazard is the effect of an earthquake such as surface faulting,
ground shaking, ground failure, or tsunami or seiche (tidal waves). All of
these must be addressed in the general plan.
Larkspur is not at risk from surface rupture. The San Andreas fault, which is
the only active fault in Marin County, lies eight miles to the west of the city.
The Hayward fault, also active, lies 13 miles to the east.
Larkspur is at risk from ground shaking - underground vibrations or waves
generated by the breaking and snapping of rocks along a fault line during an
earthquake. Most damage associated with past - and future - earthquakes is
from ground shaking. Ground shaking causes direct damage to buildings,
roads, and utilities. The greatest losses solely from ground shaking may
occur where tall structures are built on thick, relatively soft, saturated
sediments, and the least where they are built on firm bedrock (Marin County
Tecgnical Report #3). Ground shaking can also trigger liquefaction, landslides,
and tsunamis, indirectly affecting these same facilities.
Larkspur is also at risk from ground failure, in the form of liquefaction,
settlement, and landslides. Liquefaction is a process by which water
saturated clay-free sands or silts are transformed from a solid to a liquid
state. Areas susceptible to liquefaction in Larkspur are those underlain by
saturated, loosely compacted granular materials such as old stream beds
(alluvium) [Geologic Report].
Settlement is the drop in elevation of a ground surface caused by settling or
compacting of the underlying material. The most severe and damaging
settlement is most likely to result from liquefaction and landsliding.
Settlement may occur without seismic activity, as discussed under Geologic
Hazards.
Landslides, the jarring loose of basically unstable hillside materials, are
another type of ground failure. Landslides induced by earthquakes will occur
generally in the same marginally stable areas as landslides induced by other
forces, such as rainfall.
A tsunami is a large ocean wave generated by an earthquake in or near the
ocean. A tsunami would be expected to reach approximately 10 feet in the
Bay near Larkspur. The wave run-up would generally be confined to the area
east of the railroad crossing on Corte Madera Creek. Tideland areas and
filled ground near or below sea level could be inundated. A seiche is an
earthquake-generated wave in an enclosed body of water, such as a lake,
reservoir, or bay. Similar run-up and inundation would be expected from a
seiche (Larkspur Seismic Safety Element, 1973).
                                     Figure 7-3
                                 Seismic Hazards
                                   [to be inserted]
divides Larkspur into three seismic hazard categories based on the
underlying geology. Areas with the least earthquake stability are composed
of artificial fill, Bay mud, and landslide and stream deposits. The thick,
loose soils of Bay mud tend to amplify and prolong the shaking. Areas of
moderate stability are composed of sandstone, shale, and melange. The most
stable areas are underlain by hard sandstone.
Effects of Earthquakes
Earthquakes are measured in terms of magnitude and intensity. The measure
of magnitude, the Richter scale, is more commonly recognized. It assigns a
number to the calculated energy release of an earthquake which is
independent of the earthquake's observed effects. The Modified Mercalli
Intensity (MMI) scale assigns a Roman number (I to XII) based on a
description of the physical effects of earthquakes. The intensity can vary
with the magnitude of the earthquake, the distance from the site to the faults,
and with geologic materials.
The intensity of the maximum possible earthquake in Larkspur would vary
depending on geologic conditions in each location. Bay muds would
experience the greatest intensity of shaking, and corresponding severe
damage to nearly all structures (MMI XI). The alluvium areas would
experience a lesser intensity of shaking with destruction of most masonry
and frame structures (MMI X) [ibid.]. The Franciscan rock areas would
experience the least shaking, resulting in general damage to foundations and
frame buildings (MMI IX).
The ability of buildings to withstand earthquakes depends on when they
were built and their structure type. Buildings built before 1933 did not have
to meet building code regulations relating to earthquake resistance. Since
then, codes have been updated several times, and newer buildings are
increasingly more resistant to damage. Generally, older wood frame
structures may perform relatively well, while unreinforced masonry
buildings (usually brick, stone, or concrete block with no reinforcement)
probably do not meet current seismic safety standards, and may not
withstand a major earthquake. In conformance with state legislation passed
in 1985, Larkspur has identified 15 unreinforced masonry buildings
scattered through the area south of Corte Madera Creek. Although several
are located downtown, most downtown buildings, including City Hall, are
wood frame. State law requires that cities must adopt a mitigation program
for buildings of unreinforced masonry.
A major earthquake (8.3 magnitude on either the San Andreas or Hayward
Fault), in addition to damaging buildings, can be expected to topple the
Highway 101 freeway overpass at Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and buckle
pavement on Highway 101 and Magnolia Avenue through Larkspur. The
earthquake could set off landslides along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard
leaving Greenbrae separated from the rest of Larkspur for up to 24 hours
(Scenario developed under the Earthquake Preparedness Program of the
California Division of Mines and Geology). Bon Air Road and Doherty
Drive could also collapse from liquefaction and settlement. Utility lines
carrying water, gas, and sewage could be ruptured by landslides and sudden
settlement. If Fires break out, emergency response teams could encounter
serious difficulties in fighting them if water lines are broken and landslides
block access roads.
Seismic Hazard Goals, Policies, and Programs
Goal 5: Reduce risks of personal injury and property damage
associated with seismic activity.
Policy j: Establish acceptable levels of risk and life safety standards, and
see that buildings are built to, or brought up to, those standards.
Action Program [13]: Require that all unreinforced masonry buildings are
seismically upgraded to protect against loss of life.
Action Program [14]: Alert owners of homes built prior to a specified date
(related to early codes) that building frames should be bolted to foundations.
Action Program [15]: Establish a basic seismic safety notification process
through resale inspections.
Action Program [16]: As soon as legally permissible, adopt new versions
of the Uniform Building Code which contain updated seismic requirements.
The Uniform Building Code (UBC) is periodically updated, but there may
be a lag between the time the Code language is re-written and the time when
it is adopted by the local jurisdiction. Immediate local adoption will help
ensure that the most current standards are applied to new buildings.
Action Program [17]: Require geotechnical engineering investigations for
(a) buildings proposed to be constructed in "high" seismic hazard areas
potentially subject to severe ground shaking and ground failure (Bay mud,
stream and landslide deposits) as shown on Figure 7-3, and (b) critical
structures or structures made of materials other than wood frame.
The required geotechnical investigations should include a site-specific
characterization of anticipated strong ground motion, which would include
the estimated peak horizontal ground acceleration, the duration of strong
shaking, and the site period. A structural engineer should then review the
seismic data to determine whether the minimum UBC criteria will be
adequate.
Policy k: Seek to preserve existing historic buildings under any new
standards that are adopted.
Geologic Hazards
Geologic hazards exist in Larkspur in the form of landslides, debris flows,
subsidence, and differential settlement. Landslides, the principal geologic
hazard in Larkspur, occur on the hillsides forming the city's boundaries.
Subsidence and differential settlement have occurred along Corte Madera
Creek in areas underlain with Bay mud.
Natural conditions which affect slope stability are steepness of the slope,
characteristics of the soil, degree of water saturation, and seismic activity.
Human activities that can contribute to landslides include steep cuts in the
slope, improper placement of fill on slopes, concentrating surface runoff,
and overwatering.
During the winter storms of 1982, landslides (debris avalanches) in Larkspur
produced over 10,000 cubic yards of soil, rock, and debris (Hillslope Processes
and Urban Planning, Paul J. Seidelman and Jeffrey D. Borum, 1983). Slope movements
resulted in several million dollars in damage to homes, roads, and other
improvements (see Flooding, page 125). After that, the City undertook a
study of the nature, extent, and magnitude of slope stability hazards in a 300-
acre area of undeveloped land on the city's southwestern slopes. The results
of the study ("Hillslope Processes in Urban Planning") can be generalized to
the other hillside areas in the city.
The report found that land surfaces in the study area had been shaped
predominantly by erosion processes which could be expected to continue to
actively change the landscape. Areas underlain by melange (described
earlier) tended to produce more landslides. Physical disturbances of the
ground resulting from land use activities have exacerbated slope stability
problems in some areas. These activities include siting structures and road
improvements on - or in the path of - landslides, and the improper design,
use, or installation of retaining wall structures, drainage facilities, and cut
slopes.
The report includes detailed maps showing landslide and slope movement
locations in the study area.
Because debris avalanches result from a sudden failure of natural or human-
modified slopes and travel at high speeds, it is difficult to provide advance
warning to those in the path of the flow. However, local residents could be
warned when heavy rainfall and total storm precipitation indicate increased
landslide potential.
Subsidence and differential settlement have occurred in Larkspur near Corte
Madera Creek. Differential (or uneven) settlement may occur in poorly
consolidated soils during earthquake shaking or over time. Settlement may
be the result of poorly engineered fill, or of building on soils which are too
weak to assume the load. In 1974, construction of several condominium
developments on Corte Madera Creek had to be halted when cracks up to
one inch wide were discovered in outside walls (Geologic Report).
When settlement occurs over a large area it is called subsidence. Subsidence
may result in flooding as ground levels are lowered (see section on
flooding).
                                      Figure 7-4
                                   Slope Stability
                                    [to be inserted]
shows four slope stability zones for Larkspur. Zone 1 includes areas of
artificial fill over Bay mud or stream deposits. Although generally stable,
they are prone to settlement. Zone 2 (flat or gentle slopes in valleys and
along ridges) is the most stable. Zone 3 is similar to Zone 2 except that
slopes are steeper and they are underlain by rock and slope deposits. Zone 4
(landslides, and quarry walls and highway cuts prone to rock falls) is the
least stable. It should be emphasized that the zones are generalized.
In 1982-83, more detailed geologic studies were made of two areas west of
Magnolia Avenue. These two areas - called out on Figure 7-4 by solid
boundary lines - are evaluated and extensively discussed in "Hillslope
Processes and Urban Planning, Larkspur, CA," by Seidelman Associates,
Lafayette, California, 1983, available in the City of Larkspur Planning
Department.
Geologic Hazard Goals, Policies, and Programs
Goal 6: Limit the exposure of existing and future structures to risk
from landslides, debris flow, and subsidence, and minimize the potential
for damage.
Policy l: Provide property owners with information to assist them in
addressing their risk from landslides and debris flows.
Action Program [18]: Make available to developers (and to owners of
residences) in areas of steep slopes with seasonal and intermittent
drainages, the City's geotechnical reports on and information regarding the
potential hazards from debris slides and flows, and encourage them to seek
professional advice from registered engineers or certified engineering
geologists on how to lessen potential risks.
Action Program [19]: Develop a program to protect existing structures
located in high risk areas by promoting the use of debris fences (to deflect
debris flows around structures) or other mechanisms.
Action Program [20]: Provide residents with information about the
geotechnical hazards of heavy rainfall in areas of landslide potential, and
the need to evacuate.
Action Program [21]: Provide property owners with standard public
drainage designs that may be retrofitted to existing homes.
Action Program [22]: For development in hillside areas, establish, by
ordinance, standards for foundations and retaining walls that meet or
exceed the current state of the art in structural and civil engineering
practice. The standards shall include:
(a) A retaining wall that provides support for the footings of a structure
must have the same life expectancy as that of the supported structure.
(b) A series of stepped or terraced retaining walls should be designed and
approved by a qualified engineer even when the height of the individual
walls is less than the standard that requires review.
(c) A soils engineer or engineering geologist will be required to provide
field supervision of the drilling and concrete pouring operations for pier
foundations to insure the exclusion of loose debris from the pier holes,
insure adequate pier depth, and confirm soil conditions.
(d) Foundation plans for hillside structures utilizing pier foundations in soil
depths of six feet or greater shall be designed to structural and soils
engineering calculations based upon passive pressures and shall demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the City that the pier will satisfactorily resist shearing.
Policy m: Ensure that new development in hillside areas takes place only in
areas that are relatively free from the threat of landslide and other forms of
ground failure.
Action Program [23]: Require approval of a use permit for building
additions or new development in areas with an average percent of slope
equal to or greater than 25 percent.
Action Program [24]: Employ the following standards for assessing the
acceptability of new construction in hillside areas and those adjacent areas
with a potential risk from landslides and debris flows.
(a) Areas subject to recent slope movement or within the paths of debris
flows are not suitable for the development of occupied structures. Further
disruption of these high risk areas will only be permitted by the City for
roads, utilities, and other similar facilities after intensive geologic studies
have determined that mitigation measures are practical and their costs
warranted.
(b) Generally, parcels with an average slope of 65 percent or greater (or
that portion of a parcel with a slope of this magnitude) that show evidence of
having been formed by landslide processes in the past are not suited for the
development of occupied structures.
(c) Sites underlain by deep-seated landslides and landslide debris deposits
may only be developed with occupied structures if detailed geotechnical
investigations demonstrate that any soils creep and future deep seated slide
processes will, in the City's opinion, be satisfactorily mitigated.
(d) High energy flow paths are not suitable for the development of
occupied structures. These flow paths are steep seasonal drainages that have
been a path for debris flows in the past.
(e) The development of new occupied structures within debris flow
dissipation areas, which are those areas in the vicinity of the mouths of high
energy flow paths, will be permitted only if adequate mitigation measures
are provided.
Action Program [25]: Require site-specific geologic and geotechnical
reports for new construction in hillside areas and areas subject to settlement
or subsidence.
Action Program [26]: dopt standards for geologic and geotechnical
reports that outline the type and extent of investigation required for various
stages of the development process, for various geologic and soils conditions,
and for the type of land use and structure proposed.
(a) Proposed development should include detailed plans for drainage
facilities. These plans should incorporate a hydrologic and, where
appropriate, a geomorphic evaluation of existing drainage courses and City
drainage facilities that will be impacted by the project. The evaluation
should demonstrate the adequacy of these systems. After adequacy is
demonstrated, the drainage facilities should be connected to City storm
drains.
(b) In hillside areas and at the mouths of seasonal and intermittent streams,
a geologic report should be required as a part of the site development review
process for all structures proposed for human occupancy and situated where
geologic hazards may directly or indirectly influence the design, location,
and safety of the structure. A geotechnical report should be required where
soil engineering and/or geologic conditions may affect the design, location,
and safety of a structure proposed for human habitation.
FIRE HAZARDS
Two categories of fire hazard exist in Larkspur: structural fires, which can
damage the home or workplace, and wildland fires, which can quickly
explode out of control in the city's hillside chaparral, grassland, and forested
areas.
Larkspur maintains two fire stations: the main station next to City Hall
downtown and a second station just off Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.
Larkspur's 16-person crew (five firefighters per shift) is supplemented by an
automatic aid agreement with the Corte Madera and Kentfield fire
departments, and a mutual aid agreement with San Rafael. There is also a
25-person volunteer force.
The Fire Department tries to maintain a six-minute response time, although
some hillside neighborhoods are up to seven (Madrone Woodlands) and
eight minutes (highest part of Sunrise Lane) away.
Larkspur's fire prevention activities include annual inspections of all
businesses, public structures, and apartment buildings. Also, owners of
vacant lots annually are required to clear their property of excessive
vegetation. In addition, the Fire Department reviews building permit
applications to ensure that new construction meets Building and Fire Code
requirements relating to fire safety.
Wildland Fires
About 50 percent of the land area in Larkspur is at risk from wildland fires
(Larkspur Emergency Plan, Hazard Summary for Major Wildland Fire). Some of the
land is open space, but developed hillsides are also at risk. (See Figure 7-5).
Like the rest of Marin County, Larkspur's periodically arid climate,
combined with extensive areas of grass and brush-covered open space and
variable topography, create an ever-present threat of wildland fire. Extreme
weather conditions, such as high temperatures, low humidity, and strong
winds may cause an ordinary fire to expand into one of massive proportions.
A high fuel load, resulting from years of accumulation, contributes to the
problem. Steep slopes allow lowland fires to preheat vegetation before
climbing hillsides, increasing the rate of fire spread and impeding firefighter
access.
                                    Figure 7-5
                              Fire Hazard Areas
                                 [to be inserted]
Many homes located in high risk fire areas were built of combustible
building materials or with stilt and pole construction. The latter allows
suspended floor areas to trap heat, increasing opportunities to ignite the
homes.
Besides the loss of property and natural vegetation from a wildland fire,
firefighting efforts could scar the land through bulldozing, road cutting, and
use of fire retardant chemicals. Erosion and landslides may occur on the
denuded slopes during the rainy season.
Fire Goals, Policies, and Programs
Goal 7: Protect Larkspur residents and property from fire hazards.
Goal 8: Minimize the risk of wildland and structural fires, and ensure
adequate fire protection.
Policy n: Provide fast and efficient fire suppression service to Larkspur
residents.
Action Program [27]: Establish performance standards such as desired
response times for police, fire, and other public services.
Policy o: Maintain an aggressive fire prevention program.
Action Program [28]: Continue to inspect all businesses, public buildings
and apartment buildings annually for fire and building code violations.
Action Program [29]: Continue to require that all vacant lots annually be
cleared of excessive vegetation.
Action Program [30]: Continue to require smoke alarms and Class C or
better fire retardant roofs for all new construction.
Policy p: Establish more stringent fire protection standards for private
development in high risk fire hazard areas.
Areas considered to be significantly at risk for a high-loss fire are Madrone
Canyon, Madrone Woodlands, hillside areas of Greenbrae, Northridge, King
Mountain, and the eastern side of Palm Hill.
Action Program [31]: Require that automatic sprinkler systems be installed
in new residences in areas with difficult access and/or poor water supply.
Action Program [32]: Require that brush be cleared for a distance of 30
feet from residences in high fire-hazard areas.
Action Program [33]: Establish landscaping guidelines that encourage the
use of fire-resistant plants in high fire-hazard areas.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Larkspur is a residential community, seemingly removed from the risk of
accidental exposure to hazardous materials. However, hazardous materials
are used, stored, and transported through Larkspur every day. Several
manufacturing processes in the area east of Highway 101 use hazardous
materials. Neighborhood gas stations and dry cleaners also use explosive
products and solvents, and almost every household keeps some hazardous
materials on hand (insecticides, paint, etc.).
Marin County's Hazardous Waste Management Plan shows that:
       In 1986, Marin County generated about 7,700 tons of hazardous
        waste.
       Of this, 85 percent of the wastes were generated by 1,400 "small
        quantity" generators.
       Marin households contribute about 5 percent of the total waste
        stream.
       Waste oil is the largest constituent of Marin's hazardous waste
        stream, and solvents are the second largest constituent.
       Marin County's overall waste stream may nearly double by the year
        2000 if source reduction is not implemented.
        In addition to hazardous materials used and stored in Marin County,
        significant risk is posed by trucks carrying flammable liquids and
        gases, corrosives, explosives, and oxidizers along Highway 101. An
        accidental release of any of these products could result in a serious
        threat to life and property, as well as secondary effects of fire,
        explosion, or public health risk (Larkspur Emergency Plan, Hazard
        Summary for Hazardous Materials Incident).
In the event of a major hazardous materials accident, Larkspur can request
assistance from the San Rafael Hazardous Material Response Team under a
joint-powers agreement. For flammable or combustible liquid spills, the City
may request assistance from the Chevron Oil refinery. There are also limited
resources for cleaning up on-site flammable or combustible liquid spills at
the Larkspur Ferry terminal.
Handling of hazardous materials is regulated by several State and federal
agencies. Commercial use and storage of hazardous materials is subject to
the provisions of the California Occupational Health and Safety Act
(CALOSHA), the Uniform Fire Code, the Uniform Building Code, and other

state and federal legislation. Transport of hazardous materials and wastes is
regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the California
Highway Patrol Motor Carrier Division, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, and the State Department of Heath Services (DOHS). Counties
have been designated by the DOHS as the enforcement agencies for many of
the hazardous materials regulations. The Marin County Environmental
Health Department regulates both underground and above-ground storage
facilities within Larkspur.
The Marin County Hazardous Waste Management Plan - which provides
guidance at the local level - is included by reference in the Larkspur
General Plan. The County Plan was prepared under a state directive (the
Tanner bill) which required cities and counties to find ways to minimize
hazardous waste through source reduction and recycling at various stages.
The Plan also addresses enforcement of standards and regulations,
emergency response, safe transportation, and prevention and clean-up of
contaminated sites. More than 100 implementation measures are
recommended.
Hazardous Material Goals, Policies, and Programs
Goal 9: Protect Larkspur from accidental exposure to hazardous
materials from spills, leaks, vapor releases, and improper or illegal
storage and disposal.
Policy q: Limit the use and storage of hazardous materials in Larkspur to
commercial and industrial areas.
Action Program [34]: Designate zone districts where hazardous materials
can be used and stored.
Action Program [35]: Closely monitor and enforce regulations concerning
the use and handling of hazardous materials.
Action Program [36]: Require transporters of hazardous materials to
notify the City before moving such materials along City streets.
The types and amounts of materials requiring such notification will be
specified by the City. The City also should identify areas where various
types of hazardous chemicals and materials can be used and stored. Small
quantities of certain types of chemicals (such as dry cleaning solvents) may
be used in neighborhood commercial areas, while other types of chemicals
and materials should be more strictly controlled.
AIR QUALITY
Poor air quality is a persistent environmental problem. Despite great
improvements in the past 20 years, the San Francisco Bay Area still
experiences unacceptably high air pollution levels. The Bay Area is
designated a "nonattainment" area for ozone and carbon monoxide, meaning
these pollutants exceed federal standards. Auto emissions are the primary
source of air pollution in the Bay Area (Unless otherwise noted, the information in
   this section was obtained from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District's booklet, Air
   Quality and Urban Development Guidelines for Assessing Impacts of Projects and Plans,
   Nov, 1985, and revised draft of Chapter 10, May 1988).
   Although ambient air quality in Marin County is excellent, due to largely
   favorable meteorological conditions (Marin Countywide Plan Draft Environmental
   Quality Element, January 1989, page 2-10), vehicle travel by Marin residents and
   workers probably contributes to the worsening conditions in other parts of
   the Bay Area. The Larkspur General Plan can contribute to improved
   regional air quality through its policies and programs to reduce the number
   of single-occupant auto trips.
   Regulatory Agencies and Standards
   Air pollutants are regulated at the federal, state, and regional level. The
   federal Clean Air Act of 1970 set standards for various pollutants. In 1977 it
   was amended to require states that would not attain air quality standards by
   1982 (as in the Bay Area) to adopt vehicle inspection and maintenance
   programs and transportation control measures.
   The State of California has adopted its own air quality standards which, for
   some pollutants, are more restrictive than the federal standards. The Sher
   and Cortese bills place greater emphasis on transportation control measures
   to reduce auto emissions.
   The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) does regional
   air quality planning, regulates stationary sources, and operates a system of
   17 air quality monitors throughout the Bay Area to track local and regional
   air quality conditions. The only Marin County monitor is located at 534
   Fourth Street in San Rafael. Readings from this monitor are the primary
   source of information about air quality in the county.
   The table below summarizes federal and state ambient air quality standards
   for the major pollutants.
                                          Figure 7-6
                  Federal and State Ambient Air Quality Standards

    (P.M. < 10)
ppm = Parts per million; ug/m3 = micrograms per cubic-meter;
P.M. < 10 = Particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter.
Standards for emissions from wood burning stoves may be forthcoming because
wood burning stoves produce large amounts of particulate matter. However, at the
time of adoption of this Plan, the California Energy Commission had not adopted
such standards. Some California communities require fireplaces and wood-burning
stoves to meet Oregon or Colorado certification standards.
Sources of Pollutants, and Health Risks
Emissions from motor vehicles are the primary source of carbon monoxide, ozone
precursors (the chemicals that react to form ozone in the presence of sunlight), and
nitrogen dioxide. Large industrial plants, primarily oil refineries, are the major
source of sulfur dioxide. Combustion, factories, construction, grading, and
demolition create particulate matter (smoke, dust, aerosols, and metallic oxides).
Particulate matter of 10 microns or less in size is of greatest concern because it is
more easily inhaled.
The regulated pollutants can cause cardiovascular disease and acute and chronic
respiratory disease. In addition, ozone can irritate the eyes, reduce visibility, and
damage vegetation. Certain population groups, including children, the elderly, the
acutely ill, and the chronically ill - especially those with cardiovascular diseases -
are particularly sensitive to high concentrations of pollutants. These groups, and the
locations and facilities where they spend a substantial amount of time, are referred
to as "sensitive receptors." In Larkspur, sensitive receptors include all residential
neighborhoods as well as public and private schools (Redwood High School, Hall
Middle School, Larkspur/Corte Madera School where Marin Primary School is
located, and St. Patrick's School), city parks, and private day care centers. (See
Figure 5-2 for locations.) Marin General Hospital, schools, parks, and convalescent
hospitals in Kentfield and Greenbrae are also "sensitive receptors."
Climate and Topography
Climate and topography are major influences on air quality. Marin County benefits
from constant winds, a marine layer of fog which lifts in the morning hours during
the summer, and heavy winter precipitation compared to other parts of the Bay
Area. Wind direction is east-west, in alignment with the ridges (Corte Madera
Ridge and Southern Heights Ridge in Larkspur). The combination of wind direction
and topography allows for constant scouring of the ambient air, resulting in
extremely high air quality most of the time. It also means that air pollution
generated in Marin County is dispersed to other parts of the Bay Area, underscoring
the regional nature of the problem (Marin County Environmental Quality Element Draft
Technical Reort #1, Air Quality Maintenance in Marin County, January 1989, page 11).
Historic and Current Air Quality
Air quality in the San Francisco Bay Area has improved since the passage of the
Clean Air Act in 1970, due mainly to emission controls on autos and to controls on
stationary air pollution sources. Table 7-7 below shows the number of days on
which federal or State standards were exceeded at the San Rafael Monitoring
Station over the past 10 years. After three incidents in 1978, there were no days in
which standards were exceeded until 1988.
                                          Figure 7-7

         Particulates (TSP)
         (P.M. < 10)
Although the table illustrates generally favorable air quality in Marin County,
Marin produced an estimated 190 tons of air contaminants every day in 1982.
When disaggregated by land use, transportation (vehicles, boats, etc.) was
estimated to produce 160 tons or 84 percent of the total. Residential, industrial,
construction, and agriculture each contributed between six and nine tons a day
(Marin Countywide Plan Draft Environmental Quality Element, January 1989, page 2-10).
Clearly, vehicle travel is the major source of air pollution in Marin County.
Although carbon dioxide is not listed above, even a clean-burning engine emits
about 5.6 pounds of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide for every gallon of gas it
consumes (The End of Nature, Bill McKibben, 1989).
Air Quality Goals, Policies, and Programs
Goal 10: Ensure that air pollution levels do not threaten public health and
safety.
Policy r: Seek to comply with State and federal standards for air quality.
Policy s: Seek to reduce auto travel and, thereby, the pollutants from auto
emissions.
Since most readily available pollution control "hardware" has already been applied
to stationary sources and motor vehicles, a reduction in auto travel may be the only
way to improve air quality in the Bay Area. This could require fundamental
changes in land use and travel patterns. Larkspur is almost built out, so significant
land use changes are not likely to occur. However, the Larkspur Circulation Goals,
Policies, and Programs strongly advocate a reduction in the number of single-
occupant auto trips. Alternative modes of transportation, such as transit and
bicycles, are encouraged, and a Transportation Demand Management ordinance is
proposed. The Circulation and Land Use chapters also encourage mixed uses and
neighborhood shopping centers to reduce auto trips.
Policy t: Ensure that traffic generated by new development is not the cause of
state and federal air quality standards being exceeded in Marin County.
Action Program [37]: Require new development to mitigate impacts if the project
causes a change in the level of air pollutants by a specified amount.
The City will work with the BAAQMD to identify other measures which Larkspur
might impose.
NOISE
Noise is unwanted sound. Traffic is the main source of noise in Larkspur. Noise
measurements taken in 1982 found noise levels to be highest near major traffic
generators and quietest at locations remote from major traffic sources.
An understanding of the location and sources of noise in Larkspur is important to
land use and transportation policies, and therefore the land use and circulation
sections of the General Plan. "Sensitive" land uses (housing, schools, hospitals)
should be located away from high noise levels, or, if that's not practical, protected
from them. Since traffic is the major noise generator, policies that will increase or
decrease traffic will affect the noise environment of adjacent land uses. Noise is
also a factor in open space planning because noise can adversely affect the
enjoyment of quiet activities in those areas.
Noise measurements were made at nine locations throughout the City in July 1982.
Measurements taken in three general areas since then (for Environmental Impact
Reports prepared in 1987 and 1988 for Creekside and the Landmark Building)
show no measurable change. (All measurements have a one or two decibel margin
of error.) Besides showing actual noise levels in various locations, these
measurements were used to validate noise contours developed for the City's major
arterials. The noise contours were modeled (not actually measured) using
information on average daily traffic, peak and off-peak travel speeds, distribution
of traffic by hour of the day, and the percentage of trucks on a given street.
The noise contours are shown in terms of the day/night average noise level (Ldn),
which is the measurement commonly used in Environmental Impact Reports.
Noise contours were also modeled for 1990 (with a notation that they would be
accurate at least through 1995).
See Figure 7-8.
                                       Figure 7-8
                            1995 Noise Exposure Contours
                                     [to be inserted]
The 1990-95 noise contours were based on projected future traffic, which is not
significantly different from the future traffic projected under this General Plan in
terms of how it affects the noise contours.
The locations of the contours do not take into account shielding provided by
terrain, buildings, or intervening walls. The contours therefore represent "worst
case" conditions. For example, the contours indicate a noise level of about 65 Ldn
at Site 1 (Via la Cumbre), but the actual noise measurement was 56 Ldn. At this
location, Highway 101 is depressed relative to the homes along Via la Cumbre, and
the cut slope reduces the noise levels. The same phenomenon was demonstrated
when noise measurements were taken for the Lincoln Terraces project. The noise
measurement at the site closest to Highway 101 was lower than at others farther
away because the location is shielded from traffic noise by the old quarry walls.
Exterior Noise Levels and Land Use Compatibility
Over the years many studies have been performed to determine how much noise is
acceptable for different land uses. Figure 7-9, "Land Use Compatibility Standards,"
shows the noise levels that are acceptable for various land use categories. The chart
indicates that a land use can be made compatible with a range of noise levels if the
necessary noise reduction features are included in its design. This table helps
planners in making preliminary determinations about the suitability of a proposed
project located in an area where there is information about the noise environment
(e.g., from noise contours or noise measurements).
California Noise Insulation Standards require preparation of an acoustical report
for multiple-family dwellings proposed in areas where the Ldn exceeds 60 dBA.
The report must show how the project will be designed to reduce the noise level to
at least 45 dBA in habitable rooms. Typical buildings with their windows open
provide an exterior-to-interior noise reduction of about 15 dB. In areas where the
exterior noise level exceeds an Ldn of 60 dB, other noise reduction measures must
be employed (see Construction Modifications on page 151). No standards have
been established for acceptable outdoor areas in multiple-family developments, but
State Noise Element Guidelines recommend 60 dB as the upper limit for
acceptable levels.
                                       Figure 7-9
                          Land Use Compatibility Standards
                                     [to be inserted]
Comparable State standards do not exist for commercial development. However,
an interior noise level of 40 to 45 dB is generally considered acceptable for an
office environment during working hours.
Besides traffic, other noise sources have been identified as common problems in
Larkspur. Unmuffled or improperly muffled motor vehicles are some of the most
annoying sources in any community. Not only are these vehicles annoying, they
are illegal. Identification of unmuffled vehicles and/or vehicles with modified
exhaust systems is easy, and it should be the routine procedure of the Police
Department to cite all offenders.
Barking dogs, especially during the night, are particularly annoying. The
Environmental Protection Agency has developed a training procedure which has
been very successful in teaching dogs not to bark. It is included in Larkspur's 1982
Draft Noise Element as Appendix C.
The use of power tools can be controlled through a noise ordinance which, in part,
restricts their use to certain hours of the day--8 AM to 10 PM during weekdays and
9 AM to 9 PM on weekends. A noise ordinance could also control amplified
music, public address system, radios, and other electronic noise sources.
Early morning garbage pick-up can be a problem. The City should encourage the
scavenger company to consider the purchase of quiet trucks when upgrading or
expanding their fleet. Additionally, the City should review new projects to
determine whether approval will result in earlier garbage pickups in existing
neighborhoods.
Noise Goals, Policies, and Programs
Goal 11: Reduce the adverse effects of noise upon persons living or working
in Larkspur.
Policy u: Ensure that all new living and work areas are developed with acceptable
noise environments.
Action Program [38]: Maintain the following standards for noise levels in new
residential developments.
            a. Indoor noise levels should not exceed 45 dBA.
            b. Outdoor noise levels should not exceed 55 dBA.
Noise can be reduced through site planning, architectural layout, noise barriers,
and construction modifications.
Site Planning. By taking advantage of the natural shape and contours of the site, it
is often possible to arrange buildings and other facilities to reduce and possibly
eliminate noise impacts. Planned unit developments are particularly conducive to
site planning techniques.
Architectural Layout. Bedrooms will be considerably quieter if placed on the side
of the house facing away from a roadway. Similarly, balconies facing roadways
should be avoided. Quiet outdoor spaces can be provided by creating a U-shaped
development that faces away from the roadway.
Noise Barriers. Noise barriers must be massive enough to prevent significant noise
transmission through them and high enough to shield the receiver from the noise
source. While effective - because of their massiveness - noise walls are not
appropriate in all locations. They work well along freeways and in larger
developments. Access doors should be placed in the walls at regular intervals for
use during emergencies.
Construction Modifications. In general, windows and doors are the acoustical
"weak links" in a building. If other noise reduction measures are not sufficient,
sealed windows on the noisy side of the building and an alternate means of
ventilating the building may help. Beyond this, thicker window panes or double-
glazed windows will be required. Doors should face away from the noise source.
They should be solid-core and equipped with an appropriate acoustical door
gasket.
Policy v: For non-residential projects, use the "Land Use Compatibility
Standards," Figure 7-9, to evaluate their suitability in particular locations.
Action Program [39]: Require acoustical studies for all projects that would be
exposed to noise levels in excess of those deemed normally acceptable, as defined
in Figure 7-9.
Action Program [40]: Require thorough noise assessments in all environmental
analyses of major projects.
Goal 12: Reduce noise levels in areas where the existing noise exceeds
"normally acceptable" levels, to levels compatible with land uses in those
areas, as defined in Figure 7-9, "Land Use Compatibility Standards."
Policy w: Promote educational efforts that will encourage the citizens of Larkspur
to improve their noise environments.
Policy x: Control unnecessary, excessive, and annoying noises within the city,
where not preempted by federal or State control.
Action Program [41]: Adopt a noise ordinance.
Policy y: Enforce applicable federal and State laws.
Action Program [42]: Enforce the provisions of the California Motor Vehicle
Code pertaining to vehicle noise emission.
Policy z: Support programs to reduce community noise levels where possible
within the "normally acceptable" categories shown in Figure 7-9.
Action Program [43]: Work with neighboring communities to ensure compliance
with Larkspur's land use and noise compatibility standards at the city's
boundaries.
Goal 13: Prevent the escalation of noise levels in areas where noise-sensitive
uses exist.
Policy aa: Analyze in detail the potential noise impacts of any actions the City
may take that could significantly alter noise levels in the community.
Action Program [44]: Review all public works projects for potential noise
impact.
Action Program [45]: Consider noise emission when purchasing vehicles,
construction equipment, etc. This consideration shall be balanced against the
required performance and cost.
Policy ab: Encourage creative solutions when potential conflicts arise between
noise levels and land use.

             Chapter 8. Bicycle and Pedestrian Trails and Paths
    A network of hiking and biking trails is available to Larkspur residents.
    These trails provide a non-vehicular circulation system in the city and link
    residents with open space and neighboring communities.
    Many links in the system are not secured, however. As land is developed for
    residential and other uses, there is danger that existing, informal trails could
    be closed to the public. Still other trails, which offer the opportunity to link
    parts of the trails system, remain undeveloped.
    The principal purpose of this chapter is to plan and secure a complete and
    citywide system of trails and paths that will link sections of Larkspur to one
    another and to neighboring communities and open space areas. This chapter
    identifies trails of citywide significance that need to be preserved and
    provides basic tools for implementing a complete system. The chapter has
    been coordinated with the Marin Countywide Trails Plan by the Larkspur
    Park and Recreation Commission. It is not intended to serve as a guide for
    trail users. Precise plans for trails and paths will be developed in an updated
    Park, Recreation, and Open Space Master Plan.
    Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
    Larkspur is well served by bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Although some
    of the older neighborhoods do not have sidewalks, newer developments do.
    About 3 percent of Larkspur residents walk to work.
    Bicycle paths in Larkspur are oriented mainly to serve students (including
    elementary, middle, and high school, and College of Marin students), and for
    recreation. A few residents - the 1980 census indicates less than 1 percent -
    bicycle to work. There is also considerable recreational travel by adult
    bicyclists through Larkspur, especially on weekends.
    Figure 8-2, the Bicycle/Pedestrian Circulation Plan at the end of this chapter,
    shows the location of existing bicycle and pedestrian facilities in Larkspur

and indicates which connections are still to be secured.
In general, multi-purpose paths - accommodating bicyclists and pedestrians -
have worked well in Larkspur. Following are two examples of such paths:
One parallels Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, from the eastern Larkspur City
Limit, westward on an extra-wide sidewalk, past the ferry terminal, under
the Greenbrae interchange with Highway 101, and behind Drake's Landing
and Bon Air Shopping Center to an end at the western terminus of South
Eliseo. This path has two spurs across Corte Madera Creek parallel to
Highway 101.
The second path follows the old Northwestern Pacific Railroad right-of-way
east of Magnolia from William Avenue, northward through the Downtown
area to Doherty Drive. The path crosses Doherty Drive in the crosswalk, and
continues along a dedicated path on Magnolia Avenue north of the
intersection, along the new Creekside development. The dedicated path
disappears near Bon Air Road, and signs advise bicyclists to walk their bikes
over the bridge across Corte Madera Creek. There, the path splits in two -
one fork follows the creek to the College of Marin and the Town of Ross,
and the other takes a more northerly tack to Bacich School. On the west side
of Corte Madera Creek, the bike trail shares a narrow sidewalk with
pedestrians through the North Magnolia area.
All the bicycle trails are open to pedestrians. There are several hiking-only
trails in Larkspur as well. These are mostly in the hills that lead up to the
Corte Madera ("North") Ridge. Another pedestrian-only facility runs along
the Bay shore in Remillard Park.
Many of the designated bicycle facilities in Larkspur are actually sidewalks
signed as bike paths. In some cases, they are only three or four feet wide, far
too narrow for a shared facility. Examples of these are on North Magnolia
Avenue, and on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, between Eliseo Street and
Wolfe Grade. It would be physically difficult and costly to acquire land or
easements and build better paths in these areas. Therefore, many of the
existing links will probably have to remain as connectors in the city's system
of paths and trails. Bicycles should therefore continue to be allowed on
sidewalks, except Downtown, between Doherty Drive and William Avenue,
where an alternate path is available along the former NWP right-of-way.
In addition to these paths and trails, there are several "paper streets" in
Larkspur that continue to provide pedestrian access in some of the hilly
neighborhoods. These streets were platted - without regard for terrain - as
part of an early survey of Larkspur. They remain as paths and staircases, but
are not well maintained. Another survey is needed to evaluate their
usefulness in the overall path system.
The Bay Trail runs through the City of Larkspur along the east and west
sides of Highway 101 from Corte Madera to Sir Francis Drake Boulevard,
and along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard to the Richmond Bridge. This
proposed 400-mile trail system will provide pedestrian and bicycle paths
along San Francisco and San Pablo Bays. The Pacific Coast Bicentennial
Bicycle Route passes through Larkspur along Magnolia Avenue. In 1990,
City staff was studying moving the route to the NWP railroad path.
The city's newest dedicated bicycle/pedestrian facilities were constructed in
1989. One is a path linking William Avenue with Lucky Drive, through the
Redwood High School campus. The other was built as part of the Creekside
project, and loops around its east side.
Handicap access to paths is important and should be considered - wherever
feasible - as new paths are planned.
The many existing and narrow roads and the constraints of existing
development preclude the overall paths plan from providing separate routes
restricted to bikes. In general, development of multi-purpose trails is most
reasonable for Larkspur.
Constraints to Bicycle and Pedestrian Circulation
Unlike motorized travel, system capacity is rarely a problem for bicyclists
and pedestrians. Rather, the problems usually involve inadequate or missing
linkage between existing paths and trails, missing or unclear access to
destinations, inconsistent design standards, and safety.
Safety is the first and major consideration. Bicyclists should feel safe and
comfortable traveling on the same roads as motor vehicles. Similarly, where
there are no sidewalks, pedestrians should feel safe sharing the road with
cars. When conditions are not favorable to smooth circulation of bicycle and
pedestrian traffic, a "constraint" is said to exist. There are several such
constraints in Larkspur. (See Figure 8-1.) Some of the constraints which
have been identified are:
                                    Figure 8-1
                Constraints to Bicycle and Pedestrian Travel
        Bicycle riding on the Bon Air Road bridge over Corte Madera Creek

       is prohibited. Bikes must be walked on the sidewalk. The intersection
       with Magnolia Avenue and Bon Air Road also is confusing for bikes.
      Pedestrians and cyclists traveling along South Eliseo Drive and Corte
       Madera Creek between the Bon Air multi-purpose path and Bon Air
       Road must use the sidewalk - where available - or the road.
      Except for the shared sidewalk access described above, there is no
       comfortable way to get to the neighborhoods in Greenbrae along Sir
       Francis Drake Boulevard.
      The NWP-rail-corridor bike path in the southbound direction across
       Doherty Drive is not signed. It is not clear where the bicycle facility
       continues. Similar signing problems occur at the south end of the
       NWP bike path, where there are shared roadway connections with
       William and Magnolia Avenues.
      The sidewalk bike paths along north Magnolia Avenue are too
       narrow for their intended use. Alternatives should be investigated.
      Pedestrians crossing Doherty Drive, especially when school begins
       and ends, find it difficult because of the steady volume of traffic.
       School crossing-guards ease this situation somewhat.
      Doherty Drive, north of the Redwood High School buildings, is
       narrow and therefore difficult for pedestrians and bicyclists to travel.
       Although there are signs routing pedestrians and bicyclists through
       the Redwood High School parking lot, the pathways have never been
       clearly defined or marked.
       In addition to the constraints in the bicycle and pedestrian circulation
       system listed above, there are areas where improvements would help
       to link parts of Larkspur, other communities, and open space areas.
       Some of those which have been identified are:
      Access to San Rafael could be improved (1) at Andersen Drive and
       East Sir Francis Drake Boulevard; (2) along the railroad right-of-way
       adjacent to Highway 101; and (3) along Wolfe Grade.
      Access to the town Corte Madera is not well developed.
      Access points to trails in the North Ridge and King Mountain are not
       well marked. If more access points were identified, hikers would not
       make an undue impact on any one neighborhood or residence.
      Access to Tubb Lake and the Southern Heights (San Rafael) Ridge
       has not been secured.
TRAILS AND PATHS GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
Goal 1: Make it easier to travel around Larkspur by non-motorized
transportation modes.
Policy a: Develop a comprehensive and coordinated trails and paths
system that serves both recreational and utilitarian travel.
Action Program [1]: Require the submittal of a trails and paths plan for all
new development or redevelopment.

Policy b:    Fill gaps in the existing path system.
Action Program [2]: Implement the Bicycle/Pedestrian Circulation Plan
shown on Figure 8-2.
Figure 8-2 is to be used by the City in reviewing new development and
redevelopment proposals to ensure that the Bicycle/Pedestrian Circulation
Plan is implemented. Any regional plans for trails and paths, and all
development and redevelopment proposals, will be referred to the City's
Park and Recreation Commission as may be necessary to confirm or modify
alignments and details. Specific improvements would include, but not be
limited to:
       Explore widening Bon Air Bridge to allow bicyclists to ride across.
       Explore a pedestrian/bicycle bridge to link the areas north and south
        of Corte Madera Creek between the existing bridges at Bon Air Road
        and Highway 101.
Corte Madera Creek is a natural boundary that separates the north and south
portions of Larkspur. There are only three ways to cross in and around
Larkspur: College Avenue, Bon Air Road, and U.S. 101. The separation
between parts of Larkspur is most acute for bicyclists and pedestrians, who
are most sensitive to roundabout routing. It is important to assure that
Larkspur cooperates with its neighbors in planning new local circulation
routes.
Policy c: Inventory and upgrade signing and access to trails and paths.
Action Programs 3-6 below propose new signs where needs have been
identified. The inventory proposed in Policy "c" will identify additional
needs and actions.
Action Program [3]: Sign Magnolia Avenue as an on-street bicycle route
from College to Bon Air Road (on the west side) and from College to
Dartmouth/ Skylark (on the east side).
Action Program [4]: Sign the sidewalk from Dartmouth/Skylark to Bon Air
Road on the northbound side as a bike path.
This sidewalk path is less constrained than sidewalks at other locations, and
should be able to handle the two uses.
Action Program [5]: Sign South Eliseo Drive as an on-street bike route.
Action Program [6]: Improve signs along William Avenue from Magnolia
Avenue to the Community Fields path at Redwood High School.
Policy d: Survey the "paper streets" of Larkspur to evaluate their
usefulness in an overall path system, and preserve those "paper streets"
identified as useful for paths.
Action Program [7]: When possible and appropriate, upgrade and improve

the "paper streets" of Larkspur for use by the public as trails or paths.
Goal 2: Provide safe bicycle and pedestrian routes for all users, to
schools, shopping and business areas, recreation facilities, open space
preserves, and other communities, and associated amenities.
Policy e: Locate and design pedestrian and bike trails separate from streets
and automobile traffic wherever possible. Designate on-street bike lanes
where off-road paths are not possible.
Action Program [8]: Require new development or redevelopment to
provide appropriate sidewalks or paths.
Action Program [9]: Require, by ordinance, bike racks in commercial and
park and recreation areas, and outside schools and other public buildings.
Action Program [10]: Install signs to mark the location of water fountains
and public toilets near bicycle facilities.
The signs will assist bicyclists and pedestrians unfamiliar with particular
routes.
Policy f: Freeway improvements should include protected crossings for
pedestrians and bicycles.
Goal 3: Coordinate existing and planned bicycle and pedestrian routes
with the circulation plans of neighboring communities and the County.
Policy g: Develop and maintain hiking trails linking Larkspur with trails
and open space areas in Marin County and nearby cities.
Action Program [11]: Cooperate with Corte Madera to use the abandoned
railroad right-of-way to develop a path from Alexander Avenue to Village
Square and from William Avenue to Industrial Way, while protecting the
habitat value of the Redwood High School marsh.
Action Program [12]: Coordinate equestrian paths with the Marin
Countywide Trails Plan.
Action Program [13]: Secure the abandoned railroad right-of-way west of
Highway 101 and along William and Holcomb Avenues for bicycle and
pedestrian paths.
Action Program [14]: Improve the path on the NWP right-of-way from
William east and south to the Corte Madera city limit.
Policy h: Pursue the potential temporary use of the NWP right-of-way east
of Highway 101 for use as a pedestrian and/or bicyclist trail until its use as a
transit-way.
Policy i: Secure better trail access to San Rafael.
Trail connections are needed between Tubb Lake and the Southern Heights
Ridge; at Andersen Drive and East Sir Francis Drake Boulevard; and along
Wolfe Grade.
Goal 4: Reduce the need for long distance and/or frequent shopping
travel by private automobile.
This goal is consistent with those in other chapters of the Plan which call for
providing neighborhood-serving businesses and keeping the Downtown at a
scale that will encourage people to walk or bike to the shops. Most of the
policies and programs that would result in attaining this goal are contained
in the Land Use chapter. Other policies are:
Policy j: Encourage neighborhood and local consumer services that can be
reached by walking and bicycling.
Policy k: Encourage means of travel to and between retail areas other than
by private automobile.
Goal 5: Provide hiking trails and access points for public enjoyment
and use of open space areas.
Policy l: Provide reasonable access to open space areas via trails and entry
points that do not adversely impact adjacent residential areas.
Action Program [15]: Develop guidelines and standards for paths and
access.
Action Program [16]: Secure multiple public access points prior to
development of areas adjacent to trails and open space lands (e.g., Big and
Little King, Tubb Lake/Miwok Park, San Rafael/Southern Heights Ridge).
This concept is important because of the difficulties experienced in
clarifying trail access in already established neighborhoods when trails
became public (as in Madrone Canyon).
Policy m: Reduce theft, noise, and parking intrusion associated with trails
in neighborhoods.
Action Program [17]: Use planting and lighting to discourage parties and
similar gatherings at trail entrances.
Policy n: Encourage persons using the hiking trails to walk to trail access
points instead of using their automobiles.
Action Program [18]: Allow parking at trail access points only where
there is sufficient land area.
Action Program [19]: At trail entrances, provide appropriate gates
designed to preclude entry by motorized vehicles (and in some cases, by
equestrians).
Goal 6: Provide paths that encourage broad public use.
Policy o: When developing trails and paths, consider the access needs of a
variety of users, including school-age children, the elderly, and the
handicapped.
Policy p: Develop and adopt design standards to reduce trail user conflicts
and protect adjacent environmental resources.
The minimum paved width of most paths should be eight feet. Where more
than modest use is anticipated, the paved section should be 10 feet, and an
unpaved shoulder 18 inches wide should be provided along each side of the
path for joggers.
Policy q: Coordinate with Marin County and its Countywide Trails Plan in
developing a policy for mountain bike use of trails and open space areas.
Goal 7: Reduce the number and severity of transportation-related
accidents.
The need for safe circulation must be recognized as a priority, even at the
expense of circulation efficiency.
Policy r: Provide bicyclists and pedestrians with safe facilities for
circulation.
Policy s: Place higher priority on safety as opposed to efficient traffic flow
and speed.
Policy t: Identify streets that create a safety problem for pedestrians and
bicyclists.
Action Program [20]: Provide opportunities for bicyclists and pedestrians
to cross Magnolia Avenue safely, such as additional all-way stop-controlled
intersections, actuated traffic signals, or other means.
Action Program [21]: Continue bicycle education programs in schools.
Action Program [22]: Selectively install bicycle/pedestrian safety
messages along paths to advise of rules of the road, need for courtesy, and
spot hazards.
Action Program [23]: Improve the bike route along Doherty Drive.
Visibility, connections, and signage should be improved on this important
route.
Action Program [24]: Improve the transition from the sidewalk bike path
on Magnolia Avenue, north of Doherty Drive, to the path on the NWP right-
of-way.
Action Program [25]: By ordinance, prohibit motor vehicles (except for
public safety vehicles) on bike paths and pedestrian trails

                  Chapter 6. Environmental Resources
This chapter covers open space and conservation as prescribed by
Government Code sections 65302(e) and 65302(d), respectively. It addresses
open space and preservation of the natural environment; water conservation
and water quality; and waste recycling.
OPEN SPACE
State Government Code Section 65560 defines open space land as "any
parcel of land or water which is essentially unimproved and devoted to an
open space use for the purposes of: (1) preservation of natural resources; (2)
managed production of resources; (3) outdoor recreation; and (4) public
health and safety." In Larkspur, the primary purposes of open space lands
are resource preservation, outdoor recreation, public health and safety, and
community separation.
Preservation and enhancement of the biological diversity of plants and
animals within the urban environment is important in an area with
significant ecological resources. Larkspur's open space lands are diverse.
They include hillsides and ridges; riparian, marsh, and shoreline areas; and
an abandoned railroad right-of-way. The City values the native habitat
resources within Larkspur and continues to implement policies designed for

their protection.
Hillsides and Ridges
Corte Madera Ridge, forming the city's south and western boundary, and
Southern Heights Ridge, forming the city's northern boundary, define
Larkspur's urban form and separate it from other communities (Ridge names
are USGS nomenclature). Corte Madera Ridge in particular, with Big and Little
King Mountains standing out in the foreground, is a symbol of the
community.
Corte Madera Ridge lies on the northeastern slopes of Mount Tamalpais.
The ridge, and Blithedale Summit to the south, make up the 1,000-acre
Northridge Open Space Preserve owned by the Marin County Open Space
District. About 260 acres of the preserve are within Larkspur, including the
newly-acquired 14-acre parcel at the upper end of Piedmont Road.
The Northridge Open Space Preserve includes shaded canyons and open
wind-blown hillsides. Woodlands (oaks, madrone, bay, buckeye, and
redwoods) are interspersed with dense stands of chaparral (chamise,
chaparral oak, manzanita, bush monkeyflower, coyote brush, and toyon) and
annual grasslands. There are both native and introduced grasses (King
Mountain Estates Draft Environmental Impact Report, April 5, 1989).
The vegetation is home to many species of wildlife, from western fence
lizards and gopher snakes to deer, fox, bobcat, and coyote. Trees in the
woodland provide nesting and perching sites for numerous bird species -
jays, red-tailed hawks, great horned owls, and others. There are no known
rare or endangered species on the Northridge property. However, the spotted
owl is on the California Department of Fish and Game list of Bird Species of
Special Concern (North Wildlife Survey, Mitchell Katzel, February 18, 1989).
(The Marin County Audubon Society has counted between 71 and 90
different species of birds in Larkspur during its annual Christmas bird counts
from 1978 to 1988. The Christmas Count area includes Corte Madera Creek
from Highway 101 to the College of Marin bridge and adjacent upland areas,
including King Mountain and various neighborhoods (Marin Audubon Society,
Mill Valley).
Most of the land on the slopes of Corte Madera Ridge that is not in the open
space preserve is developed with single and multiple-family housing. An
exception is the Tiscornia Estate - a 300-plus-acre holding on and around
King Mountain and Little King Mountain. A large part of the Tiscornia
Estate is in unincorporated Marin County. About 160 acres on King
Mountain is proposed to be divided into four large single-family lots with
125 acres of it reserved in a scenic open space easement. About 76 acres in
Larkspur and a similar amount in the County (at the upper end of Baltimore
Canyon) are being added to the Northridge Preserve. As of September 1990,
the Marin County Open Space District had the property in escrow. About 30
acres on the lower slopes (including the former Escalle Winery) is
designated for Low Density Residential.
Both the publicly and privately-owned lands on Corte Madera Ridge are
easily accessible from several residential neighborhoods and are used by
hikers and joggers.
Southern Heights Ridge separates Larkspur from San Rafael. West of
Highway 101, the south-facing hillside has been developed with the single-
family homes of the Greenbrae neighborhood. Although landscaping is
extensive, the area cannot be defined as open space except to the extent that
it is an important visual backdrop to the community. A plant called the
White Rayed Pentachaeta found on the slopes of the hill has been designated
as a candidate for the federal list of threatened species.
Southern Heights Ridge continues east across Highway 101 where it forms
the spine of the San Quentin Peninsula. The ridge drops off steeply into the
old rock quarry, now developed with housing. The top of the ridge (about 20
acres within Larkspur) was set aside as open space as a condition of
development approval for the Larkspur Landing and Lincoln Terraces
development.
Except for grass, the ridgeline is quite barren. It is a landmark visible from
all directions.
Besides the hillside open space areas within Larkspur, the community
greatly benefits from its proximity to Mount Tamalpais State Park and Marin
Municipal Water District watershed lands, which are open to public use. The
total acreage in recreation and open space use in Marin quadrupled between
1970 and 1990. Together, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, the
Point Reyes National Seashore, the state parks, the Marin Municipal and
North Marin County Water District watershed lands, and the Open Space
District lands comprise approximately 150,000 acres (Marin Countywide Plan,
Parks and Recreation Element, Draft, October 1988).
Shoreline and Marsh Areas
Corte Madera Creek, although substantially channelized, once flowed
through a wide valley of tidal marshes. The creek still remains as the major
open space resource in Larkspur's flatlands. Before urbanization, these
marshes extended from Magnolia Avenue on the south to Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard on the north (with the exception of Bon Air Hill). The creek's
natural character has been greatly altered by the Army Corps of Engineers
flood control project, and by private development. All that remains of the
marshes is a narrow fringe along segments of the creek edge, and small areas
preserved at the College of Marin, Piper Park, Redwood High School, the
Larkspur Ferry Terminal, and Remillard Park.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service classifies most of the marshes as
estuarine, or tidal wetlands, because the waters have some access to the Bay
(The California General Plan Glossary (The California Planning Roundtable, 1990)
defines "wetlands" as "Transsitional areas between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the
water table is usually at or near the surface, or the land is covered by shallow water." Under
a "unified" methodology now used by all federal agencies, wetlands are defined as those
areas meeting certain criteria for hydrology, vegetation, and soils.). The marshes along
the southeasterly boundary of Redwood High School, at the College of
Marin, and at Remillard Park are classified as palustrine, or nontidal
wetlands - cut off from tidal action.
The wetlands contain a variety of marsh vegetation. One plant, cordgrass, is
the most productive in its yield per acre of any grass food known. It also
produces more oxygen by photosynthesis than any other vascular plant.
Another plant found along Corte Madera Creek, the Marin knotweed, is a
preeminent, extremely rare, endangered, and unprotected species, according
to the California Department of Fish and Game. Corte Madera Creek is one
of only two known locations where the knotweed still exists (Creekside
Supplemental Environmental Report, September 1987).
Salt marshes support a great diversity of animals ranging from small
invertebrates to large vertebrates such as great blue herons. Fish graze the
marshes at high tide and are in turn eaten by birds. The marsh vegetation
provides nest sites and food sources for song birds and rodents (ibid.).
The marshes of the San Francisco Bay and the waters of Corte Madera
Creek provide an important over-wintering habitat for migratory species of
the Pacific Flyway. In the fall, migrating waterfowl and shorebirds by the
hundreds of thousands arrive from the north to rest and feed before resuming
their flights southward to Mexico and Central and South America. In spring,
waves of shorebirds are seen once again as they return. The northward
migration is not as populous, as many of the birds choose to return through
the Central Valley.
Three special status species have been sighted near the creek in Larkspur,
although not in recent years - the California clapper rail, the California black
rail, and the salt marsh harvest mouse. The clapper rail and salt marsh
harvest mouse are listed as endangered by both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service and the California Department of Fish and Game.
Balance Between Recreational Uses and Protecting Natural Vegetation
and Wildlife
In recent years, Larkspur has aggressively fought to preserve its few
remaining marshes. The City has also sought to retain the recreational
aspects of the creekside environment by establishing bike and pedestrian
paths along some segments. The City recognizes that creekside
improvements may encourage human intrusion into areas of the creek that
sustain important habitat for wildlife. Therefore, the provision of recreation
facilities in areas with critical ecological resources is balanced with a
sensitivity to protecting wildlife habitat, wildlife species, and remnants of
native riparian vegetation.
Water Quality
Intermittent or continually running water distinguishes rivers and streams.
Streams originate as outlets of ponds or lakes, or from springs, seepage, or
seasonal runoff. Riparian streams and creeks represent a rare habitat type,
affected by the availability and quality of their water. The quality of water in
streams, creeks, ponds, and other surface bodies can be affected by erosion,
sedimentation, and runoff. Naturally occurring processes, such as erosion,
can be accelerated by human actions. Excessive grading, removal of
vegetation, and construction adjacent to stream banks can hasten the natural
erosion process, resulting in the rapid loss of soil from the land and high
levels of sediment in surface water bodies. The sediment in rapidly moving
water undercuts stream banks, while slower moving waters deposit silt. The
potential for erosion occurs primarily along natural channel banks that have
not been altered by flood control projects.
Another source of surface water pollution is contaminated surface runoff.
Surface runoff typically contains contaminants such as oil and grease from
driveways, parking lots, and streets, sediment from construction sites, litter,
animal waste, pesticides, lead from auto exhausts, and yard waste.
San Francisco Bay
Larkspur only has about one-half mile of direct Bay frontage - from the
Larkspur Landing pedestrian bridge to the eastern end of Remillard Park.
The shoreline is designated either Open Space or Parkland and there is no
potential for development. The Bay frontage beyond Remillard Park is
outside the City Limits and within the boundaries of San Quentin Prison,
except for a small beach between the park and the prison boundaries. Wind
surfers launch their craft from the beach. (See Policy "e" and Action
Programs 7 and 8, and discussion of this site in Chapter 5, Public Facilities
and Services, page 107) Other than at the beach, access to the Bay is
difficult. The shoreline is rocky and narrow, and it is unsafe to stop a car
along busy Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, which parallels the Bay front. A
paved bike/pedestrian path does provide access to views of the Bay and the
hills beyond.
The wave action from boats approaching the Larkspur Ferry Terminal has
caused some shoreline erosion. Ferries now reduce their speeds as they
approach and leave the terminal, mitigating the problem.
Railroad Right-of-Way
The former Northwestern Pacific Railroad right-of-way paralleling Holcomb
and William Avenues and the Redwood High School marsh is also a
valuable urban open space area. Since abandonment of the line for railroad
use, the property has become overgrown with blackberries, native willow,
wild rose, broom, and acacias. It is used informally for biking, walking, and
play. Any new development should provide for a permanent
bicycle/pedestrian path to replace the existing informal path. As of October
1990, a citizens' group was working to acquire this land for open space.
Parks
Larkspur's parks are discussed in Chapter 5, Community Facilities and
Services, pages 93-95. However, three City parks are unique in that they
serve more than recreational purposes. Piper Park, Remillard Park, and
Miwok Park each contain protected marshes and natural areas. The marshes
at Piper and Remillard Parks are discussed above.
Miwok Park on the slopes of the San Quentin Peninsula contains a manmade
reservoir, Tubb Lake, that has become a valuable biologic study resource for
the community. Tubb Lake is in need of dredging, and its cattails should be
cleared. The dam should also be assessed for stability. Lands adjacent to the
park which are designated for residential development could have an impact
on the Tubb Lake watershed the natural character of the park. There is an
existing lease at the park. It is crucial to enhance Tubb Lake and the
surrounding park to make it a functional public facility.
Open Space Goals, Policies, and Programs
Goal 1: Preserve and enhance a variety of open space features
including ridgelines, the wetlands along the Bay and the creeks, wildlife
habitats, view corridors, and other amenities which contribute to a
sense of openness in Larkspur.
Goal 2: Maintain Corte Madera and Southern Heights Ridges as
community separators.
Policy a: Work with local and regional open space agencies and interest
groups to develop an open space preservation strategy.
Action Program [1]: Map and rank open space features as to their value to
the community.
Action Program [2]: Support the efforts of the Marin County Open Space
District to acquire more open space in the Larkspur Sphere of Influence.
Action Program [3] Identify financing mechanisms to acquire privately
held lands designated for future open space.
Action Program [4]: Educate school children and the general public about
Larkspur's open space resources.
Policy b: Designate and preserve in open space the areas so shown on the
General Plan Land Use map. They include Those portions of the Northridge
that are above the 350-foot elevation, Baltimore canyon, the Piedmont and
Redwood Avenue areas, Big and Little King Mountains and their saddle
area, the Tubb Lake watershed, and the ridge above the old quarries on the
San Quentin Peninsula.
Policy c: Designate and preserve in Shoreline/Marsh Conservation area the
wetlands along Corte Madera Creek and at Piper Park, Redwood High
School, and the Larkspur Ferry Terminal, and the shoreline between East Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard and the Bay waters.
Action Program [5]: Rezone publicly-owned or dedicated open space areas
to appropriate zone districts that indicate that their potential for
development has been eliminated.
The Land Use and Circulation Plan designates the areas listed in Policies "b"
and "c" as Open Space, Shoreline/Marsh Conservation, or Parkland. Most of
these areas are in public ownership or are required to remain in open space
as conditions of development approval. However, except for the parkland,
the underlying zoning suggests there is potential for development (e.g., the
Northridge Preserve is zoned RMP, Residential Master Plan). In areas where
the potential for development has been eliminated, the zoning should reflect
a commitment to keeping the land open.
In the few remaining areas where development is allowed, Policies d-f and
Action Programs 6-10 apply:
Policy d: Allow low-intensity development on hillsides and near Corte
Madera Creek only if the design preserves natural features, such as
significant stands of trees, forested hillsides, riparian vegetation, marshlands,
wildlife habitats, ridgelines, and buffer zones.
Policy e: Encourage the use of cluster site plans for large parcels of land
provided the design will not be detrimental to the character and scale of the
community.
Clustering is the construction of buildings in closer groupings than usual
with the purpose of retaining open space areas. Common access points,
shared driveways, and the pooling of small yard spaces can create more
usable open space and other amenities than is possible with traditional
setbacks and access requirements. In those situations in which tradeoffs
between General Plan policies are required, the preservation of Larkspur's
unique community character should be given more weight than the objective
of clustering to achieve open space.
Action Program [6]: Require new development to preserve some natural
area.
Action Program [7]: If a development proposal requires the removal of
trees or other vegetation of significant resource value or adversely impacts a
wetlands area (as defined in implementing ordinances), require the
developer to replace the lost resources.
The Initial Study for each public or private project should indicate whether
the project will be located in or adjacent to wetlands or other natural habitat.
Where wetlands or other sensitive biologic resources are identified, studies
should be prepared by a qualified biologist to assess the impacts of the
project and to identify measures that will fully mitigate those impacts so that
the habitat values are preserved.
Action Program [8]: Avoid development in areas which contain rare or
endangered species of plants or animals.
Policy f: Increase visual access to the Bay and Corte Madera Creek.
Action Program [9]: Provide public spaces with views onto the Bay and
Corte Madera Creek.
Action Program [10]: Apply conditions of project approval that will
preserve or open up views of the Bay and Corte Madera Creek.
Policy g: Provide boating access to Corte Madera Creek and the Bay.
Action Program [11]: Maintain or improve the existing level of access to
Corte Madera Creek for the launching of small boats.
Larkspur and the Marin Rowing Club have worked out an agreement
whereby the club has built a clubhouse and dock on City land near the
Greenbrae (Sir Francis Drake) interchange. In return, the public can take
rowing classes and use the dock on weekends. (See also Chapter 5, page 94,
last paragraph, regarding this Joint Powers Agreement.)
Goal 3: Provide reasonable access to open space areas and trails
without adversely impacting natural habitats.
Policy h: Seek a balance between the recreational aspects of open space
and the need to protect wildlife and fragile vegetation from intrusion by
humans and domestic animals.
Action Program [12]: Provide a buffer zone between natural habitats and
human use areas (such as paths), and clearly mark the boundaries. Place
restrictions on access to these sensitive areas by pets.
The City will consider an ordinance to implement Action Program 12. The
ordinance should identify the purpose of the buffer zone, specify its size and
nature, and call for protection and enhancement of biological resources,
particularly wetlands, riparian streams, and creeks.
Action Program [13]: Provide hiking trails to connect Tubb Lake with the
ridge top, Larkspur Landing, and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.
Other Goals, Policies, and Programs relating to trails and paths are found in
the Chapter 8, Trails and Paths, on pages 158-163.
Goal 4: Protect open space and shoreline/marsh conservation areas
from degradation as a result of public facility needs such as roads,
sewers or flood control.
Policy i: Seek to balance the needs for community safety with the goal of
protection of the environment.
Action Program [14]: When dredging Corte Madera Creek, protect the
wetlands along the creek.
Action Program [15]: Plan future development of the ferry terminal so as
to minimize impact on nearby creek and marshland habitats.
WATER CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY
The City of Larkspur receives its water from the Marin Municipal Water
District (MMWD) which serves central and southern Marin County. Most
water consumers in Larkspur are connected to MMWD's Ross Valley
distribution system. This distribution system is fed by three transmission
lines which channel water chiefly from reservoirs on the slopes of Mount
Tamalpais but also from the Russian River through pipelines of the Sonoma
County Water Agency. Two of the lines come from Kentfield and run
through Larkspur along Magnolia Avenue. The third comes from Kentfield
along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard through Larkspur and on to San Rafael.
There are few problems with water service in Larkspur (Ron Theisen, Principal
Engineer, Marin Municipal Water District, May 1989).
The quality of water delivered by the MMWD is considered excellent. All
district water supplies meet current Environmental Protection Agency and
State of California health standards after treatment. In 1989, the MMWD
was planning some modifications to its two treatment plants to meet
proposed new federal and State standards. Larkspur's water is treated at the
Bon Tempe Treatment Plant above Phoenix Lake.
Water shortages are a perennial problem in central and southern Marin
County. The drought of 1987-89 drew further attention to the need for
intensive water conservation efforts. The MMWD developed public
awareness and voluntary water reduction campaigns. A computer assisted
program designed to help conserve water at sites with two or more acres of
turf and an automatic irrigation system produced significant results. A
majority of the households served by the district conserve water with low
flow showers and toilets, and low-water-use landscaping. Despite these
efforts, per capita water use has been increasing by about 0.6 percent per
year since the early 1970s (Water Supply Master Plan, Marin Municipal Water
District, October 1989).
In 1989, the MMWD placed a restriction on new water hook-ups as it
searched for additional long-term water supplies outside the area. A water
supply Master Plan, published in October 1989, recommended that the
district try to obtain additional supplies from Lake Sonoma on the Russian
River and the New Bullards Bar Reservoir on the Yuba River. This would
require agreements with the local water agencies and approval of the State
Water Resources Control Board.
Water Goals, Policies, and Programs
Goal 5: Reduce water consumption.
Policy j: Support the efforts of the Marin Municipal Water District to
reduce water consumption.
Action Program [16]: Require new and replacement public and private
landscaping to use drought tolerant plantings
Standards will be developed in an implementing ordinance.
Action Program [17]: Require the installation of water-conserving
plumbing fixtures in new buildings and when existing fixtures are replaced.
SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING
Garbage service in Larkspur is provided by Marin Sanitary Service. Garbage
is hauled to a landfill in Novato, but only after newspaper, cardboard, glass,
and metal have been removed for recycling. Recycling services are provided
by Marin Recycling, which is under the same ownership as the garbage
company. Marin Recycling picks up separated recyclable materials in
residential neighborhoods on the same day as regular garbage pickup. In
addition, Marin Recycling manually separates recyclable materials from
debris boxes and dumpsters delivered to its indoor resource recovery plant in
San Rafael. As a result of these aggressive recycling programs, 25 percent of
the County's waste stream is now diverted from landfill (Joe Garbarino, Marin
Sanitary Service and Marin Recycling, November 1989). Thus the County is already
in compliance with new state legislation that requires 25 percent diversion
by 1995. By 2000, 50 percent must be diverted.
Wood and brush are also separated from the garbage and reduced to
woodchips and sawdust. The woodchips are transferred to a co-generation
plant and burned to produce energy. Sawdust and sand are mixed to produce
topsoil.
Solid Waste Goals, Policies, and Programs
Goal 6: Reduce the total volume of the City's waste stream.
Policy k: Support programs to recycle paper, cardboard, glass, metal,
plastics, motor oil, and to compost or generate energy from tree prunings,
brush, and other vegetation.
Action Program [18]: Promote the use of goods containing recycled
materials through City purchasing policies and other efforts.
