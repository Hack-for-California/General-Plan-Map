City of Bradbury                                                  General Plan – 2012 – 2030 Update
Circulation –Transportation Element - Draft -                                          Revised-020514
              General Plan 2012-2030 Update
          Circulation-Transportation Element
Purpose
State statute requires that the General Plan Circulation-Transportation Element correlate directly
with the Land Use Element. The Circulation-Transportation Element also has direct relationships
with the mandated Housing, Open-Space, Noise and Safety Elements. The Circulation-
Transportation Element must address the following issues:
        •       Major thoroughfares
        •       Transportation routes
        •       Terminals
        •       Local public utilities and facilities
The purpose of the General Plan Circulation-Transportation Element is to plan adequate circulation
systems for the community’s residents. Circulation includes all facilities that direct and
accommodate motorized vehicles, bicycles and pedestrian movement. Transportation includes
accommodations for public and privately owned and operated buses, trains and aircraft. Not all
methods of transportation may be offered or available within the community. However, the
Circulation-Transportation Element will address or identify the systems that are available to the
community residents. Emphasis will be made to provide access to all public transportation systems
by the disabled. The Circulation-Transportation Element should also establish parameters for new
development to insure that minimum standards are met.
In 2008 the Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 1358 (Chapter 657) entitled “The California Complete
Streets Act.” This law requires that as part of their next substantive update to the Circulation
Element after January 1, 2011, local jurisdictions must plan for the development of multi-modal
transportation networks. Consistency between regional and local circulation and transportation
systems is essential. The coordinated regional and local circulation and transportation systems will
create the desired “Complete Streets Network” envisioned by AB 1358.
Providing a “Complete Streets Network” has a multitude of benefits that include streets designed for
safe travel including: bicycle and pedestrian facilities that promote and encourage users to engage
in healthy transportation alternatives. Availability of facilities that provide alternatives to the use of
motorized transportation can reduce miles traveled per day which correlates with air quality
improvements and the reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
The State of Californian legislature also enacted Assembly Bill 32 (AB-32) entitled “The Global
Warming Solutions Act of 2006”. The stated goal is to reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG)
to 1990 levels no later than the year 2020. Companion bill, Senate Bill 375 (SB-375), adopted in
2008, targets automobiles and light trucks for immediate Greenhouse Gas Emission reduction.
The City of Bradbury recognizes the benefits of reducing our dependency on automobiles to meet
our transportation needs. Residents are encouraged to use alternative modes of transportation.

Circulation –Transportation Element - Draft -                                       Revised-020514
This Circulation-Transportation Element is meant to be the foundation for the City’s commitment to
reducing “Vehicles Miles Traveled”. Future development should promote the ideals and principles
that would reduce the community’s reliance on the automobile.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
Future traffic volumes will not significantly increase over the next twenty years. Based on the 2009
National Household Travel Survey prepared by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the average
vehicle trips per day per household is 9.84. The accepted industry standard for computing the
number of vehicle trips per day per household is 10 trips.
The Land Use Element estimates the total potential increase in the number of dwelling units within
the City will be ninety seven (97). The maximum potential number of dwelling units at “Build-Out”
condition will be 497. The projected additional vehicle trips per day based on the “Build-Out”
condition would be nine hundred and seventy (970). The projected total number of vehicle trips per
day would then be 4,970 or approximately a 24% increase in the number of daily vehicle trips.
Regional Setting
The City of Bradbury is nestled against the San Gabriel Mountains northwest of the intersection of
the San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605) and the Foothill Freeway (I-210). Access ramps at Mount
Olive Drive, Buena Vista Street and Irwindale Avenue provide direct ingress and egress to the
freeway system.

Traffic Impacts: The primary traffic impact to Bradbury residents will occur as nearby communities
experience growth in commercial and industrial development. As nearby communities grow, traffic
will increase and the Level-of-Service (LOS) at surrounding arterial highway intersections will
decrease.
Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative indicator that is used to describe the operative conditions of a
roadway. Level of Service is computed using methods documented in the Transportation Research
Board Publication Highway Capacity Manual. For signalized intersections and all-way-stop-
controlled intersections (AWSC), delays in movement and LOS are reported as average values for
the entire intersection. For two-way-stop-controlled intersection (TWSC), the average delays and
LOS are reported for the “worst-case” movement. The definitions for the various Levels-of-Service
are described below:
1. LOS-“A” (Stable Flow) means free-flow conditions with negligible to minimal delays. Excellent
    progression with most vehicles arriving during the green phase and not having to stop at all.
    Nearly all drivers find freedom of operation.
2. LOS-“B” (Stable Flow) means good progression with slight delays. Short cycle-lengths typical.
    Relatively more vehicles stop than under LOS-“A”. Vehicle platoons are formed. Drivers begin to
    feel somewhat restricted within groups of vehicles.
3. LOS-“C” (Stable Flow) means relatively higher delays resulting from fair progression and/or
    longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear. The number of vehicles
    stopping is significant, although many still pass through without stopping. Most drivers feel
    somewhat restricted.
4. LOS-“D” (Approaching Unstable Flow) means somewhat congested conditions. Longer but
    tolerable delays may result from unfavorable progression, long cycle lengths, and/or high
    volume-to-capacity ratios. Many vehicles are stopped. Individual cycle failures may be
    noticeable. Drivers feel restricted during short periods due to temporary back-ups.
5. LOS-“E” (Unstable Flow) means Congested conditions. Significant delays result from poor
    progression, long cycle lengths, and high volume-to-capacity ratios. Individual cycle failures
    occur frequently. There are typically long queues of vehicles waiting upstream of the
    intersection. Driver maneuverability is very restricted.
6. LOS-“F” (Forced Flow) means jammed or grid-lock type operating conditions. Generally
    considered to be unacceptable for most drivers. Zero or very poor progression, with over-
    saturation or high volume-to-capacity ratios. Several individual cycle failures occur. Queue
    spillovers from other locations restrict or prevent movement.
A LOS of “A” refers to a roadway with little or no congestion, LOS “B” refers to very good operation
with some traffic congestion. LOS “C” refers to good operating roadways with light congestions and
minor delays. LOS “D” refers to a fair operating condition, with congestion and delay at intersection
approaches. LOS “E” refers to poor operating conditions with severe congestion and delay and LOS
“F” refers to a roadway that has jammed or severe stop-and-go traffic conditions.
The principal east-west arterial roadway serving Bradbury is Huntington Drive. Huntington Drive is
an improved four-lane arterial highway with raised, landscaped medians and separate left-turn
lanes. The City of Duarte, Circulation Element (November 2007) listed the Huntington Drive
roadway as being constructed to a capacity of 32,000 average daily trips (ADT). In November 2005,
Huntington Drive was operating at a capacity of between 23,000 and 28,000 ADT’s. The roadway
was operating at a LOS “C” (from Buena Vista east to Highland) and LOS “D/E” along the remaining
portions of the highway within the City of Duarte. Due to projected growth, the City of Duarte has
estimated that the conditions for Huntington Drive will continue to worsen. It is anticipated that the

Circulation –Transportation Element - Draft -                                       Revised-020514
Level of Service will be reduced to a LOS “D” from Buena Vista to Highland and a LOS “E/F” for the
remaining portions of the roadway.
Royal Oaks Drive, located in the City of Duarte, borders the City’s southern boundary and provides
east-west access for community residents as well as those just passing through the City of Duarte.
Royal Oaks Drive is a two lane local street with parking on both sides of the street in many
residential areas. It connects with Mount Olive Drive on the east and Mountain Avenue on the west.
The City of Duarte has determined that it has a capacity of 16,000 ADTs. The roadway operates at
a LOS of “A/B” with ADT volumes ranging from 7,610 to 10,650.
Mount Olive Drive provides north-south access to the City of Bradbury. Mount Olive Drive north of
Royal Oaks Drive is a long cul-de-sac street that provides the single point of access for many
Bradbury residents and residents living in the Duarte Mesa. Mount Olive Drive terminates at the
200 unit Duarte Mesa neighborhood.
Railroad Transportation Systems: Several railroad lines operate within the San Gabriel Valley,
ranging from light rail to freight rail.
The Metrolink commuter rail system is jointly operated by several regional transit agencies across
four counties and services both the northern and southern valley regions through two lines that
connect in downtown Los Angeles to the west and the Inland Empire to the east. Amtrak operates
interregional trains throughout Southern California, with a single station in the southern valley
located in the City of Pomona. For the City of Bradbury, the connecting link to this system is the
Metro Gold Line.
Metro Gold Line: Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority (Metro) operates the Gold Line light
rail train connecting the northwestern San Gabriel Valley to Downtown Los Angeles. In the vicinity
of Bradbury the track runs in the median of the I-210 freeway. The eastern terminus of the line is in
the City of Pasadena at Madre Street and the I-210. There is a large parking structure there for
commuters from the foothill communities, like Bradbury to use to ride the train into Downtown Los
Angeles. The nearest station is currently the Sierra Madre Villa Station in Pasadena, but Metro is
currently constructing an extension to the line into the City of Azusa, with the ultimate goal of
extending it even further to the eastern edge of the San Gabriel Valley. The light rail is a vital transit
link to the region and for the residents of Bradbury, providing access to downtown Los Angeles and
to other forms of transportation.
Air Transportation: There are no international or domestic airline service airports in the San
Gabriel Valley, although there are several general-aviation airports, including Brackett Field in La
Verne (east) and El Monte Airport in El Monte (south). There are however, several major airports
near the San Gabriel Valley which are easily accessible to Bradbury residents. Los Angeles
International Airport is located 39 miles southwest of the City and is accessible via-freeway and
transit. Ontario International Airport is located 28 miles east of the City and is easily accessible by
the I-210 and I-10 freeways. Burbank (Bob Hope) Airport is located 25 miles west of the City and is
easily accessible via the I-210 and I-5 freeways.
Mass Transit Bus Systems: There are no operating transit routes within the City of Bradbury. The
closest lines are located in the City of Duarte along Huntington Drive and include Foothill Transit
line 187 and Metro.

Foothill Transit operates the following routes through the City of Duarte:
Route No. 494 - Is a commuter route, traveling west to the El Monte Station where passengers
transfer to an express bus serving downtown Los Angeles via the I-10 freeway. To the east, the
route terminates at the San Dimas Park & Ride. This route operates on weekdays only.
Route No. 187 - This is a local bus route operating seven days a week. The schedule changes on
the weekend. This route will take you west to Pasadena and east to the Montclair Transportation
Center. The frequency of scheduled times during peak times is at intervals of 15 minutes.
Route No. 272 - This is a local bus route operating seven days a week. The schedule changes on
the weekends. This route originates in Duarte and travels southeast to The Plaza at West Covina
via the Baldwin Park Metrolink.
Schedules and information for these routes can be obtained from www.FoothillTransit.org.
Metro operates one route in Duarte. It originates at the City of Hope in Duarte. Information for this
route can be obtained by calling the Metro at 1-800-266-6883 or by visiting their website
at www.metro.net
Route No. 264 - This is a local route traveling west to Altadena via Santa Anita Fashion Park, and
the Sierra Madre Gold Line station. This route operates seven days a week. Schedule changes on
weekends.

Para-Transit: Monrovia Transit (Dial-a-Ride). The City contracts with the City of Monrovia to
provide a full demand-responsive transportation service. Dial-a-Ride provides curb-to-curb transit
service to the general public within the service area. The service area includes: City of Monrovia,
City of Bradbury, L.A. County unincorporated areas located south of Monrovia, Target (transfer
point to Duarte Transit) and Walmart in Duarte, Medical locations within a three (3) mile radius of
Monrovia's City limits, Methodist Hospital in Arcadia; medical offices on Duarte Road in Arcadia;
medical offices located in Duarte; and the City of Hope in the City of Duarte.
Local Setting
The City of Bradbury is comprised entirely of single-family residential detached dwelling units.
There are no retail commercial, industrial or multi-family uses of land within the City.
The community is comprised of lots that range in size from the traditional 7,500 square foot
rectilinear track configuration to large estate uniquely shaped parcels of land containing two to
seventy acres. The smaller lots including some 2-acre parcels have direct access to the public
street system. The 5-acre estate parcels and numerous 2-acre sized parcels are located within
gate guarded neighborhoods. These gate guarded neighborhoods have privately owned and
maintained streets.
There are no signalized intersections within the City. There are no arterial highways within the City.
All of the public and private streets are designated as local or local-collector streets. Lemon

Avenue, Royal Oaks Drive North and Mount Olive Drive collect all of the local traffic and direct it to
the arterial highways located in adjacent cities.
Bradbury is nearly “Built Out” therefore; a substantial increase in traffic generated within the
community is not expected. In 2010, the average vehicle miles traveled (VMT) was 4,191 miles per
year per service population. In comparison with similar sized cities such as La Canada Flintridge,
South Pasadena, Claremont, Glendora, and El Monte, Bradbury ranked fifth.
The 2010 Census concluded that the City of Bradbury contained 400 dwelling units. Using an
industry accepted planning standard of ten (10) vehicle trips per day per household the City’s
consulting traffic engineer estimated that 4,000 daily vehicle trips are generated for the entire
community. The traffic generating capacity of the City is easily and adequately handled by the local
public and private streets. The impact created by the City of Bradbury to the surrounding arterial
highway system is negligible. It is, however, noted that during the morning and evening peak traffic
hours the signalized intersections along Huntington Drive operate at a somewhat uncomfortable
level. Traffic accidents on the I-210 Freeway often result in the diversion of traffic to Huntington
Drive which further impacts the smooth flow of traffic along this and other major highways.
Recently the Bradbury City Council responded to residents’ concerns regarding speeding on the
steep Mount Olive Drive public street. Traffic calming improvements have been made to discourage
speeding. A pedestrian/equestrian trail was constructed on the west side of the street to separate
pedestrians from vehicular traffic. The capacity of the roadway has not been reduced and it
adequately accommodates the existing and projected traffic volume.

Emergency Access and Evacuation Plan. In accordance with the Disaster Mitigation Act of
2002, which requires each city to prepare a Natural Disaster Plan, the City of Bradbury adopted a
Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan on October 19, 2004. The Hazard Mitigation Plan addresses such
hazards as earthquakes, earth movements, flooding, wildfires and windstorms and multi-hazards, (a
combination of more than one hazard occurring at the same time). The plan is evaluated annually to
determine the effectiveness of its programs and to reflect changes in land development or
programs.
An important element of the Hazard Mitigation Plan is the Evacuation Plan. In the event of a
catastrophic event it is extremely important to evacuate the residents, their belongings and their
animals. Equally important is providing access to the hillside neighbors for emergency “First
Responders”. Police, Fire and Medical personnel and their equipment must have access to
minimally accessible hillside areas of the community. The following Emergency Access Plan has
been reviewed and approved by emergency personnel. Residents are advised of the plan and they
are encouraged to participate in making the roadways passable during an emergency.

Roadway Standards. The roadway classification system describes the standards for the design of
each classified roadway. All streets within the City are to be designed and constructed to meet the
adopted specifications. The only exception is unimproved fire lanes and utility roads. The City does
not regulate the design and construction of these types of roads.
The Bradbury Estates Community Services District (CSD) is responsible for the design, approval
and maintenance of the private streets located within its jurisdictional boundary. The City may
provide review and suggestions regarding the construction of new private streets within the Estates
upon request.
1. Collector Streets: A collector street is intended to facilitate traffic moving between arterial and
    local streets, generally providing direct access to properties. Collector Streets have a typical
    pavement width of 35 to 40 feet and contain two travel lanes (one in each direction) On-street
    parking is often permitted depending on the width of the roadway. Roadways classified as
    collector streets include: Mount Olive Drive, Royal Oaks Drive North, and Lemon Avenue.
2. Local Streets (Public): Local public streets provide direct access to individual properties and
    they are designed to discourage through-traffic. Local Streets have a typical pavement width of
    35 to 40 feet and contain two travel lanes. On-street parking is generally permitted. Roadways
    classified as local streets include: Mount Olive Lane, Elda Street, Freeborn Street, Oak Shade
    Road, Spring Point Drive, Gardi Street, Fairlee Avenue, Woodlyn Lane (the eastern portion
    only), Braewood Drive and Winston Avenue.
3. Local Streets (Private): Local streets (private) provide direct access to individual properties
    located within gate guarded neighborhoods. They are most often cul-de-sac streets and lanes.
    These private roadways are maintained either by a homeowners association or a community
    services district. The width of these roadways varies from 15 to 26 feet. On-street parking is
    generally prohibited. Streets included in this category are: Woodlyn Lane, Bradbury Hills Road,
    Bradbury Hills Lane, El Cielo Lane, Deodar Lane, Deodar Lane West, Sawpit Lane, Palm Hill
    Lane, Dove Tail Lane, Barranca Road, Sycamore Lane Oak Mountain Road, Starlite Drive,
    Ridge Drive, Circle Drive, Old Ranch Road, Bliss Canyon Road Oak Knoll Lane and Long
    Canyon Road
4. Fire Roads and Utility Lanes: Fire Roads and Utility Lanes are unimproved, non-paved
    roadways that vary in width. Public access is discouraged. Roadways included in this category
    include the Spanish Canyon Fire Road and the Flood Control Access Lane between the
    Bradbury Debris Basin and the Spinks Canyon Debris Basin.

Street Lights: The City of Bradbury has a “Dark Sky” policy. Street lights are not required on
private streets and roads. The City maintains street lights only on the public streets. The public
street system was designed and constructed without sidewalks. Certain recent improvements have
been made along the local collector streets in order to separate pedestrians from the lanes devoted
to motorized vehicles.
Public Utilities: Typical urban/suburban energy sources such as natural gas and electricity are
produced or generated well beyond the City limits of Bradbury.
•   Southern California Edison Company generates electricity in facilities located more than
    twenty-five miles from the City. Electricity is transmitted to the City and distributed to the single-
    family dwellings using a network of overhead utility poles and wires. Electricity use in Bradbury
    has been reported to be 17,652 kWh per residence per year. The Air Quality Control
    Management District (AQMD) estimates that the average household in Southern California uses
    7,300 kWh per year (20 kWh a day per household).
•   Southern California Gas Company; provides natural gas to the community. Natural gas is
    imported and distributed via underground pipes.
•   Verizon Telephone Company; provides landline telephonic communications to the community.
    The telephone communication system is a network of overhead poles and wires.
•   Time Warner Communications; provides a landline system that offers direct hard-wire
    connection for television services. Residents have the option of contracting with companies who
    provide wireless satellite television service.
•   California American Water Company; provides domestic potable water service to the
    community. The network of underground water mainlines also services the fire hydrants located
    throughout the community. A system of reclaimed water is being expanded each year as part of
    the water company’s public works program. The water company is aware of the importance of
    improving the availability of adequate fire flow. A collaborative effort between the City and the
    water company has resulted in various upgrades of the water system.
•   Los Angeles County Sewer Maintenance District; is responsible for maintaining the public
    sewer system within the City. Many of the dwelling units utilize private septic systems.
    However, as development proposals are submitted to the City the possibility of expanding the
    public sewer system is explored. The intent is to connect as many dwelling units as possible to
    the public sewer system.
•   Los Angeles County Flood Control District; is responsible for maintaining the public storm
    drain system. Concrete lined channels and large underground storm-drain pipes provide the
    backbone flood control network. Large agriculture parcels are required to retain surface run-off
    on-site. The existing storm drain system collects run-off from streets and small parcels of land.
Overview
As indicated in the Land Use Element, the City of Bradbury is almost entirely residential with the
exception of the City Civic Center and Royal Oaks Elementary school. Traffic movement
throughout the community flows easily and it is directed to arterial highways and freeways located
in adjacent communities.

The single source of traffic congestion occurs at the Royal Oaks Elementary School during peak
hours and the congestion is exacerbated during periods of inclement weather. A variety of
pedestrian/equestrian trails are located through the community.
A well used pedestrian trail is located in the City of Duarte adjacent to Bradbury’s southern
boundary. Residents have easy access to this trail through a trail system in Bradbury.
The Bradbury City Council has demonstrated a commitment to providing improved roadway and
trail facilities that are accessible to all residents.
Key Goals, Objectives, Policies and Action Programs
The Circulation-Transportation Element indicates the general location and extent of the existing
roadways and establishes standards for these roadways. The City has established the following
goals and policies for circulation and transportation in the City of Bradbury. The implementation
measures are contained at the end of the Chapter.
Circulation-Transportation Goals
     Circulation-Transportation Goal 1:                The Circulation-Transportation Element seeks to
                                                       maintain safe and efficient circulation systems that
                                                       do not impact the rural residential character of the
                                                       City.
     Circulation-Transportation Goal 2:                Maintain transit programs that do not exceed the
                                                       City’s annual transit funding allocation or budget.
     Circulation-Transportation Goal 3:                Inform residents of all available transit programs.
   Circulation-Transportation Goal 4:                  Support regional rail services such as the METRO
                                                       Gold Line light rail system.
     Circulation-Transportation Goal 5:                Promote traffic safety throughout the community
     Circulation-Transportation Goal 6:                Promote a “Dark Sky” development concept for all
                                                       circulation systems that is consistent with the City’s
                                                       rural character.

                   Health and Safety Element
The City of Bradbury Health and Safety General Plan Element consists of the combination of
the State required Noise Element and Safety Element. The required General Plan Elements
have been combined for clarity and to eliminate redundancy.
Noise Chapter
Purpose
The Noise Chapter of the Bradbury General Plan Health and Safety Element establishes
guidelines for controlling noise in the City. The Noise Chapter examines ·the characteristics and
effects of noise. It describes State and Federal guidelines relating to noise control. An
evaluation of the existing noise environment is included. This portion of the Health and Safety
Element contains a discussion of the anticipated future noise environment. The Chapter
identifies sensitive land uses and potential noise sources that may cause impacts.
As mandated by the California Government Code Section 65302(f), the Noise Chapter follows
the guidelines established by the State Office of Planning and Research. Local governments
must “analyze and quantify” noise levels and the extent of noise exposure through actual
measurement or the use of noise modeling. Technical data relating to mobile and point sources
must be collected and synthesized into a set of noise control policies and programs that
“minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive noise”. Noise level contours must
be mapped and the conclusions of the element used as a basis for land use decisions.
The Noise Chapter must include implementation measures and possible solutions to existing
and foreseeable noise problems. Furthermore, the policies and standards must be sufficient to
serve as a guideline for compliance with sound transmission control requirements. The Noise
Chapter directly correlates to the Land Use, Circulation, Housing and Community Resources
Elements. Pursuant to State requirements, the Noise Chapter must indicate noise levels from
traffic along major roads and highways. Noise contours are used to illustrate noise levels in
areas adjacent to major roadways. The noise contour map identifies existing noise levels in the
City and noise levels anticipated from projected traffic volumes.
This Chapter provides a framework within which future planning and noise-related decisions will
be made and implemented. Development and traffic have a direct bearing on noise in the local
environment. The community survey conducted as part of General Plan Update found that most
residents view the relatively quiet and noise free environment of the City as an important
amenity that must be preserved.
The Noise Chapter of the Health and Safety Element includes goals, policies and objectives that
will aid in the creation and maintenance of an acceptable noise environment for the City’s
residents. The single-family nature of the community is the use of land that creates the least
noise impacts. Although single-family dwellings create minimal noise generators it is important

City of Bradbury                                            General Plan 2012 – 2030 Update
Health and Safety Element – Draft -                                            Revised-020514
to review the surrounding uses of land that may cause concern to the community. In residential
areas such as Bradbury major contributors to noise are transportation, construction, garden
equipment, as well as human and animal services. Additionally, sensitive noise receptors have
been identified and goals and policies have been created to protect these uses from excessive
noise impacts.
Noise Chapter Objective
The objective of the Noise Chapter is to maintain and preserve the existing quiet and relative
noise free environment in the City. The effects of noise can be eliminated or reduced through
regulatory noise controls and responsible land use planning. Noise and land use guidelines
have been developed by State and Federal agencies including the Federal Highway
Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, the American National Standards Institute, and the State of California.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
California Planning Law requires that all elements of the General Plan be consistent. While each
of the General Plan elements could be characterized as independent documents, they are also
interrelated in the common goal of providing a long-range integrated plan for the ongoing
development of the City. The Noise Chapter of the Health and Safety Element is most directly
related to the Land Use, Circulation, Housing and Community Resources Elements.
Goals, objectives and policies set forth in all of the General Plan elements have been reviewed
and assessed for internal consistency.
Overview of Noise Element Issues
Noise is defined as any unwanted sound. Sound is defined in terms of loudness (amplitude) and
frequency (pitch). The standard unit of measurement for loudness is the decibel (dB). Since the
human ear is not equally sensitive to sound at all frequencies, a frequency-dependent rating
scale rates the level of noise to the sensitivity of the human ear. The A-weighted decibel scale
(dBA) discriminates against frequencies in a manner approximating to the sensitivity of the
human ear. Decibels are based on the logarithmic scale, in terms of human response to noise.
Everyday sounds normally range from 20 dB (very quiet) to 100 dB (very loud).
The Single Event Noise Exposure Level (SENEL) is the most appropriate noise level-duration
rating scale for a single noise event. The SENEL is given in decibels. The noise exposure level
of a single event measured over the time interval between the initial sounds to the final sound
for which it exceeds the threshold of acceptable noise level. A single event is a solitary
occurrence such as a train passing by or an aircraft flying overhead (overflight). Examples of
various sound levels due to varying activities are shown in Exhibit H-S Noise No. 1.

Cumulative noise measurements have been developed to assess community response to noise.
These scales attempt to include the loudness of each event, the duration of these events, the
total number of events, and the time of day that these events occur, into one single number
rating scale. The cumulative noise measurement includes the Equivalent Noise Level (Leq) and
the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). The Leq represents the average sound level
energy for a one-hour period and employs an A-weighted decibel correction, which corresponds
to the optimal frequency response of the human ear. CNEL is a 24-hour, time-weighted annual
noise level and is a measure of the overall noise exposure for a 24-hour period. So that, noise
levels during the evening (7 p.m. to 10 p.m.) are penalized by 5 dB and noise levels at night (10
p.m. to 7 a.m.) are penalized by 10 dB.
Environmental factors that impact noise levels include: wind direction and speed; temperature
and humidity; characteristics of the ground surface; and the presence of turf, shrubbery, and
trees. This is particularly true where the view of the target roadway is interrupted by isolated
buildings, bushes, scattered trees, or if the intervening ground is soft or covered with vegetation.
Another important factor is the location of the source or the receiver. If either the source or the
receiver is located more than three meters above the ground, the level of the intruding noise will
be affected. In an area which is relatively flat and free of barriers or impediments, the sound
resulting from a single source spreads in a spherical manner away from the source (similar to
the way waves are formed after a rock is thrown into a pond). The sound level decreases by six
decibels for each doubling of distance or 20-decibels for each factor of ten in distance. This
applies to fixed noise sources and mobile noise sources which are temporarily stationary, such
as an idling truck or other heavy equipment operating within a confined area (such as industrial
processes).
Characteristics of Traffic Noise
Generally, it can be shown that a 26 percent increase in traffic volume will cause a 1.0- dBA
increase in CNEL. Doubling the number of vehicles on a given route increases the adjacent
noise levels by 3.0-dBA, but changing the vehicle speed has an even more dramatic effect.
Increasing the vehicle speed from 35 to 45 mph raises the adjacent noise levels approximately
3.2- dBA. Reducing vehicle speeds from 35 to 30 mph decreases adjacent noise levels by 1.5-
dBA on major roadways. A speed decrease from 40 mph to 35 mph also reduces adjacent
noise levels by 1.6- dBA. Consequently, lowering motor vehicle speeds can have a significant
positive impact in terms of reducing adjacent noise levels.
Existing Noise Environment
Bradbury is exclusively zoned and developed with single-family residential detached dwelling
units. Outdoor noises generated from single-family residences are associated with yard and
agricultural grove maintenance, barking dogs, children playing, and other typical sounds
emanating from low density residential communities. Indoor noise includes appliances, music,
television as well as people and animals. Noise levels acceptable for commercial and industrial
uses in other communities are not acceptable for this residential community. The large parcels
have significant setbacks and they generally contain dense landscaping. The result is that
noises emanating from adjacent uses of land are adequately buffered for the most part. The
Irwindale Raceway located south of the City of Bradbury has been identified as a noise source
that has on occasion caused distress to some residents. The City of Irwindale and the Raceway
officials are aware of the noise impacts created by activities at the Raceway. Efforts have been

Health and Safety Element – Draft -                                               Revised-020514
made to reduce the offending noise. Dwelling units constructed within the past several decades
are well insulated and they use double and triple pane windows. These construction techniques
substantially reduce the level of sound within the interior of a dwelling unit.
The highest noise levels within the community can be found adjacent to major arterial roadways
located beyond the City’s boundary. Local collector streets such as Lemon Avenue, Royal Oaks
Drive North, Lemon Avenue and Mount Olive Drive are used by City and area residents during
the morning and evening peak traffic periods. Huntington Drive, a major arterial street, and the
I-210 and I-605 freeways are the significant sources of noise that have an impact on the
community. Both freeways are located to the south and beyond the City’s boundary. Since noise
travels upwards, the impact may be greater on those properties located close to the major
arterial roads and freeways and to dwellings located on the south-facing slopes.
Two types of noise sources have been considered: 1) stationary sources; and 2) mobile
sources. Stationary noise is attributed to air conditioning units, pool equipment, audio or
television usage. Non-Stationary or mobile noises are usually of short duration such as motor
vehicles, aircraft, railroads, lawnmowers and power tools. Air conditioning and pool equipment
noises can be reduced through design measures (placement and screening). The most
prevalent mobile noise source is vehicular traffic. The major sources of noise within the City are
associated with transportation-related activities: such as motor vehicles, aircraft, and railroads.
All of these significant mobile noise generators are located beyond the Bradbury City limits.
These sources include the Interstate I-210 and I-605 freeways and a railroad that is located
south of and parallel to the I-210 freeway. Aircraft arriving and departing the City of Los Angeles
Airport (LAX) are generally high enough and short enough duration so as to not create a noise
impact for the residents.
The major traffic noise includes vehicles operating on major arterials that serve the City
including Royal Oaks Drive (bordering the City) and Huntington Drive, Buena Vista Street,
Highland Avenue, and Duarte Road. Interstate I-210 freeway generates significant noise levels
since is it is a constant and consistent noise especially during peak traffic periods. The railroads
generate higher levels of noise but only for a short duration of time.
There are no industrial uses in close proximity to the residents of Bradbury. Noise
measurements taken along Mount Olive Drive and Royal Oaks Drive (City of Duarte General
Plan 2007) indicated that there was no noise level greater than 65 CNEL.
Controlled gate-guarded neighborhoods within the City restrict undesirable traffic and thus
reduce or eliminate significant traffic-related noise. Traffic related noise is minimal within the
community of Bradbury due to the lack of major arterial roadways. The Bradbury public street
system is comprised of local and collector streets only. Most dwellings located near the internal
collector streets and the exterior arterial highways are buffered from intruding noise through the
use of walls.
The average residential lot in the City of Bradbury is substantially larger than single-family
residential lots in adjacent communities. The larger parcels allow for landscape buffering and
significant separation between dwelling units and setbacks from local streets. The highest
ambient noise level in the community (64- dBA) is generated by traffic using Royal Oaks Drive
(located in the City of Duarte). Noise in this area is attributed to traffic south of the old Pacific
Electric Railroad right-of-way, which is also outside the Bradbury City limits.

To assess the existing noise environment, field measurements were taken at six locations in the
City (refer to Exhibit H-S Noise No.2). Two readings were taken at each location, one 10-minute
reading and one 1-minute reading. The results of the noise survey are summarized below in
Table HS Noise No.1. The highest noise levels are expected in the southern area of the City.
This is due to the higher density of development and the presence of through traffic in that area.
Development in these areas should be subject to detailed noise analysis when there is a
potential to exceed acceptable noise levels identified in the January 2014 analysis.
Future Noise Environment
The Land Use Plan for the City of Bradbury shows that the City will remain exclusively single-
family residential. This land use is not expected to result in any significant increases in local
traffic. Thus, future development under the provisions of the Land Use Plan is not likely to result
in any significant changes in the ambient noise levels of the community.
Residential development is a noise-sensitive use. Any development along major roadways in
the City shall be subject to noise evaluation to determine the need for specific noise control
measures, in order to achieve an acceptable noise environment. Land uses and activities which
may generate excessive noise shall also be regulated to prevent any adverse effect on the
City’s future noise environment.

The main source of noise in the City is traffic on roadways. Traffic noise affects noise-sensitive
land uses that may be located along and near these routes. Because of the primarily low density
residential nature of the City and the presence of many private roads, future development in
Bradbury is not expected to result in major increases in traffic volumes and noise along City
streets. Increases in traffic volumes on major roadways are expected to be generated by
development located outside the City. This will result in increased noise levels along selected
roadways. Table H-S Noise No.-2 presents the results of a noise modeling analysis based on

Noise Sensitive Land Uses
Land uses in Bradbury and the immediate area considered noise sensitive by the State of
California include: schools, hospitals, rest homes, and long-term care and mental care facilities.
There are no hospitals rest-homes or long-term medical or mental care facilities within the City
of Bradbury. The Royal Oaks Elementary School is located in the southeastern corner of the
City. The Be Royal Oaks (formally Royal Oaks Manor) retirement/assisted living care facility is
located on Royal Oaks Drive North, east of Braewood Drive. This facility is located adjacent to
the City of Bradbury in an unincorporated portion of Los Angeles County.
Noise Mitigation Plan
Transportation noise is the prevalent noise issued faced by Bradbury residents. Traffic using
arterial highways and freeways located beyond the City’s jurisdiction poses the most significant
noise generator that can impact the City’s tranquil and peaceful environment. Peak a.m. and
p.m. traffic periods generate the most noise. Local governments have little direct control of
transportation noise at the source. State and Federal agencies have the responsibility to control
vehicle noise emission levels. The most effective methods cities have to mitigate transportation
noise on their communities are by use of effective site planning and the construction of noise
barriers.
Noise impacts can be mitigated in three basic ways: 1) reduce the sound level of the noise
generator; 2) increase the distance between the source and the receiver; and 3) insulate the
receiver. People must be protected from excessive noise from non-transportation sources.
These impacts are most effectively controlled through the application of the City’s Noise
Ordinance and the City’s development design guidelines.

Health and Safety Element – Draft -                                            Revised-020514
Existing Noise Regulations. The primary objective of the City of Bradbury Noise Element is to
maintain and preserve the existing noise free environment. As indicated previously, the effects
of noise can be eliminated or reduced through regulatory noise controls and responsible land
use planning. Noise and land use guidelines have been developed by State and Federal
agencies including the Federal Highway Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency,
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the American National Standards Institute,
and the State of California.
Noise Control Act In 1972, the Noise Control Act authorized the US Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to publish descriptive data on the effects of noise and establish levels of sound
"requisite to protect the public welfare with an adequate margin of safety." These levels are
separated into health (hearing loss levels) and welfare (annoyance levels) with an adequate
margin of safety. In March 1974, the EPA published information on Levels of Environmental
Noise Required to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety (EPA
550/9-74.004). According to this publication, 55- dB Ldn is described as the required maximum
noise level to provide an adequate margin of safety for areas with outdoor uses including
residences and recreational areas. The EPA report does not establish standards, specifications
or regulations, but identifies safe levels of environmental noise exposure without consideration
for the costs to achieve these levels.
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) The FHWA adopted and published noise abatement
criteria for Federally-funded highway construction projects. The FHWA noise abatement criteria,
basically, establishes an exterior noise goal of 67- dBA Leq for residential land uses and an
interior goal of 52- dBA Leq for dwellings.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) The Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) has adopted environmental criteria and standards for determining
project acceptability and necessary mitigation measures to ensure that projects assisted by
HUD provide a suitable living environment. The standards include noise limits of 65- dB Ldn for
residential areas.
California Streets and Highways Code Division 1, Chapter 1, Article 6 of this Code requires
State funded noise abatement programs for freeway construction or use which will result in
noise levels exceeding 55- dBA Leq or 52- dBA Leq at existing classrooms, libraries, multi-
purpose rooms, and pupil personnel services of public and private elementary and secondary
schools. The noise abatement program may include acoustical treatment, elimination of
windows, air conditioning, sound buffer structures and other mitigation measures.
Sound Transmission Control Standards in the California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 2
commonly refered to as the California Building Code and the California Green Building
Standards Code (California Code of Regulations Title 24, Part 11) establish the minimum
standards for construction to include remodeling for a variety of dwelling occupancies to include
single-family detached residential buildings.
California Motor Vehicle Code The State of California has adopted noise standards for areas
not regulated by the federal government. State standards regulate noise levels of motor vehicles
and motor boats, establish noise impact boundaries around airports, regulate freeway noise
affecting classrooms, sound transmission control, occupational noise control, and identify noise

insulation standards. The California Motor Vehicle Code sets operational noise limits according
to the type of vehicle and date of manufacture.
City Noise Ordinance The City of Bradbury adopted a Noise Ordinance to establish acceptable
noise levels generated on private property in residential neighborhoods. It is designed to control
unnecessary, excessive and annoying sounds generated from stationary sources that may
impact adjacent property. It differentiates between environmental and nuisance noise.
Environmental noise is measured under a time average period while nuisance noise cannot
exceed the established Noise Ordinance levels at any time. Chapter 9.06.110 of the Bradbury
Development Code establishes controls regarding unnecessary, excessive and annoying noise.
No person shall create or allow the creation of noise on any residential property which causes
the noise level to exceed the actual measured median ambient noise level, or the following
presumed ambient noise level, whichever is greater.

Key Noise Goals, Objectives, Policies and Action Programs
The City’s Noise Control Ordinance provides a means to enforce the existing quiet, noise free
environment. The City will continue to:
   •   Incorporate measures into future residential projects which attenuate exterior noise
       levels in outdoor activity areas to a maximum of 65 CNEL and interior noise levels to a
       maximum CNEL of 45 dB.
   •   Establish through the design review process that schools are located and designed so
       that they comply with the acoustical criteria promulgated by the California Collaborative
       for High Performance Schools (CHPS).
   •   Enforce State vehicle noise regulations (Section 23130, 23130.5, 27150, 27151 and
       38275 of the California Vehicle Code) to curtail the use of vehicles equipped with illegal
       or faulty exhaust systems and “hot rods” exhibiting tire squeal or excessive exhaust
       noise.
   •   Enforce the California Noise Insulation Standards (Title 24 California Building Code) for
       dwellings to ensure an acceptable maximum interior noise level of 45 CNEL in habitable
       rooms, and maintain adequate noise insulation.
   •   Strictly enforce acoustical privacy, consistent with the California Noise Insulation
       Standards and all existing and future requirements outlined in the State Housing Code,
       for residential construction.
   •   Prohibit roosters and peacocks in the City.

Safety Chapter
Purpose
The Bradbury General Plan Health and Safety Element is comprised of two State mandated
general plan elements (Noise and Safety). The Safety Chapter of the Health and Safety
Element focuses on those elements of risk to the residents that should be considered in current
and future development planning.
The purpose of the Safety Chapter is to protect the community from any unreasonable risks
associate with the effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure,
tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides;
subsidence, liquefaction, and other seismic hazards identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8
(commencing with Section 2690) of Division 2 of the Public Resources Code, and other hazards
known to the legislative body; including flooding; and wildland and urban fires.
The Safety Chapter of the Health and Safety Element includes mapping of known seismic and
other geologic hazards. It also address evacuation routes, peakload water supply requirements,
and minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those items relate to identified
fire and geologic hazards.
This Safety Chapter is the primary vehicle for relating local safety planning with the City's land
use decisions. The City has established land use policies, standards, and designations based
on among other things the criteria set forth in this Safety Chapter. Additionally, local decisions
related to zoning, subdivisions, and entitlement permits, for example, will be tied to the Safety
Chapter’s identification of hazards and hazard abatement provisions. The City of Bradbury
Safety Chapter examines those issues related to protecting the community from any
unreasonable risks associated with earthquakes, slope instability, flooding, and fire. The
Chapter also indicates design standards, such as peakload water supply requirements;
minimum road widths; and clearances around structures. Finally, the Safety Chapter indentifies
evacuation routes and emergency reception centers.
Safety Chapter Objective
Hazards affecting the City of Bradbury can be divided into two major categories: 1) naturally
occurring hazards; and 2) manmade hazards. Naturally occurring hazards include earthquakes,
wildland fires, floods, and slope failure. Chemical contamination, structural fires, transportation
accidents and air and water pollution are examples of manmade hazards.
The objective of the Safety Chapter is to enable the City to be sensitive to those natural and
manmade hazards in future decision making and to be able to respond in a timely manner in the
event of an emergency. As a result, the following principle serves as the framework for the City
of Bradbury Safety Chapter: Public safety is the focus of the emergency preparedness plan
which emphasizes the risks associated with earthquakes, wildfire, flooding, and other manmade
and natural hazards. In response to the principle, the Safety Chapter provides the foundation for
a detailed inventory of those risks that need to be considered. This Chapter also establishes
standards related to public safety.

Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
California Planning Law requires that all elements of the General Plan be consistent. While all of
the General Plan Elements are independent, they are also interrelated. Certain goals and
policies of one element may also address items that are issues of other elements. This
integration of issues throughout the General Plan creates a strong basis for the implementation
of plans, programs and achievement of community goals. The Safety Chapter is most directly
related to Land Use and Circulation Elements and the Conservation and Open Space Chapters.
Related Agencies, Laws and Plans
The following State mandates impact planning and development:
Colbey-Alquist Floodplain Management Act. The Colbey-Alquist Floodplain Management Act
encourages local governments to plan, adopt and enforce land use regulations for floodplain
management, in order to protect people and property from flooding hazards. This Act also
identifies requirements which jurisdictions must meet in order to receive State financial
assistance for flood control.
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act. The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act
requires the state Geologist to identify earthquake fault zones along traces of both recently and
potentially active major faults. Cities and counties that contain such zones must inform the
public regarding zone location.
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act. Pursuant to the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act, the state
Geologist compiles maps identifying seismic hazard zones. Development in seismic hazard
areas is subject to policies and criteria established by the State Mining and Geology Board.
Additionally, approval of development on a site within a seismic hazard area mandates the
preparation of a geotechnical report and local agency consideration of compliance with
applicable state requirements.
Landslide Hazard Identification Program. The Landslide Hazard Identification Program
requires the state Geologist to prepare maps of potential landslide zones within urbanizing
areas.
Fire Hazards. The threat of wildfires in foothill areas in Southern California has been of concern
for many years. Recognizing that this concern throughout the State, in 2012 the Legislature
adopted SB 1241 which requires communities to protect themselves against wildland and urban
fires by addressing the fire risk in areas of State responsibility and areas designated very high
fire hazard severity zones.
Overview of Safety Chapter Issues
The City of Bradbury has attempted to identify and analyze natural and manmade hazards and

Fire Hazards.       The threat of wildfires in foothill areas in Southern California has been of
concern for many years. Very high risk for wildfire is evident in areas having steep slopes that

are covered with chaparral vegetation and where there is limited access for fire control
equipment. Low risk areas are developed urban areas where fire access is readily available and
the terrain is relatively flat. Industrial areas, hazardous material users, structures with
substandard electrical wiring, overhead high voltage power lines, and high pressure gas lines
are examples of urban fire hazards.
In order to facilitate immediate firefighting response, the City should have the following
standards for areas that are located in high or very high fire hazard severity zones:
    •    There should be sufficient access routes and roads for emergency vehicles and for the
         evacuation of residents from all areas.
    •    Adequate access should be provided for all developed areas. All roadways to hazard
         areas should be of sufficient width to accommodate fire-fighting equipment. Streets
         should be marked and addresses should be posted in plain view. Adequate water supply
         should be available and adequate for fire suppression activity.
The County of Los Angeles Fire Department has identified virtually all of the City of Bradbury as
a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone. All development within this zone should comply with the
standards set forth in the Fire Department’s Fuel Modification Plan. The three primary
components needed to reduce fire losses are:
         1. Implementing building construction methods that reduce building fire hazards,
         2. Providing adequate defensible space around structures to reduce fuel; and
         3. Identifying areas where there is a significant risk and a history of significant losses.
Good defensible space around structures allows adequate area for firefighters to fight a fire and
avoid injury to personnel and equipment. Terrain, climate conditions, and vegetation interact to
affect fire behavior.
Government Code Sections 51175 through 51189 direct the California Department of Forestry
and Fire Protection (CDF) to map areas of significant fire hazards based on fuels, terrain,
weather, and other relevant factors. These zones, referred to as Fire Hazard Severity Zones
(FHSZ), define strategies to reduce the risk associated with wildland fires. As part of this
mapping effort, areas designated for management by CDF are identified as State Responsibility
Areas (SRA). Areas managed by local fire departments are identified as Local Responsibility
Areas (LRA).
The majority of the City of Bradbury is located within a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone
established by the County of Los Angeles Fire Department and reflected on Exhibit H-S Safety
No. 1. The entire City lies within a Local Responsibility Area (LRA). Public Resource Code
(PRC) section 4291 requires that homeowners provide fuel modification to 100 feet around their
buildings to create a defensible space for firefighters and to protect their homes from wildfires.
Residents must reduce dry fuel around the perimeter of any structure and comply with the
adopted codes that provide standards for mitigating fire hazards.

Bradbury’s location at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains creates an urban/wildland interface
that makes Bradbury more susceptible to wildfires than cities that do not border the foothills.
During community workshops many residents expressed their concern that safety and
preparedness were the highest priority for the community.
Historic Wildfires in the City of Bradbury
1953 Duarte Fire This fire originated between Spinks Canyon and Maddock Canyon in wildland
area. A total of 561 acres burned in this fire.
1958 Norum Fire This fire burned in the foothills north of Monrovia, Duarte, Bradbury and Azusa.
A total of 6,440 acres burned in the Norum Fire.
1980 Stable Fire On November, 16, 1980 a fire storm that had been fanned by Santa Ana Wind
conditions swept down from the foothills and destroyed 35 homes in the City of Duarte and 14
homes in the City of Bradbury. Reports indicated that the fire had moved from the City of Azusa,
east of the San Gabriel River to the Duarte and Bradbury homes in 8 to 10 minutes, due to a
strong shift in winds. Immediately after the fire, city and county personnel began taking measures

to deal with the devastation. A Disaster Assistance Center was established at Duarte City Hall
and Federal and State agencies were contacted for help. The Los Angeles County Fire District set
up a mobile command center and the City of Duarte set up an emergency shelter. In the weeks
that followed the fire, the City established several programs to deal with possible floods and
mudslides that could occur due to the bare slopes where all vegetation had been burned off. Mud
diversion structures were constructed, sandbags were distributed, and parking was restricted on
streets with potential slides.
2009 Station Fire Since the Stable Fire other large wildland fires have occurred in the
surrounding communities near Bradbury. The largest being the Station Fire of 2009. The Station
Fire was the 10th largest wildfire in California history, burning 160,577 acres and killing two
firefighters since it began in late August. The fire started in the Angeles National Forest near
the U.S. Forest Service ranger station on the Angeles Crest Highway (State Highway 2). The
blaze threatened 12,000 structures in the National Forest and the nearby communities of La
Cañada Flintridge, Glendale, Acton, La Crescenta, Littlerock, Pasadena and Altadena, as well as
the Sunland and Tujunga neighborhoods of the City of Los Angeles. The fire was predicted to
burn for months and travel miles to the City of Azusa behind the City of Bradbury. The Station Fire
burned on the slopes of Mount Wilson, threatening numerous television, radio and cellular
telephone antennas on the summit, as well as the Mount Wilson Observatory, which includes
several historically significant telescopes and multi-million-dollar astronomical facilities operated
by UCLA, USC, UC Berkeley and Georgia State University. In October 2009, the fire went out due
to a fall rainstorm.
Flood Hazards          The potential for flooding is generally described in terms of a statistically
projected frequency. For example, a 100-year flood has a 1.0 percent chance of occurring in a
given year, while a 500-year flood is one which has a 0.2 percent chance of happening in any
given year. A 500-year flood would be slightly deeper and cover a greater area than a 100-year
flood. The San Gabriel River lies east of the City of Bradbury, and it is designed to contain a
100-year flood. The river is fully operational and is maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and the Los Angeles County Flood Control District. The construction of San Gabriel
River improvements in 1947 reduced the local area's risk of flooding. Los Angeles County
Drainage Area studies performed by the Army Corps of Engineers have shown no deficiencies
along the San Gabriel River. The elevated nature of the City removes Bradbury from flood
danger from the San Gabriel River.
The San Gabriel River is the central backbone of the San Gabriel River Watershed. The
watershed for the San Gabriel River is one of several coastal watersheds in Southern California
that drain hundreds of square miles of mountainous and urban lands to the Pacific Ocean. The
character of the river changes dramatically along its 58-mile journey from Cogswell Dam (near
the headwaters in San Gabriel Mountains) to its mouth at the Pacific Ocean. On its run to the
sea, the San Gabriel River passes through 19 different cities. A network of dams and flood
control measures controls the San Gabriel River. The natural water cycle and flow are
significantly altered to protect adjacent communities from flood damage and to better use local
water resources for urban and agricultural water supplies.
Serious flooding has not been a problem in Bradbury because the low density residential
development has permitted the retention of natural ground cover which retards serious floods. In
addition to the natural ground cover, the Bradbury Debris Basin and the Spinks Debris Basin
and check dams, maintained by the Los Angeles County Flood Control District, also provide the

City with protection from large scale floods. A series of concrete lined channels and
underground storm drains exist within and around the perimeter of the City. These backbone
storm drain facilities are maintained by the Los Angeles County Flood Control District. The
City’s large agriculturally zoned and developed parcels either retain surface run-off on-site or it
is directed to the public facilities by a system of privately owned and maintained drainage
swales. Minor occurrences concerning water runoff occurred in the past during extremely wet
years, however privately owned improvements have been made to rectify the local flooding
issues. These minor flooding problems tend to be localized and primarily relate to very small
mudslides and small erosion problems in areas where the natural topography had been altered.
Much of the soil in Bradbury Canyon is of an alluvium base material and it is susceptible to
runoff problems if the natural ground cover has been removed and not replaced with
landscaping or other mitigating measures. The City maintains a policy of investigating any
localized runoff or mudslide problems through the assistance of the City Engineer and the Los
Angeles County Department of Public Works.
Since the City of Bradbury has not been studied by the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP) to ascertain flood hazards, it is difficult to estimate if there is an area that might be at risk
of flooding. The City’s history does not contain any reports of catastrophic flooding that would
endanger resident’s health or safety. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) designated
Bradbury as “Zone D” which means that no analysis of flood hazards has been conducted.
Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements do not apply, but coverage is available.
Geologic Hazards            The City of Bradbury is situated along the foothills of the San Gabriel
Mountains, west of the San Gabriel River as reflected on Exhibit H-S Safety No. 2.
Geographically, the San Gabriel Mountain Range is made up of two roughly parallel ranges.
The northern, inland range extends from Mt. Gleason eastward past the 9,000-ft. summit of Mt.
Waterman and Baden-Powell and terminates near the only summit over 10,000-ft. (Mt. San
Antonio or Old Mt. Baldy). The range’s major watershed is the San Gabriel River who’s three
main forks and countless tributaries drain approximately 20 percent of the precipitation in the
mountains.
There are geologic conditions within and around the City of Bradbury that could cause problems
if proper precautions are not taken. The northern mountainous areas of the City are generally
too steep and bedrock is too unstable for typical construction. Erosion, landslides and ground
shaking from earthquakes can be severe hazards within these areas. Exhibit H-S Safety No. 3
identifies the portions of the City of Bradbury that are susceptible to landslide and liquefaction.
Landslides       Geologic hazards in the City of Bradbury include the potential for landslides,
erosion, and debris flow and liquefaction in areas with loose soils and high water tables.
Landslide hazards may involve relatively intact, dense bedrock materials or highly fractured and
broken, jumbled bedrock. Landslides often occur along pre-existing zones of weakness within
the bedrock. Local folding of the bedrock adds to the potential for slope failure. However, many
landslides do not seem to be controlled by the position of the bedding rock relative to the
topography but by other factors such as rock type and its attendant characteristics (density of
jointing and fracturing). Landslides have been known to occur in the northern steep sections of
the City. Other areas of the City may experience landslides should conditions change that
adversely affect slope stability.

Health and Safety Element – Draft -                                                Revised-020514
Erosion Hazard Erosion is the natural process by which earth materials are loosened,
worn away, decomposed, or dissolved, and transported to another site. Precipitation, runoff,
running water, and wind are common agents of erosion. The potential for erosion is generally
low in exposed natural slopes but it greatly increases when slopes have been denuded of all
ground cover and vegetation. Barren slopes are more susceptible to erosion and subject to riling
or raveling.
The potential for debris flow depends primarily on the presence of Colluvium deposits upstream
and the increase in soil moisture due to heavy rainfall. A debris flow is a fast moving, liquefied
landslide of unconsolidated, saturated debris that looks like flowing concrete. It is differentiated
from a mudflow in terms of the viscosity and textural properties of the flow. Flows can carry
material ranging in size from small stones to large boulders. Often debris flows contain large
amounts of woody debris such as logs and tree stumps. The soil known as Colluvium is loose
bodies of sediment that have been deposited or built up at the bottom of a low-grade slope or
against a barrier. The deposits that collect at the foot of a steep slope or cliff are also known by
the same name. The Bradbury and Spinks Canyon Debris Basins control debris flows.
Seismic Hazards            The U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific
information regarding natural hazards and disasters within the United States in order to protect
and save lives. Geologic events and seismic activity in particular, are the primary natural
hazards of the community. Earthquakes are caused by violent and abrupt releases of strain built
up along faults. When a fault ruptures, energy is released in all directions from the source, or
epicenter, in the form of seismic waves. Earthquakes generate two types of hazards. Primary
hazards are ground shaking and surface rupture along faults. Secondary hazards result from
the interaction of ground shaking with existing ground instabilities and include: liquefaction,
settlement, and landslides.
The City of Bradbury is located in a seismically active region and in an area of potential fault
rupture, strong ground shaking, and slope instability. These geologic and seismic hazards can
affect the integrity of structures and utilities, and in turn can cause severe property damage and
potential loss of life. In California, faults are common, ranging from small breaks of an inch or
less, to the significant breaks experienced along the San Andreas Fault which extends for
hundreds of miles. In addition to size, the age of a fault has a direct bearing on the likelihood of
generating an earthquake. Many large faults have not moved for millions of years and are
considered “dead” or inactive.
The two principal seismic considerations for most cities in Southern California are damage to
structures due to seismically induced ground shaking and surface rupture along active fault
traces. Strong ground motions could have a major impact on the City of Bradbury due to the
proximity and earthquake potential of nearby active faults. The local geologic and topographic
conditions of Bradbury’s location at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains could either amplify
or attenuate the seismic waves. Surface ruptures could also have a major impact on the City of
Bradbury. Surface ruptures occur during an earthquake when movement along an active fault
breaks the ground surface.
The City of Bradbury contains two earthquake faults (Exhibit H-S Safety No. 3). The Sierra
Madre Fault extends through the major portion of the Bradbury along the base of the San

Gabriel Mountains. The Duarte Fault extends across the southern portion of Bradbury and
bisects an unincorporated County island. The Duarte fault is actually a “segment” of the Sierra
Madre Fault. Movement along these frontal faults has resulted in the uplift of the San Gabriel
Mountains. Seismic activity is expected to be a maximum of 7.2 magnitude.
The Sierra Madre-Cucamonga Fault Zone includes several fault segments extending for over 86
miles along the southern margin of the San Gabriel Mountains. The two main portions of the
Sierra Madre-Cucamonga Fault Zone include the Sierra Madre fault to the west and the
Cucamonga fault to the east. The fault zone is inclined to the north, dipping below the San
Gabriel Mountains and uplifting them above the Los Angeles Basin. The fault zone was
responsible for the 1971 6.6 magnitude San Fernando earthquake on its westernmost segment
near the City of Sylmar. The Sierra Madre fault passes through the northern portions of
Pasadena, Arcadia, Monrovia, Bradbury, Duarte, Azusa, and portions of San Dimas. The
locations of the regional faults are shown in Exhibit H-S Safety No. 2.
The Sierra Madre fault zone is divided into five main segments, labeled with the letters A
through E, to more easily characterize this fairly complex system. It was not the fault
responsible for the 1991 Sierra Madre earthquake.

is the A segment, also known as the Vasquez Creek fault, which runs between the San Gabriel
fault and the intersection of the B and C segments of the Sierra Madre fault zone. At the junction
of the C and D segments, the Clamshell - Sawpit Canyon fault splays off from the fault zone,
toward the northeast (shown in sea green on the map above). It was this fault, not the Sierra
Madre fault zone itself, that ruptured to produce the Sierra Madre earthquake of 1991.
One of the strands that make up segment D is known as the Duarte fault, because of its location
near that community. Segment E represents the easternmost part of this fault zone, and at its
eastern end, it meets up with several other faults in a complex zone northwest of the City of
Upland, near the epicenter of the 1990 Upland earthquake. The general trend of the Sierra
Madre fault zone continues eastward from this point along the base of the San Gabriel
Mountains, but this eastern continuation is known as the Cucamonga fault zone. The
Cucamonga fault zone seems to be more active, (has a higher slip rate) than the Sierra Madre
fault zone.
Faults are continuously being found by geologists/seismologists within the region. These
scientists have identified almost 100 faults in the Los Angeles area that are suspected of being
capable of generating earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.0 or greater. Included within the newly
discovered faults are faults classified as “blind thrusts”. These faults do not reach the ground
surface but do connect many of the known surficial faults at depth and under virtually the entire
Los Angeles, San Fernando and San Gabriel Basins. When a fault ruptures energy spreads in
the form of seismic waves. Energy waves travel through the earth’s crust and eventually reach
the ground interface creating surface waves which cause the ground to vibrate up and down
and side to side. The City of Bradbury may experience some or all of the hazards associated
with seismic waves including ground rupture, ground shaking, landslides, flooding, and
liquefaction.
Ground Rupture represents the primary hazard associated with earthquake since it is the
initial result of seismic events. Surface rupture poses a difficult seismic problem from an
engineering standpoint, because it is far more expensive and complicated to design a
foundation and structure to withstand the displacement of even fractions of a foot than to build
without consideration of ground rupture. Such ground fractures can cause parallel displacement
in the foundation, causing buildings to crack and split. Development should be avoided in areas
of high fault potential.
Ground Shaking The most significant earthquake action in terms of structural damage and
loss of life is ground shaking. Ground shaking is the movement of the earth’s surface in
response to a seismic event. The intensity of the ground shaking and the resultant damages are
determined by the magnitude of the earthquake, distance from the epicenter and characteristics
of surface geology. This hazard is the primary cause of the collapse of buildings and other
structures. Increased hazards from earthquakes occur when the seismic activity occurs in a
highly urbanized area. The significance of an earthquake’s ground shaking action is directly
related to the density and type of buildings and the number of people exposed to its effect.
Liquefaction is a phenomenon involving the loss of shear strength of soil. Liquefaction
involves a sudden loss in strength of saturated, cohesion soil (mostly sand) which is caused by
shock or strain, such as generated by an earthquake and results in temporary transformation of
the soil to fluid mass. If the liquefying layer is near the surface the effects are much like that of

Health and Safety Element – Draft -                                               Revised-020514
quicksand on any structure located on it. If the layer is in the subsurface, it may provide a sliding
surface for the material above it.
Liquefaction typically occurs in areas where the groundwater surface is less than 30 feet below
the grounds surface and where the soils are composed of soft fine sand. There are several
liquefaction zones located in the northern and eastern portions of the City of Bradbury. During
and after a severe rain event, liquefaction could occur should a moderate severe earthquake
take place.
Although, Bradbury has not experienced measurable ground failure due to an earthquake in
recent years, the potential for damage due to ground failure is still present. Past seismic events
indicate that the City of Bradbury has been free of major damaging earthquakes for at least 130
years. However, a number of historic earthquakes have affected the City in varying degrees
from nonstructural damage (toppling of building contents) to minor structural damage (cracks in
swimming pools).
A major earthquake occurring in or near Bradbury may cause injuries and even death, extensive
property damage, fire, hazardous spills and other hazardous effects that could be aggravated by
aftershocks and by the secondary effects of fire, hazardous materials/chemicals accidents and
possible failure of waterways and dams.
Seiches, or periodic oscillations ("sloshing") of bodies of water such as ponds, lakes, and
bays, usually occur in moderate to great earthquakes. Seiches may raise and lower a water
surface from a few inches to several feet, and may occur several thousand miles away from the
earthquake epicenter.

Safety and Emergency Preparedness Plan
The two existing emergency response plans, the Los Angeles County Disaster Relief Manual
and Basic Emergency Operations Plan, provide the tools to coordinate the disaster recovery
operations of County fire control and law enforcement agencies with local agencies and
governments. The City currently has a number of ordinances, programs and requirements in
existence pertaining to seismic and fire hazards. Primary among these are the subdivision and
building permit approval requirements for seismic strengthening and adequate access. The
State Office of Emergency Services has established three levels of emergency response to
peacetime emergencies, which are based on the severity of the situation and the availability of
local resources in responding to that emergency. The three levels of emergency response
include:
     •   Level 1:   A minor-to-moderate incident wherein local resources are adequate in
                    dealing with the current emergency;
     •   Level 2:   A moderate-to-severe emergency where local resources are not adequate in
                    dealing with the emergency and mutual aid assistance would be required on
                    a regional or statewide basis.
     •   Level 3:   A major disaster where local resources are overwhelmed by the magnitude of
                    the disaster and State and federal assistance are required.
Each potential hazard to the public safety has been assessed according to the following levels
of risk:
     •   Low Risk:        The level of risk below which no specific action is deemed necessary.
                          The occurrence of a specific event is unlikely.
     •   Medium Risk:     The level of risk above which specific action is required to protect life
                          and property, though the probability of the event taking place is low to
                          moderate.
     •   High Risk:       Risk levels are significant and occurrence of a particular emergency
                          situation is highly probable or inevitable.
The scope or risk refers to the geographic area that could be potentially affected with the
occurrence of one of the hazards. The scope of risk includes three levels:
     •   Local:     The affected geographic area that is directly affected is localized or site
                    specific;
     •   Citywide: The affected area includes a significant portion or all of the City;
     •   Regional: The affected area includes the entire City as well as the surrounding region.
The low-density character of Bradbury has been mentioned as a positive factor in terms of
general safety. Any incremental intensification of existing residential uses may, to some degree,
increase susceptibility to fire and/or seismic events. The expansion of urban uses is preceded
by, or accomplished in conjunction with, the expansion of infrastructure, and the provisions of a
wide range of vital services and facilities. Future development plans and proposals for all
property located within the City to include the 302-acres of privately owned undeveloped hillside

open space will be scrutinized for compliance with the City’s Safety and Emergency
Preparedness Plans.
Police Services. Police protection is provided by the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department.
The City maintains a contract with the Sheriff’s Department law enforcement services. Although
the City contracts for a minimum level of service, in times of emergency the Sheriff dedicates all
available personnel and equipment to address the community’s needs.
The Duarte Satellite Sub-Station is the launching center for 30 police officers. These officers
are responsible for providing police services to the City of Duarte, the City of Bradbury and
surrounding unincorporated areas. The Satellite Sub-Station does not have dispatch or booking
facilities. The Temple City Sherriff Station is the base of operations location for the region.
Dispatch and booking facilities are located there.
Fire Services. Fire protection / Emergency Medical Services are provided to the City by the Los
Angeles County Consolidated Fire Protection District. The closest Fire Station, No. 44 is located
at 1105 Highland Avenue in the City of Duarte. The station is staffed with at least seven
firefighters 24 hours a day. The equipment includes two fire trucks, one patrol vehicle and one
water tender. Backup paramedic assistance is provided by Station 29 which is located in the
City of Baldwin Park and Station 32 which is located in the City of Azusa. The City of Monrovia
Fire Department offers additional mutual-aid when necessary and requested by the County. Los
Angeles County Fire also provides Hazardous Material services. The U. S. Forest Service in
San Dimas provides wildfire service in the Angeles National Forest.
Medical Services. Emergency medical services are available throughout the Los Angeles
County. Acute care facilities near Bradbury include the Methodist Hospital in Arcadia,
Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, Kaiser-
Permanente Foundation Hospital in Baldwin Park and Foothill Presbyterian Hospital in
Glendora.
Peakload Water Supply
Peakload water supply is defined as the supply of water available to meet both domestic water
and fire fighting needs during the particular season and time of day when domestic water
demand on a water system is at its peak. California American Water provides potable water to
the City of Bradbury. Potable water is provided from eight wells located in and around
Bradbury.
Storage of potable water in the Bradbury service area (which includes portions of the City of
Duarte) is provided by seven (7) reservoirs of which four (4) are located within the City. The total
storage capacity is 11.2 million gallons which is the equivalent of about 175% of an average
day’s demand. All of the reservoirs are covered to reduce evaporation.
California American Water is seeking entitlements to drill a new water well at its facility located
on Lemon Avenue. It is anticipated that the new well will be on line by the end of 2014.
Peakload water supply on August 11, 2005 was 19.5 million gallons. Peakload water demand is
always highest during the hot summer months. Design capacity is based on the peak demand
periods.

Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan
The City of Bradbury adopted the updated Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan on July 7, 2007 by
City Council Resolution No. 07-17. The updated plan fulfills the City’s obligation pursuant to the
Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. The plan adoption and update process involved the
participation of all City departments and interested City residents.
The plan includes the following mitigation goals:
Protect Life and Property
    • Implement activities that assist in protecting lives by making homes, infrastructure,
         critical facilities, and property more resistant to natural hazards.
    • Reduce losses and repetitive damages for chronic hazard events while promoting
         insurance coverage for catastrophic hazards.
    • Improve hazard assessment information and encourage preventative measures for
         existing development located in areas vulnerable to natural hazards.
Public Awareness
    • Develop and implement education and outreach programs to increase public awareness
         of the risks associated with natural hazards.
    • Provide information on tools, partnership opportunities, and funding resources to assist
         in implementing mitigation activities.
Natural Systems
    • Balance watershed planning, natural resource management, and land use planning with
         natural hazard mitigation to protect life, property, and the environment.
    • Preserve, rehabilitate, and enhance natural systems to serve natural hazard mitigation
         functions.
Partnerships and Implementation
    • Strengthen communication and coordinate participation among and within public
         agencies, citizens, and local organizations to gain a vested interest in implementation.
    • Encourage leadership within public and private sector organizations to prioritize and
         implement local, county, and regional hazard mitigation activities.
Emergency Services
    • Establish policy to ensure mitigation projects for critical facilities, services, and
         infrastructure.
    • Strengthen emergency operations by increasing collaboration and coordination among
         public agencies and local organizations.
    • Coordinate and integrate natural hazard mitigation activities, where appropriate, with
         emergency operations plans and procedures.
Hazard mitigation is the responsibility of the City; however the following agencies provide
support and assistance with preparedness, response, recovery, and administration of funding
efforts.

        and releases information to the public to increase earthquake awareness, reduce
        economic losses, and save lives.
    •   California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF or CAL FIRE) – responsible
        for all aspects of wildland fire protection on private and state owned land. CDF or CAL
        FIRE administers forest preservation regulations, including landslide mitigation, on non-
        federally owned land.
    •   California Division of Mines and Geology (DMG) – responsible for geologic hazard
        characterization, public education, and reduction of risk of tsunami inundation.
    •   California Division of Water Resources (DWR) – plans, designs, constructs, operates,
        and maintains the State Water Project, regulates dams, provides flood protection, and
        assists in emergency management.
Hazardous Waste and Materials Management Program The Los Angeles County Fire
Department Health Hazard Materials Division administers the Unified Hazardous Waste and
Hazardous Materials Management Regulatory Program for the City of Bradbury. The Unified
Program consolidates, coordinates, and makes consistent the following hazardous materials
and hazardous waste programs (Program Elements):
    •   Hazardous Waste Generation (including on-site treatment under Tiered Permitting).
    •   Above ground Petroleum Storage Tanks (only the Spill Prevention Control and
        Countermeasure Plan of “SPCC”).
    •   Underground Storage Tanks (UST’s).
    •   Hazardous Material Release Response Plans and Inventories.
    •   California Accidental Release Prevention Program (Cal ARP)’ and Uniform Fire Code
        Hazardous Material Management Plans and Inventories.
Emergency Preparedness
 
Bradbury’s position in Southern California and the San Gabriel Valley makes it susceptible to a
number of natural disasters and other emergencies.
As such, the City Council appointed an Emergency Response Committee, a five-member
advisory body to the Bradbury City Council, to help prepare the community. Commissioners
serve as a communication link between the community, City Council and staff regarding issues
pertaining to Emergency Preparedness. Members of the Committee are hands-on volunteers
who assist in the emergency operation and in the emergency related programs and services
offered to the community.
The specific and primary purpose of the Commission is to:
        A. Assess and define emergency needs;
        B. Locate and publicize available resources;

Health and Safety Element – Draft -                                              Revised-020514
         C. Conduct exercises, manage responses and oversee simulated, actual or impending
             emergencies when called upon to do so by the Mayor, Mayor Pro-Tem or City
             Manager.
Commissioners serve for a term of four years, beginning July 1st and ending June 30th and are
eligible upon request to serve one additional consecutive term, for a total of eight years.
Most members of the Committee are CERT (Community Emergency Response Team) trained.
These volunteers are educated about disaster preparedness for hazards that may impact the
area and in basic disaster response skills, such as fire safety, light search and rescue, team
organization, and disaster medical operations. CERT members can assist others in their
neighborhood or workplace following an event when professional responders are not
immediately available to help.
Additionally, the City of Bradbury has implemented the Connect-CTY service to provide the City
the ability to communicate with residents regarding time-sensitive matters, such as unforeseen
events or emergencies.
With the Connect-CTY system, the City can quickly contact residents by telephone, cell phone,
text message or e-mail regarding urgent and important information. For example, in the event
of an emergency, the City can quickly let residents know what to do or where to go for services.
Only authorized City officials are allowed to send messages. Other non-emergency messages
can be sent by e-mail regarding upcoming meetings, events or workshops.
Disaster Area Management. During World War II, the National Civic Defense Program was
activated. The Los Angeles County and the local military authorities quickly recognized that the
size and complexity of the County would require a unique management structure to effectively
coordinate war-related activities amongst the County, cities, private sector and other agencies.
Civil Defense Areas were formed and each area was supervised by an Area Coordinator. After
the war, Civil Defense transformed into Disaster Management with an emphasis on planning,
training, exercising and public education for earthquakes, fires, floods, severe weather events
and epidemics. The City of Bradbury resides in the “Area D” area of responsibility. Other cities
in “Area D” include Arcadia, Azusa, Baldwin Park, City of Industry, Claremont, Covina, Diamond
Bar, Duarte, El Monte, Glendora, Irwindale, La Puente, La Verne, Monrovia, Pomona,
Rosemead, West Covina, Temple City, Walnut, South El Monte, Sierra Madre, and San Dimas.
There are eight Disaster Management Areas; each has a coordinator to work with cities and
partner agencies to assist their emergency management activities and to act as a liaison
between local government and county, state and federal agencies.
City Staff meets with cities within this area of responsibility once a month to discuss topics such
as federal reporting and reimbursement after a disaster, incident command, working with
minorities, the disabled and the underserved community, public relations and emergency
evacuation. The City also participates in a monthly county-wide radio check with “Area D”
Coordinators.
Alert LA County. Alert LA County is an emergency mass notification system established by
Los Angeles County to contact County residents and businesses via recorded phone messages,
text messages or e-mail messages in case of emergencies. The system will be used by the
County’s Emergency Operations Center to notify residents and businesses of emergencies or
                       Health and Safety                           Page No. 30

Health and Safety Element – Draft -                                              Revised-020514
critical situations and provide information regarding necessary actions, such as
evacuations. The system uses the telephone companies’ 911 database and is able to contact
land-line telephone numbers, whether listed or unlisted. If the call is picked up by an answering
machine, the system will leave a recorded message. If the number called is busy or does not
answer, the system will redial the number in an attempt to deliver the message. The system is
also TTY/TDD compatible.
Alert LA County uses 911 databases; therefore, only land-line numbers are automatically
included in the system. To be notified at a cellular phone or receive an e-mail notification, a
person must register the cellular phone number and/or e-mail address. Each cellular number
and/or e-mail address can only be associated with one street address in the system. The
registered telephone number and e-mail address will be contacted only when the street address
it is associated with is impacted by a disaster or emergency.
Specific Needs Disaster Voluntary Registry (SNAP). The purpose of Specific Needs
Disaster Voluntary Registry (SNAP) is to facilitate the planning and implementation of disaster
response by first-responder agencies to Specific Needs persons living in the County of Los
Angeles. The registry is a project of the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management
in cooperation with other cities and agencies in the Los Angeles County disaster response
operational area.
If a person living in Los Angeles County has any of the following conditions which might impede
their abilities to evacuate a building, travel to or stay safely in an emergency evacuation center,
or to securely shelter in place without assistance, they should enroll in the program:
     •   Physical disabilities
     •   Cardiac and/or respiratory circumstances
     •   Developmental disabilities
     •   Emotional or psychiatric disabilities
     •   Deafness or hearing loss
     •   Blindness or severe vision loss
     •   Speech impairments
     •   Short-term disabilities
     •   Reliance on technologies that use electricity
     •   Using medications
     •   Participation in a home delivery program
     •   Need specialized paratransit vehicles
     •   Experience seizures
     •   Immune system deficiencies
     •   Communicable diseases
Should a disaster strike in the area, this registry will be used to enhance the efficiency of those
agencies called upon to respond, including the Los Angeles County Sherriff’s and Los Angeles
County Fire Departments.

Evacuation Routes and Reception Centers
Emergency preparedness includes the designation of evacuation routes and emergency
facilities. The following facilities are delineated in Exhibit H-S Safety No. 4 and the following
rules apply:
Primary Evacuation Routes. The roads are to be kept open at all times. In the event of
temporary closure due to maintenance and/or construction, the Fire Department is to be
notified.
Reception Centers. The Bradbury Civic Center (600 Winston Avenue, Bradbury, CA 91008)
and the City of Duarte Community Center (1600 Huntington Drive, Duarte, CA 91010) will serve
as Reception Centers for disseminating information, collection points, distribution centers, etc.
Local Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The Bradbury Civic Center will serve as the local
EOC, the alternate site is City of Duarte Community Center until such time the County of Los
Angeles designates another local facility.
Critical Facilities. Certain public facilities require special consideration because of the number
of persons located in the facility at any one-time. Only one critical facility is located within the
City (Royal Oaks Elementary School). The Be Royal Oaks (a senior assisted living facility) is
located adjacent to the City in the County unincorporated area.
The evacuation routes in the City and those facilities that will serve as collection/information
centers are located on Exhibit H-S Safety No. 4. The Emergency Evacuation Plan does not
apply to normal day-to-day emergencies and the well-established and routine procedures used
in coping with such emergencies. In the event of a serious hazard which would require the
evacuation of Bradbury residents, the following streets would be used as primary evacuation
routes:
     •    Mount Olive Drive.
     •    Woodlyn Lane (gates will be opened to permit exiting at Royal Oaks Drive, North). The
          access gate located near Mount Olive Drive will be used by “First Responders” to gain
          access to the Woodlyn Lane neighborhood.
     •    Deodar Lane (gates at Wild Rose, Barranca, and Woodlyn Lane will be opened to permit
          exiting from the Bradbury Estates neighborhood.
     •    Winston Avenue and the Lemon Avenue access to the Flood Control Channel will be
          used as access points for “First Responders”.
Evacuation will be handled by Los Angeles County safety personnel under contract to the City
(i.e., Fire, Sheriff, etc.). In a major disaster, mutual aid sources in adjacent jurisdictions are likely
to be fully committed to their own needs, and there may be substantial delays in the request and
transport of assistance from more distant locations. Ingress to and egress from the City is likely
to be inhibited by damage caused by the disaster and related congestion. Effective disaster
preparedness will require the concerted efforts of City personnel, contracted first responders
and residents. Not only must effective plans and procedures be in effect, but those plans should
be tested and improved through disaster preparedness exercises.

                             Housing Element
The City of Bradbury prepared a General Plan Housing Element 2008 and the City Council
adopted the Element October 20, 2009 (Resolution No. 09-35.CC). The State of California
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) certified the Housing Element as
meeting the provisions of the State Planning Law.
Because the cycle for preparation and updating the Housing Element differs from the cycle
associated with the review and modification of the remaining mandated elements of the City’s
General Plan, the Housing Element has been prepared as a separate document and it is not
part of this General Plan 2012–2030 Update.

City of Bradbury                                          General Plan - 2012 – 2030 Update
Land Use Element – DRAFT –                                                      Revised-020514
            General Plan 2012 – 2030 Update
                             Land Use Element
Purpose:
The purpose of the General Plan Land Use Element is to plan for and shape the future physical
development of Bradbury. State Planning Law requires that General Plans establish land use
designations for various areas in the plan, as well as standards for population density and
building intensity. The Land Use Element serves as a guide for future development. The
Element’s relationship to other General Plan components is central for many aspects. Land use
decisions influence: 1) capacity and service levels for transportation and utility systems; 2)
housing availability; 3) preservation of resources; and 4) long-term effects related to economic
prosperity.
History:
The City of Bradbury incorporated July 26, 1957. The boundaries lie within the northern part of
the Rancho Azusa de Duarte, originally a 6,596-acre Mexican Land Grant given in 1841 to
Andres Duarte. The original rancho included all of Bradbury and portions of the surrounding
cities. It was developed and subdivided into 40+ acre parcels in the 1870’s. Around 1883 Lewis
Leonard Bradbury acquired 2,750 acres of the rancho which comprises the present day cities of
Bradbury and Duarte.
The population of Bradbury has grown from 518 in 1957 to 1,048 in 2010. The City is divided
into five council districts representing the various distinctive areas of this unique community.
The boundaries of the council districts are adjusted every ten years based on the most current
census population data.
Relationship to other General Plan Elements
The Land Use Element responds to detailed State statutory requirements and it has a broad
scope. Land Use issues overlap those of all of the other general plan elements. This element is
internally consistent with the goals, objectives and policies contained in all of the remaining
general plan elements.
Planning Boundary & Sphere of Influence:
As required by State Law, this Land Use Element contains text and maps that designate the
future use and reuse of land and standards for residential density within the City and its Sphere
of Influence. The General Plan Land Use Map, contained in this Element, graphically represents
the City’s vision for future development, enhancement and conservation. The planning

Land Use Element – DRAFT –                                                        Revised-020514
boundaries of the City are identified in Exhibit LU No.1 and they include the existing
jurisdictional boundary and the City’s Sphere of Influence Area.
The Sphere of Influence includes four (4) parcels of land that are currently located in the City of
Monrovia but within the legal authority of the Bradbury Estates Community Service District
(CSD). These four parcels include portions of two developed residential estate sites that are
located in the Bradbury Estates. Additionally, the main entrance to the Bradbury Estates,
including the guard house, is located in the City of Monrovia. It is the City of Bradbury’s position
that these four tax assessor parcels should logically be part of the City of Bradbury and should
be subject to the development policies of this jurisdiction rather than the policies of the City of
Monrovia. The physical extension of the City of Bradbury to the right-of-way of Wild Rose
Avenue should be pursued with the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) and the City
of Monrovia in the future.
Cities are required to enact and develop policies designed to promote logical and orderly
development. Pursuant to Senate Bill SB 244 (adopted in 2011 and enrolled as Chapter 513),
prior to the next housing element due date (February 2014 for Bradbury), cities and counties are
required to update of their land use element to identify county islands adjacent to their city within
their planning boundaries when, in doing so, it promotes logical development. To comply with
SB 244, the planning boundaries for the City should include the 17-acre County Island, “Be
Royal Oaks” retirement/skilled nursing facility. Since the property is a multi-family residential
skilled nursing facility and the site is developed and urban services are provided by the same
agencies utilized by the City of Bradbury no unexpected impacts to the City of Bradbury are
anticipated.
The City of Bradbury has not and does not include multi-family residential zones, development
concepts or policies. The annexation of the Be Royal Oaks retirement/skilled nursing facility
has been previously considered by Planning Commissions and City Councils. The concept of
annexing this County Island into the City of Bradbury has been considered, reviewed and
discarded as a potential expansion of the City of Bradbury. However, if future City Councils
determine that annexation of this multi-family residentially developed property is appropriate
then detailed studies and analysis of the potential impacts would prepared for consideration
before any action is undertaken.
The Bradbury General Plan Existing Land Use Map (Exhibit LU No. 2) identifies the existing
uses of land as of the date of adoption of this General Plan 2012-2030 Update. The General
Plan Land Use Map (Exhibit LU No. 3) designates the desired land use pattern, development
density and intensity envisioned for this planning period. The desired development of land
uses is implemented by the application of the various zone districts set forth in the City’s
Development Code. Development density and intensity is established by the regulations and
standards contained in each of the City’s zone districts.

Local Setting:
The City of Bradbury is a single-family residential community comprised of 1,216-acres of land
(1.9 square miles). The community is almost fully developed with a variety of single-family
detached residential dwelling units and accessory buildings and structures. Other land uses
consisting of non-developable open-space and miscellaneous public uses include: the 1.06–
acre Civic Center; the 13-acre Royal Oaks Public Elementary School; 49.67-acres devoted to
flood control debris basins owned and operated by the Los Angeles County Flood Control
District; the 4.06-acres of privately owned land dedicated as open space; and 3.36-acres owned
by California Water Company and used for water reservoirs.
The south/southeastern half of the City is divided in parcels ranging in size from 7,500 square
feet to two (2) acres. The north/northwestern half of the City consists of large estate size parcels

City of Bradbury                                            General Plan - 2012 – 2030 Update
Land Use Element – DRAFT –                                                      Revised-020514
of land. The estate zoned parcels range in size from two (2) acres to seventy (70) acres. Many
of the parcels are located within areas of steep hillsides.
There are eight (8) large parcels of land comprising approximately 302-acres which are located
in the northern portion of the City adjacent to the City of Monrovia/Angeles National Forest that
appear to have average slopes that range from 24% to 56.66% based on a cursory review of
internet maps and the existing topographical maps on file with the City. The City recognizes
that the eight (8) parcels of land, as they currently exist, have the opportunity to be developed
with one (1) main dwelling unit and one (1) accessory dwelling per parcel in accordance with the
A-5 SP development standards as set forth in the City’s Development Code. This General Plan
Update therefore uses development of 16 additional dwelling units as a realistic development
number for planning purposes for this area. For the purposes of this General Plan Update and
pending future detailed development and environmental feasibility studies these 302-acres of
undeveloped land are recognized as privately owned Open-Space subject to the City’s Hillside
Development Standards as set forth in the Development Code.
Limited access to this 302-acre area, lack of urban utilities and the potential existence of
sensitive ecological areas and species may render these parcels very difficult or potentially
economically infeasible for residential estate development. It should be noted that residential
development of this area is not limited to the 16 units; development density may be increased
through the utilization of land division and development concepts, such as clustered
development, that can be developed through a specific plan. The subject property owners may
at their volition file development applications with the City in accordance with the provisions of
applicable ordinances and policies for such development. Any development of these 302-acres
requires the preparation, review and approval of a Specific Plan. Due to the severe site
constraints it is anticipated that special development design considerations will have to be
examined in order to provide adequate access to future building sites.
Existing Land Uses:
An analysis of the City’s existing land uses identified seven categories: 1) Single-Family
Residential; 2) Public Facilities; 3) Education; 4) Open Space, Privately Owned-Undeveloped; 5)
Vacant; 6) Water Reservoir; and 7) Open-Space-Dedicated. Table LU No. 1 contains the area
tabulations for the various existing land uses. Exhibit LU No. 2 depicts the location of the
various existing land uses.
Land Use Designations:
The City’s zoning, which will not be changed by the General Plan Update, implements the
community’s long-standing desire to retain its rural, low-density single-family residential
character. The entire City of Bradbury is zoned for single-family detached residential
development with only one exception for Open-Space areas that are used for public facilities,
flood control debris and disposal areas water reservoirs, and privately owned and dedicated
open-space areas.

Development:
Existing Development:
Almost the entire City is developed with single-family detached residential dwelling units.
Publically owned property consists of the Civic Center; Royal Oaks Public Elementary School;
Los Angeles County Flood Control District owned Flood Control Debris Basins and Channels;
and privately owned Water Reservoirs. The 2010 Census reported that the City of Bradbury
had 400 dwelling units and a population of 1,048. It was reported that forty-six (46) dwelling
units were vacant. The reported average household size was 3.1 persons per dwelling unit.
There are three unique and distinct neighborhoods in the City known as the Bradbury Estates,
the Woodlyn Lane Improvement Association and the Bradbury Hills Road and Lane Association.
The remaining residential areas are traditional single-family detached residential neighborhoods
that are accessed from public streets.
The Bradbury Estates is a gated community consisting of large residential parcels ranging in
size from two to seventy-acres in size. A unique feature of this community is that it is under the
jurisdiction of a Community Services District (CSD) which was formed on December 28, 1995.
The CSD has the stated responsibility to:
     •   Equip and maintain additional security services above and beyond that provided by the
         Los Angeles County Sheriff to protect and safeguard life and property; and
     •   The construction, opening, widening, extending, straightening, surfacing, and
         maintaining in whole or part of any street in the district; and
     •   The construction and improvement of bridges, culverts, curbs, gutters, drains and works
         incidental thereto.
The Woodlyn Lane Improvement Association is a gated community consisting of large
residential parcels usually having a minimum of two-acres of land area.
The Bradbury Hills Road and Lane Association is a gated community consisting of large
residential parcels usually having a minimum of two-acres. There are seventeen (17) residential
parcels that have access to the private streets, Bradbury Hills Road and Bradbury Hills Lane.
Public Facilities: Royal Oaks Public Elementary School is located within the City’s corporate
boundary and it occupies 13-acres located at the extreme southeast corner of the City. This
school is operated by the Duarte Unified School District.
The Civic Center is located at 600 Winston Avenue in the south central portion of the City and
the entire 1.06-acre site is dedicated for public use. The Civic Center contains a recently
constructed 2,400 square foot facility that includes offices and a multi-purpose room that has
been designed for meetings and civic functions.
Future Development Potential:
The undeveloped parcels within the City fall within three categories. Category 1 consists of eight
(8) parcels of land comprising approximately 302-acres. These parcels are located in the
                                           Land Use - Page No. 8

northern most portion of the City and are subject to the City’s Hillside Development Standards
as set forth in the Development Code which severely restricts grading of slopes which are in
excess of 10%. Category 2 consists of 67.82 acres comprising 24 parcels which are vacant and
more easily developable for single-family detached residential dwellings. Category 3 consists of
5 underutilized parcels which could support additional development.
Category 1 is comprised of a 302-acre area consisting of eight (8) parcels located in the City’s
northern boundary adjacent to the City of Monrovia and the Angeles National Forest (see
Exhibit LU No. 4). The General Plan Land Use Map identifies this area as Open Space,
Privately Owned Undeveloped (see Exhibit LU No. 3), having a maximum density of one
dwelling unit per five acres. The area has been zoned A-5 SP (Agriculture/Residential 5-acre
minimum, Specific Plan). Each parcel may be developed with one main dwelling and one
accessory dwelling unit and would provide for a projected increase of 16 units and 50 persons.
Any development or further subdivision of the 302-acres would be subject to review and
approval of a specific plan. Associated environmental studies will address the impacts and
mitigation measures associated with any such future development and proposed increase in
residential density or population over that set forth herein. The area has been reported to
contain hillside slopes that range from 24% to over 50%; numerous prominent ridgelines;
Blueline streams; earthquake induced landslide zones; lack of existing public or private
vehicular access; lack of existing public utilities, and habitat that could include sensitive or
endangered flora and fauna. These development constraints lead one to consider that
development of the area is physically and economically difficult. This area is further restricted by
being located in an area designated as a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone in compliance
with California State Law. If so desired a Specific Plan could be submitted to the City for
consideration of the area’s maximum development density potential. Use of this steep hillside
potentially environmentally sensitive area could include the creation of a conservation
conservancy/easement; the use of development right transfer strategies, and cluster
development concepts, at the owner’s option.
Any development in this area would be subject to the hillside development standards that are
applicable to any site that consists of two-acres of land area having an average slope exceeding
10%. The intent of the hillside development standards is to preserve the pristine hillside
mountainous topography. Grading of the hillside property is restricted and controlled. The
nature and extent of the grading and development restrictions are based on the average slope
of the parcel under consideration.

Category 2 is comprised of twenty-four (24) vacant undeveloped residentially designated and
zoned parcels. All of these sites are considered as appropriate for development for single-
family detached residential dwelling units. (See Exhibit LU No. 4.) The identified vacant
developable residential parcels on the 67.82 acres could theoretically yield 27 main dwelling
units and 26 second dwelling units for a total of 53 additional dwelling units for a projected
population of 165 persons for this category.

Total Build-Out:
The follow exhibits (LU No. 4 and LU No. 5) locate the vacant undeveloped parcels of land and
the underutilized parcels capable of supporting additional dwelling units. The total projected
dwelling unit buildout capacity for the City of Bradbury is ninety-seven (97) additional dwelling
units. The existing dwelling unit count is 400, but according to the 2010 census, only 354 units
were occupied, providing for an 11.5% vacancy rate. Under current conditions the projected
maximum dwelling unit count would be 497 which would include main and accessory dwellings.
The 2010 federal Census indicates that the average household size in the City of Bradbury is
3.1 persons. The projected maximum population of the City would then be 497 dwellings
multiplied by the average household size of 3.1 for a total buildout population of 1,541 persons.

decades ago when it was initially adopted. The mission statement provides guidance to local
decision makers in the implementation of the community’s land use policies.
Vision Statement: The City of Bradbury recognizes its unique single-family residential
character and by maintaining fiscally responsible governance and development policies shall
strive to provide a stable and sustainable rural community balancing preservation of natural
open space with the needs of its residents for a quiet and safe place to live and raise their
families.

                                  character of the City. The element designates the general
                                  location, distribution, and extent of existing and permitted
                                  development.
