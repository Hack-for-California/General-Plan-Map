City of Big Bear Lake General Plan
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                        I. Introduction
I.      INTRODUCTION
A.      Purpose of the Housing Element
The purpose of the Housing Element is to identify the City’s housing needs and outline
goals, policies and programs to address them. The Housing Element is an eight-year plan,
extending from October 15, 2013 to October 15, 2021. The primary issues addressed in
the Housing Element include: 1) preservation and improvement of the existing housing
stock, 2) housing availability for special needs populations, 3) planning for a sufficient
supply of new housing to meet the City’s fair share of regional need, and 4) fair housing.
B.      Overview
State law requires the preparation of a Housing Element as part of a jurisdiction's General
Plan (Government Code §65302(c)). It is the primary planning guide for local jurisdictions
to identify and prioritize the housing needs of the City and determine ways to best meet
these needs while balancing community objectives and resources. The 2013-2021
Housing Element consists of five chapters: 1) Introduction, 2) Housing Needs Assessment,
3) Resources and Opportunities, 4) Constraints, 5) Housing Action Plan, plus three
Appendices. The evaluation of the 2008-2014 Housing Element is found in Appendix A,
while Appendix B contains details regarding the City’s inventory of sites and default
density parcels for housing development. Appendix C contains a summary of public
participation efforts and comments.
Guidelines adopted by the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
are also to be considered in the preparation of the Element (§65585). Periodic review of
the Element is required to evaluate (1) the appropriateness of its goals, objectives and
policies in contributing to the attainment of the state housing goals, (2) its effectiveness in
attaining the City's housing goals and objectives and (3) the progress of its implementa-
tion (§65588).
C.      Public Participation
Public participation is an important component of the planning process, and this update
to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties numerous
opportunities for review and comment. Public notices of all Housing Element meetings
and public hearings were published in the local newspaper in advance of each
meeting, as well as posting the notices on the City’s website. The draft Housing Element
was made available for review at City Hall and posted on the City’s website. After
receiving comments on the draft Housing Element from the State Housing and
Community Development Department, a proposed final Housing Element was prepared
and made available for public review prior to adoption by the City Council.
                                              I-1          CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

2013-2021 Housing Element                                                       I. Introduction
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this
Housing Element update.
      Planning Commission/City Council Study Session #1         December 5, 2012
      Community Workshop                                        January 16, 2013
      Planning Commission hearing                               June 5, 2013
      City Council hearing                                      June 24, 2013
Additional discussion regarding public participation efforts and how public comments
were incorporated into this Housing Element is provided in Appendix C.
D.      State Housing Element Requirements
The preparation of the Housing Element is guided by California Government Code,
Article 10.6. The law governing the contents of Housing Elements is among the most
detailed of all elements of the General Plan. According to §65583 of the Government
Code, “The Housing Element shall consist of an identification and analysis of existing and
projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, and
scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing
and shall make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic
segments of the community”.
E.      Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
The Housing Element must be consistent with other elements of the General Plan. For
example, the location of housing determines the extent of school, park, library, police,
fire and other services. The Housing Element works in conjunction with the other General
Plan Elements and is consistent with the policies and proposals set forth elsewhere in the
Plan.
The Housing Element is closely related to development policies contained in the Land
Use Element, which establishes the location, type, intensity and distribution of land uses
throughout the City. The Land Use Element determines the number and type of housing
units that can be constructed in the various land use districts. Areas designated for
commercial and industrial uses create employment opportunities, which in turn, create
demand for housing. The Circulation Element establishes the location and scale of
streets, highways and other transportation routes that provide access to residential
neighborhoods.
Because of the requirement for consistency between the various General Plan elements,
any proposed amendment to an element will be evaluated against the other elements
to ensure that no conflicts occur.
SB 1087 of 2005 requires cities to provide a copy of their Housing Elements to local water
and sewer providers, and also requires that these agencies provide priority hookups for
developments with lower-income housing. The Housing Element will be provided to these
agencies immediately upon adoption.
                                              I-2          CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

II.     HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This chapter examines general population and household characteristics and trends,
such as age, race and ethnicity, employment, household composition and size,
household income, and special needs. Characteristics of the existing housing stock (e.g.,
number of units and type, tenure, age and condition, costs) are also addressed. Finally,
the City’s projected housing growth needs based on the 2014 Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) are examined.
The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent data from the 2010 U.S. Census,
California Department of Finance (DOF), California Employment Development Depart-
ment (EDD), Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and other relevant
sources.
A.      Population Characteristics
        1.       Population Growth Trends
San Bernardino County is one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation, with a
population increase of over 20% during the 1990s. In contrast, the City of Big Bear Lake
was very stable during the 1990s, with a population growth of only 1.6%. The rate of
population growth has however decreased since 2000 by 8.4% due to the downturn in
the economy (see Table II-1). Figure II-1 compares population changes from 1990
through 2010 for Big Bear Lake and San Bernardino County. It should be noted that nearly
three-fourths of all homes in the City are vacation homes rented or held for occasional
use (see Table II-19).

        2.          Age
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age
groups have different housing needs based on lifestyles, family types, income levels, and
housing preference. Table II-2 provides a comparison of the City’s and County’s
population by age group in 2010. This table shows that the City’s population is
significantly older than that of San Bernardino County as a whole, with a median age of
about 40.3 compared to the County median of 31.2 years.

        3.      Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of the City differs from the County in that a much
lower proportion of City residents are Hispanic/Latino or racial minorities. Approximately
78% of City residents are non-Hispanic white, contrasted with just 52% for the County as a
whole. No other minority group represents more than 2% of the City’s population (Table II-
3).

B.      Household Characteristics
        1.         Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing
needed in a City. The Census defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing
unit, which may include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or
blood, or unrelated persons sharing a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as
dormitories, retirement or convalescent homes, or other group living situations are
included in population totals, but are not considered households.
Big Bear Lake is unique in that nearly three-quarters of its residential units are vacation
homes held for occasional use. The City had 2,187 permanent resident households as
reported in the 2010 Census. Table II-4 provides a comparison of households by type for
the City and San Bernardino County as a whole. Family households in 2010 comprised
approximately 60.4% of all households in the City, compared to 76.9% for the County.
Single person households comprised the second largest household type in the City at
30.9%, significantly higher than for the County, and average household size was just 2.28
persons in the City compared to 3.28 for the County. These statistics suggest that there is
less need for large units in Big Bear Lake than is typical for other areas of the County.

        2.         Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) is an important indicator of the housing market.
Communities need an adequate supply of units available both for rent and for sale in
order to accommodate a range of households with varying incomes, family sizes and
composition, and lifestyles. Table II-5 provides a comparison of the number of owner-
occupied and renter-occupied units in the City in 2010 as compared to the County as a
whole. The table shows that the homeownership rate in the City is lower than the County.
Note that these statistics refer to units intended for permanent occupancy and exclude
vacation homes.

           3.        Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The
U.S. Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than
one person per room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding
when there are more than 1.5 residents per room. Overcrowded households are usually a
reflection of a shortage of affordable housing. Table II-6 summarizes overcrowding for Big
Bear Lake in 2010 as compared to the County as a whole.

Approximately 6% of the City’s households were overcrowded compared to 8% for
households for the County. Compared to the County as a whole, overcrowding was less
frequent in the City.
           4.        Household Income
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community. It can be
assumed that the ability of residents to afford housing is directly related to household
income. The City’s income distribution of households by income category based on 2010
Census data is provided in Table II-7. This table shows that over 80% of households fell into
                                                                     II-5            CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

        5.      Overpayment
According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of
gross household income. Table II-10 displays estimates for overpayment as reported by
SCAG 2012. The SCAG data provides numbers and percentages of both renters and
homeowners and categoraizes housing costs as a percentage of income. According to
the data, housing costs as percentage of income varies widely for both renter and
owner households. Nonetheless, the numbers show that 38.60% of renters and 30.80% of
owners pay more than 50% of their income toward housing costs.
Although homeowners enjoy income and property tax deductions and other benefits
that help to compensate for high housing costs, homeowners paying a higher
percentage toward a mortgage may need to defer maintenance or repairs due to
limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For renters, severe cost burden can
require families to double up resulting in overcrowding and related problems.

C.      Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs
available in each employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and
size of housing residents can afford.
        1.         Current Employment
Current employment and projected job growth have a significant influence on housing
needs during this planning period. Table II-11 shows that the City had a workforce of
2,049 persons, or one half of the working-age population, as reported in the 2010 Census.
This table shows that the City has a lower labor force participation rate as the County. A
greater proportion of the City’s than the County’s working age population also receives
social security income, which is indicative of early retirees.

In 2010, approximately 21.5% of the City’s working residents were employed in manage-
ment and professional occupations (Table II-12). About one-third of the workforce
(37.1%) was employed in service related occupations such as waiters, waitresses and
beauticians. Blue collar occupations such as machine operators, assemblers,
transportation, handlers and laborers constituted about 25.5% of the workforce.

As of 2010, the four largest employment sectors within San Bernardino County were
educational services and health care services (179,296 employees), retail (103,003
employees), manufacturing (82,045 employees), and accomodation and food services
(71,295 employees)1.
Mountain communities like Big Bear Lake have a significant number of seasonal workers
employed at the ski resorts, restaurants, hotels and other visitor-serving facilities. It is
difficult to quantify this component of the labor force. Recent discussions with ski resort
management indicate that housing for seasonal resort workers is not a problem most
years. However, the City adopted a Development Code amendment in 2011 to allow
extended-stay lodging facilities as a way to address housing options for seasonal workers.
         2.     Projected Job Growth
Future housing needs are affected by the number and type of new jobs created during
this planning period. Table II-13 shows projected job growth by occupation for the
Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) along with median
hourly wages for 2010-2020. Total employment in the region is expected to grow by 16.5%
between 2010 and 2020. The overall growth is expected to add 206,700 new jobs and
bring the employment of San Bernardino-Riverside counties to 1,464,600 by 2020.
Generally, residents that are employed in well-paying occupations have less difficulty
obtaining adequate housing than residents in low paying occupations. Table II-13
illustrates the growth trend in low-wage service jobs such as health care support, food
preparation and serving, building grounds, cleaning and maintenance, sales, and

care and service, computer and mathematical, transportation and material moving,

             3.         Jobs-Housing Balance
A regional balance of jobs to housing helps to ensure that the demand for housing is
reasonably related to supply. When the number of jobs significantly exceeds the housing
supply, the rental and for-sale housing markets may become overheated, requiring
households to pay a larger percentage of their income for housing. In addition, a tight
housing market can result in overcrowding and longer commute times as workers seek
more affordable housing in outlying areas. The current jobs-housing objective within the
SCAG region is one new housing unit for every 1.5 jobs.2

According to the 2010 Census, about 91% of employed Big Bear Lake residents worked
within 30 minutes of their place of employments indicating that very few residents
traveled outside of the Big Bear Valley for employment (Error! Reference source not

The largest permanent employment sector within Big Bear Lake is “arts, entertainment,
recreation, accommodation, and food services”(450 employees), followed by
“education services, health care, and social assistance” (369 employees). The City of Big
Bear Lake is a recreational community. The biggest recreational attraction is winter skiing.
During the winter months, Big Bear Mountain Resorts, which operates both the Bear
Mountain and Snow Summit ski areas, adds about 2,000 seasonal employees to the
town’s workforce.3 Many of these workers come from other communities; others are local
residents who work in the resorts in the winter and may work construction or other jobs in
the summer months. Bear Mountain Resorts does not provide temporary housing or rental
assistance for seasonal employees.
With 1,859 year-round jobs and 2,187 permanent resident housing units, the City’s
jobs/housing ratio was 1.17 as of 2010 (Table II-15). The City’s jobs/housing ratio is lower
than San Bernardino County as a whole, (823,910 jobs/691,321 units), which had a ratio
of only 1.19 jobs per housing unit in 2010. It should be noted, however, that many jobs are
seasonal rather than year-round, and therefore these statistics are not directly
comparable to non-resort areas.

D.      Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the community’s housing
stock and helps in identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the
number and type of housing units, recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure,
vacancy, housing costs, affordability, and assisted affordable units at-risk of loss due to
conversion to market-rate. A housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, mobile
home, or group of rooms, occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for
occupancy as separate living quarters.
        1.      Housing Type and Growth Trends
As of 2010, the housing stock in Big Bear Lake was comprised mostly of single-family
detached homes, which made up about 84% of all units, while multi-family units
comprised only 10% of the total. Mobile homes comprised the remaining 5%. Table II-16
provides a breakdown of the housing stock by type along with growth trends for the City
compared to the County as a whole for the period 2000-2010.

Between 2000 and 2010, single-family detached homes represented about 66% of all
units built in the City, while approximately 34% of new units were multi-family or mobile
homes.
        2.         Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior
to 1978 before stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed may have
interior or exterior building components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built
before 1970 are the most likely to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in
deteriorated condition. Lead-based paint becomes hazardous to children under age six
and to pregnant women when it peels off walls or is pulverized by windows and doors
opening and closing.
Table II-17 shows the age distribution of the housing stock occupied by permanent
residents in Big Bear Lake compared to San Bernardino County as a whole as reported in
the 2010 Census.

This table shows that about 35% of owner-occupied permanent resident housing units
and 55% renter-occupied permanent resident housing units in Big Bear Lake were
constructed prior to 1970. These findings suggest that there may be a need for
maintenance and rehabilitation, including remediation of lead-based paint, for
approximately one-third to over one-half of the City’s housing stock that is occupied by
year-round residents.

owner-occupied                   and            renter-
occupied housing units lacking

Between November 1999 and February 2000, staff of the Big Bear Lake Planning Division
conducted a “windshield” survey of the condition of every housing unit in the City. Staff
assessed the condition of each unit as good, moderate or poor using an assessment tool
roughly based on the categories used by the American Housing Survey. Units with
peeling paint or missing roof shingles were categorized as moderately deteriorated while
units with a sagging roof, holes in the walls or other extreme conditions were described as
in poor condition. The survey found 89 multi-family units on 19 properties in moderately
deteriorated condition and 53 multi-family units on 12 properties in need of substantial
rehabilitation. In the single-family housing stock, there were 550 homes in moderately
deteriorated condition and 84 in poor condition. Mobile homes in the City’s five mobile
home parks were mainly in good condition with only 21 of mobile home units assessed as
fair and none as poor. The survey did not distinguish between deteriorated units needing
substantial rehabilitation and those needing replacement.
In December 2007, a sample field survey was conducted to determine whether housing
conditions had changed significantly since the prior survey. Based on the re-surveyed
sample, it was estimated that the proportion of housing units in need of rehabilitation has
decreased by approximately 10% to 15%. This estimate seems reasonable considering
that the housing market was very strong during the period 2000–2005, and rising property
values encouraged owners to make needed repairs and improvements. On the basis of
the new survey, it is estimated that there may be 540 to 570 single-family homes, 120 to
125 multi-family units and 18 to 20 mobile homes currently in need of repair.

Housing vacancy rates as reported in the 2010 Census are shown in Table II-19. The table
shows that 78.2% of all housing units in the City were held for seasonal or occasional use.
Only 21.8% the City’s housing units were occupied year-round by permanent residents.
The vacancy rate for the County as a whole is considerably lower, at 13.8%. Since
vacancy rates in the 2% range indicate nearly full occupancy, it can be assumed that
there is no upward pressures on rents.

        4.      Housing Cost
a.      Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on
the area (i.e., County) median income (“AMI”): extremely-low (30% or less of AMI), very-
low (31-50% of AMI), low (51-80% of AMI), moderate (81-120% of AMI) and above
moderate (over 120% of AMI). Housing affordability is based on the relationship between
household income and housing expenses. According to HUD and the California Depart-
ment of Housing and Community Development4, housing is considered “affordable” if
the monthly payment is no more than 30% of a household’s gross income. In some areas,
these income limits may be increased to adjust for high housing costs.
Table II-20 shows affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices for
housing in San Bernardino County by income category. Based on state-adopted
standards, the maximum affordable monthly rent for extremely-low-income households is
$487, while the maximum affordable rent for very-low-income households is $812. The
maximum affordable rent for low-income households is $1,300, while the maximum for
moderate-income households is $1,950.
Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage
interest rates and qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments,
homeowner association fees, property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the

September 2011 to September 2012, the median price for an existing single family homes
was $197,000 while the median price for condominiums was $124,000 during this period.

majority of existing single family homes and condos sold in the City of Big Bear Lake fall
into the affodablitiy range.
c.      Rental Housing
Most rentals within Big Bear Lake are single-family homes, with some condominiums and
duplex units. Therefore, an informal classified ad survey and search of realtor websites of
rentals in the City and its immediate environs was conducted. The results of the survey
are shown in Table II-21. Rent for homes with three or more bedrooms ranged from $900
to $2,700 per month, with an average rent of $1,546. Two-bedroom homes ranged from
$600 to $1,250 per month, with an average rent of $843. One-bedroom/studio units
ranged from $500 to $600, with an average rent of $743.

E.      Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
special circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and
income, family characteristics, disability, or other conditions. As a result, some Big Bear
Lake residents may experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or
other housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines “special needs” groups to include persons with
disabilities, the elderly, large households, female-headed households with children,
homeless people, and farmworkers. This section contains a discussion of the housing
needs facing each of these groups.
        1.      Persons with Disabilities
In 2010, approximately 737 people between the 16 and 64 years of age, or 14.3% of the
working age population, reported a work-related disability (see Table II-22). Of those
aged 65 and over, approximately 3% reported a physical disability. Included within these
disabilities are persons whose disability hinders their ability to go outside the home (0.9%
of the working age population and 0.3% of the senior population). Housing opportunities
for the handicapped can be maximized through housing assistance programs and
universal design features such as widened doorways, ramps, lowered countertops, single-
level units and ground floor units.

The City of Big Bear Lake does not have any housing units specifically designated for
disabled persons. However, there are 75 units for very-low- to moderate-income seniors
that can accommodate persons with mobility limitations. In addition, the 42-unit
affordable apartment building built in 2010 complies with the American with Disabilites
Act.
        2.      Persons with Developmental Disabilities
Senate Bill 812 (Chapter 507, Statues of 2010) requires an evaluation of housing needs for
persons with developmental disabilities. The Welfare and Insitutions Code (Section 4512)
defines "Developmental disability" to mean a disability that originates before an
individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely,
and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. As defined by the Director of
Developmental Services, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction, this
term shall include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term shall
also include disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to
require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but shall
not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) provides community
services to persons with developmental disabilies and their families through a system of
                                                         II-19          CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

regional centers. In San Bernardino County, the Inland Regional Center (IRC) is the local
service provider for the State Department of Developmental Services. The center
provides access to a variety of resources such as educational, employment, health, and
housing to persons with developmental disabilities. In Big Bear Lake, the IRC ccordinates
housing programs with In-Home Supportive Services (through the County Department of
Aging and Adult Services) and family support services such as respite, for persons living at
home with the family. Respite services may include a behavior modification specialist
and educational services. The IRC also provides transporation vouchers. The IRC serves 18
Big Bear Lake residents, which are mostly young adults (born in the 1990 decade)5.
According to the IRC, there is a day center the Big Bear area, called First Step, which
offers educational, employment, and other support programs for qualifying residents.
Adults are typically limited to an SSI income, which may range from $600-$800 per month.
Depending on the type of developmental disability, employment options are limited.
Many persons with such disabilities may live independently with minimal supervision.
Others may live in a group facility with some supervision, while more severe conditions
may require institutional living with regular supervision. In Big Bear Lake, the IRC identified
affordable housing as a priority need. Accordingly, a new program will direct staff to
collaborate with the IRC on affordable housing projects to ensure that appropriate units
can be set aside for persons with developmental disabilities.
         3.      Elderly
In 2010, there were 687 households in Big Bear Lake where the householder was 65 or
older (Table II-23). Many elderly persons are dependent on fixed incomes or have
disabilities. Elderly homeowners may be physically unable to maintain their homes or
cope with living alone. The housing needs of this group can be partially addressed
through smaller units, second units on lots with existing homes, shared living
arrangements, congregate housing and housing assistance programs.

        4.      Large Households
Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as
those with five or more members. The City's average household size has dropped slightly
from 2.31 persons in 2000 to 2.28 persons in 2010. Among both owners and renters, more
than half of all households have only one or two members. About 11% of renter
households had five or more members, while about 5% of owners were large households
(Table II-24). This distribution indicates that the need for large units with four or more
bedrooms is expected to be significantly less than for smaller units.

Of the 2,091 year-round households in the City, 275, or about 13%, were headed by a
female (Table II-25). While female-headed households represent a small portion of
households, they make up a significant portion of households that are below the poverty
level. On a percentage basis, two times as many renter households were female-headed
as compared to owners (18% vs. 9%, respectively).

Unlike most areas of the Southern California metropolitan area, agriculture is still a
significant component of the economy in San Bernardino County, with a total value of
over $367 million per year6. Most of the farm economy consists of milk products (54%),
cattle & calves (11%), and eggs (12%). Agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and mining
occupations employ 6,256 persons within the County.7 However, according to both the
1990, 2000, and 2010 Census, there are no agricultural workers living in the City of Big
Bear Lake. The City is within a mountain recreation area adjacent to a national forest.
There is no agricultural land within the City; nor is the City adjacent to any agricultural
producing areas.
        7.        Temporary Resort Workers
During the winter months, the two ski resorts in Big Bear Lake reported that they add
approximately 2,000 additional workers. Some of those work full-time, while others are
part-time weekend workers. Detailed information is not available regarding where they
live while they work in Big Bear Lake and how they are housed. The ski resorts do not
provide temporary housing for their workers, and management indicated that housing is
generally not a problem in recruiting workers.
Although details regarding the demographics and needs of seasonal workers in Big Bear
Lake are not readily available, it can be assumed that the incomes of these employees
are relatively low, as with other service occupations. In 2011 the City ammended the
Developement Code to allow for short term motel cabins to be converted into extended
stay units for up to six months. This should increase the supply of small affordable units by
making more effective use of the existing underutilized housing stock.

        8.      Homeless Persons
Homelessness is a continuing national problem that persists within local cities and
communities including San Bernardino County. During the past two decades, an
increasing number of single persons have remained homeless year after year and have
become the most visible of all homeless persons. Other persons (particularly families)
have experienced shorter periods of homelessness. However, they are often replaced by
other families and individuals in a seemingly endless cycle of homelessness.
A Countywide homeless count is anticipated for January 23, 2013, however, based on
the low potential for unsheltered homeless persons on that date in the City (due to
inclimate weather), the County will not conduct a formal count within the City. The most
recent available survey for homeless counts is the 2007 San Bernardino County Homeless
Census and Survey. In 2007, the survey’s point-in-time count included unsheltered homes
people (streets, vehicles, encampments) and sheltered people (emergency shelters,
transitional housing, domestic violence shelters, and motel/hotel vouchers).
Big Bear Lake is fortunate, as studies and surveys by government agencies and homeless
advocacy groups have shown that homelessness is not pervasive in the community. The
homeless count conducted by San Bernardino County in 2007 indicated that on 53
homeless persons in Big Bear Lake, which represents less than 1% of the City’s population,
and less than .01% of the County’s total homeless population (Table II-26). These numbers
include families that might be displaced through evictions, women and children
displaced through abusive family life, or persons with substance abuse problems.

The County’s homeless count estimates that the number of homeless persons in San
Bernardino County in 2007 was 7,331 persons, including sheltered and unsheltered
counts. Survey data indicates that 17,551 unduplicated San Bernardino County residents
experience homelessness in a given year. This range represents between 1% of the

County’s total population, which is comparable to current national estimates of
homelessness.
In September 2007, the board of supervisors established the Office of Homeless Services
and formed the San Bernardino County Homeless Partnership (SBCHP) to provide a more
focused approach to issues of homelessness within the County. The Partnership consists of
community and faith-based organizations, educational institutions, non profit
organizations, private industry, and federal, state, and local governments.
SBCHP was developed to promote a strong collaboration between agencies to direct
the planning, development, and implementation of the County’s 10-year Strategy to end
chronic homelessness. The Partnership provides leadership in creating a comprehensive
countywide network of service delivery to the homeless and near homeless families and
individuals through facilitating better communication, planning, coordination, and
cooperation among all entities that provide services and/or resources for the relief of
homelessness in San Bernardino County.
The local County Sheriff’s Office and City Code Enforcement Department has since
taken a collaborative approach in reaching out to homeless persons. In July 2012, both
agencies conducted a “POP Project” (POP stands for people-oriented policing) in the
City. The project resulted in a count of 25 homeless persons, most of whom were
individual men in encampment settings8. The majority of these persons indicated that
they do not remain on the mountain during the winter season. The goal of the project is
to distribute information on local and County homeless services.
Direct services for the homeless within the City are typically provided in the form of food
and motel vouchers provided by individual churches. In winter, if no shelter can be
obtained within the community, homeless individuals or families have to take the bus to
San Bernardino where there is a motel that accepts shelter vouchers.
Although there is no emergency shelter in Big Bear Lake, DOVES of Big Bear operates an
18-bed shelter program for victims of domestic violence and their children. This is a six-
month program. For the 2009-2010 fiscal year, the program housed 22 adults and 19
children. Over the course of 2010-2011, the DOVES program housed 17 adult women and
18 children. For 2011-2012, the shelter program housed 28 adults and 19 children. Also,
from January 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, DOVES also was able to fund a transitional
housing program for 12 adults and 6 children. The transitional housing program was
discontinued due to lack of funds. For 2011-2012, DOVES housed 28 adults and 19
children. From July 30, 2012 to present, DOVES has housed 8 adults and 3 children. About
half the women who leave the program move “down the hill” because they are unable
to find affordable housing and full time employment in Big Bear Lake. There are no
transitional housing units for homeless individuals or families with general needs.

G.        Future Growth Needs
          1.       Overview of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is a key tool for local governments to
plan for anticipated growth. The RHNA quantifies the anticipated need for housing within
each jurisdiction for the 8-year period from January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2021.
Communities then determine how they will address this need through the process of
updating the Housing Elements of their General Plans.
The current RHNA was adopted by the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) in October 2012. Future housing need is determined primarily by the forecasted
                                                  II-25                  CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

growth in households in a community. Each new household, created by a child moving
out of a parent's home, by a family moving to a community for employment, and so
forth, creates the need for a housing unit. The housing need for new households is then
adjusted to maintain a desirable level of vacancy to promote housing choice and
mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for units expected to be lost due to
demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of these factors –
household growth, vacancy need, and replacement need – determines the construction
need for a community. Total housing need is then distributed among four income
categories9 on the basis of the County’s income distribution, with adjustments to avoid
an over-concentration of lower-income households in any community.
        2.      2014-2021 Growth Needs
SCAG has determined the RHNA growth needs for each of San Bernardino County’s
cities plus the unincorporated area. The total housing growth need for the City of Big
Bear Lake during the 2014-2021 planning period is 2 units, which is distributed by income
category as shown in Table II-28. The growth need in the extremely-low-income category
was not included in the RHNA, however it is estimated to be 50% of the very-low-income
category as permitted by AB 2634.

        1.      Regional Growth Needs 2014-2021
In accordance with Government Code §65584, projected housing needs for each City
and County in the Southern California region are prepared by the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) under a process known as the Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA). SCAG’s Regional Council adopted the final Regional Housing
Need Allocation in October 2012. The RHNA covers the 8-year planning period of
January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2021. The RHNA process began with an update of the
population, employment and household forecasts for both the region as a whole and for
each County. These forecasts were largely derived from the 2010 Census, California
Department of Finance (DOF) population and employment forecasts and modified by
regional demographic and modeling efforts by SCAG.
For this RHNA cycle only (due to extraordinary uncertainty regarding conditions
impacting the economy and housing market not expected to similarly impact future
RHNA cycles), a new 1-time adjustment was made to account for unprecedented high
vacancies in existing stock, due to unusual conditions including high foreclosures and
recession uncertainties. A slow absorption rate of 10% of existing excess vacant units is
assumed to occur in shrinking current excess vacant units before the start of 2014 RHNA
projection period resulting in applying a 90% adjustment to account for units not
absorbed that decreases new housing need by -75,390 units. Existing housing stock
consists of two components:
   (1) housing units for sale and rent in existing housing stock that are above the housing
       units required to maintain the healthy market condition, calculated as the number
       of units in housing stock (for sale+for rent+sold, not occupied+rented, not
       occupied+occupied units).
   (2) housing units in the “vacant units others” category of existing housing stock above
       the simple average of 1.28% calculated based on Census data from 1980 to 2010.
       To evaluate the reasonableness of vacancy adjustments proposed by SCAG to
       account for the unprecedented economic downturn, the Department used 2010
       Census Demographic profile data (DP-1) and desirable “normal” vacancy rates by
       tenure, in conjunction with the region’s household growth and proposed
       household formation rates. The proposed vacancy adjustment is limited to not
       exceed the differential between the 2010 Census vacant units and the healthy
       market vacant units rate associated with the region’s annual household growth.
       As the adjustment was below the differential, the vacancy adjustment was applied
       in calculating the low RHNA range.
All new units built or preserved after January 1, 2006 are credited in the current RHNA
period. Table III-1 shows the net remaining growth need after crediting units built during

        2.      Inventory of Sites for Housing Development
Pursuant to Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3), the housing element must include
analysis of identified sites which must demonstrate density standards to accommodate a
jurisdiction’s regional need for all income levels, including lower-income households.
To meet this statutory requirement, local governments are required to provide an analysis
demonstrating how adopted densities accommodate the regional housing need for
lower income households. The analysis must include, but is not limited to, factors such as
market demand, financial feasibility, or information based on development project
experience within a zone or zones that provide housing for lower income households.
As an option and alternative to preparing the analysis described above, Government
Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B) allows local governments to elect the option of utilizing
“default” density standards that are “deemed appropriate to accommodate housing for
lower income households.” The default density option is not a mandated density. The
default density is standard provides a streamlined option for local governments to meet
the density requirement. No analysis to establish the appropriateness of the default
density is required and the Department must accept that density as appropriate in its
review.
The default density option was adopted in 2003 by consensus with local government
representatives, builders, planners and advocates through the Housing Element Working
Group which was convened by the Department in 2003. Default densities are

Based on the release of 2010 Census data, the Department updated the default density
standards set forth in the Department’s June 9, 2005 technical assistance memo
(Amendment of State Housing Element Law – AB 2348). Specifically, Table A and
Appendix 1 of the June 9, 2005 memo have been revised based on current US Census
Bureau population based criteria as established in Government Code Section
65583.2(c)(3)(d) through (f). Table A identifies the City of Big Bear Lake as a suburban
jurisdiction with a default density of at least 20 units per Acre.
In 2011 the City amended its Development Code to rezone 8.74 acres to a minum of 20
units per acre. (Figure B-1) This created a potential for 173 affordable units to be
constructed on three selected parcels. With an outstanding unmet need of 153
affordable units (Table III-1) the City still maintains an excess capacuity of 20 affordable
units. The City therefore has met both its curerent and past RHNA requiremtns for
affordable units.

B.      Financial and Administrative Resources
        1.      State and Federal Resources
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) – Limited federal funding for
housing programs is available through the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD). The City’s allocation of CDBG funds is about $40,000 per year. The
City does not directly control these funds. Instead, the Big Bear Lake City Council makes
recommendations for the expenditure of this money, but the funds are administered by
the Housing and Community Development Department of the County of San Bernardino
(HCD).
Section 8 Rental Assistance – The San Bernardino County Housing Development
Department, in cooperation with the Housing Authority, administers the Tenant Based
(Rental) Assistance Program that includes Section 8 rental assistance. The Housing
Authority reports that 19 Section 8 housing vouchers are issued within the City and its
immediate environs. The housing vouchers assist low-income households by paying the
difference between 30% of an eligible household's income and the actual cost of renting
a unit. Another component of the Tenant Based Assistance Program provides one-time
security deposit assistance to eligible applicants.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program - The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program
was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to provide an alternate method of funding
low-and moderate-income housing. Each state receives a tax credit, based upon
population, toward funding housing that meets program guidelines. The tax credits are
then used to leverage private capital into new construction or acquisition and
rehabilitation of affordable housing. Limitations on projects funded under the Tax Credit
programs include minimum requirements that a certain percentage of units remain rent-
restricted, based upon median income.
        2.      Local Resources
a.      Big Bear Lake Programs
        Community Development Grant Program
        In 2010, the City modeled a Community Development Grant Program, similar in
        scope and goals to the federal CDBG program. The award is based on the City’s
        annual CDBG allocation, which is about $40,000 every fiscal year. Since it’s
        inception, awards have been granted as follows.
       CDBG-funded Enhanced Code Enforcement Services
        During fiscal year 2011-2012, the City was awarded CDBG funds toward Code
        Enforcement Services that targeted income-qualifying areas. The boundaries of
        these primarily residential areas are based on HUD census tracts and services are
        limited to the neighborhoods identified low- and moderate-income (LMI) areas.
        The scope of the program is to enhance blighted properties in low-income
        neighborhoods. The City will continue to apply for funding this program.

b.      San Bernardino County Affordable Housing Programs
The San Bernardino County Housing Development Department administers three housing
programs in addition to the Tenant Based Assistance Program discussed above. The
following County-administered programs could be used to create or acquire affordable
housing in the City of Big Bear Lake.
Mortgage Revenue Bond Programs
Single Family Home Mortgage Revenue Bond Program – This bond program serves
eligible households throughout the County who are first time homebuyers. The program
provides below-market loans to eligible households. Households apply directly to
participating lenders who are listed on the County of San Bernardino web page at
www.sbcounty.gov/ECD/HOUSING. Income limits change from year to year.
Multi-family Mortgage Revenue Bond Program – The Multi-Family Residential Rental
Housing Revenue Bond Program assists developers of rental units by providing financing
for acquisition and new construction or rehabilitation of multi-family housing
developments. A specified number of the units must remain affordable to eligible
households for a specified period.
Homeownership Assistance Program
Households with incomes below 80% of the County median income may also be eligible
for down payment and closing cost assistance through the County’s Homeownership
Assistance Program (HAP). Most of the participating lenders also process applications for
the HAP program.
Rental Property Acquisition and Rehabilitation Assistance Program
This program provides financial assistance to nonprofit and for-profit developers of rental
property for the acquisition and/or rehabilitation of residential rental units available to
income-eligible tenants at affordable rates.
C.      Energy Conservation Opportunities
State law requires all new construction to comply with "energy budget" standards that
establish maximum allowable energy use from depletable sources. These requirements
apply to such design components as structural insulation, air infiltration and leakage
control, setback features on thermostats, water heating system insulation (tanks and
pipes) and swimming pool covers if a pool is equipped with a fossil fuel or electric heater.
State law also requires that a tentative tract map provide for future passive or natural
heating or cooling opportunities in the subdivision, including designing the lot sizes and
                                            III-5         CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

configurations to permit orienting structures to take advantage of a southern exposure,
shade or prevailing breezes. These standards have been incorporated by reference into
the City’s Building Code and Subdivision Ordinance.
In addition to the energy and water conservation measures required by state law, other
private and public initiatives assist with energy payments and conservation. The Bear
Valley Electric Company participates in the Low-income Energy Assistance (LEAP)
Payments program providing lower energy rates to eligible households. To inform
residents about this program, the electric company annually mails all customers a
brochure and application form for LEAP with the monthly bill.
The County of San Bernardino Community Services Department administers a
weatherization program with funding from both the federal government and several
Southern California gas companies. Services provided include attic insulation and
venting, weather stripping, repair or replacement of windows and doors, if needed, and
repair of combustion appliances. Low flow showerheads are also installed.
The City of Big Bear Lake is a participant in the San Bernardino County Associated
Governments (SanBAG) Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program. The PACE
program helps home and business owners pay for the upfront costs of green initiatives,
such as solar panels and similar energy improvements. SanBAG will be offering a specific
bond to investors and then use the proceeds to loan money to consumers and
businesses to put towards energy retrofits on their property. The loans are repaid over the
assigned term (typically 15 or 20 years) via an annual assessment on their property tax
bill. The loan is attached to the property rather than an individual which allows the
property owners to begin saving on energy costs immediately while paying for their
energy improvements through their annual tax bill.
In addition to these measures, the City will adopt a program to subsidize building permit
fees for replacing windows, water heaters and furnaces with energy efficient models
(see Chapter V, Program 7.1). Local utility and service providers in the City also provide
rebate programs, water conservation assistance and programs, and recycling and
electronic waste disposal. The City will adopt programs to actively publicize these
programs in order to expand access and oppurtinities to participate. Furthermore,
development in the City has long been subject to requirements to protect and retain
large healthy stands of trees (through the Tree Conservation Ordinance) and to use
native plants and drip irrigation as a water conservation measure. The City has been an
annual participant in the Xeriscape Garden Tour, which provides tours of local gardens
and an expo for information.

IV. CONSTRAINTS
A.      Government Constraints
        1.      Land Use Designations and Development Standards
As a mountain resort community, Big Bear Lake has adopted land use designations and
development standards that are suited to the City’s remote location, predominantly
second-home character, and environmental conditions.
Residential Land Use Designations
The Big Bear Lake General Plan Land Use Element provides for six residential land use
designations as follows:
            Rural Residential (RR)                  one unit per 2.5 gross acres
            Equestrian Estates (EE)                 one unit per gross acre
            Single-Family Residential 2 (SFR-2)     two units per gross acre
            Single-Family Residential 3 (SFR-3)     three units per gross acre
            Single-Family Residential 4 (SFR-4)     four units per gross acre
            Multiple Family Residential (MFR)       12 units per gross acre
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development
through the City Development Code. The Development Code regulations serve to
implement the General Plan and are designed to protect and promote the health,
safety, and general welfare of residents. The Development Code also helps to preserve
the character and integrity of existing neighborhoods.
The three zoning districts that allow residential units as a principal permitted use are as
follows:
            R-L        Residential-Low
            R-1        Single-Family Residential
            R-3        Multiple-Family Residential
Single-family      districts    also  allow
manufactured housing on permanent
foundations, subject to applicable
development standards pursuant to
state     law.    The      Multiple  Family
Residential zone allows a maximum of
12 units per acre with a density bonus
of up to 35% as allowed by state law
for affordable housing. Projects with 2-5
units are reviewed administratively,
while projects of 5 or more units require
a Plot Plan Review (PPR) (see discussion
under Section 6 Permit Processing).

The development standards that govern single-family and multi-family development
have been in place since the 1960s, prior to the City’s incorporation in 1980. Upon
incorporation, the City adopted the County of San Bernardino’s Development Code,
which has been revised from time-to-time by City ordinances and was ultimately
replaced in 2003 with a comprehensive Development Code update.
The Development Code sets forth residential development standards for each zone
district. Residential development standards for both Single Family Residential (R-1) and
Multiple Family Residential (R-3) zone districts are shown in Table IV-1.

2013-2021 Housing Element                                                       IV. Constraints
conveniently located trash enclosures, and placement of common use areas in visible
areas to promote safety.
In     additional     to    conventional
residential buildings, other uses
permitted        in   the    multi-family
residential zones are boarding and
lodging houses, residential care
facilities, large group living facilities
for 6 or more residents (including
SROs and transitional housing),
private schools, lodges and private
clubs, philanthropic and charitable
institutions, motels, mobile home
parks and recreational vehicle parks,
hotels and large-scale housing
projects.
a.       Commercial Land Use Designations Allowing Mixed Use
In addition to the residential districts discussed above, residential development is also
permitted as an accessory use subject only to plot plan review in the C-1, C-2, C-3 and
C-4 commercial zones if a principal use is also located on the site. Residential
development standards in commercial zones are the same as in the R-3 zone but are
capped at 12 units/acre.
b.       Effects of Zoning and Development Standards on Housing Affordability
Big Bear Lake is a recreational community in which the dominant residential building
type is the single-family house or cabin. In multi-family areas, the normal maximum
density is 12 units per acre although developers of affordable or senior housing may
apply for a density bonus up to 35%, depending upon the proposed affordable unit mix.
As noted in Table IV-1, the allowable lot coverage is 60% and the building height limit is
40 feet in the R-3 zone. These standards enable two- and three-story buildings at densities
sufficient to facilitate lower-income housing. The chief constraint on the development of
subsidized affordable housing is not land use controls but the lack of interest by non-profit
or for-profit agencies in constructing and
managing affordable housing in Big Bear
Lake, and lack of available funds to
subsidize such projects.
There are three examples of successful
affordable housing developments in the
R-3 zone.In 1998-99 the Mountain
Meadows senior affordable apartment
project was developed. This project was
granted a density bonus allowing a
density of 27 units/acre. This project
                                             IV-4          CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

2013-2021 Housing Element                                                        IV. Constraints
contained 68 very-low- and low-income units out of a total of 75 units.
The second was the 42-unit affordable apartment project called “The Crossings” at 773
Knickerbocker Road, which was recently completed on a 2.6-acre site at a density of
16.2 units/acre. This project is 100% affordable at the very-low- and low-income levels
with deed restrictions.
The third is the three unit market rate condominium project built at 673 Modesto on .31
acres. Although this project was not subsized and did not recieve a density bonus, the
manuafactored units reached a density of 12 units per acre and still remained affordable
to low income households.
In addition to these three projects there is also 67.9 acres of R-3 zoned property in the
City with a 12/acre zoning designation and 8.74 acres with a 20/acre designation. Based
on recent development trends, all R-3 zoned multifamily parcels of can be assumed to
have a realistic potential of 10 units/acre. Though the maximum allowable density in the
R-3 zone, excluding potential density bonus, is 12 units/acre, this conservative estimate
takes into account building constraints such as steep slopes, the 100 year flood plain and
sensitive habitat. Therefore, with 67.9 acres of vacant R-3 parcesl zoned at 12/acre and
8.74 R-3 parcels zoned at 20/acre there is a potential for at least 608 multi-family units.
With the two multi-family projects that were built in the previous planning period
achieving higher densities than the “10 per acre” assumption, (The Crossings at 16.2
units/acre, and the Modesto condominiums at 12/acre), the City’s development
standards do not present a constraint to affordable housing development nor do they
constrain construction on the remaining 77.01 acres of parcels zoned for multi-family.
         2.     Special Needs Housing
State law requires cities to demonstrate
that        development          regulations
encourage         and     facilitate     the
production of a variety of housing types
for households with limited incomes as
well as persons with special needs,
including those in residential care
facilities, persons with disabilities, the
elderly, farm workers, persons needing
emergency shelter or transitional living
arrangements,        and    single     room
occupancy units. The City’s provisions
for these housing types are discussed below.
       a.    Manufactured Housing and Mobile Homes – State law requires that
             manufactured housing on permanent foundations be permitted subject to the
             same development standards and procedures as conventional residential
             construction (Government Code Sec. 65852). The City’s Development Code
             complies with this requirement. Mobile home parks are also permitted in the R-
                                              IV-5          CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

City of Big Bear Lake General Plan
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                             IV. Constraints
             3 (multi-family residential) district. These regulations are consistent with state
             law and do not pose a constraint. In addition, Program H-2.3 calls for the
             purchase of mobile home affordability covenants using redevelopment
             agency set-aside funds.
      b.     Residential Care Facilities – Residential care facilities refer to any family home,
             group home, or rehabilitation facility that provide non-medical care to
             persons in need of personal services, protection, supervision, assistance,
             guidance, or training essential for daily living. The City of Big Bear Lake refers to
             residential care facilities as “social care facilities” in the Development Code.
             Social care facilities that serve six or fewer persons are permitted by-right in all
             residential districts. Facilities serving more than six persons are conditionally
             permitted in the R-L, R-1, and R-3 districts.
      c.     Housing for Persons with Disabilities and Supportive Housing – Under some
             circumstances, zoning and development regulations can unintentionally
             hinder the provision of suitable housing for persons with disabilities. Of
             particular concern are the following issues:
                  Definition of “family”. The Development Code definition of “family” is
                   “one or more persons related by blood, marriage or legal adoption or a
                   group of persons including unrelated individuals living together as a
                   relatively permanent bon fide housekeeping unit”. This is consistent with
                   state law and poses no constraints.
                  Concentration requirements. While sections of the Development Code
                   were amended for compliance with SB 2, one section of the
                   Development Code requires that transitional housing facilities be located
                   at least 1,320 feet from another transitional housing, congregate meal or
                   homeless shelter. There are no minimum separation requirements for other
                   residential care facilities. The separation requirements for transitional
                   housing will be eliminated as part of Program H-3.4.
                  Zoning or site planning requirements. The City requires a CUP in
                   residential zones for care facilities with more than 6 occupants. CUP
                   processing typically requires 6 to 8 weeks and includes conditions
                   addressing such issues as parking and on-site supervision.
                  Parking requirements. One space for every four beds is required for care
                   facilities.
            The City’s building codes require that new residential construction comply with
            the federal American with Disabilities Act (ADA). ADA provisions include
            requirements for a minimum percentage of units in new developments to be
            fully accessible to the physical disabled. Provisions of fully accessible units may
            also increase the overall project development costs. However, unlike the UBC,
            enforcement of ADA requirements is not at the discretion of the City, but is
            mandated under federal law.
                                                  IV-6           CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

2013-2021 Housing Element                                                             IV. Constraints
            Compliance with building codes and the ADA increases the cost of housing
            production and also impacts the viability of rehabilitation of older properties
            required to be brought up to current code standards. However, these
            regulations provide minimum standards that must be complied with under
            state and federal law in order to ensure the development of safe and
            accessible housing.
            Compliance with the American’s with Disabilities Act is concurrently reviewed
            as part of the building plan review process thereby reducing processing time
            to a minimum. However, in order to further reduce architectural or other
            obstacles for persons with disabilities, the City will develop a mechanism for
            expediting the review of requests for reasonable accommodation (see
            Chapter V – Program H 3.1).
      d.     Farm Worker Housing – As discussed in Chapter 2, (Needs Assessment), the City
             of Big Bear Lake is not located within a major agricultural area and has no
             significant need for permanent on-site farm worker housing. The City’s overall
             efforts to provide and maintain affordable housing opportunities will help to
             support any agricultural or forestry workers that may choose to reside in the
             City.
      e.     Housing for the Elderly – Senior housing projects (five or more units) are
             allowed with a conditional use permit in the R-3 District. Senior housing facilities
             are regulated by Section 17.25.190 of the City’s Development Code which
             establishes minimum design standards to ensure adequate housing for seniors.
             Senior housing is also eligible for a density bonus of up to 100% (Development
             Code Sec. 17.25.200). The Development Code is not considered to be a
             constraint to the development of senior housing as the regulations are similar
             to other jurisdictions within San Bernardino County.
      f.     Emergency Shelters – An emergency shelter is a residential facility, other than
             a community care facility or temporary shelter provided following disaster,
             which provides temporary accommodations to persons or families with lower
             incomes. Such facilities may also provide meals, counseling and other services,
             as well as common areas for residents of the facility. Emergency shelters may
             have individual rooms, but are not developed with individual dwelling units,
             with the exception of a manager’s unit.
            State law (Senate Bill 2 of 2007) requires that unless adequate shelter facilities
            are available to meet a jurisdiction’s needs, emergency shelters be allowed
            by-right (i.e., without discretionary review such as a conditional use permit) in
            at least one zoning district, and may include specific development standards.
            In 2011, the City amended its Development Code to allow Emergency Shelters
            by-right in the C-5 Commercial-Industrial zone.
      g.     Transitional and Supportive Housing – Transitional housing is explicitly defined in
             the Development Code and is permitted in the R-3 district with a conditional
             use permit (CUP) and in the C-2 district with a plot plan review. Development
             standards for transitional housing facilities serving seven or more individuals are
                                                IV-7             CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

City of Big Bear Lake General Plan
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                            IV. Constraints
             regulated by Section 17.25.160 of the City’s Development Code. Supportive
             housing is not explicitly defined in the Code. SB 2 requires that transitional and
             supportive housing be considered a residential use subject only to the same
             standards and procedures as other residential uses of the same type in the
             same zone. In 2011, the City amended its Development Code to comply with
             SB 2, however one Section of the Code remains inconsistent in regards to
             provisions for Transistional Housing. Program H-3.4 in the Housing Action Plan
             includes a commitment to amend the Development Code regarding
             transitional housing in conformance with SB 2.
      h.     Single Room Occupancy – Single room occupancy facilities are small studio-
             type units and are permitted by conditional use permit in the R-3 district. A
             Conditional Use Permit takes approximately 6 to 8 weeks to prepare and
             present to the Planning Commission for approval. Development standards for
             SRO developments serving six or more residents are governed by Section
             17.25.170 (Group Living Facilities) of the Development Code and are no more
             restrictive than for other group living facilities in the City. One parking space
             per bedroom plus two manager spaces are required.
      i.     Second Units – Second dwelling units are prohibited in residential zones.
             Section 17.25.210 of the Development Code sets forth specific findings in
             support of this exclusion. Among the key findings are the high proportion of
             vacation homes rented on a short-term basis and the possibility of up to three
             accessory units in commercial zones, which encourages mixed-use
             development.
      j.     Housing for Resort Employees – As noted in the Needs Assessment (Chapter II),
             Big Bear Lake has a significant number of seasonal workers who staff the ski
             resorts and other recreational facilities. Many of these workers are young single
             persons with modest incomes who could benefit from small apartments and
             SRO-type units. In 2011 the City ammended its Development Code to allow
             extended stay lodging for up to 6 months in the R-3 Zone. A Conditional Use
             Permit is required to convert existing lodging facilities to this use. Conditions on
             the conversion limit the number of occupants based on the square footage
             of each individual cabin or unit so that they are in compliance with the
             efficiency dwelling unit standards proscribed in the California Building Code.
             Additional conditions will grant City staff access to perform annual housing
             quality inspections and may restrict the number of vehicles and amount of
             outdoor storage allowed depending on the exterior open space available to
             each unit.
         3.      Parking Requirements
Parking requirements for single family residential development are two parking spaces
per unit, regardless of the number of bedrooms in the unit. The General Plan encourages
one of the spaces to be covered, either within a garage or carport; the other may be
open.
                                                IV-8            CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

2013-2021 Housing Element                                                          IV. Constraints
Construction of new attached or detached two-, three- and four-family dwellings are
required to provide two parking spaces per dwelling unit, of which one parking space
must be covered whereas two covered space is typically the norm.
Multiple-family residential projects with 5 or more dwelling units (excluding manufactured
home parks and manufactured home subdivisions, must provide a minimum of 1 parking
space for each studio or 1-bedroom unit; 2 spaces per each 2- or 3-bedroom unit; and 3
spaces for each unit with 4 or more bedrooms. In addition, each multiple family project
shall provide a minimum of 2 guest parking spaces for each 4 units up to 12 units; 1 space
for each 4 units for the 13th to the 48th unit; and 1 space for each additional 6 units above
48 units.
The required parking is typical for most cities in San Bernardino County and is not
considered to be a constraint on the production of affordable housing. A builder
proposing to reduce the number of parking spaces would have to apply for a variance;
however, in the case of affordable housing, the City’s density bonus ordinance contains
provisions for granting additional land use concessions to affordable housing developers,
which might include a parking reduction. It is widely accepted that low-income
households have fewer cars than higher income households.
In order to facilitate mixed-use development in commercial zones, the Development
Code was amended to allow parking for residential portions of a mixed-use project to
match that required for a motel or lodge. The requirement is 1 space per guest unit, plus
2 spaces per resident manager unit, plus 1 space for every 20 guest rooms.
        4.      Infrastructure to Support Housing Development
According to the City’s Land Use Element, most of the land within the City designated for
single-family use has already been subdivided into buildable lots. Further, infrastructure
such as streets and utilities are readily available to almost every lot in the City; therefore,
availability of infrastructure is not considered to be a constraint to new housing
development.
        5.      Fees and Exactions
The City first adopted development impact fees in 1985. The fee program was revised in
1991 in response to AB 1600. Since 1991, the fee program has been amended from time
to time to reflect changing conditions and infrastructure needs. Impact fees are
intended to ensure that new growth will pay only its fair, or proportionate, share of the
cost of the cost of off-site infrastructure and facilities needed to support new
development. Table IV-2 (page IV-10) and Table IV-3 (page IV-11) provide a breakdown
of existing permit and fee costs for the development of a single-family house and multi-
family development. Construction permit fees are based on valuation.
It should be noted that the water connection and user fees include a fee for
participation in the Water Demand Offset Program established by the Department of
Water and Power. Fees paid under this program are used to offset the water usage of
                                                IV-9          CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

        6.         Permit Processing
Three levels of development review apply to residential projects depending on their type
and size.
Zoning Clearance (Sec. 17.03.240) is an administrative (i.e., non-discretionary) approval
process without public notice or hearing to determine whether a project conforms to
applicable Code requirements or previous conditions of approval. Single-family-
detached homes require only zoning clearance and building plan check. Zoning
clearance typically is completed within 1-3 days.
                                                                     IV-11               CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

City of Big Bear Lake General Plan
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                        IV. Constraints
Plot Plan Review (Sec. 17.03.160) is a discretionary process requiring public notice and
hearing by the Planning Commission. The purpose of Plot Plan Review is to ensure that
structures conform to General Plan and zoning requirements, and do not cause adverse
effects on surrounding properties. Conditions of approval are typically required to
address dedication of public easements, on- or off-site improvements, or other items
specific to the site. Findings are required, including consistency with applicable General
Plan and zoning provisions, no substantial adverse effect on abutting property, and
adequate vehicular access. Multi-family developments of 5 or more units require plot
plan review, which typically requires 6-8 weeks, followed by building plan check
(typically 4 weeks).
Conditional Use Permit (Sec. 17.03.170) is a discretionary process requiring public notice
and hearing by the Planning Commission. The CUP process is intended to provide an
opportunity for public review and evaluation of site-specific requirements and
characteristics, provide mitigation of potentially adverse impacts, and ensure ongoing
compliance with conditions of operation necessary to protect public health, safety and
welfare. The application procedure is the same as for Plot Plan Review, except that
additional relevant information may be required regarding hours of operation, provisions
for on- or off-site security, or other conditions of operation. Conditions of approval and
required findings are similar to those for Plot Plan Review with the addition of stipulations
regarding operational characteristics. Multi-family projects do not require a CUP, which
typically requires 6-8 weeks, followed by building plan check (typically 4 weeks).
For single-family subdivisions, procedures are governed by the Subdivision Map Act and
the time can vary from 6 to 18 months depending on the environmental review required
by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
Condominium projects are processed no differently than a multi-family housing complex
except that a condominium subdivision map is processed concurrently with the parent
Conditional Use Permit application. Since projects of this type do not propose to create
new parcels of land the processing timeline is shortened to 4 to 6 months.
Multi-family development is a two-stage process with a six- to eight-week plot plan
review application which is heard before the Planning Commission, followed by a plan
check process that takes about four weeks.
The permit process is typically expedited through the use of pre-application meetings
with project sponsors in which City staff provides guidance to assist architects and
developers in complying with local standards.
In order to reduce processing time and facilitate multi-family development the City has
amended its Development Code to eliminate the discretionary review process for multi-
family projects of 5 units or fewer (i.e., ministerial zoning clearance only) while larger
projects of 6+ units require only Plot Plan Review rather than a CUP.
        7.      Building Codes and Enforcement
The City has adopted the California Uniform Building Code with additions and/or
changes based on topographic, geologic and climatic conditions specific to the City of
                                              IV-12         CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013
City of Big Bear Lake General Plan
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                       IV. Constraints
Big Bear Lake. Notification of the local amendments was filed with the state Building
Standards Commission as required by law, and in a letter dated March 3, 2011 the
Commission acknowledged receipt of the City’s notice. These local amendments
include the following:
               The City has adopted additional building code requirements to address the
                State Fire Marshalls designation of Big Bear Lake as being in a High Fire
                Hazard Area
               The City has adopted a 100-lb roof load design criteria to address the build-
                up of snow on roofs during the winter months.
While these standards may add to construction costs, they are necessary to protect
public health and safety in a mountain environment.
The City seeks to coordinate its code enforcement activities with housing improvement
programs in order to make property owners aware of assistance that is available to
facilitate needed repairs, particularly for lower-income households. When code
enforcement becomes aware of problems, owners are referred to the appropriate City
or County sources for relevant program information.
Building permit fees are also based on the 1997 Uniform Administrative Code identified in
the “Service Fee Schedule” adopted by City Council Resolution No. 2006-42. These code
requirements are in compliance with the applicable provisions of the California Code of
Regulations.
Code Compliance – Code compliance activities within the City are intended to promote
the safety and character of the City. The City includes approximately seven square miles.
There are currently two code compliance officers responsible for code enforcement
activities in the City. Therefore, code enforcement activities are primarily reactive. In the
residentially designated properties, code enforcement housing efforts generally focus on
overcrowding of private vacation home rentals and property maintenance. In the past,
overcrowding of private home rentals has created noise, traffic and land use impacts to
surrounding neighbors. However, a City ordinance adopted in 1999 requiring inspections,
and a Transient Private Home Rental Enforcement Ordinance adopted in 2007 resulting
in more consistent monitoring of these units, has improved the conditions and operations
of vacation rentals.
        8.      Circulation and On- and Off-Site Improvements
Most of the land within the City of Big Bear Lake has been divided into buildable lots and
the majority of streets are already dedicated but not all streets are paved. Builders are
required to provide curbs and sidewalks only in areas where there are already curbs and
sidewalks. In areas of the City where there are neither curbs nor sidewalks and curbs and
sidewalks are not planned for, developers of individual parcels are generally not required
to provide this amenity; however, if additional roadway paving is necessary then the
developer is required to pave the roadway.
                                             IV-13         CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

City of Big Bear Lake General Plan
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                           IV. Constraints
The Circulation Element of the General Plan establishes the City’s street width standards.
Interior residential streets (secondary arterials) are required to have a standard 24foot
curb-to-curb width, with no sidewalks.
To maintain the City’s mountain rural character curbs gutters and sidewalks are not
required in residential zones and subdivisions that do not front on a major street. The City
also allows street widths of as little as 26 feet, which reduces street improvement costs.
Most parcels in the City are readily served by water, power, gas and sewer facilities.
There is a substantial fee for water and sewer hookups. Waste disposal is conducted
through a contract between the City and Big Bear Disposal. Natural gas in supplied by
Southwest Gas Corporation. Electricity is provided by Bear Valley Electric Service, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Southern California Water Company. Telephone service is
provided by Verizon (formerly GTE). Big Bear Lake has had cable television service since
the early 1960s. The City does not currently have a coordinated system of drainage for
storm water and is in the process of developing a drainage master plan. The City is
working with seven other cities and three unincorporated areas to develop a water
diversion and recycling program. There is no evidence that the minimal requirements for
on and offsite improvements are a constraint on housing development.
While these requirements for on- and off-site improvements add to the cost of housing,
they are necessary to protect the public health and safety and are not unreasonable
and are minimal in comparison to other jurisdictions.
        9.      Access to Housing Assistance
The City of Big Bear Lake is a small city with a permanent population of only 5,019 (2010)
people. Its allocation of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds is only
about $40,000 per year. The City does not directly control these funds. Instead the Big
Bear Lake City Council makes recommendations for the expenditure of this money, but
the funds are administered by the Community Development and Housing (CDH)
Department of the County of San Bernardino. All other housing programs, including
HOME, are administered by the County. The offices of CDH are an hour away in the City
of San Bernardino as are the offices of many of the service agencies that might refer
residents to these programs. It is therefore difficult for residents of Big Bear Lake to obtain
information about housing programs.
The City cannot remove this constraint through local ordinance. However, the City has
ensured that residents have access to information about housing programs by providing
notices and links on the City’s website and distributing literature informing residents about
housing programs. Additionally, it can help coordinate the development of housing and
services to homeless persons by assigning a City staff person as a housing/homeless
coordinator.
The City can further facilitate the provision of housing services by taking an active role to
ensure that both public and nonprofit agencies have appropriate office space in the
City of Big Bear Lake. There is land available within appropriate General Plan land use
designations that will accommodate these uses, as principally permitted uses. In order to
facilitate the establishment of these agencies, the City will actively assist them in site

selection and seek the cooperation of the private sector in the provision of social service
office space.
a.      Housing Information
The City continues to post notices about housing programs and links to County
departments on the City’s website. The City advertises the availability of County Housing
programs in the local paper, on its website, and also periodically provides press releases
or stories to the local newspapers about housing assistance and provides brochures for
the County’s first-time homebuyers program and the HAP program to local real estate
offices.
b.      Program Coordination
The City has assigned a City staff person to work with the City’s homeless service
providers in the development of an emergency shelter and a transitional housing
program.
B.      Non-Government Constraints
        1.      Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones,
floodplains, sensitive biological habitat, and agricultural lands. In many cases,
development of these areas is constrained by state and federal laws (e.g., FEMA
floodplain regulations, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, and the
state Fish and Game Code and Alquist-Priolo Act). Because Big Bear Lake is a mountain
community, these issues pose significant constraints to new development. The City’s land
use plans have been designed to protect sensitive areas from development, and to
protect public safety by avoiding development in hazardous areas. While these policies
constrain residential development to some extent, they are necessary to support other
public policies.
        2.      Land and Construction Costs
Land costs vary considerably in Big Bear Lake based on location, views, and proximity to
the lake, and also fluctuate with market conditions. From 2000 through 2006 real estate
values rose significantly, however the recent downturn has had a dampening effect on
prices. Allowable density has an effect on per-unit land cost, especially for multi-family
development.
Construction costs are similar throughout the mountain area since construction projects
inside and outside the City use the same contractors, building materials suppliers and
labor force. The City has no control over the cost of materials and labor.
Construction costs combined with land costs are not constraining housing development
since units continue to be built in Big Bear Lake but they do affect the affordability of
new housing in Big Bear Lake. In response, the City used redevelopment set-aside funds
                                            IV-15         CC Resolution No. 2013-18, 06/24/2013

to construct 75 affordable senior units and 42 workforce (affordable) apartment units. In
order to mitigate the constraint on housing affordability imposed by land and building
costs, the City has rezoned 8.74 acres to 20 units per acre to incourage to make larger
affordable projects more cost effective.
         3.     Financing
Financing for housing purchase and construction appears to be readily available in the
City of Big Bear Lake. There are a number of banks and mortgage lenders located in the
community and additional loans can be accessed on the Internet. Internet mortgage
sites make it possible for borrowers to compare rates and shop for the best terms. The San
Bernardino County Department of Economic and Community Development also offers a
first-time homeowner program and down payment assistance. Six banks throughout the
County process applications for these loans.
C.       Fair Housing
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire
neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical or economic conditions in
the area (“redlining”). In monitoring new construction sales, re-sales of existing homes,
and permits for remodeling, it would not appear that redlining is practiced in any area of
the City.
State law also prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property
transactions, and it is the City’s policy to uphold the law in this regard. The City also
participates in a County consortium to support the Inland Mediation Board, a non-profit
organization that provides landlord-tenant and fair housing counseling services in
participating cities. Literature describing available services is available to interested
parties at City Hall, and a link to Inland Mediation Board is available on the City’s
website.

V.      HOUSING ACTION PLAN
A.      Goals and Policies
The housing goals of Big Bear Lake are to:
        Goal H1        Provide adequate sites for housing.
        Goal H2        Assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of
                       low- and moderate-income households.
        Goal H3        Address and where appropriate and legally possible, remove
                       governmental constraints.

        Policy H1.2    Eliminate barriers to housing development for all income groups
                       arising from incompatibility of the zoning code and the general plan
                       or unnecessarily lengthy, ambiguous or conflicting requirements of
                       the development review and permitting process.
        Policy H2.1    Utilize federal, state, and local housing subsidies to produce

B.      Housing Programs
This section describes the City’s housing programs for the 2013-2021 planning period,
including the responsible agency, timeframe, funding source and objectives. It should be
noted that where funding sources list “General Fund”, these may consist of in-kind staff
services, expedited permit processing, and/or reduced permitting fees.

            Segments of the Community
            H 1.1    Adequate Sites
            In order to ensure that adequate sites are available, the City will incorporate

                       Evaluation of the Prior Housing Element
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate the
effectiveness of the existing Housing Element, the appropriateness of goals, objectives
and policies, and the progress in implementing programs for the previous planning
period. This appendix contains a review the housing goals, policies, and programs of the
previous housing element, and evaluates the degree to which these programs have
been implemented during the previous planning period, 2008 through 2014. This analysis
also includes an assessment of the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies. The
findings from this evaluation have been instrumental in determining the City’s 2013
Housing Implementation Program.
Table A-1 summarizes the programs contained in the previous Housing Element along
with the source of funding, program objectives, accomplishments, and implications for
future policies and actions.
Table A-2 evaluates the appropriateness of previous goals and policies, and identifies
any changes that are called for in response to the City’s experience during the past
planning period.
Table A-3 presents the City’s progress in meeting the quantified objectives from the
previous Housing Element.

     a. Sites for Lower-Income Housing
All single-family lots were assigned to the Above-moderate category. All parcels currently
zoned R-3 (multi-family) were conservatively assigned to the Moderate-income category.
The City has met the 2008-2014 Program H-1.1 to amend the Development Code to
increase the maximum density from 12 to 20 units/acre for R-3 parcels that are at least 2
acres in size. These parcels, shown in Figure B-2, encompass approximately 8.74 total
acres and can accommodate at least 173 units, which exceeds the City’s net remaining
need for lower-income households of 153 units (see Table III-2).
Program H-2.1 describes the City’s efforts to facilitate development of lower-income
housing using local and other state and federal funding sources.
     b. Realistic Development Capacity
Single-Family Parcels. For parcels zoned for single-family development, the estimated
number of units is based on the minimum lot size. Some parcels would require approval
of a subdivision map in order to allow the estimated number of units. Based on this
methodology, vacant parcels have a potential for 1,449 additional single-family homes.
Multi-Family Parcels. In order to estimate the realistic development capacity of vacant
multi-family sites, a review of recent development trends was conducted. Table B-3
summarizes multi-family (condo or apartment) projects approved since 2004. Of these 14
projects, all but one were small parcels of less than one-half acre. The average density of
these small projects was approximately 10 units/acre. The Development Code allows
construction on any legally-subdivided lot regardless of size, as long as setback
requirements can be met. The City lot consolidation process is a simple administrative
review performed by the City’s engineering department. An application requires a title
policy verifying ownership and a survey describing the new legal description. It takes less
than one week to review a completed application with no public hearing required.
A 42-unit affordable apartment project (773 Knickerbocker Road) was recently
approved on a 2.6-acre site, with a density of 16.2 units/acre. This project will be 100%
affordable at the very-low- and low-income levels with deed restrictions. Based on these
recent development trends, all parcels of less than one acre were assigned a realistic
potential of 10 units/acre, while parcels of one acre or more were assigned a density of
12 unis/acre, except parcels where special considerations were known to exist (e.g., the
17-acre parcel which was estimated at only 4 additional units since it is impacted by a
100-year flood plain, endangered plants and sensitive habitat. While the maximum
allowable density in the R-3 zone, excluding potential density bonus, is 12 units/acre, this
is considered to be a conservative estimate for larger parcels since the two larger multi-
family projects built or approved in the previous planning period achieved significantly
higher densities (Mountain Meadows senior affordable apartments at 27 units/acre, and
773 Knickerbocker Road at 16.2 units/acre). Based on this conservative methodology,
there is capacity for at least 556 multi-family units on vacant parcels based on current
zoning.

2013-2021 Housing Element                           Appendix B – Residential Land Inventory
As noted above, the Development Code was amended to increase the maximum
density from 12 to 20 units/acre for R-3 parcels that are at least 2 acres in size. These
parcels, shown in Figure B-2, encompass approximately 8.74 total acres and can
accommodate at least 173 units, which exceeds the City’s net remaining need for lower-
income households of 153 units.
Mixed Use on Commercial Parcels. Although residential units are permitted as an
accessory use on commercially-zoned parcels, the total realistic residential capacity of
these parcels has not been estimated since adequate sites will be provided on
residentially zoned land.

to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties numerous
opportunities for review and comment. The City distributed flyers to contacts listed in C-1,
and dropped off flyers at community centers such as the local library and senior center.
Workshops were also advertised online on the City’s
homepage and through e-blasts (emails to persons
signed up on the City’s listserve).
Public notices (1/8 page display ads) for all Housing
