I.      INTRODUCTION
In order to plan for the development of adequate housing for everyone in
the community, a housing element is prepared as a part of a city’s
general plan. This Housing Element specifically addresses housing needs
and resources in Dixon. Section I provides a brief overview of Dixon and
its housing issues, the purpose and content of the element, the public
participation process undertaken to assist in the development of the
element, and the Housing Element’s relationship with the rest of the
General Plan.
A.      COMMUNITY CONTEXT
Dixon is located in eastern Solano County, approximately 21 miles southwest of Sacramento and
65 miles east of San Francisco (see Figure I-1). Since its incorporation in 1878, Dixon has grown
from a small town of about 300 residents to a community of over 18,500. Much of this growth has
occurred since the 1950s, and Dixon’s population has continued to grow as more and more
families have been attracted because of the city’s location and rural small-town character.
Though more businesses have located in the city, Dixon remains a community with rich
agricultural roots. Unlike much of the rest of the northern Bay Area, Dixon has flat terrain and
climate similar to that of the Central Valley. Dixon is home to the annual Lambtown Festival as
well as the May Fair, one of the oldest state fairs in California.
Dixon is primarily a residential community, with much of its developed land occupied by housing.
The predominant housing type is single-family homes, representing 83 percent of the housing
stock. Multi-family developments, including apartment and condominium complexes, comprise
the remaining 17 percent of the dwelling units. As is the case in many communities throughout
the region, housing costs in Dixon have increased over the last year. The median price of a single-
family home sold in Dixon in 2013 was $275,000, an increase of 31 percent over the previous year.
Much of the housing in Dixon has been built in the last 25 years and is in relatively good
condition. However, a recent study of the city’s housing stock indicates that some homes,
particularly those in parts of the former redevelopment area, are older and have a need for repairs
and maintenance. The City promotes home improvement through its code enforcement activities
as well as its new Housing Rehabilitation Program. Continued City efforts are important to help
maintain and improve Dixon’s housing.
February 2015                                                       Dixon Housing Element Update

                                                              Housing Element
According to projections by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) of the counties in
the ABAG region, Solano County is expected to have the largest percentage increase in jobs over
the next 20 years. Based on ABAG’s projections, Dixon’s population is projected to increase by
approximately 2,350 residents and approximately 1,300 new jobs are expected to be added by
2040. In addition, growth in both the Sacramento area and throughout Solano County is expected
to impact the local housing market.
The City of Dixon is faced with a number of important housing issues: (1) preserving and
enhancing housing for all segments of the population; (2) providing new housing in response to
anticipated growth; (3) maintaining and improving the quality of the housing stock; and
(4) achieving a balance between jobs and housing. This Housing Element provides policies and
programs to address these issues.
B.      STATE POLICY AND AUTHORIZATION
The California Legislature has declared that the availability of housing is of vital statewide
importance, and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for
every California family is a priority of the highest order. Recognizing the important role of local
government in the pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all cities and counties
prepare a housing element as part of their comprehensive general plan.
State law requires housing elements to be updated at least every five years to reflect a
community’s changing housing needs. The Dixon Housing Element was last updated in August
2009 to cover a five-year period spanning 2009 through 2014. The 5th cycle Housing Element
planning period is 2015–2023. The planning period has changed from five years to eight years due
to state law stemming from Senate Bill 375.
Unlike other General Plan elements, the Housing Element is the only element subject to review
and certification by a state agency to determine its compliance with state laws. The draft 2015–
2023 Dixon Housing Element must be submitted to the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) for review. At the end of the review period, which is typically 60
days, HCD will provide its review to the City, documenting any concerns with the analysis, goals,
policies, and programs contained in the draft Housing Element. To receive a letter of compliance
from HCD, the City must work with HCD to revise the draft Housing Element, addressing all
concerns to a mutually acceptable level. To formalize the certification, the City must submit the
adopted Housing Element for a final HCD review to ensure that the agreed-upon changes have
been incorporated into the adopted element. If a mutually acceptable housing plan cannot be
achieved due to differences in policy direction, the City may adopt findings that indicate why the
City believes the Housing Element is in substantial compliance with state laws.
February 2015                                                      Dixon Housing Element Update
                                                I-3

                Housing Element
A state-certified Housing Element offers a number of significant benefits to the community,
including:
            Providing greater protection from legal challenges to the Housing Element
            Receiving priority for state housing funds, including funds for:
           o    New construction
           o    Acquisition and rehabilitation
           o    Homeownership
           o    Infill incentives
            Avoiding possible financial penalties associated with future legislation
C.      ROLE AND CONTENT OF HOUSING ELEMENT
The Housing Element of the General Plan has two purposes: (1) to provide an assessment of both
current and future housing needs and constraints in meeting these needs; and (2) to provide a
housing strategy with goals, policies, and programs that address the identified needs.
This Housing Element represents the City of Dixon’s commitment to the development and
improvement of housing with specific goals for the 2015–2023 period. This element consists of the
following major components:
            An analysis of the city’s demographic profile, housing characteristics, and existing
             and future housing needs (Section II);
            A review of potential market, governmental, and environmental constraints to
             meeting Dixon’s identified housing needs (Section III);
            An evaluation of the land, financial, and organizational resources available to address
             the City’s identified housing needs goals (Section IV); and
            A presentation of the City’s plan to address the identified housing needs, including
             housing goals, policies, and programs (Section V).
Dixon Housing Element Update                                                          February 2015

                                                               Housing Element
D.      DATA SOURCES
Various sources of information are used to prepare the Housing Element. The background data is
primarily drawn from the ABAG data packet which includes data from the 2010 Census of
population and housing are used to a large extent in the element. While the 2010 Census is still
considered the most reliable source of demographic information, it has now been four years since
the data was collected and therefore the validity of the numbers has decreased. To correct this,
the City has occasionally used 2013 projections provided by the California Department of Finance
and data from the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS provides estimates of numerous
housing-related indictors based on samples averaged over a five-year period. Where the US
Census provides complete counts of various demographic indicators, the ACS provides estimates
based on statistically significant samples. Due to the small size of the sample taken in Dixon, the
estimates reported by the ACS have large margins of error. Where ACS data is used, the numbers
should not be interpreted as absolute fact, but rather as a tool to illustrate general proportion or
scale. Additional sources are used to supplement limited 2010 Census information:
            Demographic and housing data provided by ABAG, the California Employment
             Development Department, and the state Department of Finance Economic
             Development Department and Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy data
             (CHAS).
            Housing market information, such as home sales, rents, and vacancies, is updated by
             surveys and Data Quick Services (dqnews.com).
            Housing condition information is provided by recent City studies.
            Public and nonprofit agencies are consulted for data on special needs groups, the
             services available to them, and gaps in the system.
            Lending patterns for home purchase and home improvement loans are provided
             using the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) database and data from Wells
             Fargo (wellsfargo.com).
E.      PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Housing Element law requires the City to make a diligent effort to facilitate the participation of all
segments of the community during the preparation its Housing Element update. A more detailed
description of each effort is discussed below.
Housing Element Outreach
Public Workshop, July 24, 2014
The City of Dixon held a public workshop on July 24, 2014. The meeting started with a
presentation on the Housing Element update process, the schedule and reported back on the
February 2015                                                       Dixon Housing Element Update
                                               I-5

               Housing Element
housing workshop held in January 2014. Following the presentation the group of residents in
attendance was asked to review several community survey samples and provide feedback and
what questions they would like to see in a community survey. In addition, they provided their
comments on the housing element update process and what changes they would like to see to this
update. Feedback on the survey was to be provided to City staff to possibly be incorporated into
the General Plan update process scheduled to begin in the Fall of 2014.
The following are a list of comments received at the meeting.
           Include a definition and description for small town character in the Housing Element
            as well as the updated General Plan.
           Remove the multi- family requirement in the Old Town area.
           Include a program to form a Housing Committee.
           No housing should be allowed to be built near the railroad tracks. There will be oil
            tankers on the railroad tracks near housing and there should be a disaster relief plan
            in place.
           It was identified that the St. Anton housing project does not include units affordable
            to low-income and the rents were just raised.
           City staff to follow up on the affordability of the Heritage Commons Apartments.
           The City should consider an inclusionary housing program; this should be one of the
            tasks for the housing committee to consider.
           It was identified that there is possible resentment over the farm worker housing in
            the community.
           Senior housing needs two bedrooms.
           The City needs to incentivize housing and work with developers to reduce fees for
            affordable housing projects.
           The City should consider adopting a drought ordinance and establish a program for
            low maintenance plants to help reduce water use.
Public Workshop, October 22, 2014
The City of Dixon held a public workshop on October 22, 2014. The meeting started with a
presentation on the Housing Element update process, the public draft Housing Element, the
schedule and reported back on the housing workshop held in July 2014. The public review draft
Dixon Housing Element Update                                                        February 2015

                                                            Housing Element
Housing Element was made available in August 2014. The City received input on the draft
Housing Element. Several members of the community attended.
Planning Commission Hearing, November 18, 2014
The City held a hearing with the Planning Commission to introduce the public review draft
Housing Element on November 18, 2014. City staff and the consultant provided a presentation on
the draft Housing Element, the Housing Element process and input received and edits made since
release of the public review draft in September.
COMMISSION QUESTIONS
Many of the housing units called for under the previous Housing Element RHNA haven’t been
built. One exception is Heritage Commons and a few other units. Heritage Commons will address
good percentage of the lower-income RHNA obligation.
STAFF COMMENTS
Additional Planning Commission comments should be provided at next meeting in December.
The staff will provided an updated version of the document for that meeting with edits that have
been made since release of the public review draft.
PUBLIC COMMENTS
       Refer to her written comments from January workshop regarding Old Town, downzoning,
        and the proposed Priority Development Area (PDA).
       Want downzoning considered to some degree, although not all single-family zones. Want
        to maintain lot sizes and setbacks.
       Corrections to at-risk housing and development standards in draft Housing Element made
        as a result of comments from public.
       There are other inaccuracies in the element and inconsistencies. Not going to go through
        one by one.
       Thank you for presentation.
       Housing Element is a critical component of the General Plan. General Plan committee
        should be involved, not bypassed.
       Concern that process has been going for some time, but public only more recently
        involved.
       In 2002, single-family homes in Old Town were declared non-conforming based on
        rezoning to meet needs for the RHNA. It was all done without much public notification.

     Had public been more involved in this update, errors would have caught.
     At the October workshop, it was implied that stakeholder meetings would be public. Now
      we’re changing that?
     In other communities, postcards have been used to publicize General Plan matters.
     Cannot comment directly to HCD if we don’t comment here.
     USC/DOF studies show CA population is only increasing slightly. ABAG advocated for
      higher numbers.
     Didn’t do much with Old Town. In 2002 Housing Element, City rezoned Old Town, didn’t
      tell anyone. Some owners can’t refinance. This is unfortunate.
     PDAs: Suspect that we’ll find out more after the Housing Element update is completed.
     Noise Ordinance: many cities have noise ordinances adopted in the Housing Element.
     Civil rights violations- B Street undercrossing noise affecting minorities, elderly, those
      with health problems.
     We can’t enforce the noise standards.
     Noise exceeded 90dB during this period. Can cause hearing loss.
     Can send noise ordinance examples from other communities.
     Small-Town Character: Has written a concept. It’s important. Need a definition!
      (Definition was read and sent to clerk).
     Housing Committee:
           o  Community Development Director recommended that there be no Housing
              Committee.
           o  Had we had a housing committee, would have gotten a lot of comments.
           o  Should go forward with this.
     Train Station:
           o  Want a policy to enforce prohibition of housing near the train station.
           o  Much confusion over train station.

       “Small-Town” Character. – Came here in 1950 as small town. It’s casual, friendly. It’s hard
       to ensure that a small town stays small.
      A while ago, there very few housing units in town. Private residents and financial
       institutions are holding units. Not sure how big a problem this is.
           o   Request informal inquiry into this.
      Public input should be more formally encouraged.
      Work harder to get public input.
      There’s a housing shortage here, need more housing available for purchase.
      There isn’t enough lighting on SR 113. It is dangerous and unsafe to walk.
      Sometimes it’s a travesty how residents are received by Council. People should be
       encouraged to participate!! Why does our staff discourage resident involvement? We need
       a housing committee.
           o   This was denied previously by Council!
           o   Don’t need to be told what’s required by State by consultant! We can figure it out.
      Who are the “Stakeholders?” It’s the residents that should help.
      What about homeowners? We support this town! Why are citizens not welcome at
       meetings, why don’t they feel involved/ supported?
      Housing should not be located near railroad tracks. Oil tankers are coming through.
      Housing Commission could get others in community involved.
      SR 113- needs more lighting, especially for pedestrians. A Street also needs more lighting.
      What types of input do you want from us? How can we help you?

     Focused on each group’s particular interests.
     How and when are the meetings to be held?
           o   It’s not meant to be a public meeting. But, what if some folks want to be in the
               meeting? But, need to stay focused.
           o   To listen and observe would be okay.
     What about opportunity for 1 Planning Commission member with 1 resident?
           o   Allows for input and to stay focused
     If those meetings aren’t governed in a way to keep focus, they wouldn’t work.
     Wouldn’t mind attending as Planning Commission member. Could be involved in a way
      that wouldn’t compromise decision-making process. If Commissioners are willing, let’s
      find out.
           o   Ritchey – Sr. Citizens
           o   Johnson – would like to do all
     Could identify 2 Commissioners: + resident/ citizen
     Open up the meetings for resident participation. Assign one person to see each group.
     If interested, let’s establish it tonight.
ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENTS
     Don’t hear perspectives from “representatives,” hear them from the people themselves!
      Talk with more than just a representative!
     Suggest adding Cathy Morris – Methodist Church Pastor
           o   Knowledgeable and objective
     There can be kickbacks to people who participate without public oversight.
     Stakeholder meetings would be good for Planning Commission to attend.
           o   Planning Commission members to attend Stakeholder meetings:

      Noise: We have standards, but not an ordinance.
           o   Staff has drafted an ordinance, it is almost done.
      GPAC: work on noise element first, to match the ordinance
      Noise will be one of first priorities.
      Let’s get to work! Bring it on, we need to address it! Let’s work on it!
      Do any Stakeholders have more of a concern with noise than others?
           o   Maybe Seniors. But discussion needs to relate to housing – not broader community
               issues.
           o   If other cities have seen “small-town”, “committee”, “noise” in context of general
               plan Housing Element, let’s look at it.
           o   Good presentation.
           o   General Plan Committee could have attended tonight!
           o   If there are errors please bring them up. Let’s discuss and resolve.
           o   Can there be two or more of the public at stakeholder meetings?
                      1 person from Commission and 1 from public? Observers, just listening.
                       (provide contact info)
           o   Fee Schedule ($45,000 to $50,000 per unit): This may be a place to start on
               affordable housing.
                      If built by non profits, we can’t recover fees through property taxes.
           o   Better salaries also provide for more affordable housing.

Planning Commission Hearing, December 16, 2014
The City held a hearing with the Planning Commission to receive additional comments on the
public review draft Housing Element on December 16, 2014. The consultant reported back on
stakeholder meetings held earlier in the day. Four members of the community attended. The
Planning Commission recommended forwarding the draft to the City Council for their
consideration.
COMMISSION QUESTIONS/COMMENTS
           Are changes needed to the Title 24 reference in the draft Housing Element?
           Page III-3 regarding the Southwest Affordable Housing site
           o   Is the current zoning correct?
           o   City Staff: no
           Page V-4 and V-38 – Measure B exemptions program – keep or revise?
           Table III-2 – minimum site area?
           Table III-4 – the revisions have clarified the standards
           There is no homeless shelter in Dixon
           Homeless numbers may be small (24 people were counted in 2012).
           City staff: how was establishment of shelter in Vacaville done?
PUBLIC COMMENTS
           Glad for the revisions to the document
           Will provide more revisions if needed
           Stakeholder meetings should have happened earlier in the process
           Some of the participants in the stakeholder meetings may be misinformed regarding:
           o   Income levels served at Heritage Commons
           o   Need for senior housing in Dixon. It is debatable. Has heard that Heritage
               Commons had to recruit residents.
           Measure B – Does not want Old Town excluded from Measure B

           o   Don’t concentrate multi-family housing in one area
           Consider an inclusionary housing ordinance or policy with required onsite
            construction of units.
           Not happy about only being allowed to observe at stakeholder meetings.
           If housing development was normal in the last five years, how much housing would
            have been built?
           Dixon shouldn’t be a magnate for low-cost housing.
           Dixon is planning for 732 new houses.
           Solano County is growing fast
           Does not agree that there isn’t enough extremely low-income housing for seniors.
           Should ask the Police Department about homeless numbers.
           City should find a good grantwriter to get a homeless shelter if the homeless shelter
            is a desire of the community.
           Take a closer look at Measure B.
           It was a big mistake to rezone Old Town.
           The City has received a grant for a PDA. Thinks that per ABAG guidelines for those
            grants that 70 percent of the City’s future high density housing will be slated for Old
            Town.
           It was wrong to ask the observers not to speak in the stakeholder meetings.
           Be careful and don’t rubber stamp the Housing Element.
           The Housing Committee was necessary.
           City is in a hurry to approve the Housing Element.
           People don’t show up to meetings because they don’t think they will be heard.
           Wants a set up community structure for providing input like standing committees
            including the housing committee.
           Decision makers should be receptive to public comments.

             Housing Element
          Agrees that people don’t attend because they don’t feel heard.
          The City Council held a special meeting last January on the PDA. It was very well
           attended. People who live in Old Town don’t want more multi-family housing there.
         o    Was encouraged by the omnibus process but discouraged about what happens at
              the Council level.
          Old Town group has done a “dear neighbor” letter to keep neighbors updated on
           planning in the City.
ADDITIONAL COMMISSION QUESTIONS/COMMENTS
          Tough to recommend forwarding the draft without all the stakeholder meetings
           complete
          Concerned about Measure B
          Implement Measure B no matter what
          Upset that community members at the stakeholder meetings were asked to observe
           only
          Not sure if homeless shelter is needed
          Pleased with what the senior committee said and felt it was reflective of what is in
           the draft Housing Element.
          Invited all attendees at the first stakeholder meeting to tonight’s hearing. They did
           not attend.
STAFF COMMENTS/INPUT
          Purpose of upcoming stakeholder meetings with church and Interact are to hear from
           the Hispanic community (church) and local youth (Interact).
          Hard to get assisted living here due to lack of medical facilities (cost to transport via
           ambulance to other cities) or other transportation to doctor’s appointments.
          Measure B is only addressed in the Housing Element and does affect meeting the
           RHNA.
          City has a de facto Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. Most big developments have a
           Development Agreement that requires affordable housing.
          Agrees that an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance should be adopted.

ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENTS
            When the document comes back to the Planning Commission it will be after HCD’s
             review and changes are unlikely
            The General Plan Committee should have had input on the Housing Element. That
             committee was put on hiatus.
            The Housing Element due date is not a surprise
            The business community is being favored
            Need to allow for all input to occur
ADDITIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION COMMENTS
            Don’t want to approve
            Want Measure B revisited to include Old Town (former RDA) in Measure B.
            What about the Housing Committee?
            o   City staff: There is a program in the draft Housing Element to bring back a
                Housing Committee. The Planning Commission could vote to prioritize this
                program.
City Council Hearing, January 27, 2015
The City Council reviewed the amended draft Housing Element and received input on January 27,
2015. Several members of the public were in attendance. The speakers were some of the same
community members who spoke at the December 16th Planning Commission hearing. The
comments replicated comments made at that Planning Commission hearing. The City Council
approved submittal of the draft to HCD for their 60-day review.
Consultations
As part of the outreach process the City and the consultant reached out to several organizations
to get input on the Housing Element update process and identify needs in the community. On
December 16th, 2014 and January 27th 2015 meetings with stakeholders were conducted. These
provided an opportunity for key stakeholders to provide input in a small group setting. Planning
Commissioner and some community members also attended the meetings. The City met with the
following parties:
       Dixon Family Services
       Senior Advocacy Committee
       Interact (High School)

                Housing Element
The following issues/topic areas were most important to the organizations that participated in the
interviews:
       Lack of transportation options for seniors who don’t drive
       Need more housing for seniors slightly above lower-income. Location and size are also
        important in senior housing.
       Existing senior developments don’t often accept those with extremely low-incomes
       Some seniors are house-poor meaning they own their homes but have little other capital
       Would like to survey seniors to see who is house poor and has other issues.
       What is the percent of seniors in poverty in Dixon?
       Need more board and care and assisted living facilities for seniors. Dixon does have
        Alzheimer’s and other housing for seniors. Lack of hospital facilities is part of why assisted
        living facilities have not located in Dixon.
       Reduction in meal programs for seniors is an issue.
       Barriers to getting into housing for individuals served by Dixon Family Services.
             o   Insufficient funds and bad credit and rental history are barriers to housing for
                 clients. They have services to assist with credit issues.
             o   Hard to qualify/ show continuous work history (sometimes related substance
                 abuse issues).
             o   Hard to come up with a down payment or deposit.
       Rental assistance has restrictive parameters and it is hard to demonstrate ability to pay
        over time.
       Insufficient or absent support services in Dixon
             o   Emergency shelters
       Homeless had HUD vouchers for a while and some city money for a while, not anymore,
        not a long term solution though.
       There has been an increase in homeless folks coming in asking for help. Some people do
        not want to live in a shelter. Sometimes this is pet related. People with small children are
        often more willing to go to a shelter.

        Some homeless served are local some are passing through.
        Laws regarding child neglect have changed a lot recently
        A seasonal shelter is needed in Dixon.
        It’s hard to get an accurate homeless count.
        Homeless families that want help usually get help.
        Needs have shifted – much more regarding unemployment and lack of housing than it
         used to be (recession related).
             Working poor are underserved. It is hard for them to qualify for help. There should be more
              of a graduated scale for assistance.
             Dixon is small town community with lots of ties to tradition and a great place to grow up.
             The students preferred the community to stay the way it is as a small town and don’t mind
              going to Davis and Vacaville to go shopping go to the movies.
             The things student utilize the most are the parks, baseball fields, public pool and the
              community library.
Other Related Outreach
The City held a public workshop to prepare for the upcoming Housing Element update on January
16, 2014, at 6 pm at City Hall. The meeting was noticed in the paper and on the City’s website; a
City email blast with was sent out and a letter inviting service providers in the region was also
sent out. Roughly 40 local residents were in attendance as well as the Community Development
Department consultant. The meeting started out with a brief presentation made by the
consultant. The presentation included Housing Element requirements, relevant legislation, an
overview of the previous Housing Element and accomplishments, and lastly, a summary of the
eligibility criteria for the 5th round Housing Element update due to be adopted by January 31,
2015.
Following the presentation was a roundtable discussion about needs and issues in the
community. There were also three letters (attached) submitted by local residents.
The following is a list of issues/concerns that were identified at the meeting.
        Several residents expressed concerns about allowing multifamily housing in the Old Town
         area of town and would like to see Program 3.2.2 removed from the current Housing
         Element which required amendments to RM-2 Zone and the addition of RM-3 and RM-4
         Zones to allow multifamily housing.
February 2015                                                             Dixon Housing Element Update

              Housing Element
     A need for a housing rehabilitation program was identified, particularly a rehabilitation
      program for seniors so they can age in place.
     Noise decibel levels should be consistent throughout the city and noise decibel levels in
      multifamily areas should be reduced.
     Residents would like to be included in the identification of new affordable housing
      projects and would prefer to not see an overconcentration of affordable housing in parts of
      the community.
     Median home prices and the process for determining what qualifies as an “affordable”
      housing unit should be included in the Housing Element.
     Encourage infill housing opportunities within the Housing Element update.
     Small-town character: protect it and maintain it.
     Make sure that the Housing Element Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) is
      within the City’s Measure B allocation.
     There should be free public parking.
     All the sidewalks in downtown/Old Town should be ADA-compliant.
     Public safety is a concern in terms of enforcing speed limits; well-lit streets and tree-lined
      streets help reduce pollution. Any new highways need to be sound proofed.
     Implement City ordinances and enforce code violations.
     Affordable housing should be done through trailer parks that have amenities.
     Small-town character needs to be defined.
     Residents want a citizen-based Housing Committee.
     The Committee would review inclusionary ordinances to prepare an affordable housing
      policy for Dixon.
     The City should use UC Davis students to survey the number of second units in the city
      and the City should meet the RHNA through second units.
     The Pulte Housing project is an example of “stack and pack” and doesn’t have adequate
      setbacks.
     When is the passenger train coming to Dixon?

       Improve the bus system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
       Use SurveyMonkey to identify the housing market needs in terms of priority development
        areas, needs for school buses, parking close to downtown, overcrowding, and Ready Ride.
       Housing should have a link to air quality and there shouldn’t be housing near railroad
        tracks.
       Identify transportation plan and address traffic issues before multifamily projects are built.
       Research grants for Ready Ride service and programs/grants funds to assist the aging
        population.
       Measure B needs to be revisited and revised.
       High density housing is not reflective of the character and livability of Dixon.
F.      RELATIONSHIP TO GENERAL PLAN
The 2015–2023 Housing Element is an important component of the City’s General Plan. The City
of Dixon adopted its General Plan in 1993 and is currently preparing to update the remainder of
the plan. The City’s General Plan comprises seven state-mandated elements that address land use,
housing, circulation, conservation, open space, noise, and safety and one optional element, Air
Quality and Energy. These topics are addressed in the following chapters of the 1993 Dixon
General Plan: (1) Introduction; (2) Urban Development and Community Design; (3) Natural
Environment; (4) Housing; (5) Economic Development; (6) Transportation and Circulation; and
(7) Public Services and Facilities.
The Housing Element goals should be interpreted and implemented consistent with the goals
contained in other elements. The Housing Element does not propose significant change to any
other element of the City’s General Plan. Due to the passage of Assembly Bill (AB) 162 relating to
flood protection in 2007, the City may be required to amend the Safety and Conservation
elements of the General Plan. If amendments are needed, the Housing Element will be amended
to be consistent with the Natural Environment and Public Services and Facilities elements.

II.      HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Addressing the current and future housing needs of Dixon residents requires a comprehensive
assessment of the housing needs. An understanding of housing needs provides the basis for an
appropriate and adequate housing plan (refer to Section V). This section presents an analysis of
the demographic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics that may affect housing needs in
Dixon.
A.       POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
The type and amount of housing need in a community is largely determined by population
growth and demographic characteristics such as age, household size, occupation, and income.
Cultural preferences may also affect housing choice.
1.       Population Trends
Dixon is the second smallest city in Solano County, with a 2013 population of 18,538, according to
the California Department of Finance (DOF). The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG)
projects that Dixon will grow by 13 percent between 2010 and 2040, an increase of 2349 residents
(Table II-1). Of the seven cities in Solano County, Dixon is anticipated to have the smallest level
of growth between 2010 and 2040.
Table II-1 shows existing and projected growth for all incorporated cities in Solano County
between 2000 and 2040. Based on ABAG projections, all are anticipated to see increasing growth.

2.        Age Characteristics
Each age group has distinct lifestyles, family types and sizes, income levels, and housing
preferences. As people move through each stage of life, housing needs and preferences also
change. As a result, evaluating the age characteristics and trends of a community are important in
determining existing and future housing needs. Table II-2 shows the age characteristics of Dixon
residents in 2000 and 2010.

 Source: 2000 and 2010 US Census
Based on national housing studies, a population with a high proportion of young adults generally
indicates a need for rental units and first-time homebuyer or first move-up opportunities,
including condominiums, townhomes, or small single-family homes. Middle-aged residents
typically occupy larger homes and are usually at the peak of earning power. Senior residents are
mostly homeowners and typically occupy single-family homes. However, as the senior population
ages, the demand for smaller housing or specialized residential developments, such as assisted
living facilities or active adult communities, is expected to grow.
The 2000 and 2010 Census reveal several important trends that affect housing need and demand
in Dixon. The population of most age groups in Dixon increased during the period from 2000 to
2010. The largest population increase was seen in the 55–64 age range, which saw an increase of 78
percent. The largest negative percent change was seen in the 35–44 age range, with a decrease of
4 percent.

3.       Race and Ethnicity
Dixon, like the rest of Solano County, has experienced changes in the racial and ethnic
composition of the population. These changes may have implications for housing needs to the
extent that cultural preferences may affect housing choices.
While Dixon has become more diverse over the past ten years, the majority of city residents in
2000 (58 percent) and 2010 (49 percent) were White as shown in Table II-3. However, the White
population was the only race which saw a decrease in 2010, with a 3 percent decrease in
population, or approximately 280 residents. The ethnicity with the largest increase was”some
other race,” which doubled its population, increasing 108 percent. Hispanics comprised the
second largest ethnic group in Dixon, consisting of 40 percent of the population in 2010.

4.       Employment
Employment has an important impact on housing needs. Different jobs and associated income
levels determine the type and size of residence a household can afford. Employment growth in the
region typically increases housing demand.
Jobs held by Dixon residents in 2011 were primarily concentrated in the managerial/professional
and education/health care sectors; this was similar to jobs in 2000. As was the case with
educational attainment, the distribution of jobs among the occupation categories was very similar
to that of Solano County as a whole. As Table II-4 indicates, in 2011 approximately 19 percent of
residents were employed in education or health care occupations. Managerial and professional
jobs, which typically garner higher wages, constituted the other major category, also employing
20 percent of Dixon residents in 2011, up 1 percent from 2000.

Table II-5 identifies the major employers in Dixon and Solano County. Employers such as Travis
Air Force Base, Kaiser Hospitals, and North Bay Medical Center were among those in the largest
employer size class in the county. The largest employer in Dixon is Walmart, with between 250
and 499 employees.

The California Employment Development Department (EDD) produces an Occupational
Employment and Wage Data spreadsheet by metropolitan statistical area yearly. Table II-6 shows
employment projections from 2010 through 2020 as related to job growth for the Vallejo-Fairfield
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). During the next six years, new employment in the Vallejo-
Fairfield MSA is expected to be concentrated in a variety of occupations ranging from
construction to management. When comparing these annual incomes to the California
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) median income for 2014 ($82,600),
only one occupational group is above this median income.
Occupations in Table II-6 include:
        Construction and extraction occupations: boilermakers, brickmasons, and carpenters
        Food preparation and serving related: restaurant workers, chefs, servers
        Sales and related occupations: retail sales workers, cashiers, and advertising sales agents

           practitioners, dentists, dietitians and nutritionists, and pharmacists
          Transportation and material moving occupations: commercial pilots, motor vehicle
           operators, and bus drivers
          Management occupations: top chefs, marketing managers, and engineering managers
          Education, training, and library occupations: teachers, librarians, and instructional
           coordinators
          Business and financial operations occupations: business operations specialists, wholesale
           and retail buyers, and purchasing agents
Of these nine occupational groups, the highest annual salary falls under the Healthcare group at
$98,621. The lowest annual salary is in the Food Preparation and Serving related occupations at
$19,279.

Based on ABAG’s Smart Growth Strategy Report, both regional and local job growth have an
impact on the housing market. Furthermore, job growth in areas without adequate housing can
have significant detrimental effects on the quality of life and the local environment. For example,
workers would have to commute longer distances to jobs in the city, thus increasing traffic and
worsening local air quality.
Commute
Commute distance is an important factor in housing availability and affordability and is also an
indicator of jobs/housing balance. Communities with extended commute distances generally have
a poor jobs/housing balance, while those with short average commutes tend to have a strong
jobs/housing balance. The burden of the additional costs associated with extended commuting
disproportionately affects lower-income households who must spend a larger portion of their
overall income on fuel. This in turn affects a household’s ability to occupy decent housing without
being overburdened by cost. Table II-8 indicates that the majority of Dixon residents travel less
than 30 minutes from home to work. This figure indicates that many of the jobs are within 20
miles of the city and that there is a strong jobs/housing balance, meaning available jobs are within
relatively close distance to the employees’ places of residence.

Jobs/Housing Balance
Developing housing, particularly near employment centers or public transit facilities, can help
reduce traffic congestion and commute times, improve air quality, and place people in closer
proximity to the services they need. The availability of housing encourages a healthy economy
and can support revitalization efforts in downtown areas. Without a range of available housing for
Dixon’s workforce, residents and individuals who work in the community will likely have to travel
long distances for the jobs and services that they need every day.
Long-term projections for Dixon suggest a substantial increase in the number of jobs in the city.
However, this local increase does not include employment growth throughout the entire region.
Already, many Dixon residents commute to jobs in Davis, Sacramento, or the San Francisco Bay
Area. In order to accommodate employment growth in the city, reduce commute times (and thus
pollution), and support the needs of businesses already in Dixon, a range of housing is necessary.
This includes not just single-family units but cluster homes and apartments in a range of
densities.
A range of housing types at a variety of prices is an important part of sustainable development.
The objective of sustainable development is to enhance the economy and conserve natural
resources, while at the same time allowing all segments to enjoy the quality of life in Dixon. When
jobs increase faster than housing, prices escalate because demand outpaces supply. This makes it
more difficult for many employees to afford housing.
The analysis of jobs/housing balance is used to measure the degree to which communities and
subregions are inducing commuter travel as growth occurs. A community with a balance of jobs
and housing has as many jobs as residents who are able to work. For example, a city with 5,000
employed residents requires 5,000 jobs to be in balance. A community is out of balance if it either
has more jobs than employed residents or has more employable residents than jobs.
In 2010, Dixon had a jobs-to-employed residents ratio of 0.53 (4,460 jobs/8,390 employed
residents), compared to a future projected ratio of 0.60 in 2040 (5,780 jobs/9,650 employed
residents). As shown in Table II-9, ABAG projects that the jobs/housing balance ratio will
continue to increase slowly over the next 30 years, meaning more residents would have the
opportunity to work in Dixon over time.

B.        HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Household type and size, income levels, the presence of special needs populations, and other
household characteristics determine the type of housing needed by residents. This section details
the various household characteristics affecting housing needs.
1.        Household Type
The Census defines a “household” as any group of people occupying a housing unit, which may
include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, or unrelated
persons who share living quarters. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes,
dormitories, or other group living situations are not considered households. Household
characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing needed in a community.
The 2010 US Census indicates that 5,865 households lived in Dixon as of 2010. Approximately 80
percent of those households consisted of families, while 15 percent were single. As shown in Table
II-8, approximately 43 percent of all households consisted of families with children compared to
37 percent consisting of married couples with no children. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of
families with children increased by 4 percent.
The percentage of family households in Dixon has remained relatively stable since 2000, as shown
in Table II-10. However, while there have been increases in all household types, the largest
increase was seen in non-family households, which increased by 29 percent since 2000. There was
a 1 percent decrease in average household size from 3.17 to 3.13 persons between 2000 and 2010.
Housing need varies by household type. Families typically prefer single-family homes. In the
future, if housing prices increase, many new workers and existing residents of rental housing will
be priced out of the ownership housing market. This leads to a greater demand for rental housing
in the city and eventually results in price increases in the rental housing market. Unless affordable
housing is provided in both the ownership and rental markets, Dixon will experience increasing
difficulty in housing its workforce.

2.        Household Income
Household income is one of the most significant factors affecting housing choice and opportunity.
Income largely determines a household’s ability to purchase or rent housing. While higher-
income households have more discretionary income to spend on housing, lower- and moderate-
income households are limited in the range of housing they can afford. Typically, as the income of
a household decreases, the incidence of housing cost burdening and overcrowding increases.
For the purpose of evaluating housing affordability, housing need, and eligibility for housing
assistance, income levels are defined by guidelines adopted each year by HCD. For Solano County,
the applicable median area income for a family of four in 2014 is $82,600.
HCD has defined the following income categories for Solano County, based on the median
income for a household of four persons.
         Extremely low income: 30 percent and below ($0 to $24,800)
         Very low income: 31 to 50 percent of median income ($24,801 to $41,300)
         Low income: 51 to 80 percent of median income ($41,301 to $65,000)
         Moderate income: 81 to 120 percent of median income ($65,001 to $99,100)
         Above moderate income: 120 percent or more of median income ($99,101 or more)

3.       Special Needs Groups
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding acceptable, affordable housing due to special
circumstances relating to employment and income, household characteristics, and disabilities,
among others. These “special needs” groups include seniors, persons with disabilities (including
those with developmental disabilities), large households, female-headed households, homeless
persons, extremely low-income households, and agricultural workers. This section discusses the
housing needs facing each group, as well as programs and services available to address the
housing needs.
Senior Households
Senior residents have many different housing needs, depending on their age, level of income,
current tenure status, cultural background, and health status. Elderly households may need
assistance with personal and financial affairs, networks of care to provide services and daily
assistance, and even possible architectural design features that would accommodate disabilities
that would help ensure continued independent living
Table II-13 shows the breakdown by age of the senior population. According to the 2010 Census,
there are 1,552 seniors in Dixon. Since 2000, the senior population in the city has increased 32
percent. The largest increase of senior population was seen in the 85-plus age range, with an
increase of 145 percent. The majority of the senior population falls in the 65 to 74 age range, at 58
percent in 2010 and 56 percent in 2000. These numbers compare closely to Solano County with 55
percent of seniors in the age range between 65 and 74.

Rising rents and housing costs are of concern because most seniors are on fixed incomes. As
shown in Table II-14 and reported in the 2011 ACS, of all senior households in Dixon, 33 percent,
are considered extremely low income, 19 percent very low income, and 19 percent low income. In
2010 the City approved the first phase (60 units) and in 2013 the second phase (60 units) of a 120-
unit senior apartment project affordable to very low income households. Phase I has been
constructed and Phase II is anticipated to be completed in 2015.

The special needs of seniors can be met through a range of services, including congregate care,
rent subsidies, shared housing programs, and housing rehabilitation assistance. For the disabled
elderly, housing with architectural design features that accommodate disabilities can help ensure
continued independent living. Elderly with a mobility or self-care limitation also benefit from
transportation alternatives and shared housing options. Senior housing with supportive services
can be provided to assist with independent living.
Social and supportive services are available in Dixon from Dixon Family Services and the Dixon
Multi-Use Senior Center. Dixon Family Services provides housing assistance for the elderly and
offers referrals to health care and other resources available in the Dixon area. The Dixon Multi-
Use Senior Center offers a range of services, including a lunch program, health and nutrition
education and information, and referrals. Center staff also works with the USDA Rural
Development program to obtain funding for low-income seniors to make needed housing repairs.

In addition, the City of Dixon operates the Readi-Ride transportation service that runs Monday
through Friday and offers curb-to-curb service. Discounted fares are available to seniors over age
60 and persons with disabilities.
Additional services are available through Solano County and in neighboring cities through various
agencies and organizations, including (but not limited to) the Solano County Health and Social
Services Department Adult Services Program, Serve Our Seniors, Solano County Food Banks
Brown Bag Program, Alzheimer’s Support Group, Friendship Services of Solano County, Area
Agency on Aging, Independent Living Resource Center, and McBride Senior Center in Vacaville.
The Solano County Health and Social Services Department Adult Services Program, in particular,
offers information services for seniors on a variety of topics, including health, housing, nutrition,
employment, legal matters, transportation, financial or personal problems, disabled services, and
health screening.
Currently there are two non-assisted senior living residential complexes in Dixon, currently
housing 140 units, with 60 more units to be completed in 2015. All units are affordable (below
market rate).
Persons with Disabilities
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from working, may
restrict one’s mobility, or may make it difficult to care for oneself. Persons with disabilities have
special housing needs often related to the limited ability to earn a sufficient income and to a lack
of accessible and affordable housing. Some residents have disabilities that require living in a
supportive or institutional setting.
Included in the definition of “disability” from the 2000 Census are three types of impairments that
can affect a person’s life: work, mobility, and self-care limitations. Disabilities are defined as
mental, physical, or health conditions that last over six months. The Census tracks the following
disabilities:
        Work Limitation: Refers to a condition that restricts a person’s choice of work and
         prevents that person from working full time.
        Mobility Limitation: Refers to a physical or mental condition that makes it difficult for a
         person to go outside the home alone.
        Self-Care Limitation: Refers to a physical or mental condition that makes it difficult to
         take care of one’s personal needs.
Based on the 2000 Census, 2,631 persons in Dixon had some form of disability, representing about
16 percent of the city population. Since there is no DOF, 2010 US Census, or reliable ACS data,
2000 US Census information is used for this analysis. As reported in Table II-16, the disabilities
reported in the city totaled 4,574. The total disabilities exceeded the total number of persons with
disabilities due to persons reporting more than one disability. Of those with disabilities, 82

percent were ages 5 through 64 and 18 percent were over the age of 65. The largest disability type
reported by those 5 through 64 years of age are those that have employment disabilities, followed
by go-outside-home disability. Of the 2,221 persons with a disability aged 16 to 64, 80 percent

The living arrangement of persons with disabilities depends on the severity of the disability. Many
persons live at home in an independent fashion or with other family members. To maintain
independent living, persons with disabilities may need special assistance, including special
housing design features, income support for those who are unable to work, and in-home
supportive services, among others.

The Solano County Health and Social Services Department offers an in-home supportive services
program for low-income elderly and disabled residents of all ages. The program offers a set
number of hours each month for in-home assistance with domestic and personal care tasks
including cooking, cleaning, dressing, laundry, shopping, and other services.
The Independent Living Resource Center also offers support to seniors and persons with
disabilities. Transportation service for persons with disabilities is available through Readi-Ride of
Dixon, which provides curb-to-curb service at a low cost.
Persons with Developmental Disabilities
Senate Bill (SB) 812 requires the City to include the needs of individuals with developmental
disabilities within the community in the special housing needs analysis. According to Section 4512
of the Welfare and Institutions Code, a “developmental disability” means a disability that
originates before an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue,
indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual which includes mental
retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently in a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment
where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental
disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally
disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.

Large Households
Large households are defined as households with five or more members. Large households
comprise a special needs group because of the need for larger dwelling units, which are often in
limited supply and therefore command higher prices. In order to save for other basic necessities
such as food, clothing, and medical care, it is common for lower-income large households to
reside in smaller dwelling units, frequently resulting in overcrowding.
Based on estimates from the 2010 Census, 19 percent of Dixon’s households (1,099) were large
families, including 8 percent (478) that had six or more persons in the household. When
compared to the 2000 Census, the percentages were similar. In 2000, 18 percent (916) of
households were large households and of those, 8 percent (399) had six or more persons in the
household.

Overcrowding
Overcrowding occurs when housing costs are so high relative to income that families and
individuals double up to devote income to other basic needs such as food and medical care.
Overcrowding also tends to result in accelerated deterioration of homes, a shortage of street
parking, and increased neighborhood traffic. Therefore, maintaining a reasonable level of
occupancy and alleviating overcrowding are critical to enhancing the quality of life.
To address overcrowding, communities can provide incentives for developers to build larger
apartments with three or more bedrooms that can accommodate larger households. Often, the
shortage of large rental units can also be alleviated through the provision of affordable ownership
housing, such as condominiums coupled with homeownership assistance. The City of Dixon
currently offers a First-Time Homebuyer Program to assist lower-income households with down
payment and closing costs.
Table II-20 shows the total number of overcrowded and severely overcrowded households in
Dixon. Overcrowding occurs when there is more than one occupant per room in a household, and
severe overcrowding occurs when there are more than one and a half persons per bedroom in a
household. According to the 2010 ACS, of the 5,771 households in Dixon, 4 percent are
overcrowded and less than 1 percent are severely overcrowded. Overcrowding is not an issue in
Dixon.

Female-Headed Households
Table II-21 illustrates the number of family households that are headed by a female with no
husband present. Female-headed households with no husband present account for 17 percent of
all households in the city. The table also reports the presence of children in female-headed
households, as well as poverty indicators for female-headed households. Of all female-headed
households, 11 percent (539) have children under the age of 18 while 6 percent (251) do not have
children. The number of female-headed households under the poverty line, 17 percent, is also
higher than the city’s percentage of all families under the poverty line, 7 percent.

                Housing Element
Reasons for the higher poverty rate could be because most female-headed households have only
one income. Compared to two-parent households, which are much more likely to have two
incomes, single-parent households are less likely to find affordable, decent, and safe housing.
Such households often require special consideration and assistance because of the greater need
for affordable housing, accessible day care/child care, health care, and other supportive services.

Homeless Persons
The Community Action Partnership of Solano (CAP Solano) is the designated Community Action
Agency for the county and is a Joint Powers Authority between Solano County and the cities of
Benicia, Dixon, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun, Vacaville, and Vallejo. CAP Solano completed a point
in time count of homeless persons on the evening of January 27, 2011. The count identified a total
of 683 homeless persons in the county. The count did not identify any persons as residents of a
specific city. The count identifies that of the 683 persons classified as homeless, 172 utilized
emergency shelter (25 percent), 276 lived in transitional housing (40 percent), and 235 were
unsheltered (34 percent). Of those unsheltered, 21 were homeless families with at least one adult
and one child, 186 were individuals without children. Overall, 66 percent had access to shelters,
while 34 percent did not utilize or did not have access to shelters. In addition, the County
provided data on homeless subpopulations. A total of 55 people identified themselves as severely
mentally ill, 63 stated issues with substance abuse, 41 people were veterans, and 14 were victims of
domestic violence.
In addition to the 2011 CAP Solano homeless count, the US Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) Homelessness Resource Exchange (HRE), Continuum of Care Homeless
Assistance Programs completed a point in time homeless population count in 2012. While this is
not necessarily representative of the average homeless population, it is still one of the best
sources of available data. The HRE report identified 622 homeless persons, of which 235 were
unsheltered and 387 were sheltered. Subpopulation data highlights that of the 622 persons
counted, 50 dealt with chronic homelessness, 28 were veterans, and 244 were persons in
households with children. When compared to a 2010 HRE, the total number of homeless persons

decreased 25 percent. A 44 percent decrease was observed with unsheltered homeless persons and
a 46 percent decrease was observed in homeless households with children. The number of
homeless residents counted in Dixon were 24 residents that were surveyed and 7 that were
observed, resulting in a total of 31 homeless residents who live in Dixon. Homeless service
providers indicate that the homeless population in Dixon consists mostly of families and some
individuals. The City of Dixon Police Department estimates that there are approximately six
homeless persons in the City.
Three types of facilities provide shelter for homeless individuals and families: emergency shelters,
transitional housing, and permanent supportive housing. These are defined below.
Emergency shelter is defined as shelter for homeless persons where the provision of services is
not the primary focus. The shelters provide basic necessities such as food, clothing, protection
from the elements, and the opportunity to engage in supportive services. The length of stay is not
regulated; however, funding availability limits the number of nights provided. While Dixon
Family Services provides assistance to the homeless, no emergency shelter is located in the city.
The closest shelters are in Vacaville and Fairfield. Heather House, Mission Solano, Opportunity
House, and Christian Help Center operate emergency shelters in the area.
Transitional housing is defined as buildings configured as rental housing developments, but
operated under program requirements that require the termination of assistance and recirculating
of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at a predetermined future point in time
that is to be no less than six months from the beginning of the assistance. Services may include
substance abuse treatment, mental and physical health care interventions, job training and
employment services, individual and group counseling, and life skills training. Transitional
housing in Dixon can currently be found at the Dixon Veterans Home, a 14-bed transitional
housing facility for veteran males, which also offers meals, case management, and life skills
assistance. The Veterans Home, operated by Community Action North Bay, has served over 75
veterans in the last three years. Other services available in the surrounding cities are Opportunity
House, Heather House, and the Coalition Against Homelessness, which offer limited transitional
housing and provide assistance with housing
Permanent supportive housing is a means of housing with no limit on length of stay, that is
occupied by the target population, and that is linked to an on- or off-site service that assists the
supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and
maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community. Housing for the
developmentally disabled, mentally ill, and frail elderly are three examples of permanent
supportive housing. No affordable permanent housing with supportive services for homeless
individuals or families is currently available in the city.
Table II-22 identifies the homeless facilities located closest to Dixon. These facilities serve a
variety of homeless persons, including battered women and children, persons with mental and/or
physical disabilities, individuals, and needy families.

Extremely Low-Income Households
An extremely low-income household is defined as a household earning less than 30 percent of the
area median income. According to HCD, the median income for a family of four in Solano County
is $82,600, which means that households making $24,800 or less would be considered extremely
low income. Since the 2010 Census data categorizes income level differently, the Census reports
that 10 percent of the households in the unincorporated area and 15 percent of those in Solano
County make less than $24,999, slightly higher than HCD’s extremely low-income category. Using
this information, the number of extremely low-income households could be slightly lower than in
the Census data provided.
The City must provide an estimate of the projected extremely low-income housing needs. Per
HCD guidelines, 50 percent of Dixon’s very low-income households qualify as extremely low-
income. Therefore, it can be estimated that approximately 50 percent of the very low-income
regional housing need in Dixon has extremely low-income housing needs. In other words, of the
50 very low-income housing units needed, Dixon is estimating 25 units for extremely low-income
households. Most, if not all, extremely low-income households will require rental housing.
The extremely low-income households will likely face housing problems such as overpaying,
overcrowding, and/or accessibility issues as a result of their limited incomes. Also, many of the
extremely low-income households will fall within a special needs category (disabled, seniors, large
families, or female-headed households) and require supportive housing services.

Agricultural Workers
Agricultural workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned
through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers work in the fields,
processing plants, or support activities on a generally year-round basis. When workloads increase
during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal labor, often supplied by a
labor contractor. For some crops, farms may employ migrant workers, defined as those whose
travel distance to work prevents them from returning to their primary residence every evening.
Determining the true size of the agricultural labor force is sometimes difficult. For instance, the
government agencies that track farm labor do not consistently define farmworkers (e.g., field
laborers versus workers in processing plants), length of employment (e.g., permanent or
seasonal), or place of work (e.g., the location of the business or field).
Dixon is surrounded by fertile agricultural land and is located in a region where agriculture
remains an important part of the economy. As shown in Table II-23, the 2012 USDA Census of
Agriculture reports 860 farms in Solano County, employing a total of 2,846 workers. Of the 2,846
farmworkers in the county, 1,387 workers (49 percent) work more than 150 days each year. The
remaining 51 percent work less than 150 days per year. Larger farms provide the main source of
farm employment for farmworkers. According to the Census of Agriculture, 1,737 (61 percent) of
farmworkers were employed on farms with 10 or more workers. While these estimates are at the
county level and are not specifically for Dixon, it is likely the vast majority of farmworkers work in
the unincorporated area where most of the agricultural production in the county takes place.

According to the Migrant Child Education Program records there are approximately 160 migrant
workers in Dixon based on current student enrollment in the program. It is likely the vast
majority of farmworkers work within the Unincorporated area where most of the agricultural
production in the county takes place. The 2011 ACS identified 187 persons in Dixon who were
employed in the “farming, forestry and fishing” industries. This category includes jobs related to
agricultural services ranging from food processing to workers in greenhouses and plant nurseries.
Farmworkers are generally considered to have special housing needs because of the limited
income and the unstable nature of employment (i.e., having to move throughout the year from
one harvest to the next). No local survey is available to document the specific housing needs of
February 2015                                                          Dixon Housing Element Update

farmworkers in Dixon. Statewide surveys provide some insight into the demographic
characteristics and housing needs of farmworkers. Among the major findings are:
       Limited income – Farmworkers typically earn very low incomes.
       Overcrowding – Because of the very low incomes, farmworkers have limited housing
        options and are often forced to double up to afford rents.
       Substandard housing conditions – Many farmworkers live in overcrowded conditions
        and substandard housing, including informal shacks, illegal garage units, and other
        structures generally unsuitable for occupancy.
The provision of adequate housing for farmworker families is a rising concern is the state. In 1999,
the California Legislature amended housing element law to mandate that jurisdictions address
housing for agricultural workers.
In order to facilitate housing for farmworkers, the Dixon Zoning Ordinance permits farmworker
housing in the Agricultural (A) district. Labor camps, which are designed to provide housing for
migrant farmworkers, are conditionally permitted in the Agricultural district. Located south of
the city boundary, the Migrant Farm Worker Center operated by the Yolo County Housing
Authority provides housing for seasonal and migrant farmworkers. The center has 64 units and
can house up to 250 persons for six months of the year. The units are restricted to farmworkers
and their families with very low incomes and remain fully occupied. Currently non-single
farmworkers can qualify to live in the center. The Yolo County Housing Authority also operates
the Madison Migrant Housing Center, which is located in the community of Madison, about 11
miles west of Woodland, and can accommodate up to 88 families during the agricultural season
(early April to late October).
C.      HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
This section of the Housing Element addresses various housing characteristics and conditions
that affect the quality of life for city residents. Housing factors evaluated include housing stock
and growth, tenure and vacancy rates, age and condition, housing costs, and affordability, among
others.
1.      Housing Growth
Between 2000 and 2013, a total of 1,031 new housing units were built in Dixon. This represents an
increase of 19 percent in the housing stock. Table II-24 compares housing growth in the city with
that of surrounding communities and Solano County, as reported by the US Census and the
Claritas report. As shown in the table, Dixon had a similar percentage growth in housing units as
Fairfield, Suisun City, and Vacaville.

2.       Housing Type and Tenure
While 1,031 housing units were built from 2000 to 2013, most of the new units were single-family
homes. Table II-25 shows the composition of the housing stock in 2000 and 2013 based on data
from the Census and the California Department of Finance. Single-family homes constituted 88
percent of the housing stock in 2000 and 83 percent in 2013. Multi-family units, including both
apartments and condominiums, made up 12 percent of all housing in 2000 and 17 percent in 2013.
The largest increase in housing type was multi-family housing of 5 or more units, which increased
by 408 units, or 165 percent. The largest decrease was the mobile homes/other category, which
saw a 38 unit decrease, or 44 percent. The city’s vacancy rate also increased from just under 2
percent in 2000 to 5 percent in 2013.

Table II-26 identifies the tenure of housing in the city. Between 2000 and 2010, the percentage of
owner-occupied units increased by 5 percent. However, while both owner- and renter-occupied
tenures are increasing, renter-occupied housing is growing significantly faster, a 43 percent
increase from 2000 to 2010. This increase in renter-occupied housing could be related to the
increase in multi-family units see in Table II-25 above.

3.       Vacancy Rate
According to the Department of Finance and as seen in Table II-25, the vacancy rate in Dixon in
2013 was 5 percent, a large increase from the 2000 vacancy rate of slightly less than 2 percent. A
vacancy rate measures the overall housing availability in a community and is often a good
indicator of how efficiently for-sale and rental housing units are meeting the current demand for
housing. A vacancy rate of 5 percent for rental housing and 2 percent for ownership housing is
generally considered healthy and suggests that there is a balance between the demand and supply
of housing. A lower vacancy rate may indicate that households are having difficulty in finding
housing that is affordable, leading to overcrowding or households having to pay more than they
can afford. Of all vacant housing units, housing units for rent made up the largest portion of
vacant units at 34 percent.

4.       Housing Age and Condition
Housing age is an important indicator of housing condition in a community. Housing is subject to
gradual deterioration over time. As a general rule in the housing industry, structures older than
30 years begin to show signs of deterioration and require reinvestment to maintain their quality.
Unless properly maintained, homes older than 50 years require major renovations to remain in
good condition. If not properly and regularly maintained, housing can deteriorate and discourage
reinvestment, thereby depressing neighboring property values and impacting the quality of life in
a neighborhood. Maintaining and improving housing quality is an important goal for the City.

Table II-28 displays the age of Dixon’s occupied housing stock by age as of 2010. Eighty percent of
Dixon’s housing stock was built between 1970 and 2010, 30 percent of which turned 30 years old in
2010. This fact will be an important redevelopment topic for the City, as new home sales have
declined while housing needs will continue to increase and diversify.

In 2001, Mercy Housing California, a nonprofit corporation specializing in affordable housing
analysis and development, conducted an evaluation of the exterior condition of housing in Dixon.
A total of 4,250 units were surveyed. The vast majority of housing was in sound condition (95
percent); only 5 percent (209) of the units were in apparent need of some form of rehabilitation.
Of those 209 units in apparent need of repair, most required only minor improvements. The most
common types of repairs necessary related to roofs and siding. According to the report, of the 209
housing units requiring some form of rehabilitation, 86 percent required siding repairs or
replacement and 37 percent of the units required roof repairs or replacement. However, 78 units
were identified as apparently needing moderate to substantial rehabilitation, while 8 were
considered dilapidated. The study only considered the exterior condition of housing, but
indicated that “it is very common for exterior condition surveys to rate units as having a moderate
need, but when the interior condition survey is conducted, it is found that the extent of the
rehabilitation needed is actually more substantial.”
Though most of the housing is in good condition, the City has administered two loans involving
rehabilitation of homes that were in disrepair since adoption of the previous Housing Element,
neither was due to a code enforcement action. The overall condition of the housing stock has
remained the same in the last five years with approximately five percent of the City’s housing
stock in need of some repair. The City developed a Housing Rehabilitation and Preservation
Program that provides low-interest loans to lower-income homeowners to help with needed
repairs. Information can be found on the City’s website.

5.      Housing Costs and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems faced by lower- and
moderate-income households in a community. If housing costs are high relative to household
income, correspondingly the incidence of housing cost burden and overcrowding will be high.
This section summarizes the cost and affordability of housing to Dixon residents.
Home Sales
Table II-29 depicts home sale prices Dixon. This information was compiled by DataQuick. The
table shows the median single-family home price in the city was $275,000 in 2013, up from
$210,000 in 2012, an increase of 31 percent. The city has seen a significant percentage increase from
2012 to 2013 of the median sales price of homes after decreases in the two previous years. The cost
of housing in Dixon is similar to that in nearby communities. Single-family home sales prices have
increased significantly throughout Solano County in the past few years after dropping
significantly during the economic downturn of the late 2000s. Dixon has the third highest median
housing cost in the county, behind Benicia and Vacaville.

Housing Affordability by Household Income
Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home in Dixon
with the maximum affordable housing cost to households at different income levels. The area
median income (AMI) provides a benchmark for estimating the affordability of housing and the
ability of newcomers to move into the community. Taken together, this information can generally
demonstrate who can afford what size and type of housing and indicate the type of households
most likely to experience overcrowding or a burden on housing cost.
In evaluating affordability, the maximum affordable price refers to the maximum amount that
could be afforded by households in the upper range of their respective income category.
Households in the lower end of each category can afford less in comparison. The affordability of
the city’s housing stock for each income group is discussed below. HCD has estimated the 2014
county area median income (AMI) to be $82,600 for a family of four.
Extremely Low-Income Households: Extremely low-income households are households
earning 30 percent or less than the county AMI. As shown in Table II-31, these households have
monthly incomes ranging from $1,450 for a one-person household to $2,066 for a four-person
household.
Very Low-Income Households: Very low-income households are classified as those earning 30
to 50 percent of the county AMI. As shown in Table II-31, the monthly income ranges from $2,412
for a one-person household to $3,441 for a four-person household.
Low-Income Households: Low-income households earn 51 to 80 percent of the county AMI.
Low-income households can have monthly incomes between $3,791 for a one-person household
and $5,416 for a four-person household.
Moderate-Income Households: Moderate-income households earn between 81 to 120 percent of
the county AMI. Moderate-income households can have monthly incomes between $5,779 for a
one-person household and $8,258 for a four-person household.

Table II-31 shows the maximum rents and sales prices, respectively, that are affordable to
extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. Affordability is based on the
following assumptions: a household spending 30 percent or less of their total household income
for shelter; the maximum household income levels established by HUD and HCD; and maximum
affordable sales prices based on 10 percent down and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 5.25 percent
annual interest rate. Based on the affordability levels in Table II-31 and the median sales prices in
Dixon seen in Table II-29, all but larger moderate-income groups would have a very difficult time
finding affordable housing for sale. When it comes to rental prices, according to the median
rental prices in Table II-31, all extremely low-income groups and most very low-income groups
would not be able to afford most rental housing units.

Overpayment
Generally, overpayment compares the total shelter cost for a household to the ability of that
household to pay. Specifically, overpayment is defined as monthly shelter costs in excess of 30
percent of a household’s income. Shelter cost is defined as the monthly owner costs (mortgages,
deed of trust, contracts to purchase or similar debts on the property and taxes, insurance on the
property, and utilities) or the gross rent (contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of
utilities).
Table II-32 shows to what extent occupied housing units (households) are overpaying for housing
cost by tenure and whether or not they were overpaying (30–50 percent of household income) or
severely cost burdened (50+ percent of household income). Of all households, 46 percent were
overpaying for housing cost in 2010, and of those overpaying, 1,295 households (48 percent) are
severely cost burdened. Of the 540 renter-occupied units severely cost burdened, 310 units were
occupied by those who are extremely low income.

185 owner households and 580 renter households earning less than 50 percent of the median
family income (MFI) in Dixon identified as having at least one of four housing problems (which
include incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing facilities, more than one person per
room, and a cost burden greater than 30 percent). It is important to note that the median family
income reported in Table II-32 is not the same as the state’s area median income (AMI) estimate
for Solano County, as reported in other places in Section II. While there were more overall owner
households with housing problems, only 9 percent of those households were low income. Renter-
occupied households had a smaller number of households with one or more problem; however, 16
percent of those households were low income. It is important to note that, similar to ACS data,
the CHAS dataset uses small samples and is subject to large margins of error and therefore may
have totals and percentages that are slightly different than other data sources used in this
Housing Element.

6.       Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
Governmental-assisted housing is often a significant source of affordable housing in many
communities. This section identifies publicly assisted rental housing in Dixon, evaluates its
potential to convert to market-rate units between 2015 and 2025, and analyzes the cost to preserve
those units. Resources for the preservation/replacement of the at-risk units are described in
Section IV of the element, and Program 2.2.1 addresses preservation of these units (see Section V).

Loss of Assisted Housing
Affordability covenants and deed restrictions are typically used to maintain the affordability of
publicly assisted housing, ensuring that these units are available to lower- and moderate-income
households in the long term. From time to time, restricted units lose their affordability controls
or subsidies and revert to market rates. As shown in Table II-34, in Dixon, the two assisted
apartment projects at risk of conversion before January 31, 2025, are the Walnut Ranch
Apartments and Moonlight Apartments.
Preservation and Replacement Options
Generally, the cost of preserving assisted housing units is estimated to be significantly less than
replacing units through new construction. Preserving units entails covering the difference
between market rates and assisted rental rates. New construction tends to be less cost efficient
because of the cost of land, which is often a limiting factor in the development of affordable
housing.
Commonly, low- and moderate-income households can afford rents for two- and three-bedroom
apartments without experiencing overpayment. However, extremely low- and very low-income
households would find it more difficult to obtain rental housing at an affordable price without
overpaying. To maintain the existing affordable housing stock, the City may either preserve the
existing assisted units or replenish the affordable housing inventory with new units.

Preservation
Rental subsidies using non-federal (state, local, or other) funding sources can be used to maintain
affordability of the 65 at-risk affordable units. These rent subsidies can be structured to mirror the
federal Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) program. Under Section 8, HUD pays the difference
between what tenants can pay (defined as 30 percent of household income) and what HUD
estimates as the fair market rent on the unit. In Solano County, the 2014 fair market rent is
determined to be $928 for a one-bedroom unit, $1,163 for a two-bedroom unit, and $1,714 for a
three-bedroom unit.
The feasibility of this alternative is highly dependent on the availability of unit type and other
funding sources necessary to make rent subsidies available and the willingness of property owners
to accept rental vouchers if they can be provided. As indicated in Table II-35, the total cost of
subsidizing the rents for all 65 at-risk units is estimated at $17,516 per month or $210,192 annually.

Replacement
The construction of new low-income housing units is a means of replacing the 65 at-risk units.
The cost of developing housing depends on a variety of factors, including density, size of the units
(i.e., number of bedrooms), location, land costs, and type of construction. Based on cost
information gathered from the Heritage Commons project in Dixon, the average construction cost
for a rental residential unit is approximately $219,000 (including land costs). Using this general
estimate, it would cost approximately $14 million to develop 65 new units to replace the at-risk
units. Given the City’s limited financial resources, development of replacement housing must rely
on partnerships with nonprofit or for-profit housing developers or other public entities. Section V
identifies City programs and actions to facilitate the construction of multi-family housing, which
may assist the development of new affordable apartment units in Dixon.
February 2015                                                                  Dixon Housing Element Update
                                                            II-35

                Housing Element
Acquisition
Another option would be for a nonprofit organization to purchase an existing multi-family
complex, rather than build a new one, lowering the per unit cost significantly. A survey done in
July 2014 of Dixon and nearby Solano County showed that multi-family projects were selling
between $549,000 (3-unit project) and $4.15 million (50-unit project). These sales prices break
down to a per unit cost range of $72,000 to $180,000 per unit.
Cost Comparisons
The above analysis attempts to estimate the cost of preserving the at-risk units under various
options. The cost of acquiring the four at-risk projects and transferring ownership to nonprofit
organizations is the second highest of the three quantified options (starting at $14 million to
replace 65 units based on the lowest market price identified). In comparison, the annual costs of
providing rental subsidies required to preserve the 65 assisted units are relatively low ($210,192).
However, long-term affordability of the units cannot be ensured in this manner. The option of
constructing 65 replacement units has the highest cost ($14 million) and is constrained by a
variety of factors, including growing scarcity of land, rising land costs, and potential community
opposition. The best option to preserve the at-risk units appears to be the purchase of
affordability covenants.
Prepayment of Federal Insured Loans
The federal government provides low-interest financing or mortgage insurance to housing
developers in return for guaranteeing that rents are maintained affordable to lower-income
households. Since an owner’s debt service was reduced through mortgage subsidies, the property
owner could maintain rents below market levels. After 20 years, the owner could prepay the
mortgage and lift the rent restrictions or maintain the affordability controls until the mortgages
were paid off.
In the mid-1970s, the federal government utilized the Section 8 program to encourage the
production of affordable rental housing. Under the Section 8 program, HUD offered a 15- or 20-
year contract to provide rental subsidies to property owners in return for making the units
affordable to very low-income households. The subsidy is typically the difference between 30
percent of the household income and a negotiated fair market rent for the area. After the
expiration of a Section 8 contract, an affordable complex may convert to market rents. The
Section 8 (Housing Choice Voucher) Program for Dixon is administered by the Vacaville Housing
Authority. There are currently 233 vouchers in use in Dixon.
Dixon Housing Element Update                                                           February 2015

HUD provides the Mark-to-Market and Mark-Up-to-Market programs for Section 8 projects
seeking renewal. If current contracted rents exceed the fair market rent (FMR), HUD will provide
favorable tax treatment to property owners in return for preserving the units at affordable rents
(Mark-to-Market). For apartments renting at or below FMR rates, HUD allows rents to be
increased to levels comparable to market rents, though not exceeding 150 percent of the FMR
(Mark-Up-to-Market). When a complex with an expiring Section 8 contract is at risk of
conversion, the below-market stock is most likely to be converted given the higher market rents
in the area.
The Section 515 program has a loan term of 50 years. Therefore, the projects funded under the 515
program are typically not considered to be at risk. In order to prepay the Section 515 loan, a
project owner must demonstrate that affordable housing for farmworkers is no longer needed in
the region. Based on Rural Housing Service staff assessment, few projects in the nation have been
able to demonstrate the diminished need. Furthermore, Rural Housing Service staff indicated that
the agency usually offers additional incentives to entice project owners to continue maintenance
of the units as affordable housing.

III.    HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
The provision of adequate and affordable housing opportunities is an important goal of the City.
However, a variety of factors can constrain the development, maintenance, and improvement of
housing. These include market mechanisms, government codes, and physical and environmental
constraints. This section addresses the potential constraints that affect the supply of housing in
Dixon.
A.      NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Environmental factors and a lack of necessary infrastructure or public services can constrain
residential development in a community by increasing costs and reducing the amount of land
suitable for housing construction. This section summarizes and analyzes the most pertinent
constraints to housing in Dixon.
1.      Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints related to agricultural land, noise, drainage and flooding potential, or
other environmental issues can impact the cost associated with the maintenance, improvement,
and development of housing. A more detailed discussion is contained in the Natural Environment
chapter of the Dixon General Plan. The discussion below summarizes the most pertinent
environmental constraints that may affect housing in Dixon.
Agricultural Constraints
According to the General Plan, much of the farmland in the Dixon Planning Area is classified by
the California Department of Conservation as “Prime Farmland.” A number of farms in the
vicinity of the city limits are under California Williamson Act contracts designed to preserve the
land for agricultural uses. Unless the contract expires, the property cannot be used for anything
but agricultural uses without incurring financial penalties to the owner. None of the parcels
currently zoned for residential use in the city are under Williamson Act contract.
Drainage and Flooding Constraints
Dixon is located on an alluvial fan formed by Putah Creek, which is located north of the city. This
area generally slopes to the southeast, and drainage follows Dickson and Dudley creeks to the
Sacramento River. The major flood hazard areas are located along the Dickson Creek and Dudley
Creek traces. The creeks no longer exist as surface drainages. Underground pipes were installed to
carry the flow.
February 2015                                                      Dixon Housing Element Update
                                                III-1

                Housing Element
The Natural Environment chapter of the General Plan identifies the following policies to address
hazards related to flooding:
        The City shall strive to reduce the risks to life and property arising from flooding to an
         acceptable level, consistent with the City’s Master Drainage Plan.
        The City shall ensure that floodways will be left open for agriculture and recreational use
         in areas of particular risk, and where the need for protection is minimal.
        The City shall ensure that measures to reduce flood damage to individual properties will
         only be undertaken where the potential for hazard due to flood erosion is not increased on
         other properties.
Over the past several decades, the City has made significant improvements to drainage
throughout Dixon. In 1991, the City prepared a Storm Drain Master Plan to address drainage
issues. The plan included specific recommendations to provide adequate drainage. The City has
made several drainage improvements based on the recommendations contained in the plan,
including construction of two of the three recommended detention ponds. In 1999, the City
prepared the Storm Drain Report to address drainage conditions and to assess further drainage
improvements as well as possible alternatives. The Storm Drain Report addresses improvements
through 2010, which is the buildout date of the 1993 General Plan. The report included
comprehensive recommendations to address and mitigate drainage needs in the city. The Dixon
Regional Watershed Joint Powers Authority formed in 2004 includes the City, the Dixon
Resource Conservation District, Maine Prairie Water District, and Reclamation District 2068. Its
charge is to address drainage needs inside and outside the city limits. The Dixon Watershed
Management Plan was developed by West Yost Associates in conjunction with Solano County
Water Agency in August 2001.
In order to address drainage issues affecting residential development, the City charges developers
impact fees to provide the necessary drainage improvements in the city. For residential
developments in undeveloped areas of the city, such as the specific plan areas, developers are
required to provide financing for the necessary improvements.
Seismic Constraints
Several active faults located in the San Francisco Bay Area can produce earthquakes that may
cause shaking in Dixon. These faults include the Greenville fault, the northern section of the
Hayward fault, the Healdsburg-Rodgers Creek fault, the Maacama fault, and the Northern
Calaveras fault. Only one fault, the Midland fault zone, crosses the Dixon Planning Area.
Seismic activity associated with faults can also cause hazards such as liquefaction and soil
settlement, among others. Due to the high water table in Dixon, there is a risk of liquefaction of
soils from an earthquake. In order to address impacts associated with seismic activity, General
Plan Policy III-11 indicates that the City will strive to reduce the risks associated with seismic
activity to an acceptable level. Policy III-12 also states that the City shall ensure “that structures

                                                 III-2

                                                               Housing Element
intended for human occupancy are designed and constructed to retain their structural integrity
when subjected to seismic activity, in accordance with the California Title 24 Codes.” The City’s
Building Division ensures that all structures, including residences, comply with the Uniform
Building Code and the Dixon Municipal Code.
Noise Constraints
Interstate 80, the Union Pacific Railroad, State Route 113, and city streets are the major sources of
noise in Dixon. Noise can affect development on parcels located near these noise sources.
However, the City has developed performance standards in order to address this issue. The City
requires that developers mitigate any noise impacts prior to construction, if environmental review
determines that impacts from noise exceed City standards.
2.      Infrastructure and Public Service Constraints
A lack of adequate infrastructure or public services and facilities can be a substantial constraint to
residential development. In fact, according to the National Association of Home Builders,
ensuring that the construction of schools, roads, and other infrastructure keeps pace with the
anticipated growth in population and economic activity is one of the biggest challenges facing
local governments.
The Dixon General Plan, as the principal document regulating growth and development in the
city, includes policies that link new development accommodated in the General Plan (i.e.,
buildout) and new facilities and/or services required to meet demands created by this new
development. Measure B is also designed to ensure that development does not exceed the City’s
capacity to provide infrastructure and necessary public services to new residents. Finally, in order
to meet the infrastructure and public service needs of new development, the City requires
developers to pay impact fees and exactions as well as to construct site improvements, as
discussed earlier in this section. In this way, development in new areas (e.g., specific plan areas)
will have the necessary infrastructure and facilities and services in place to meet the needs of
residents.
Water
The older areas of the city receive drinking water service from the California Water Service
Company (Cal Water). According to its 2010 Urban Water Management Plan, Cal Water serves
2,906 housing units in the central portion of Dixon, operating eight wells in the area. Current Cal
Water usage is approximately 1,502 acre-feet per year. Cal Water estimates the service area’s
population could reach 10,880 by 2040 and projected water usage could reach 2,000 acre-feet per
year. Current well design capacity of active wells is 5,100 gallons per minute, or if all Cal Water
wells were pumped continuously, 8,226 acre-feet per year. Cal Water currently prioritizes
conservation and reduced pumping in the basin.
City of Dixon Water Division (formerly the Dixon-Solano Water Authority (DSWA), the product
of a joint powers authority between the City of Dixon and the Solano Irrigation District (SID),

               Housing Element
serves more recently developed sections of the city and surrounding areas. The City of Dixon
Water Division will provide water supply to most future development areas. Though customers
are currently supplied with groundwater, SID has surface water rights to approximately 151,000
acre-feet per year, and future plans include the potential to establish treatment plants in the
Dixon area to accommodate growth with treated surface water.
On August 6, 2012 the City of Dixon began the dissolution of DSWA. On August 9, 2014 the City
assumed operation and maintenance of the water system. The City of Dixon is expected to supply
water to most newly developing portions of the Dixon planning area.
The City’s water is on a first come-first served basis with the exception of affordable projects,
which receive priority for both water and sewer. According to City staff, the City currently has
more than enough capacity to accommodate its 2014–2023 RHNA (197 units).
Sewer
The City’s Department of Public Works provides wastewater collection and treatment service. The
wastewater treatment facility (WWTF), located south of the city along Pedrick Road, treats
wastewater in on-site ponds. The treatment facility has a capacity of 1.82 million gallons per day
(mgd). According to the 2014 Wastewater Treatment Facility Report, the City’s current
wastewater treatment plant was built in the 1950s and is currently in need of several retrofit
projects. Current flows to the WWTF are approximately 1.2 million gallons per day, while flows for
future General Plan buildout levels are projected to reach 2.5 million gallons per day.
In May 2013, the City Council selected a WWTF Improvements Project capacity of 1.9 mgd as the
preferred project to service the development projects that have been approved and to provide
capacity for future commercial and industrial connections. The Regional Water Quality Control
Board also requires the WWTF Improvements Project, at a minimum, to serve growth expected to
occur over at least the next five-year period, which, given recent growth rates, is adequately
covered by the adopted 1.9 mgd capacity. For the Phase 1 WWTF Improvements Project, planned
for construction in 2015/16, the City Council approved a design flow of 1.9 mgd to serve approved
specific plan areas for the following equivalent dwelling units (EDUs): Valley Glen Planned
Development, 375 EDUs, Southwest Dixon Specific Plan Area, 1,008 EDUs, and Parklane
Subdivision, 520 EDUs. This will serve approximately 6,100 additional residents and should serve
City short-term growth requirements for five to ten years, depending on development plans and
housing market conditions. The 1.9 mgd Stage 1 WWTF Improvements Project also includes
capacity for about 0.3 mgd for new commercial and industrial service located in the Northeast
Quadrant Specific Plan Area. The Phase 1 WWTF Improvements Project will provide more than
sufficient capacity to serve the 2014–2022 RHNA of 197 units. A later Stage 2 WWTF
Improvements Project will expand service to 2.5 mgd, enough to meet General Plan buildout.
Transportation
The Public Works Department owns and maintains the local street network and ensures
implementation of design standards for transportation facilities. According to the General Plan,
the multimodal transportation network should:

        Maintain or improve existing levels of service along the local circulation network; and
        Provide a safe and efficient circulation system that provides access to residential,
         commercial, industrial, and recreational areas by all modes of travel.
Transportation facilities will be provided to newly developing areas, as designated in the General
Plan, through a combination of developer dedications, in-lieu fees, and special assessments.
3.       Market Constraints
Land costs, construction costs, and market financing contribute to the cost of housing investment
and can potentially hinder the production of new housing. Although many constraints are driven
by market conditions, jurisdictions have some leverage in instituting policies and programs to
address such constraints. The discussion below analyzes these market constraints as well as the
activities that the City can undertake to mitigate their effects.
Development Costs
Construction costs vary widely according to the type of development, with multi-family housing
generally less expensive to construct than single-family homes. However, wide variation within
each type exists, depending on the size of the unit and the amenities provided, such as fireplaces,
swimming pools, and interior fixtures, among others.
Building-cost.net, a housing construction cost resource that calculates the total estimated cost of
building a new home, estimates the total construction price of a 1,500-square-foot home with four
walls, an attached garage, central heating and air, and average building materials at $212,002. The
cost breakdown consists of $119,416 for materials, $88,308 for labor, and $4,278 for equipment
needed to finish the construction.
In addition to construction costs, the price of land is one of the largest components of housing
development costs. Land costs may vary depending on whether the site is vacant or has an
existing use that must be removed. Similarly, site constraints such as environmental issues (i.e.,
lack of proper drainage, soil stability, seismic hazards, or flooding) can also affect the cost of land.
The price of land is a major market constraint that impacts housing production and the price of
available new housing. LoopNet.com, an online listing of commercial real estate in the United
States, advertises vacant land properties for sale in the city that are zoned for residential uses. A
July 2014 survey yielded a 48-acre vacant lot, approved for the construction of at least 200 single-
family homes, selling for $5 million. The cost of land would add approximately $25,000 to the
price of each home.
Availability of Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. Under the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions must disclose information on the
February 2015                                                         Dixon Housing Element Update

                 Housing Element
disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and race of the applicants. This applies to
all loan applications for home purchases and improvements, whether financed at market rate or
through government-backed loans.
The primary concern in a review of lending activity is whether home financing is generally
available to all income groups in the community. Given the rising cost of a home in Dixon, low-
and moderate-income households may have difficulty in obtaining home purchase loans from
conventional sources such as banks or mortgage lenders. Specific housing programs, such as the
City’s First-Time Homebuyer Program or other mortgage assistance programs, can assist low- and
moderate-income homeowners with down payment and closing costs, which are often significant
obstacles to homeownership for these groups.
Table III-1 illustrates interest rates as of July 2014. The table presents both the interest rate and
the annual percentage rate (APR) for different types of home loans. The interest rate is the
percentage of an amount of money which is paid for its use for a specified time, and the APR is
the yearly percentage rate that expresses the total finance charge on a loan over its entire term.
The APR includes the interest rate, fees, points, and mortgage insurance and is therefore a more
complete measure of a loan’s cost than the interest rate alone. However, the loan’s interest rate,
not its APR, is used to calculate the monthly principal and interest payment.

B.       GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Local policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of housing and, in particular,
the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, fees and
exactions, permit processing procedures, and other factors may constrain the maintenance,
development, and improvement of housing. This section discusses potential governmental
constraints as well as policies that encourage housing development in Dixon.
1.       Land Use Policies
The Urban Development and Community Design Element of the Dixon General Plan sets forth
the policies for guiding development. These policies, together with existing zoning regulations,
establish the amount and distribution of land for different uses in the city. As described in Table
Dixon Housing Element Update                                                                           February 2015

III-2, the General Plan has three residential designations for single-family dwellings and two
designations for multi-family uses. The Medium Low Density designation includes both types of
housing. These designations permit a varied level of density for urban residential uses. The City is
working on a complete General Plan update and it is uncertain whether the land designations will
change. The City is also in the process of annexing seven parcels totaling 34 acres, including
roadways, in the northern portion of the Pedrick Road-Interstate 80 interchange within the City’s
Sphere of Influence. Three of the parcels are currently developed with commercial uses and the
remaining parcels are being farmed with a variety of row crops. The annexed parcels will be zoned
Highway Commercial.

In addition to these conventional residential land use categories, the City has established the Core
Area Mixed Use (MU) designation. This land use designation allows a mix of both commercial
retail and office uses with residential uses in the central downtown area of Dixon. This land use
designation corresponds to the City’s Planned Mixed Use (PMU1 and PMU2) districts, which
permit a density of up to 6.23 to 21.78 dwelling units per acre (du/ac). To facilitate affordable
housing and mixed-use development in the downtown core area, the City will establish
development standards that can facilitate housing development at 20 to 25 units per acre while
providing for high-quality housing development.
Specific Plan and Planned Development Areas
Dixon has two specific plan areas—Southwest Dixon and the Northeast Quadrant—as well as the
Southpark Subdivision Planned Development (now known as Valley Glen Subdivision Planned
Development) (Richland Communities, Inc.) and Parklane Subdivision Planned Development
(Brookfield Homes). Valley Glen Parklane Planned Developments and Southwest Dixon include
large residential components, while the Northeast Quadrant Specific Plan is planned for
commercial, light industrial, and office development. Valley Glen, Parklane Planned
Developments and Southwest Dixon include a variety of housing types to be developed at
densities ranging from less than 2 du/ac to more than 24 du/ac. Table III-3 summarizes planned
residential development for Valley Glen, Parklane Planned Developments and Southwest Dixon.
Valley Glen Planned Development: The Valley Glen Planned Development is located in
southeast Dixon and is generally bounded by West Cherry Street to the north, the Porter Road
Retention Pond to the south, the Union Pacific Railroad to the west, and S. First Street (State
Route 113) to the east. The site consists of approximately 93 acres. The development proposes
several housing types, including apartment units, cluster homes with two or three units per
building, medium-density detached single-family homes, and low-density homes. Since the
Development Agreement for the Valley Glen Planned Development was approved by the City
Council in November 2002, 360 single-family homes have been built as well as the Bristol
Apartment complex and Valley Glen Apartments.
Southwest Dixon Specific Plan: The Southwest Dixon Specific Plan area consists of
approximately 269 acres and is located west of Porter Road and east of Interstate 80.
Approximately 61 percent of the land is designated for residential use, while the remainder is for
commercial uses and public facilities. The Specific Plan contains three residential land use
designations that provide for housing ranging from low-density single-family units to townhomes,
cluster homes, and apartments. The Southwest Dixon Specific Plan was adopted by the City
Council in 1995. Most of the site is presently in agricultural use. Portions of the area remain under
Williamson Act contracts; however, the land under contract does not include the sites for the
apartment units or most of the medium-density housing.
Parklane Subdivision Planned Development: Brookfield Homes is developing a residential
community on approximately 94 acres immediately south of the existing Country Faire
neighborhood and east of State Route 113. The City has entered into a Development Agreement
with Brookfield Homes to provide residential allocations in years 2008 through 2013 contingent

upon certain conditions which must be satisfied by Brookfield Homes. The Brookfield project was
annexed to the city in 2005. The conditions of the Development Agreement included dedication
of 40 acres for the new high school, completed in 2006, and construction of infrastructure,
including streets, as well as a high volume water well and storage system (completed in 2007) for
the southeast Dixon area. The development proposes four housing types, including alley-loaded,
medium-density, and low-density single-family homes. In 2013, Phase 1 of Heritage Commons
Senior Housing consisting of 60 affordable units was completed in 2013. Phase 2, consisting of an
additional 60 affordable units, is scheduled to start construction with completion in 2015.

2.       Residential Development Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily
through its Zoning Ordinance. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the
health, safety, and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the Dixon
General Plan. The Zoning Ordinance also helps preserve the character and integrity of existing
neighborhoods. Table III-4 summarizes the relevant residential standards for both single-family
and multi-family development. In the table, zone districts are grouped by the General Plan land
use category in which they are permitted (i.e., Very Low, Low, Medium-Low, Medium-High, and
High).
Single-Family Residential Development Standards
The R-1 district is the primary district for single-family residential development. The minimum lot
area ranges from 7,000 to 20,000 square feet, which is designed to accommodate the need for

R-1-7 district. Densities range from 2 dwelling units per acre in the R-1-20 district to over 6 du/ac
in the R-1-7 district. The height limit for single-family homes is generally 30 feet.
Multi-Family Residential Development Standards
Both the RM-1 and RM-2 districts permit multiple dwelling units per lot. The RM-1 district
permits two-family dwellings or duplex units, while the RM-2 district permits multi-family
dwellings. The minimum lot size for RM-1 and RM-2 is 8,000 and 7,500 square feet, respectively.
The minimum site per unit varies from a maximum of 4,000 square feet in the RM-1 district to
2,500 square feet in the RM-2 district. The maximum height is 38 feet in both districts and the
maximum lot coverage is 40 percent. The RM-3 and RM-4 districts also allow multiple dwelling
units per lot. RM-3 allows triplexes, fourplexes, and multi-family housing with five or more units,
while RM-4 allows multiple-family dwellings of five or more units.
In addition to the RM districts, the City also has the Planned Multiple Family Residential (PMR),
Downtown Commercial, and Planned Mixed Use (PMU) districts, which allow residential
development. The PMR district permits multi-family units on 9,000-square-foot lots with a
density of up to 10 du/ac (minimum site area per unit of 4,350 square feet). The Downtown
Commercial district allows multi-family units with no minimum lot size; this district also has 50-
foot height limitations. The PMU district permits mixed-use development including retail and
office development in conjunction with multi-family units in the downtown area of the city. The
PMU district has a minimum lot size of 5,000 square feet and permits a density of up to 21.78
du/ac.

Parking Requirements
The City’s parking requirements for residential districts vary by housing type, the number of
units, and parking needs. Table III-5 identifies the City’s parking requirements for different
housing types. Single-family units are required to have two covered spaces. Mobile homes are
required to have one covered and one uncovered space. For all other types of residential
development, parking requirements are based on the number of bedrooms per unit. In multi-
family dwellings such as apartment units, one-bedroom units must have 1.5 covered spaces. Units
with two or more bedrooms must have two covered spaces.
The City may reduce parking requirements to provide housing for special needs groups. For
example, the Planning Commission granted a reduction in the number of parking spaces required
for the Dixon Second Street Apartment project for seniors. The La Esperanza project consisted of
72 single-family homes affordable to lower-income homebuyers and was also granted a reduction
in parking standards. The Planning Commission granted the Heritage Commons project (which
has PD overlay zoning) a parking reduction; the project was allowed to reduce the parking
requirement from 1.5 spaces per unit to 0.8 spaces per unit. The Zoning Ordinance was amended
in 2013 to reduce the senior parking requirement to 0.75 spaces for one bedroom and 1 space for
two bedrooms.

The City offers several mechanisms to facilitate the provision of a diversity of housing types.
These mechanisms provide greater flexibility with regard to residential development standards
than conventional residential zone districts. These mechanisms, such as the Planned
Development (P-D) district and density bonuses, are described in more detail below.
February 2015                                                                         Dixon Housing Element Update
                                                         III-13
              Housing Element
     Planned Development District: The P-D district is designed to facilitate a diversity of
      uses with greater flexibility than in conventional zone districts. In particular, the district
      encourages a mix of housing styles and costs, a more efficient use of open space, and
      variety in the physical development of the city. The P-D district was used for the La
      Esperanza affordable single-family home project as well as for Valley Glen and Southwest
      Dixon. The Valley Glen Planned Development includes a number of different housing
      types such as apartments, cluster homes, medium-density single-family homes, and larger
      homes.
     Planned Multiple Residential District: The purpose of the PMR district is to reserve
      land for the development of multiple residential development. The district emphasizes the
      development of a wide variety of multi-family or multiple residential dwelling types such
      as condominiums, townhomes, and cluster homes. The district supports higher-density
      development along with appropriate community facilities that complement the residential
      uses and meet the needs of residents. Both the Southwest Dixon Specific Plan and the
      Valley Glen Planned Development used the PMR designation for the development of
      cluster homes or townhomes.
     Planned Mixed Use District: The PMU district corresponds to the Core Area Mixed Use
      (MU) designation of the General Plan and is intended to facilitate the development of a
      combination of commercial, professional, and residential uses in the downtown. This
      district accommodates the need for housing in close proximity to employment, City
      services, and public transit. There are two PMU districts, PMU-1 and PMU-2. These zones
      are distinguished by the applicable minimum site per dwelling unit regulations, with
      PMU-2 allowing smaller site areas for overall increased dwellings. Furthermore, two other
      districts—Central Commercial (CC) and Central Services (CS)—allow residential uses in
      commercial areas subject to a conditional use permit. The City has seen recent
      development of mixed-use projects in the downtown. The Asher project was constructed
      in 2008 and included 7 units with ground-floor commercial uses. No mixed-use projects
      have been developed in the downtown since 2008.
     Specific Plans: The City uses the specific plan process as a means to provide a wide
      variety of housing types as well as appropriate relief from the application of zoning
      regulations and development standards, when appropriate. The City has two specific
      plans: Northeast Quadrant and Southwest Dixon. The Southwest Dixon Specific Plan has a
      substantial residential component, which includes the development of apartments, cluster
      homes, and single-family units.

3.        Provision for a Variety of Housing Types
Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available
through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of various
types of housing for all economic segments of the population. This includes single-family housing,
multi-family housing, manufactured housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters, and transitional
housing, among others. Table III-6 summarizes those housing types, other than single-family
homes, permitted within the primary zones in Dixon.

Multi-Family Housing: The RM-2, RM-3, and RM-4 districts are the primary multi-family
districts, with a maximum density range of up to 29 units per acre. Multi-family development is
also permitted in the CD, PD, PMR, and PMU districts. Both the Commercial Services and Central
Commercial districts allow multi-family housing as part of a mixed-use development, subject to a
conditional use permit.

Secondary Living Units: A secondary living unit (or second unit) is a separate dwelling unit that
provides complete, independent living facilities for one or more persons. It includes permanent
provisions for living, sleeping, cooking, eating, and sanitation on the same parcel or parcels as the
primary unit is situated. A secondary living unit may be created by either conversion of a portion
of an existing single-family home or by adding onto an existing dwelling. Secondary living units
are conditionally permitted in Agricultural (A) districts and permitted in all single-family (R-1)
and multi-family (RM) districts.
Mobile/Manufactured Homes: Mobile homes and manufactured housing offer an affordable
housing option to many low- and moderate-income households. Approximately 1 percent of the
city’s housing stock consists of mobile homes. The City permits mobile homes and manufactured
housing in the single-family residential district (R-1).
Farmworker Housing: According to the 2010 Census, an estimated 208 persons in Dixon were
employed in the “farming, forestry, and fishing” industries; however, only a portion of these
workers were employed as farmworkers. As noted in the Housing Needs Assessment, the number
of persons living in Dixon employed in such capacities is expected to continue to decrease. While
the housing needs of farmworkers who live and work in Dixon on a permanent basis can typically
be accommodated through affordable single- and multi-family housing (the very low-income
housing afforded in this Housing Element will benefit farmworkers searching in the area for
housing), migrant farmworkers often have special housing needs. The Migrant Farm Labor
Center, located outside the city boundaries, provides housing to migrant farmworkers and their
families. The center is operated by the Yolo County Housing Authority under an agreement with
the Dixon and Solano County Housing Authorities. The center has 64 residential units and other
facilities to accommodate the needs of up to 250 workers. The units are restricted to farmworkers
and their families with very low incomes and remain fully occupied.
State law (Section 17021.6 of the Health and Safety Code) requires that farmworker housing with
12 or fewer units be permitted by right in all zones allowing agricultural uses. Health and Safety
Code Section 17021.5 requires that employee housing for farmworkers and other employees for six
persons or fewer be allowed ministerially in zones allowing single-family residential structures.
These two Health and Safety Code sections are known as the Employee Housing Act. The City’s
Zoning Ordinance allows farmworker housing in the Agricultural (A) district in Dixon. The
purposes of the Agricultural district include providing locations for permanent dwellings and
transient accommodations for persons gaining their livelihoods from agricultural pursuits, and
ensuring adequate light, air, and privacy for each dwelling unit. Program 4.1.7 is proposed to
amend the City’s Zoning Ordinance to fully comply with the Employee Housing Act.
Residential Care Facilities: Under the Lanterman Act, jurisdictions are required by the state to
treat licensed residential care facilities that provide housing and care for persons with disabilities
as a residential use. Those facilities that serve six or fewer persons must be permitted by right in
residential zone districts. The City’s Zoning Ordinance does not differentiate between nursing
homes and licensed community care facilities. Nursing homes are defined as “a structure operated
as a lodging house in which nursing, dietary, and other personal services are rendered to
convalescents, invalids, or aged persons not suffering from contagious or mental disease,
Dixon Housing Element Update                                                           February 2015

alcoholism, or drug addiction….” This definition excludes some state-licensed community care
facilities that should be permitted by right according to state laws. In general, nursing homes are
permitted in residential zone districts subject to a conditional use permit. Findings for granting a
use permit deal with designing and locating conditional uses to ensure physical compatibility
with surrounding uses. Currently, the City permits residential care facilities for six or fewer
persons by right in all residential zones and allows and permits care facilities for seven or more
persons with a conditional use permit in the R-1 zone.
Emergency Shelters: California Health and Safety Code Section 50801 defines an emergency
shelter as “housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to
occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person.”
In effect since January 1, 2008, Senate Bill (SB) 2 (Cedillo, 2007) requires the City to allow
emergency shelters without any discretionary action in at least one zone that is appropriate for
permanent emergency shelters (i.e., with commercial uses compatible with residential or light
industrial zones in transition), regardless of its demonstrated need. The goal of SB 2 was to ensure
that local governments are sharing the responsibility of providing opportunities for the
development of emergency shelters. To that end, the legislation also requires that the City
demonstrate site capacity in the zone identified to be appropriate for the development of
emergency shelters. Within the identified zone, only objective development and management
standards may be applied, given they are designed to encourage and facilitate the development of
or conversion to an emergency shelter. Those standards may include:
        The maximum number of beds or persons permitted to be served nightly by the facility
        Off-street parking based upon demonstrated need, provided that the standards do not
         require more parking for emergency shelters than for other residential or commercial uses
         within the same zone
        The size and location of exterior and interior on-site waiting and client intake areas
        The provision of on-site management
        The proximity to other emergency shelters provided that emergency shelters are not
         required to be more than 30 feet apart
        The length of stay
        Lighting
        Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation
The Zoning Ordinance permits emergency shelters by right in the ML district. There are currently
430 vacant acres are available in this zone, allowing adequate capacity for this use.

                 Housing Element
Transitional and Supportive Housing: Transitional housing is defined in Health and Safety
Code Section 50675.2 as buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under
program requirements that require the termination of assistance and recirculating of the assisted
unit to another eligible program recipient at a predetermined future point in time that shall be no
less than six months from the beginning of the assistance.
Supportive housing is defined by Health and Safety Code Section 50675.14 as housing with no
limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population, and that is linked to an on- or
off-site service that assists the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his
or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the
community.
SB 2 requires that transitional and supportive housing types be treated as residential uses and
subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same
zone. Both transitional and supportive housing types must be explicitly permitted in the
municipal code. Transitional housing is permitted in the R-1, RM, and PMR districts by right.
Program 4.1.6 is proposed to fully comply with SB 2 and allow transitional and supportive housing
in all zones that allow residential uses in the same way other residential uses are allowed.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities: Compliance with provisions of the federal Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) is assessed and enforced by the Building Official in Dixon. ADA access
is enforced through building permit entitlement and is required for all commercial development,
new construction of multi-family apartments with three or more units in any one building, and
new construction of congregate housing or shelters. Special ADA access retrofitting is not
required for remodeling or renovation of buildings, but only for new construction. In the last
planning period, the City adopted a transition plan and has been installing/replacing ADA curb
ramps and making other improvements to public facilities. The City currently evaluates the need
for reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities on a case-by-case basis. The City
does not have any specific land use or development standard related to the spacing or
concentration of persons with disabilities, or any special parking requirements. However, the City
has recently created brochures on universal design to formalize reasonable accommodation
procedures that will soon be available on the City’s website. Reasonable accommodation may
include minimal review by the Planning Director and may include the following criteria:
        The request for reasonable accommodation will be used by an individual with a disability
         protected under fair housing laws.
        The requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an individual
         with a disability protected under fair housing laws.
        The requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative
         burden on the City.
        The requested accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the nature
         of the City’s land-use and zoning program.

Extremely Low-Income Households: Assembly Bill 2634 (Lieber, 2006) requires the
quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of extremely low-income
households. Elements must also identify zoning to encourage and facilitate supportive housing
and single-room occupancy units (SROs).
Extremely low-income households typically comprise persons with special housing needs
including but not limited to persons experiencing homelessness or near-homelessness, persons
with substance abuse problems, and farmworkers. The City’s Zoning Ordinance currently allows
SROs in the Downtown Commercial (CD) district by right.
Density Bonus: In accordance with state law, the City provides density bonuses to qualified new
housing projects. Density bonuses are typically approved as part of the development approval
process. No additional processing time is required to receive a density bonus. Density bonuses
have been used by the City to provide senior and affordable housing. No density bonuses have
been granted since the Simpson Housing Project in 2001.
4.      Growth Management – Measure B
Growth management programs facilitate well-planned development and ensure that the
necessary services and facilities for residents are provided. Furthermore, the planning and land
use decisions associated with growth management intend to enhance housing opportunities by
concentrating housing in urban areas close to jobs and services, rather than in sprawling
developments that may threaten agricultural land and open space. However, a growth
management program may act as a constraint if it prevents a jurisdiction from addressing its
housing needs.
In 1986, Dixon voters approved Measure B, a growth management initiative. Voters reaffirmed the
measure in 1996. The measure limits annual residential growth in the city to a number of dwelling
units that is no more than 3 percent of the total number of housing units as of December 31 of the
prior calendar year. In addition, Measure B is intended to create and maintain an approximate
mix of 80 percent single-family housing units (including single-family attached and duplex units)
and 20 percent multi-family dwelling units. The purpose of Measure B is to achieve a balanced
housing mix and a steady, controlled rate of annual growth. While the housing stock in 2000
consisted of 14 percent multi-family units, Measure B enables the City to enhance the mix of
housing types by encouraging 20 percent multi-family units. The measure was also designed to
ensure that City services and facilities would be adequate to serve the needs of existing and future
residents.
Measure B includes one key categorical exemption so that it does not unduly constrain residential
development, particularly affordable housing. This categorical exemption excludes development
that was approved prior to the enactment of Measure B. This development is also exempt from
the 80/20 residential mix objective and the 3 percent annual growth rate.
In order to encourage the production of housing, any unallocated allotments from the residential
development allotment pool that remain unallocated under Measure B at the end of each

consecutive five-year period may continue to be used for housing. Furthermore, Measure B
contains a nondiscretionary exemption that permits a higher number of units to be built in a
single year. The measure’s “rollover” provision enables units not built during one year to be
constructed in subsequent years as long as the total number of units approved over the five-year
period averages 3 percent a year.
While Measure B manages residential growth in Dixon, it is not designed to prevent the City from
meeting its share of the regional housing needs. In addition to the exemptions listed above,
Measure B also allows the City Council to grant an exception to increase the number of residential
units built in any one year above the 3 percent threshold to meet the City’s share of the regional
housing needs.
Table III-7 shows that the 3 percent growth cap does not prevent the City from meeting its 2014–
2022 RHNA. Based on 3 percent of the 2013 Department of Finance housing unit count (6,178) in
Dixon, the City is able to build 185 units per year for the next seven years. For the City to meet its
RHNA, Dixon needs to be able to accommodate 22 units per year.

5.      Site Improvements and Development Fees
Site improvements are an important component of new development and include water, sewer,
circulation, and other infrastructure necessary to serve the new development. The City of Dixon
collects development fees to cover the costs of processing permits and providing the necessary
services and infrastructure related to new development. Table III-8 identifies the typical
development fees for single-family and multi-family housing.
The City requires pro-rata payments for off-site extension of the water, sewer, and storm drain
systems. It requires the developer to construct all internal streets, sidewalks, curb, gutter, affected
portions of off-street arterials, and other standard conditions. New residential construction will
either occur as infill on scattered lots throughout the central part of the city or be built in
outlying areas, where infrastructure and/or adequate public services and facilities may be
necessary.
Requiring developers to construct site improvements and/or pay pro-rata shares toward the
provision of infrastructure, public services, and processing will increase the cost of developing
homes and the final sales price or rent of housing. However, payment of fees is necessary to
maintain an adequate level of services and facilities, and more generally, to protect public health,
safety, and welfare. Based on a review of fees in neighboring jurisdictions and discussions with
local developers, development fees in Dixon are comparable to and in many cases lower than
most other cities in the region.
In order to assist projects that address specific needs in the community such as affordable
housing, the City has provided reductions or offsets of development fees. The City provided the La
Esperanza project with infrastructure fee offsets totaling approximately $300,000. City fees were
most recently updated January 26, 2011.

Table III-9 shows the breakdown of development fees for a single-family home ranging in size
from 1,000 square feet to 3,000 square feet. A recently developed multi-family senior housing
project, Heritage Commons, consisted of 60 units (a total of 37,523 square feet) and had a total
construction cost of $14,300,000 ($219,256 per unit). Of the total construction cost, $655,998
constituted the total fees paid, not including permit costs, which equates to 5 percent of the total
project cost. When including permit costs for Heritage Commons, the developer paid $2,332,990,
equating to 16 percent of the total development cost.

Dixon determines permit costs based on the valuation of each project. For example, as seen in
Table III-10, based on a 1,500-square-foot home with attached garage, the approximate fees
would be $45,771 (see Table III-9). Using Building-cost.net’s estimated cost for building a 1,500-
square-foot home of $212,002 and the estimated land cost of $25,000, the total estimated cost is
$237,002. Based on the cost of the project, the fees are estimated to make up close to 20 percent of
the total cost for a single-family home and 18 percent for a multi-family unit.

6.        Development Permit Procedures
Development review and permit processing are necessary steps to ensure residential construction
proceeds in an orderly manner. However, the time and cost of permit processing and review can
be a constraint to housing development if they place an undue burden on the developer.
The City of Dixon can encourage the construction, maintenance, and improvement of housing by
decreasing, to the extent possible, the time and uncertainty involved in gaining approvals for
various development permits. Based on the Permit Streamlining Act, governmental delays can be
reduced in two key ways by (1) limiting the processing time for development in most cases to one
year, and (2) requiring public agencies to specify the required information to complete an
acceptable application.
The permitting and review process for residential projects in Dixon includes an optional pre-
application review meeting, submittal of the application, a review for completeness by Planning
and Development Department staff, internal review by the Design Review Commission (Planning
Commission) and other City agencies, and review and approval by the Planning Commission and,
if necessary, the City Council. Table III-11 identifies the approximate time necessary for review of
residential developments. In general, the process for development of a subdivision involving the
development of vacant land needing an environmental impact report takes 12 to 18 months to
process. For smaller subdivisions or multi-family projects requiring a mitigated negative
declaration, the time frame is 6 to 12 months. For multi-family projects of 5 to 10 units, the time
frame is typically 4 to 6 months. For single-family and multi-family projects of up to 4 units, the

                    Housing Element                            Housing Element
time frame is 2 to 4 months. All of these estimates include the time to obtain a building permit.
However, the time necessary for review depends on the complexity of the project and whether an
exception from development standards, existing land use, or operating conditions is requested. As
an example, the time period necessary for environmental review may vary substantially depending
whether an environmental impact report or a negative declaration is required. For those projects
that involve multiple requests, all the applications are processed concurrently whenever possible.
Review of residential projects typically involves the determination of conformance with the City
General Plan and compliance under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). If the
project is not consistent with the General Plan, a General Plan amendment may be required. The
project is also reviewed to determine whether the type and amount of residential development is
consistent with the zoning for the site; otherwise a zone change is required. Several residential
projects have been granted General Plan amendments and zone changes, including the La
Esperanza affordable single-family project, the Dixon Second Street Senior Apartments, and the
Pheasant Run #7 residential development and Heritage Commons.

Design Review
Most residential developments must submit a design review application. These consist of single-
family production homes, multi-family residences (including conversion of existing structures) of
three or more units, all plans for construction in the downtown Dixon area, and multi-family
residence remodeling that would alter external appearance. Applications are processed on a first-
come, first-served basis. The City’s Community Development Director has the authority to
approve single-family or duplex developments that adhere to the City’s design guidelines. All
other development plans must be reviewed by the Design Review Commission prior to the
application for a building permit. The focus of the review is mainly on compatibility, the quality
of the site plan, and the architecture.

The Planning Commission serves as the Design Review Commission (DRC) and is composed of
seven members appointed by the City Council. The DRC is responsible for reviewing the siting of
structures, landscaping, building design, and other design-related issues for all types of
development, including residential. All multi-family development and new subdivisions are
subject to review by the DRC, as is the external remodeling of any existing multi-family complex
that would alter its external appearance.
The design review process takes about one month for most projects. Neither the design review
process nor the Design Review Commission acts as a substantial constraint to development. In
most cases, developments require only one review by the commission, and fees to cover the cost
of design review are included in overall planning fees.
The review procedures are as follows:
       The review procedure for all applications may consist of a preliminary plan and a final
        plan or just the latter. The DRC encourages a preliminary and final plan in instances of
        large or complicated development projects.
       Preliminary review by the DRC has the following purposes:
        o   Indicate to the applicant major areas of deficiency and good design.
        o   Instruct the applicant as to sections of the project which are unacceptable or need
            minor revisions.
        o   Inform the DRC on the scope of the project for the final review stage.
       When any project is brought before the Planning Commission which requires DRC
        approval, the Planning Commission shall, before it takes action on such project, refer it to
        the DRC for review and comment.
The functions of the Director and DRC shall be to review the following, with respect to all
applicable structures:
       Sitting of all structures as designed on a site plan.
       Landscaping, fencing, other screening as designed on a landscape or irrigation plan
        featuring all existing trees and shrubs and proposed plantings.
       Design of all circulation and parking and loading facilities for automobiles and bicycles.
       Location, design, and screening of garbage/recycling facilities.
       Details of fencing, public works items such as curb cuts, curbs, gutters, sidewalks,
        sidewalk design, drainage, fire hydrants.
       Location, design, and intensity of all exterior lighting.

        meters and mechanical equipment.
       Design, placement, dimension, colors of all proposed signs and exterior graphics as
        required by ordinance.

       Review of design of facilities for compliance with Attachment 4 of the California State
        Water Resources Control Board’s Water Quality Order No. 2003-005-DWQ, as may be
        amended, supplemented, or superseded.
All guidelines listed above are design guideline objectives and do not pose a constraint to the
development of housing; they are meant to assist in providing direction for each project.
7.      Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of Dixon has adopted the California Title 24 Building Codes (CBC), which establishes
standards and requires inspections at various stages of construction to ensure code compliance.
Although these standards and the time required for inspections increase housing production costs
and may impact the viability of rehabilitation of older properties that are required to be brought
up to current code standards, the intent of the codes is to provide structurally sound, safe, and
energy-efficient housing. The City currently has five substantive local amendments to the
California Building and Plumbing Codes. They include (1) requiring 4-inch-thick concrete slabs,
(2) requiring concrete mix have five sacks per cubic yard, (3) requiring rebar 18 inches on center
(4) prohibiting water piping from being installed in or under a concrete slab resting on the
ground without prior approval of the Building Official (this amendment is designed to make it
easier to repair ruptured pipe), and (5) allowing wood shakes/shingles with a Class B fire rating as
an exterior siding material. The first three amendments are based on the local geology of the
highly expansive soil located throughout the city; they are designed to create stronger concrete
and intended to address the past moisture problems many residents have experienced in their
homes.
The City’s Code Enforcement Division is responsible for enforcing both state and City regulations
governing maintenance of all buildings and property. Staff handles complaints on a reactive basis,
primarily related to property maintenance, building code issues, and inoperative vehicles, among
others. Most of the complaints affecting housing are related to the city’s older housing stock
located primarily in the former redevelopment area. To assist homeowners with housing
condition problems, Code Enforcement staff offers information about the City’s rehabilitation
program.

IV.       HOUSING RESOURCES
This section analyzes the resources available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation
of housing in Dixon. The analysis includes an evaluation of the availability of land, the City’s
ability to satisfy its share of the regional housing needs, the financial resources available to
support housing activities, and the administrative resources to assist in implementing the City’s
housing programs.
A.        AVAILABILITY OF SITES FOR HOUSING
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is responsible for developing the Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), which assigns a share of the region’s future housing need to
each jurisdiction in the region. State law requires communities to demonstrate that sufficient land
is available to accommodate their share of the region’s need for housing from January 1, 2015,
through January 31, 2023. This section identifies the development potential on suitable land in
Dixon.
1.        Regional Housing Need
The regional housing needs for different regions are determined by the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) based on projected growth in population,
employment, and households. ABAG allocates its share of the housing need to all jurisdictions in
the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. Dixon’s share of the regional housing need for the period
between 2014 and 2022 is 197 units. As shown in Table IV-1, this number is divided into five
income categories: extremely low, very low, low, moderate, and above moderate.

   Low (51%–80%)                                                24                   12%

2.       Options for Complying with the Adequate Site Requirement
State law requires jurisdictions to demonstrate that “adequate sites” will be made available over
the planning period (2015–2023 for the ABAG region) to facilitate and encourage a sufficient level
of new housing production. Jurisdictions must also demonstrate that appropriate zoning and
development standards, as well as services and facilities, will be in place to facilitate and
encourage housing. The Housing Element must inventory land suitable for residential
development, including vacant and underutilized sites, and analyzes the relationship of zoning
and public facilities and services to these sites.
In complying with the adequate site requirement, jurisdictions can take credit for the number of
new units built during the RHNA cycle of 2014–2022 toward the RHNA. This includes new
housing units either built or approved since January 1, 2014.
State law also allows jurisdictions to fulfill a portion of the RHNA with existing housing units.
Under Assembly Bill (AB) 438, jurisdictions can fulfill up to 25 percent of the RHNA for lower-
income households through the acquisition/rehabilitation of qualified substandard units that
would otherwise be demolished. Given the stringent criteria of AB 438, few communities in the
state have been able to take advantage of this provision.
AB 438 also authorizes jurisdictions to fulfill a portion of the RHNA through the preservation of
affordable units that would otherwise revert to market rents (at-risk units) but are preserved
through committed assistance from the jurisdiction. However, the high cost of preserving the at-
risk units is beyond the current financial resources of the City.
The following discussion identifies how the City may provide for a sufficient number of sites to
facilitate housing production commensurate with the 2014–2022 RHNA. In evaluating the
adequacy of sites to fulfill the RHNA by income level, HCD assesses a jurisdiction’s development
potential by zoning district and corresponding density level.
3.       Progress Toward Meeting Housing Needs
An important component of the Housing Element is the identification of sites for future housing
development and evaluation of the adequacy of these sites in fulfilling Dixon’s share of the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation, as determined by ABAG.
In the 4th cycle Housing Element update, the City included Program 5.3.1, stating that the City
would accommodate its remaining lower-income RHNA by rezoning enough sites to RM-4 to
address a shortfall of 250 units. The City has since rezoned property and approved projects to
accommodate all but 16 units of the 250. Table IV-2 details the projects/sites that have addressed
the requirements of Program 5.3.1.

In addition to the two approved projects in the table above, the City provided Redevelopment
funds to two homes (on the same lot) that that care for up to 12 homeless veterans. The facility
opened in 2009. This facility is considered transitional housing which is temporary by definition
therefore the 12 beds don’t count towards the 4th cycle RHNA.
In order to accommodate the 16 remaining units, rezoning of the Southwest Affordable Housing
site is proposed. The two parcels that make up the site total 10.7 acres and are currently zoned
RM-2. An affordable housing project for 131 units has been approved on a portion of the site. Per
the Development Agreement, the units will be affordable to low-income households or lower
depending on the final plans for development. In order to accommodate the densities allowed
under the project, the site will need to be rezoned to RM-4, which allows densities between 22
and 29 units per acre, densities feasible to facilitate development of housing affordable to lower-
income households in Dixon. Although a project has been approved on the site, building permits
have not been approved and the project is not currently moving forward. Program 5.3.1 proposes
to rezone the entire 10.7 acres; the City estimates that the site has a realistic capacity of 231 units
(131 of these units have already been approved as part of the approved project as described above).
The RM-4 zoning will have a minimum allowed density of 22 units per acre with a maximum of 29
units per acre. This program will be implemented within one year of the beginning of the 5th cycle
planning period or January 31, 2016, and the remaining 215 units that can realistically be
accommodated on the site will be available as part of the 5th cycle land inventory.
As part of the 2015–2023 Housing Element update, an analysis of the residential development
potential in Dixon was conducted. City staff performed a parcel-specific vacant and underutilized
sites analysis. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table IV-3 and compared to the
City’s share of the RHNA.

The following discusses in depth the City’s development capacity.
Units Built
Since January 2014 zero residential units have been built.
Single-Family Residential Sites
Most of the vacant sites with zoning that permits single-family development (primarily R-1, PMU,
and PMR) are currently being developed or have been approved or planned for construction.
Based on current market conditions, single-family residential land can facilitate the development
of housing affordable primarily to moderate- and above moderate-income households.
In addition to these sites, significant single-family housing development opportunities exist in
both the Valley Glen Planned Development and the Brookfield/Parklane Subdivision areas (refer
to Specific Plan residential sites discussion on page III-10).
Multi-Family Residential Sites
The city has a limited number of remaining sites zoned for multi-family housing. Overall, Dixon
has approximately 7 acres of multi-family residential sites not located in either of the specific plan
areas that can facilitate the development of housing affordable to low- and very low-income
households.
Remaining RHNA
Overall, after considering housing units already built and residential sites currently zoned at
appropriate densities, the City has a remaining challenge to provide adequate sites at appropriate
densities to facilitate the development of 74 units affordable to lower-income households
(includes extremely low, very low and low-income RHNA numbers).
Dixon Housing Element Update                                                            February 2015
                                                IV-4

                                                           Housing Element
When looking at Table IV-4 for sites without approved projects, the City has assumed a realistic
capacity of 75 percent. Realistic capacity was determined by multiplying the number of acres by
the maximum density for the site and then 75 percent of that was used as the final unit number.
The 75 percent buildout is a conservative assumption derived from recent developments in the
city. Simpson Housing was built on a 3.1-acre lot in a zone allowing a maximum density of 29
units to the acre. Containing 81 units, this development built at 90 percent of the maximum
density (29 units per acre).
Capacity for mixed-use sites in the city was determined by looking at the most recently developed
mixed-use project. The Asher project, built in 2008 in the Downtown Commercial zone, was built
as a mixed-use project at a density of 42 units to the acre. This mixed-use project was developed
with 64 percent of the project residential and 36 percent commercial; therefore, it is appropriate
to assume that half of the sites listed in Table IV-4 would develop as residential. After assuming
that 50 percent of the sites listed below could develop as residential, the City took a capacity of 75
percent of each site to determine the realistic capacity for each mixed-use site. Note that the City
does not need to rely on the mixed-use sites listed below to accommodate its regional housing
need.
Additionally, the City promotes mixed-use development and has provided funding to help
facilitate its development. The City provided $55,000 (housing-set aside funds) in a forgivable loan
for 55 years to facilitate the Asher mixed-use project. The City also has the PD overlay zone
(Ordinance 12.15.01), which allows varying standards and encourages the development of sound
housing for persons of low, moderate, and high income levels in residential projects that provide a
mix of housing styles and costs, creative approaches in the development of land, more efficient
and desirable use of open area, and appropriate variety in the physical development pattern and
in the general development standards which apply in designated housing areas of the city.
In order to accommodate all of Dixon’s extremely low-, low-, and very low-income RHNA,
Program 5.3.1 is proposed to rezone the Southwest Affordable Housing site as described earlier in
this section. Sixteen of the 231 units on the Southwest Affordable Housing site are needed to
address the City’s 4th cycle RHNA. After 16 units are removed, 215 units will remain available on
the site. The RM-4 zoning will have a minimum allowed density of 22 units per acre and a
maximum of 29 units per acre. Program 5.3.2 is also proposed to facilitate the subdivision of the
10.7 site when the affordable housing project moves forward or any other project is proposed on
the site.
In the past, the City has rezoned properties to facilitate the development of affordable housing.
The site for the Dixon Second Street Apartments (Simpson Housing) was rezoned from Light
Industrial (ML) to RM-2 and the project was granted a density bonus. In 1997, the City also
rezoned the site for the La Esperanza affordable housing development. The zoning on the site was
changed from R-1-40 and Light Industrial to Planned Multiple Residential-Planned Development
(PMR-PD). This rezone facilitated the development of 72 affordable small-lot single-family
homes. In 2003, the City also rezoned the site for the North Lincoln Creek Apartments. The
zoning was changed from Highway Commercial Planned Development (CH-PD) to Multiple
Family Residential (RM-2). The City approved a 120-unit affordable senior apartment project on a

B.      FINANCIAL RESOURCES
The City of Dixon has access to a variety of existing and potential funding sources for affordable
housing activities. These include programs from federal, state, local, and private resources. The
following section describes the key housing funding sources currently used in the city, which
include Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds from the state and Section 8 rental
assistance. Table IV-6 lists a range of potential financial resources that may be utilized in Dixon.
1.      Community Development Block Grant Funds
The US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) CDBG program provides funds
for a range of community development activities. The program is flexible in that the funds can be
used for a variety of activities. The list of eligible activities includes, but is not limited to,
acquisition and/or disposition of real estate or property, public facilities and improvements,
relocation, rehabilitation and construction (under certain limitations) of housing,
homeownership assistance, and site clearance activities. As a small city in a non-urban county,
Dixon is eligible to participate in the CDBG Program for Small Jurisdictions administered by HCD
on behalf of HUD. Funding under this program is allocated on a competitive basis. In the past,
the City had applied for and was awarded CDBG funds for economic development and housing
rehabilitation activities. In 2013, Dixon received $1.1 million in CDBG funds for housing
rehabilitation and public improvement projects.
2.      HOME Investment Partnership Act Funds
The purpose of HUD’s HOME Program is to improve and/or expand the supply of affordable
housing opportunities for low-income households. Eligible activities that can be supported with
HOME funds include the acquisition, rehabilitation, and new construction of affordable housing;
owner-occupied housing rehabilitation programs for low-income households; and first-time
homebuyer’s assistance for low-income households. As with the CDBG program, Dixon is eligible
to participate in the HOME Program for Small Jurisdictions administered by HCD on behalf of
HUD. The City has been successful in recent years in obtaining HOME funds from the state and
has used these funds to support its Housing Rehabilitation Program and its First-Time
Homebuyer Program. Projects funded with HOME funds must be targeted to very low- and low-
income households and must have permanent matching funds from non-federal resources equal
to 25 percent of the requested funds. This fund accounts for grants awarded for the Heritage
Commons and Valley Glen projects. During 2013–14, construction was completed on the 60-unit
Heritage Commons Senior Housing Complex for low-income residents. Additionally, the 59-unit
low-income Valley Glen Rental Apartment Complex was completed.
3.      Section 8 Assistance
The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program is a federal program that provides rental
assistance to very low-income persons in need of affordable housing. The Section 8 program offers
a voucher that pays the difference between the payment standard and what a tenant can afford to
pay (e.g., 30 percent of their income). The voucher allows a tenant to choose housing that may

 direct Section 8 voucher allocation but falls under the jurisdiction of the City of Vacaville Housing
 Authority. There are currently 233 vouchers in use in Dixon.

C.      ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
Described below are public and nonprofit agencies that have been involved or are interested in
housing activities in Dixon. These agencies play important roles in meeting the housing needs of
the community. In particular, they are involved in the improvement of the housing stock,
provision of affordable housing, and/or housing assistance to households in need.
Mercy Housing California: Mercy Housing California, with a regional office in West
Sacramento, is a nonprofit housing developer active in the region. Statewide, Mercy Housing has
developed over 4,000 units of affordable multi-family and self-help housing for families, seniors,
and formerly homeless persons, among others.
Community Housing Organizing Corporation: The Community Housing Opportunities
Corporation (CHOC), based in nearby Davis, has sponsored the development of approximately
1,300 units of affordable rental housing in Davis and in communities in Yolo, Sacramento, Solano,
and eastern Contra Costa counties. Of the available affordable units, 94 are senior housing, 157 are
designated for farmworkers, 76 are SRO units, and 15 units are for mentally ill adult residential
care. CHOC finances developments and programs through a complex blend of private and public
loans and grants. Among its projects in Solano County, CHOC was involved in the completion of
Hampton Place/Gateway Village in Fairfield. The development consists of 56 apartments, of
which 18 are three-bedroom units and 38 are two-bedroom units. The project provides 56 units of
housing to very low- and low-income families.
Solano County Habitat for Humanity, Inc.: Solano County Habitat for Humanity is a nonprofit
housing developer that was founded in 1992 as an affiliate of Habitat International. Solano County
Habitat for Humanity serves both Solano and Napa counties and over the past ten years has built
five homes and renovated one. Habitat builds a variety of ownership housing including both one-
and two-story “duplex” styles. Most Habitat homes are typically 1,100 to 1,300 square feet and have
three bedrooms. Solano Habitat recently completed builds in Fairfield and foreclosure home
rehabilitation in Vallejo.
D.      OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
With respect to residential construction, opportunities primarily take the form of construction of
new homes using energy-efficient designs, materials, fixtures, and appliances, or retrofitting
existing homes to be more energy efficient (e.g., weather stripping, upgrading insulation,
upgrading to more energy-efficient fixtures and appliances). At a minimum, new housing
construction in Dixon must comply with the State of California Title 24 energy efficiency
standards. These requirements are enforced through the building plan check process.
In addition to the design and construction of individual buildings, the development industry is
becoming increasingly aware of opportunities for energy conservation at the site planning level
and even at the community planning level. New developments are increasingly being planned so
that building orientations will take advantage of passive solar energy benefits. Larger-scale land
use planning is increasingly considering the benefits of compact urban form (i.e., higher

densities) as a means to reduce auto dependency for transportation, and the benefits of mixed-use
land use patterns to make neighborhoods more self-contained so that residents can walk or
bicycle to places of work, shopping, or other services. Compact urban development patterns are
necessary to improve the effectiveness of buses and other forms of public transit. If effective
public transit is available and convenient, energy will be conserved through reduced auto use.
Utility-related costs can directly impact the affordability of housing in Northern California.
However, Title 24 of the California Administrative Code sets forth mandatory energy standards
for new development and requires adoption of an “energy budget.” In turn, the home building
industry must comply with these standards while localities are responsible for enforcing the
energy conservation regulations.
The following are among the alternative ways to meet these energy standards.
       Alternative 1: The passive solar approach that requires proper solar orientation,
        appropriate levels of thermal mass, south-facing windows, and moderate insulation levels.
       Alternative 2: Generally requires higher levels of insulation than Alternative 1, but has no
        thermal mass or window orientation requirements.
       Alternative 3: Also is without passive solar design but requires active solar water heating in
        exchange for less stringent insulation and/or glazing requirements.
Additional energy conservation measures are as follows: (1) locating the home on the northern
portion of the sunniest location of the site; (2) designing the structure to admit the maximum
amount of sunlight into the building and to reduce exposure to extreme weather conditions;
(3) locating indoor areas of maximum usage along the south face of the building and placing
corridors, closets, laundry rooms, power core, and garages along the north face; and (4) making
the main entrance a small enclosed space that creates an air lock between the building and its
exterior, orienting the entrance away from winds, or using a windbreak to reduce the wind
velocity against the entrance.
Energy-efficient, new residential construction can cut energy consumption in the home by up to
50 percent. A few energy-efficient home construction and retrofits are described below.
       Double-pane windows (two panes of glass enclose a vacuum-tight space that does not
        allow heat and cold to transfer as quickly as it does in a window with a single pane of
        glass)
       Attic insulation greater than R-19 (soft, fiberglass insulation is given an “R” rating based on
        its capacity to insulate an area; a higher R value indicates greater insulation capability)
       Rigid attic insulation (generally a compressed Styrofoam insulation with an R-30 value)
       Additional wall insulation (older homes may not have insulated walls)

       Fluorescent indoor lighting (a standard, incandescent light bulb uses more energy)
       Shade trees along southern and western exposures, and glazing to reduce the heat from
        windows on hot summer days
       Solar screens that reduce the amount of heat from solar radiation coming through
        windows
       Evaporative cooler, which uses less energy than an air conditioner
       Pools and/or hot tubs with integrated cleaning and heating systems (including pool
        covers, active solar heating, and efficient filters, pumps, and motors)
       Energy use automatic timers that provide energy only when it is necessary
       Drip irrigation system that conserves water and reduces the energy needed for pumping
        water
       Drought-tolerant landscaping
       Energy-efficient appliances (in new construction and replacing older appliances in existing
        homes)
       Reflective film on south-facing windows to minimize heat gain during the summer
       Individual meters for gas, electricity, and water (to encourage conservation) in multi-
        family units
Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E), which provides both natural gas and electricity to
residential consumers in Dixon, offers various programs to promote the efficient use of energy
and assist lower-income customers. These programs are discussed below.
PG&E provides a variety of energy conservation services for residents. PG&E also participates in
several other energy assistance programs for lower-income households, which help qualified
homeowners and renters conserve energy and control electricity costs. These programs include
the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program and the Relief for Energy Assistance
through Community Help (REACH) Program.
The CARE Program provides a 20 percent monthly discount on gas and electric bills to income-
qualified households, certain nonprofits, facilities housing agricultural employees, homeless
shelters, hospices, and other qualified nonprofit group living facilities.
The REACH Program provides one-time energy assistance of $200 to customers who have no
other way to pay their energy bill. The intent of REACH is to assist low-income customers,
particularly the elderly, disabled, sick, working poor, and unemployed, who experience severe
hardships and are unable to pay for their necessary energy needs.

         addition, the City will evaluate adopting
         development and managerial standards
         that will be consistent with Government
         Code Section 65583(a)(4). These standards
         may include such items as:
            Lighting
            On-site management
            Maximum number of beds or persons
             to be served nightly by the facility
            Off-street parking based on
             demonstrated need

             emergency shelter is in operation
      b. Transitional and Supportive Housing
         Transitional and supportive housing
         provides temporary housing often with
         supportive services to formerly homeless
         persons for a period that is typically
         between six months and two years. The
         supportive services, such as job training,
         rehabilitation, and counseling, help
         individuals gain life skills necessary for
         independent living.

          Currently the City allows transitional
          housing in the RM-2 district subject to a
          conditional use permit. Pursuant to SB 2,
          the City must explicitly allow both
          supportive and transitional housing types
          in all residential zones. The City shall
          update its Zoning Ordinance to include
          separate definitions of transitional and
          supportive housing as defined in Section
          50675.2 of Health and Safety Code Sections
          50675.2 and 50675.14. Both transitional and
          supportive housing types will be allowed as
          a permitted use subject to only the same
          restrictions on residential uses contained in
          the same type of structure.
      c. Extremely Low Income: Assembly Bill 2634
          requires the quantification and analysis of
          existing and projected housing needs of
          extremely low-income households and
          requires Housing Elements to identify
          zoning to encourage and facilitate
          supportive housing and single-room
          occupancy units (SROs).
          To ensure zoning flexibility that allows for
          the development of SROs, the City will
          update its Zoning Ordinance to explicitly
          allow for SROs in the Central Commercial

B.      HOUSING GOALS AND POLICIES
Sections II through IV of the Housing Element present an assessment of housing needs in Dixon,
an analysis of constraints to the provision of housing, an inventory of land, and the financial and
administrative resources that are available to address housing needs. The goals and policies set
forth in this Housing Element are designed to address the identified housing needs in the city.
The City’s plan for addressing its identified housing needs is outlined in the following areas:
       Housing and Neighborhood Conservation
       Housing Production
       Special Needs Housing
       Housing Affordability
       Governmental Constraints
       Promotion of Equal Housing Opportunity
       Energy Conservation
The following goals and policies are designed to provide for the preservation, production,
maintenance, and improvement of housing in Dixon.
1.      Housing and Neighborhood Conservation
Housing and neighborhood conservation are important to maintaining and improving the quality
of the housing stock. While much of the housing in the city is relatively new, about 5 percent of
the housing is considered to be in need of repair, particularly the older housing stock located near
the downtown. The City will continue its efforts to improve the housing condition through its
Housing Rehabilitation Program and code enforcement efforts. The policies listed below address
the issue of housing and neighborhood conservation.
GOAL 1:             Maintain and improve the quality of the existing housing stock
                    and residential neighborhoods.
Policy 1.1:         Assist owners of rental properties and low-income homeowners, to the
                    extent that resources are available, in maintaining and improving
                    residential properties through the City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program.
Program 1.1.1       Housing Rehabilitation: The City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program provides low-
                    interest loans of up to $10,000 to assist lower-income families. The loans are available to
                    owner-occupants as well as to owners of rental property. There are no application fees

                 for the loans, and interest rates are as low as 2 percent. The City will continue to use
                 Community Development Block Grants, when available, to fund the City’s Housing
                 Rehabilitation Program.
                 Eight-Year Objectives: Provide loans to rehabilitate three to five housing units
                 annually. Advertise the program on the City website and provide information at public
                 counters.
                 Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
                 Time Frame: Annually
                 Funding: CDBG
Policy 1.2:      Concentrate rehabilitation assistance and code enforcement efforts in
                 areas of the city with a concentration of older and/or substandard
                 residential structures.
Program 1.2.1    Code Enforcement: The City’s Code Enforcement staff is responsible for ensuring
                 compliance with building and property maintenance codes. Code Enforcement handles
                 complaints on a reactive basis and deals with a variety of issues, including property
                 maintenance, abandoned vehicles, and housing conditions. The City will continue to use
                 Code Enforcement and Building Division staff to ensure compliance with building and
                 property maintenance codes. The Code Enforcement program is complaint-based.
                 Eight-Year Objective: Continue code enforcement activities. Code Enforcement and
                 Building Division staff will assist in referring eligible property owners to the City’s
                 Housing Rehabilitation Program for assistance. The City plans to broaden the
                 rehabilitation program, targeting specific areas of the community based on criteria that
                 the City develops including age, code violations, visual assessment, and Government
                 Code health and safety concerns.
                 Responsible Agency: Code Enforcement and Building Division
                 Time Frame: Ongoing
                 Funding: General Fund
GOAL 2:          Protect and conserve the existing housing stock in Dixon.
Policy 2.1:      Develop criteria for the conversion of rental units to condominiums.
Program 2.1.1    Condominium Conversion Ordinance: Both ownership and rental housing are an
                 essential part of any community’s housing stock. The conversion of existing apartment
                 complexes to condominiums can reduce the supply of available rental units, an
                 important housing option for lower-income working families and individuals. An
                 ordinance that outlines specific requirements and/or criteria for the conversion of rental

                   units to condominiums or cooperative housing projects can ensure that rental
                   households are not adversely affected by the conversion of apartment complexes.
                   Eight-Year Objective: Develop and adopt a condominium conversion ordinance that
                   includes requirements and criteria for converting rental apartments to condominiums or
                   cooperative projects
                   Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
                   Time Frame: The City will adopt a Condo Conversion Ordinance by December 2015.
                   Funding: General Fund
Policy 2.2:        Work to preserve affordable housing developments that may be at risk of
                   converting to market rate.
Program 2.2.1      Preservation of Units: State law requires jurisdictions to provide a program in their
                   housing elements to preserve publicly assisted affordable housing projects at risk of
                   converting to market-rate housing. The City will continue to monitor the status of
                   affordable housing projects, in particular the 65 units at risk within ten years of the
                   beginning of the planning period. As their funding sources near expiration, the City will
                   work with the owners and other agencies to consider options to preserve such units.
                   Eight-Year Objective: Continue to monitor the status of assisted units in affordable
                   projects, in particular the 65 at-risk units. Provide technical support to property owners
                   and tenants regarding proper procedures relating to noticing and options for
                   preservation
                   Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
                   Time Frame: Annually monitor

2.      Housing Production
The Regional Housing Need Plan (RHNP) identifies the need for a variety of housing types at a
range of prices and rents to accommodate existing and future housing needs resulting from local
and regional growth. Housing diversity is important to ensure that all households, regardless of
income level, age, and household type, have the opportunity to find housing suited to their needs
and lifestyle. The following policies identify the City’s efforts to encourage the development of
housing.
February 2015                                                              Dixon Housing Element Update

              Housing Element
GOAL 3:          Encourage a diversity of housing types that will meet a range of
                 needs for all economic groups in Dixon.
Policy 3.1:      Maintain land use policies that allow residential growth consistent with
                 the availability of adequate infrastructure and public services.
Program 3.1.1    Utilize Exemptions Under Measure B: Measure B allows the City Council to grant an
                 exception to increase the number of residential units built in any one year above the 3
                 percent threshold to meet Dixon’s share of the regional housing needs. Before the
                 dissolution of Redevelopment Measure B exempted all development in the
                 Redevelopment Area from both the 3 percent annual increase cap and the 80/20 (80
                 percent single-family/20 percent multi-family) housing mix. The City is working on
                 updates to the Measure B ordinance to delete all references to Redevelopment Areas
                 being exempt. With the exemption gone, any future development within the
                 Redevelopment Area would need the Council to allocate the project Measure B
                 residential allotments.
                 Eight-Year Objective: Continue to implement existing exemptions that are part of
                 Measure B. Annually review progress in meeting the regional housing needs, and
                 determine whether increased number of units above the 3 percent cap should be
                 granted.

                 Time Frame: Annually
                 Funding: General Fund
Policy 3.2:      Provide for an adequate supply of developable residential land within the
                 city limits as well as through the annexation of land in the City’s Sphere of
                 Influence when necessary and appropriate.
Program 3.2.1    Land Inventory Program: Dixon has a limited supply of vacant land zoned for
                 residential use. Additional land may be needed in order to address Dixon’s share of the
                 regional housing need. The City initiated a comprehensive review of available sites
                 within Dixon’s boundaries that may be suitable for housing development. The City will
                 continue to conduct annual reviews of available residential land to determine if rezoning,
                 increased density, or additional land is necessary within the city limits or whether land
                 should be made available through annexations from the City’s Sphere of Influence to
                 address the City’s housing needs or if changes in zoning may be needed to meet City
                 housing needs. Such zoning changes will be adopted annually, if needed.
                 Eight-Year Objective: Conduct regular reviews of available land to provide adequate
                 sites for residential development. Provide an update on the residential sites inventory as
                 part of the annual report on the progress of implementing the General Plan.

Policy 3.3:   Encourage a variety of housing types including both rental and ownership
              housing and new for-sale and rental housing units that will provide a
              choice of housing type, density, and cost.
Program 3.3.1 Housing Diversity: A diversity of housing types is important in order to provide a
              greater range of housing choice and to address the housing needs of all community
              members. The City will assign priority for Measure B allocations and entitlement
              processing to projects that include more than one housing type.
              Eight-Year Objective: Assign priority for Measure B allocations to projects with more
              than one type of housing.

              the city that will result in the production of housing available to all income levels,
              including single-family subdivisions where 5 percent of the units are dedicated to the
              development of custom homes.
              Eight-Year Objective: The City will implement a 5 percent custom home requirement
              in new subdivisions.

Program 3.3.3 Residential Development Requirements: Residential development projects of 50
              gross acres or more shall include a minimum of 5 percent of the total project residential
              developable acreage (net) for residential uses of 20 units per acre or higher, and 5
              percent for residential uses of 10 units per acre or higher. Development projects with a
              requirement of less than 5 acres in either or both categories may opt to designate land
              off-site, if deemed appropriate for the project. If projects propose densities higher than
              the identified density, the required acreage shall be decreased accordingly.
              For the purpose of satisfying the 5 percent requirement for land uses at or above 20
              units per acre, sites must meet the following requirements:

Special Needs Housing
Persons and households with special housing needs include the elderly, persons with disabilities
(including those with developmental disabilities), large households, single-parent households,
farmworkers, and the homeless. These groups typically have difficulty in finding suitable and
affordable housing. The policies listed below identify City efforts to continue to facilitate housing
to serve those with special needs.
GOAL 4:            Address the housing needs of special population groups.
Policy 4.1:        Encourage the development of housing for special needs populations by
                   offering density bonuses and other incentives.
Program 4.1.1      Provide Incentives for Special Needs Housing: The City has a number of incentives
                   to encourage the production of housing to meet the needs of special needs populations,
                   such as the elderly and persons with physical and developmental disabilities. These
                   include density bonuses, modification of development standards, and development fee
                   offsets.
                   The City has provided incentives in the past to facilitate special needs housing. The
                   Dixon Street Senior Apartments project was granted a density bonus and reduced
                   parking standards, and the project was provided with financial assistance in the form of
                   a low-interest loan for development of the project. The City will also participate in
                   special needs housing projects of various types by providing gap financing or assisting
                   with on- and off-site improvements, such as bus access for senior housing. The City will
                   pursue grants, such as HOME matching grants, Community Development Block Grant,
                   Farmworker Housing Grant Program, and other appropriate federal and state funding,
                   to use in incentivizing development of special needs housing of all types. The City will
                   continue to encourage housing development for special needs groups through the
                   provision of density bonuses, regulatory incentives, and/or financial assistance.

Program 4.1.8 Special Needs Housing, Including for Those with Developmental Disabilities:
              The City will work with housing providers to ensure that special housing needs and the
              needs of lower-income households are addressed for seniors, large families, female-
              headed households, female-headed households with children, persons with physical and
              development disabilities and, extremely low-income households, and homeless
              individuals and families. The City will seek to meet these special housing needs through
              a combination of regulatory incentives, zoning standards, new housing construction
              programs, and supportive services programs. The City will promote market-rate and
              affordable housing sites, housing programs, and financial assistance available from the
              city, county, state, and federal governments. In addition, as appropriate, the City will
              apply or support others’ applications for funding under state and federal programs
              designated specifically for special needs groups and other lower-income households such
              as seniors, persons with physical and developmental disabilities, extremely low-income
              households, and persons at risk for homelessness.

Housing Affordability
According to HUD, a household is considered to be overpaying for housing when 30 percent of a
household’s total income is spent on housing. As housing prices increase, it becomes more
difficult for low- and moderate-income households to afford to live in the community. Providing
sufficient sites for a range of housing types as well as assisting in the development of affordable
workforce housing encourages housing for all households. The following policies facilitate
housing affordability.
GOAL 5:              Encourage the production of housing affordable to low- and
                     moderate-income households.
Policy 5.1:          Establish affordable housing objectives consistent with the City’s share of
                     the regional housing need.
Policy 5.2:          Continue the Measure B implementation procedures that provide
                     incentives for the production of affordable housing.
Program 5.2.1        Affordable Housing Allotment: The City adopted an updated implementation
                     ordinance for Measure B in April 2002, which allocates all unused housing allotments at
                     the end of each five-year period to be used solely for affordable housing with City
                     Council approval. As part of the implementation program for Measure B, the City will
                     provide allocations for the development of affordable housing.
                     Eight-Year Objective: If any allocations are unused prior to new unit allocations
                     becoming available in 2015, communicate to housing developers interested in
                     developing affordable housing in Dixon regarding the availability of unused Measure B
                     allotments. The City Council will pass a resolution stating that unused allotment to be
                     used in the following five-year period would apply in addition to the 15 percent already
                     allowed.

Policy 5.3:   Ensure that adequate sites are available for affordable housing
              development throughout the city.
Program 5.3.1 Program to Rezone Sites: Program to Rezone Sites: The City made substantial
              progress toward rezoning sites and approving projects to address the 250-unit Regional
              Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) shortfall from the 4th cycle Housing Element as
              shown in Table IV 2 of the Resources section of the Housing Element. After taking
              these efforts into account, a shortfall of 16 units affordable to lower-income households
              remains for the 4th cycle. In order to accommodate the 16 remaining units,
              redesignation and rezoning of the Southwest Affordable Housing site is proposed. The
              two parcels that make up the site total 10.7 acres and are currently designated MDH and
              zoned RM-2. An affordable housing project for 131 units has been approved on a
              portion of the site. In order to accommodate the densities allowed under the project, the
              site will need to be rezoned to RM-4, which allows densities between 22 and 29 units per
              acre, densities feasible to facilitate development of housing affordable to lower-income
              households in Dixon. A General Plan Amendment will also be required for the site to
              redesignate it to HD allowing 21.78 to 29.04 units per acre. Although a project has been
              approved on the site, building permits have not been approved and the project is not
              currently moving forward. This program proposes to redesignate/rezone the entire 10.7
              acres; the City estimates that the site has a realistic capacity of 231 units (131 of these
              units have already been approved as part of the approved project as described above).
              The HD designation/RM-4 zoning will have a minimum allowed density of 21.78 units
              per acre with a maximum of 29.04 units per acre and allows residential uses only. This
              program will be implemented within one year of the beginning of the 5th cycle planning
              period or January 31, 2016.
              The City will monitor compliance with Dixon’s share of the regional housing need.
              Within one year of adoption of the Housing Element, the City will undertake steps to
              ensure that adequate sites are available to meet the City’s share of the regional housing
              need by rezoning of land for multi-family development and/or increasing the density of
              sites. The site proposed for rezoning permits owner-occupied and rental multi-family
              developments by right and does not require a conditional use permit, planned
              development permit, or any other discretionary review.
              Eight-Year Objective: The City will rezone the 10.7-acre Southwest Affordable
              Housing site within one year of the beginning of the 5th cycle Housing Element
              planning period, by January 31, 2016. The City will also prepare a General Plan
              Amendment to redesignate the land use category to High Density (HD) for consistency
              with the RM-4 zoning.

Program 5.4.1    Affordable Housing Development Assistance: The provision of affordable housing
                 and the implementation of other programs to support this type of development depend
                 on the availability of housing funding from county, state, federal, and local sources. As
                 discussed in Section IV, Housing Resources, a number of programs offered by state and
                 federal agencies provide direct subsidies, mortgage insurance, or low-interest loans to
                 nonprofit developers. Many of these programs offer:
                    Technical assistance grants for project feasibility and development
                    Subsidies for shared housing for:
                        o    Shared housing for seniors
                        o    Congregate housing

                  Project loans and loan insurance for single-family and multi-family housing
                   construction/rehabilitation
              The City is increasing and will continue to increase its competitiveness for these grants
              through such actions as preparing and adopting a Housing Element meeting state laws,
              identifying City resources to be used as matching grants for federal and state programs,
              and coordinating with local service providers regarding state grant opportunities.
              Eight-Year Objective: Identify and apply for federal and state funding, if available, for
              the construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing affordable to very low- and
              low-income households. Work with developers to assist them in securing these funds.
              Funding programs that may be pursued include HOME partnership grants, CDBG,
              Farmworker Housing Grant Program, and other appropriate funding.

Program 5.4.2 Section 8 Rental Assistance: The Housing Choice Voucher or Section 8 rental
              assistance program provides rental subsidies to very low-income households, including
              seniors, families, and persons with disabilities. Through the Section 8 program, a person
              or family can receive a voucher that pays the difference between the current fair market
              rent (FMR) as established by HUD and what a tenant can afford to pay (i.e., 30 percent
              of household income). Households with Section 8 vouchers can live wherever landlords
              accept the vouchers. The voucher enables a household to choose rental housing that
              may be in excess of the FMR so long as the household pays the extra cost.
              The Housing Authority of the City of Vacaville administers the Section 8 program for
              Dixon. Given the continued need for rental assistance, the City supports and encourages
              the provision of additional subsidies through the Section 8 program.
              Eight-Year Objective: Assist the Housing Authority of Vacaville with publicizing the
              Section 8 program, and provide referrals to the Housing Authority. Publish the names
              and contact information for the complexes in the Dixon area that accept Section 8
              vouchers on the City’s website.

Governmental Constraints
Market factors and government regulations can significantly impact the production and
affordability of housing. While market conditions are typically beyond the control of any local
jurisdiction, the City can ensure the appropriateness of governmental regulations that affect the
maintenance, improvement, and development of housing. Whenever possible, efforts should be
undertaken to address these constraints.
GOAL 6:             Where appropriate, mitigate governmental constraints to the
                    maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
Policy 6.1:         Periodically review the City’s regulations, ordinances, and development
                    fees/exactions to ensure they do not unduly constrain the production,
                    maintenance, and improvement of housing.
Program 6.1.1       Regulatory Incentives and Financial Assistance: Regulatory incentives and financial
                    assistance can be used in the development of projects that address local housing needs.
                    The City can assist with the development of quality affordable housing by offering
                    regulatory and/or financial incentives. The City will continue to encourage the provision

              financial assistance with available state or federal funding sources. The assistance
              includes the City’s First-Time Homebuyer Program through which the City provides
              assistance to low-income households that are planning to purchase their first home. The
              program provides a deferred low-interest loan of up to 25 percent of the appraised value
              to assist with down payment and closing costs. Refer to Section IV of this Housing
              Element for some details about funding sources.

              assistance, such as reduced parking requirements and low-interest loans, to encourage
              quality affordable housing projects. Assist an average of three households annually

Program 6.1.2 Planning Fee Review: High development fees can add to the cost of housing and act
              as a constraint to development in a community. Planning fees should be commensurate
              with the cost to provide infrastructure and services needed to support growth. Periodic
              annual review of planning fees can help ensure that planning fees correspond to the cost
              of services and do not overburden developers. If fees are determined to be excessive
              compared to the cost of providing services to new development, they should be adjusted
              appropriately.
              Eight-Year Objective: Conduct periodic annual review and, if appropriate, adjustment
              of City development fees.

Program 6.3.1       Planned Development District: The Planned Development (PD) district offers
                    developers greater flexibility than in conventional zone districts. The PD district enables
                    developers to provide a greater range of housing units that can accommodate a variety
                    of needs. Both Southwest Dixon and Valley Glen used this zoning district to include
                    several different housing types such as apartments, townhomes, and attached single-
                    family units, as well as detached single-family homes on larger lots. The City will
                    continue to use this district to offer residents greater housing choice.
                    Eight-Year Objective: Continue to use the Planned Development district to provide
                    flexible development standards to address housing needs by encouraging a mix of
                    housing types at a range of densities.

Promotion of Equal Housing Opportunity
Equal access to housing is a fundamental right that enables each person to meet essential needs
and assist in the pursuit of other goals such as employment and education. In recognition of equal
housing access as a fundamental right, the federal government and the State of California have
both established fair housing as a right protected by law. The following policies support City
efforts to provide information and encourage fair housing practices in Dixon.
GOAL 7:             Promote equal housing opportunities for all residents in Dixon.
Policy 7.1:         Encourage fair housing practices throughout the city by providing
                    information to residents on their rights and responsibilities under fair
                    housing law.
Policy 7.2:         Discourage discrimination in the sale or rental of housing to anyone on
                    the basis of race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, disability, sex,
                    sexual orientation, familial status, marital status, or other such arbitrary
                    factors.

Program 7.2.1 Fair Housing Program: Fair housing is defined as a condition where individuals of
              similar incomes in the same housing market have a like range of choice available to them
              regardless of their race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, disability, sex, sexual
              orientation, familial status, marital status, or other such arbitrary factors.
              Support the enforcement of the fair housing laws to protect against housing
              discrimination, provide adequate information about renters’ rights, and promote equal
              housing opportunity. Due to limited funding, the City does not contract directly with a
              local fair housing service provider. However, the City refers discrimination cases to
              HUD, to the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, and to Legal Services of
              Northern California’s fair housing hotline. The City will further fair housing practices in
              the community by publicizing and providing information on fair housing laws and
              owner and renter rights and responsibilities, as well as referrals to the local fair housing
              hotline. In addition, the City will include the fair housing complaint hotline number on
              City housing flyers and on the City’s website.
              Eight-Year Objective: Continue to publicize and provide information on fair housing
              laws and include a listing of local fair housing resources in City housing flyers and on the
              City’s website. The City will encourage housing professionals such as nonprofit housing
              providers and apartment owners/management associations to conduct workshops to
              educate the community on tenant/landlord rights and responsibilities.

Program 7.2.2 Citizen Participation: Input from the community is crucial to the identification of
              housing needs, the development of local and regional plans, and the successful
              implementation of housing programs. The City solicited public input in a variety of ways
              throughout the development of the Housing Element. The City will continue to engage
              the public in the planning process and provide opportunities for input/feedback on
              housing issues through public meetings and the dissemination of information. The City
              will also convene a housing committee to provide housing specific input on a regular
              basis.
              Eight-Year Objective: Continue to encourage and solicit public input on housing
              issues through the use of community meetings and workshops.

Energy Conservation
Conserving the region’s resources not only ensures that these resources are available to future
residents but also helps reduce utility costs. The following policy continues the City’s efforts to
conserve energy and water resources through the design of housing.
GOAL 8:            Conserve energy and water in the development of new housing.
Policy 8.1:        Encourage energy and water conservation design features in residential
                   developments.
Program 8.1.2      Energy Efficiency Improvements: Minor improvements, such as weatherization,
                   insulation installation, and other energy conservation retrofitting measures, can help
                   lower overall housing costs. This can be especially helpful to lower-income households
                   by enabling them to reduce their utility payments. The City’s Housing Rehabilitation
                   Program along with the Safe at Home program and the Tax Increment Housing Set-
                   Aside program provide low interest loans to low-income households for such energy
                   efficiency improvements. Furthermore, PG&E also offers several programs, such as the
                   Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which provides free
                   weatherization services and a list of participating contractors to assist low-income
                   households. The City will continue to assist low-income households with energy
                   efficiency improvements through its Housing Rehabilitation Program and will provide
                   information about PG&E’s weatherization services programs.
                   Eight-Year Objective: Assist low-income residents in need of assistance with energy
                   efficiency improvements through the City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program and
                   provide information on other free or low-cost weatherization services.

The Dixon General Plan Program is designed to provide a comprehensive land use plan for the 
City  of  Dixon  to  replace  the  Dixon  General  Plan  which  was  adopted  in  1987.  The  goal  of  this 
program is to help strengthen the City's ability to guide development and implement recognized 
community  objectives.  The  emphasis  is  on  identifying  practical  goals,  realistic  policies  and 
feasible, cost‐effective programs which the City intends to follow and support in implementing 
the General Plan. 
This General Plan is the ninth report produced for the General Plan Program for the City of 
Dixon. Prior reports prepared for review in this program have included: 
                 Work Program, Schedule of Activities, and Guidelines 
                 Issues and Policy Choices 
                 Alternative Scenarios 
                 Preliminary Draft General Plan 
                 Hearing Draft General Plan 
                 Environmental Assessment 
                 Environmental Assessment (Responses to Comments) 
                 Final Draft General Plan 
The  first  report  described  the  purpose  of  the  General  Plan  Program,  identified  the  roles  of  the 
participants  and  outlined  the  schedule  leading  to  the  adoption  of  the  General  Plan.  The 
second  report  was  designed  to  assist  participants  in  defining  the  policy  directions  for  the 
development of the Hearing Draft General Plan. The third report presented a series of maps and 
projections for a number of General Plan alternatives, which contributed to the development of 
the  Hearing  Draft  General  Plan.  The  Preliminary  Draft  General  Plan  provided  the  basis  for 
additional  modifications  which  resulted  in  the  Hearing  Draft  General  Plan.  This  General  Plan 
document  incorporates  changes  and  revisions  resulting  from  testimony  received  during  the 
public review process and public hearings before the City Council and Planning Commission, 
and was adopted by the Dixon City Council on December 14, 1993 by Resolution No. 93‐
123. The Planning Commission approved certification of the Environmental Assessment and 
adoption  of  the  General Plan with some recommended text revisions on December 8, 1993. 
Documents  relating  to  the  adoption  of  the  General  Plan  are  included  in  Appendix  A  of  this 
report. 
During  the  development  of  the  General  Plan,  the  General  Plan  Steering  Committee  (GPSC)  met 
frequently to discuss General Plan issues and to provide input for the documents prepared as 
part of the General Plan Program. GPSC members provided a wide range of viewpoints regarding 
the  goals  and  policies  to  be  included  in  the  Dixon  General  Plan.  This  report,  although  revised 
from  earlier  versions,  still  represents  a  consensus  plan  which  reflects  the  preponderant 
viewpoints received in the discussions and meetings held to review the alternative scenarios.

In  2010,  the  General  Plan  was  updated  to  incorporate  current  maps  and  statistical  data, 
formatted  for  consistency  based  on  the  Air  Quality  and  Energy  Element  format,  and  added 
discussion  regarding  seismic  hazards  and  flooding  as  required  by  law.    For  more  detailed 
information  regarding  the  status  of  various  regulatory  and  infrastructure  issues,  refer  to  the 
General Plan Update Background Report, July 2008, at www.ci.dixon.ca.us.

policy direction to those involved in the development process. 
This comprehensive General Plan is geographic, in that it covers the entire Dixon Planning Area, 
addressing land use concerns beyond the city limits. It also addresses a range of issues that 
are associated with Dixon's development, including physical, economic and social concerns. 
The  State  of  California  requires  each  city  to  adopt  a  general  plan  "for  the  physical 
development  of  the  county  or  city,  and  any  land  outside  its  boundaries  which...bears 
relation  to  its  planning."  The Dixon General Plan is to act as a "constitution" for development, 
and  will  provide  the  basic  foundation  for  all  local  land  use  decisions.  No  subdivision,  parcel 
map or rezoning can be approved unless it is found to be in harmony with an adopted general 
plan. Public works projects proposed by local government agencies and special districts must 
be  reviewed  by  the  Dixon  Planning  Commission  and  the  Dixon  City  Council  to  determine 
their conformance with the General Plan. 
Not long ago, local general plans were regarded as merely a set of broad policies that had only a 
distant  relationship  to  actual  development  decisions.  However,  the  importance  of  general 
plans has increased over the past twenty years, and an "adequate" general plan can no longer 
be simply a vague picture of a city's future. Under current law, the Dixon General Plan must 
be able to provide concrete direction for community decision‐making. 
In  California,  state  law  makes  the  general  plan  the  foundation  and  central  feature  of  the 
local  planning  process.  Each  city  and  county  is  required  to  prepare,  adopt  and  maintain  a 
general plan to govern the physical development of all of the land area under its jurisdiction. 
The purposes which will be served by the Dixon General Plan include: 
        The  identification  of  Dixon's  physical  development  goals  and  goals  relating  to 
         environmental, economic and other factors. 
        The  definition  of  policies  for  maintaining  or  improving  the  character  of  existing  uses 
         and for guiding the location and nature of future development, in order to ensure that 
         Dixon's goals are achieved.

CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
Introduction 
        The  consideration  of  all  aspects  of  local  conditions  within  the  Dixon  Planning  Area 
         which affect  physical development  and change, in  order to  ensure  that problems  and 
         opportunities  are  adequately  analyzed  and  addressed  within  the  context  of  local, 
         regional, statewide and national goals and policies. 
        The provision of information to Dixon residents, business people, property owners and 
         other interested persons about the planning and decision‐making process of the local 
         government. 
        The description of procedures and measures intended to improve the coordination of 
         local government actions affecting the development of Dixon. 
Planning  and  land  use  regulation  in  Dixon  stem  from  the  two  main  legal  powers  granted  to 
cities  and  counties  by  the  Constitution  of  the  State  of  California:  corporate  powers  and  police 
powers. Corporate power provides Dixon with the authority to collect revenues (from bonds, 
fees,  taxes  and  assessments)  and  to  spend  these  monies  to  provide  services  and  facilities 
(such as roads, water and sewerage facilities, parks, etc.). Police power provides Dixon with 
the authority to regulate citizen behavior (including the use of private property) in order to 
promote  the  health,  safety,  welfare  and  morals  of  the  public.  Land  use  planning,  zoning, 
subdivision and building regulation all comprise exercises of Dixon's authorized police power. 
The Dixon General Plan, in legal and conceptual terms, will guide the exercise of police power 
through  zoning  and  subdivision  regulation,  and  the  exercise  of  corporate  power  through  the 
provision of capital facilities and improvements. 
The adoption of the Dixon General Plan is a legislative act, and as such, the General Plan's 
provisions are subject to the initiative and referendum processes. 
A general plan is not a static document. Although the Dixon General Plan is intended to guide 
development within the Dixon Planning Area through the year 2010, it must be reviewed on a 
regular basis and revised to reflect new information as it becomes available or as the goals of the 
community change. The requirements of law, as well as the day‐to‐day decision‐making process, 
demand  that  the  information  and  projections  on  which  the  Dixon  General  Plan  is  based  be 
maintained in an up‐to‐date and currently valid form. 
The State of California requires that all general plans include seven mandatory elements: 
         The Land Use Element, which designates the distribution and intensity of public and 
          private land uses; 
         The  Circulation  Element,  which  identifies  the  location  and  extent  of  existing  and 
          proposed  major  transportation  routes,  terminals  and  other  local  public  utilities  and 
          facilities; 
         The  Housing  Element,  which  provides  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  current  and 
          projected  housing  needs  and  the  policies  and  actions  designed  to  provide  adequate 
          housing; 
 
                                                         
                                         City of Dixon General Plan 
                                                      I‐3 

                                                                      CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
                                                                                                 Introduction 
        The Conservation Element, which addresses the conservation, development and use of 
         natural resources; 
        The  Open  Space  Element,  which  provides  plans  and  measures  for  preserving  open 
         space  for  natural  resources,  outdoor  recreation,  agriculture  and  other  managed 
         production, public health and safety; 
        The Noise Element, which identifies and evaluates noise problems to provide the basis 
         for land use distribution; and 
        The Safety Element, which establishes policies and programs designed to protect the 
         community from the risks associated with seismic, geologic, flood and fire hazards. 
Local  general  plans  may  also  address  issues  beyond  those  which  are  addressed  in  the  seven 
mandatory  elements,  and  upon  adoption,  any  optional  elements  become  integral  parts  of 
the general plan. For example, the General Plan contains the components of an optional Historic 
Preservation  Element.  All  elements  have  equal  importance,  and  any  conflicts  between 
elements  in  terms  of  goals,  policies  or  standards  must  be  resolved  within  the  plan  itself.  Any 
programs defined for carrying out the plan must also be consistent with, and follow logically 
from, the plan's goals and policies. 
A general plan "shall consist of a statement of development policies and shall include a diagram 
or diagrams and text" (Government Code Section 65302).  The text and diagrams must also be 
consistent with each other, and data and projections must be uniform and consistent among and 
within elements. When a new element is adopted or a part of it is amended, the rest of the 
plan must be changed to eliminate any inconsistencies which may be created. 
 
B.   GENERAL   PLAN   MAP   AND   LAND   USE  
DESIGNATIONS 
The  General  Plan  map  (as  it  is  finally  adopted)  will  be  an  important  document,  since  it  will 
represent a clear and graphic expression of the development pattern desired within the Dixon 
Planning Area, consistent with the text of the General Plan. Land uses shown on the General 
Plan  map  (Figure  I)  are  expressed  in  terms  of  four  major  categories  (Residential,  Commercial, 
Industrial and Other), and the map indicates appropriate areas for each of them by type and 
intensity of use. 
The  Dixon  Planning  Area  exhibits  a  number  of  conditions  which  make  consideration  of  land  use, 
zoning and environmental factors very important in the preparation of the General Plan. These 
include: 
        A local economy in which agriculture continues to play an important role; 
 
                                                         
                                          City of Dixon General Plan 
                                                      I‐4 

CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
Introduction 
         Large areas of vacant land (most of which is currently in agricultural use) which may be 
          available for future residential, industrial and commercial development; and 
         Areas where shallow sheet flooding may occur. 
The  1987  Updated  General  Plan  designated  sufficient  land  area  for  residential  uses  to 
accommodate a total population of approximately 18,250 people. Between 1980 and 1990, the 
population of Dixon grew by approximately 38 percent, from 7,541 to 10,401. Future population 
growth  in  the  City  is  anticipated  to  exceed  the  rate  expected  in  most  other  portions  of 
California,  and  if  population  growth  continues  at  recent  rates,  the  population  of  Dixon  could 
place pressures on the land supply currently designated for residential uses in the 1987 Updated 
General Plan. 
A discussion of the characteristics of each of the General Plan land use categories is included in 
each  chapter  of  this  report,  under  the  section  describing  the  map  provisions.  The  land  use 
designations applied on the General Plan map below. 
The General Plan map indicates by means of an asterisk (*) those designations in the Northeast, 
Southwest and South Park Annexation Areas for which specific plan approval would be required. 
The  General  Plan  map  also  indicates  by  means  of  a  star  symbol  on  a  black  background  in 
locations limited to the west side of 1‐80 that "Only Highway Commercial use, with annexation 
to the City, is acceptable new development". 
It is important to bear in mind that the General Plan map cannot reflect the quality and 
character desired in a particular land use category in a specific location except in very general 
terms. The General Plan map indicates the predominant use of land recommended in each area, 
and does not preclude minor deviations from the overall pattern. For example, it does not 
reflect every church, institutional, commercial, single‐ or multi‐family residential use that may 
exist in areas designated for other uses, nor should it be interpreted as recommending or 
requiring their removal. Also, the boundaries of areas designated for a particular use should not 
be viewed as final or inflexible. There is no intention to single out one lot as opposed to another 
next to it for a specificuse.

C.   UPDATING   AND   AMENDING   THE   GENERAL  
PLAN 
The General Plan has been developed using a time horizon of approximately twenty years. It is 
based on analyses and assumptions concerning social, economic and physical conditions which 
may be subject to change over time. After it is adopted in its final form, the Dixon General Plan 
                                                      
                                       City of Dixon General Plan 
                                                   I‐7 

                                                                      CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
                                                                                                 Introduction 
should  be  reviewed  annually  and,  if  necessary,  updated  to  reflect  new  conditions  and 
information. 
Once the City of Dixon has adopted a general plan, it may also adopt "area plans" and "specific 
plans" to address local concerns in additional detail. 
An  area  plan  is  a  specialized  plan  that  addresses  a  particular  portion  of  the  Dixon  Planning 
Area. Such plans refine the policies of the Dixon General Plan as they apply to a smaller area, 
and are implemented  by local  ordinances  such as those regulating land use. Area plans are 
focused  planning  policy  documents  that  become  part  of  (and  must  be  internally  consistent 
with) the Dixon General Plan. 
Unlike  an  area  plan,  a  specific  plan  is  not  an  amendment  to  the  Dixon  General  Plan,  but  is 
designed  to  implement  the  goals  and  policies  of  the  General  Plan  for  a  specific 
geographical  area.  When  a  specific  plan  is  adopted,  it  represents  a  separate  document 
which  must  be  fully  consistent  with  the  goals  and  policies  stated  in  the  Dixon  General 
Plan.  A  specific  plan  is  a  hybrid  policy  statement  and/or  regulatory  tool  which  places  the 
emphasis  on  development  standards  and  criteria  which  supplement  those  stated  in  the 
Dixon  General  Plan.  The  text  and  diagrams  of  a  specific  plan  must  address  land  use 
(including  open  space),  infrastructure,  standards  for  development  and  natural  resource 
conservation, and implementation measures. 
 
D.   ORGANIZATION   OF   THIS   REPORT 
Although  the  seven  mandatory  general  plan  elements  and  the  one  optional  general  plan 
element are addressed in the General Plan, because they are closely related to one another, 
they are not addressed separately. Instead, the different aspects of the physical character of 
development  in  Dixon  are  discussed  under  six  general  topic  headings  (Chapter  II  ‐  Urban 
Development/  Community  Design,  Chapter  III  ‐  Natural  Environment,  Chapter  IV  ‐  Residential 
Environment, Chapter V ‐ Economic Development, Chapter VI ‐ Transportation and Circulation, 
and Chapter VII ‐ Public Services and Facilities) which cover all of the mandatory elements, 
with  the  exception  of  the  Housing  Element.  The  "Residential  Development"  chapter  will 
present  information  which  is  fully  consistent  with  the  City  of  Dixon's  Housing  Element, 
although  the  Housing  Element  will  be  prepared  separately  to  meet  the  specialized 
requirements  of  state  law.  Figure  2,  identifies  the  location  of  material  relating  to  each  of 
the seven elements within the text of the General Plan.

A goal is an ideal future end, condition or state related to the public health, safety or general 
welfare  toward  which  planning  and  planning  implementation  measures  are  directed.  Goals  set  a 
direction  for  Dixon  and  provide  an  expression  of  community  values,  but  goals  are  not  generally 
quantifiable, time‐dependent or suggestive of the future actions required for goal achievement.

A  policy  is  a  specific  statement  that  guides  decision‐making.  Policies  are  based  on  General  Plan 
goals  and  an  analysis  of  data  related  to  the  environmental,  social,  economic  and  political 
conditions  in  Dixon.  Policy  statements  indicate  a  clear  commitment  on  the  part  of  the  City 
Council  to  meet  the  goals  stated  in  the  General  Plan,  and  are  designed  to  be  clear  and 
unambiguous. 
Implementation  Recommendations  are  actions  which  may  be  taken  to  carry  out  policies 
established in the General Plan. 
Goals are indicated by an "I" within the text of the General Plan. Policies are indicated by a 
bold‐type  number  reference  in  the  left  margin,  and  implementation  recommendations  are 
indicated  by  a  bold‐type  letter  in  the  left  margin.  The  numbering  of  policies  and  the 
lettering  of  implementation  recommendations  is  consecutive  within  each  chapter,  but  not 
within the report as a whole. 
 
E.  MISSION   STATEMENT   AND   FUNDAMENTAL  
GOALS 
Mission Statement 
The  main  objective  of  the  Dixon  General  Plan  is  to  develop  a  balanced  community  that  will 
provide  residents  with  a  wide  range  of  housing,  employment,  recreational,  shopping  and  cultural 
opportunities.  This  will  involve  a  balancing  of  traditional  values  and  lifestyles  with 
contemporary,  fiscally  responsible  municipal  services,  while  simultaneously  progressing  into  the 
next century with stable, economic progress. To do this, it will be necessary to: 
       Retain a sense of community and quality of life by permanent residency in attractive, 
        well‐maintained neighborhoods. 
       Provide  a  healthy  economic  base  by  encouraging  clean  commercial  and  industrial 
        development compatible with a residential community. 
       Be  sensitive  to  the  environment  while  at  the  same  time  providing  the  necessary 
        infrastructure and public works to serve the City. 
       Operate City government in a fiscally responsible and prudent manner. 
       Provide  local  government  leadership  in  a  manner  that  is  responsive  to  residential, 
        institutional  and  corporate  constituents  and  that  allows  for  legitimate  differences  of 
        opinion  while  fostering  interaction  of  civic  leaders,  residents,  the  business  community 
        and City staff.

CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
Introduction 
        Provide effective, City services for the residents of Dixon. 
        Be responsive to the human service needs of area residents. 
Dixon  residents  value  effective  service,  the  worth  of  the  individual,  quality,  innovation,  integrity 
and a futuristic orientation in decision‐making. 
Fundamental Goals  
Goals  and  policies  are  presented  in  each  section  of  the  General  Plan.  However,  several 
fundamental goals will guide all future land use decisions in Dixon: 
        To maintain Dixon's "small town character". 
        To  control  growth  based  on  the  capability  of  local  service  networks  to  adequately 
         support it. 
        To provide adequate local services in the most cost‐effective manner. 
        To balance future residential growth with the creation of jobs in the Dixon area. 
        To protect existing agriculturally‐related operations from potential land use conflicts.

                              URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND 
                                                 COMMUNITY DESIGN
A.  S ETTING  
The Dixon Planning Area 
Dixon is located on the Interstate 80 corridor, 19 miles west of Sacramento and approximately 67 
miles northeast of San Francisco. Several sets of boundaries have been identified as having a 
direct relationship to future development patterns Dixon; 
        The Dixon Planning Area: (See  Figure 3).  This is the portion of eastern Solano County 
         that bears a close relationship to the City of Dixon. Within this area, the City will work 
         closely with Solano County and other jurisdictions on planning determinations. 
        The Dixon Sphere of Influence: (See  Figure 3).  This is the portion of eastern Solano 
         County  which  encompasses  all  incorporated  and  unincorporated  territory  which  is 
         within  Dixon's  ultimate  physical  boundaries  and  service  area,  as  adopted  by  the  Local 
         Area Formation Commission (LAFCO). Urban services and the City limits are expected to 
         ultimately expand to the Sphere of Influence (SOI) boundary. 
        The Dixon City Limits: (See  Figure 3).  This is the area within the legal jurisdiction of the 
         City  of  Dixon.  Although  the  City  of  Dixon  has  an  interest  in  the  character  and  timing  of 
         development  within  the  boundaries  identified  above,  it  has  legal  jurisdiction  only 
         over those areas within the city limits. 
Historical Background 
Indigenous  peoples  utilized  what  is  now  the  Dixon  area  for  many  years  before  the  first 
European  settlers  arrived.  In  1840,  the  Mexican  governor  of  the  territory  gave  four  Mexican 
leagues  in  an  area  then  known  as  the  Rancho  Los  Putos  (located  in  the  extreme  northern 
portion of what is now Solano County) to William Wolfskill. John Wolfskill was sent to the area 
to settle the land claim, and arrived on the Solano County side of Rio Los Putos with some cattle. 
By  the  1850s,  traffic  between  San  Francisco  and  Sacramento  through  what  is  now  the  Dixon 
area had increased as a result of the Gold Rush. Elijah  S.  Silvey first built a house and corral, 
and later a general store to serve travelers passing through the area. A blacksmith shop was 
built in what had come to be known as Silveyville, and in 1856 another store was built in the area. 
By 1865, there were approximately 150 people living in Silveyville. 
In the late 1860s, the town of Silveyville was moved to a new location around the railroad line 
approximately three miles away, on a ten‐acre site donated by Thomas A. Dickson. The town 
became known as Dixon, and began to grow, supported by farms in the vicinity. In  1883, the

Within  the  Dixon  city  limits  there  are  over  40  residential  structures  which  were  constructed 
prior  to  1900  (see  Appendix  B).  In  addition,  a  number  of  non‐residential  structures  in  Dixon 
meet National Register of Historic Places criteria, including the following:

Population Growth in Dixon 
The population of Dixon has increased significantly in recent years, as shown from U.S. Census 
Bureau estimates: 
                         Year                               Population 
                         1940                               1,108 
                         1950                               1,714 
                         1960                               2,970 
                         1970                               4,432 
                         1980                               7,541 
                         1990                               10,401 
                         2000                               16,020 
                         2010                               17,605 
 
B.  PROJECTIONS 
The land use pattern outlined in the General Plan is anticipated to accommodate additional 
population and employment growth within the Dixon Planning Area through at least  /, the  year 
2014. Although the magnitude of future population growth cannot be predicted with 
certainty, the General Plan has been developed on the assumption that the population of Dixon 
would continue to grow at a rate similar to that experienced since the passage of Measure "B" 
in 1986.

CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
Urban Development & Community Design 
Under  Measure  "B",  the  residential  growth  to  be  permitted  in  the  City  in  a  given  year  is 
limited  to  a  number  of  dwelling  units  equal  to  three  percent  or  less  of  the  total  number  of 
housing units existing in Dixon on December 31 of the previous year (see Appendix C). This 
rate  of  residential development could have resulted in a total of approximately 6,775 units in 
the  Dixon  area  by  2010,  or  an  estimated  population  of  approximately  20,325,  based  on  an 
average  of  three  persons  per  household  (see  Appendix  D).  This  level  of  population  growth 
would represent nearly a doubling in the number of people living in Dixon between 1990 and 
2010.  However, the recent economic downturn has resulted in residential growth stagnating 
between 2007 and 2010. 
C.  ISSUES 
The primary issue related to urban development and community design in Dixon is: 
       How to accommodate growth in a manner which will enable Dixon to maintain the small 
        town characteristics which appeal to a large number of residents? 
D.  GOALS 
The central goals expressed in this chapter are: 
                To maintain Dixon's "small town character". 
                To  protect,  preserve  and  enhance  the  significant  historic  features  of  the  Dixon 
                 area to the maximum extent feasible. 
                To  establish  historic  areas  for  the  restoration  of  those  structures  which  are  of 
                 historic, cultural and/or architectural significance. 
                To preserve individual structures of historic value. 
The policies contained in this chapter and the recommended actions for their implementation 
further  these  goals  by  addressing  the  location  of  new  development,  the  pattern  of 
development  which  is  most  desirable  for  Dixon,  and  the  overall  future  character  and 
appearance of the community.

Urban Growth and Development 
1.     The City shall maintain the "small town character" of Dixon to some extent. However, it 
       is recognized that Dixon is an attractive area to newcomers, and that a larger city could 
       result  in  increased  employment,  shopping,  cultural  and  recreational  opportunities 
       for Dixon residents by attracting firms and activities which require more market support 
       than  can  be  provided  by  the  current  population.  The  provisions  of  Measure  "B" 
       currently  define  the  upper  limits  of  permissible  growth,  and  while  these  have 
       general support, voters in the future may act to refine or modify some of their aspects. 
2.     The City shall actively pursue a balanced community comprising industrial, commercial 
       and residential development. 
3.    The  City  shall  ensure  that  urban  development  occurs  only  within  the  incorporated 
       portion of the Planning Area, and that land proposed for such development will be 
       annexed by the City before final development approval is given. In the unincorporated 
       sections of the Planning Area, beyond the edge of proposed future urbanization, the 
       existing  rural  character  and  agricultural  uses  shall  be  maintained  and  preserved  at 
       least until the year 2010. The County of Solano should prohibit urban development 
       within  the  Dixon  Planning  Area  outside  the  Dixon  city  limits,  unless  it  is  specifically 
       endorsed  by  the  City  of  Dixon  and  fully  consistent  with  the  provisions  of  Solano 
       County Proposition "A" and the Solano County General Plan. 
4.     The  City  shall  ensure  that  future  residential  growth  takes  place  in  or  adjacent  to 
       areas  where  development  has  already  taken  place,  and  that  future  commercial  and 
       industrial growth takes place at strategic locations. 
5.    The City shall phase development in an orderly, contiguous manner in order to maintain a 
       compact  development  pattern  and  to  avoid  premature  investment  for  the  extension 
       of public facilities and services. New urban development shall occur only in areas where 
       municipal  services  are  available  and  where  adequate  service  capacity  exists.  In 
       areas  where  proposed  development  would  require  major  new  facility  expansion  to 
       ensure the provision of municipal services, adequate service capacity should be in place 
       prior to the approval of the proposed development. 
6.     The City shall manage growth to the extent that the local service networks can support 
       it. 
7.     The City shall ensure that new development will pay all of the incremental public and

8.      The  City  shall  focus  future  growth  initially  in  areas  already  designated  as  appropriate 
        locations  for  such  growth,  in  the  interests  of  providing  services  in  the  most  cost‐
        effective manner. 
9.      The  City  shall  identify  agriculture  as  an  acceptable  interim  use  on  land  in  the 
        unincorporated  portions  of  the  Planning  Area  which  have  been  designated  for  ultimate 
        development in residential, commercial, industrial or institutional use. 
10.     The City shall encourage the maintenance of agricultural uses in all undeveloped areas 
        designated for future urban use, especially in the areas designated for future industrial 
        uses. 
11.     The  City  shall  restrict  land  uses  north  and  west  of  Interstate  80  to  agricultural  use, 
        except as otherwise provided in the General Plan. 
12.     The  City  shall  encourage  agriculture  and  the  preservation  of  open  space  between 
        Dixon and Vacaville, and between Dixon and Davis, to maintain community integrity and 
        urban form. 
Historic Preservation, Community Design and Appearance 
13.     The City shall promote the preservation of historic buildings and other landmarks that 
        give residents a tie with the past. 
14.     The City shall consider the preservation of the functional character of the Downtown 
        area, which serves as the focal point for community identity and enhances residents' 
        "sense of place" and feeling of historic continuity, whenever changes in land uses are 
        proposed in the Downtown area. 
15.     The City shall consider the establishment of procedures and criteria to coordinate and 
        encourage historic preservation efforts in Dixon. 
16.     The City shall encourage the use of federal, state and local funds for the restoration of 
        historic structures. 
17.     The  City  shall  support  federal,  state  and  local  legislation  which  provides  incentives  for 
        maintaining historic structures. 
18.     The  City  shall  ensure  that  entry  points  to  the  City  are  identified  by  well‐maintained 
        entrances indicating civic pride and concern for civic beauty. 
19.     The  City  shall  actively  promote  the  beautification  of  Dixon  by  acquiring  easement  or

        appropriate,  and  shall  encourage  the  removal  of  overhead  utility  lines  and  poles 
        throughout the city. 
21.     The City shall strictly regulate signs and billboards in order to minimize their impact on 
        the visual environment. 
22.     The  City  shall  ensure  that  all  new  development  which  may  be  built  adjacent  to 
        Interstate  80  will  either  present  an  attractive  appearance  or  not  be  visible  from  the 
        freeway  at  all.  To  the  greatest  extent  possible,  visual  separation  between  developed 
        areas  of  Dixon  and  the  freeway  corridor  will  be  maintained  by  vegetation, 
        landscaping, beans and devices other than standard acoustical walls. 
23.     The City shall consider the establishment of a system of open space buffers to help to 
        define the urban boundary of Dixon. 
24.     The  City  shall  promote  the  design  of  new  development  that  is  conducive  to  use  of 
        alternative  transportation  modes  and  that  will  be  pedestrian‐oriented,  i.e.;  walkways, 
        pathways, bike paths and open areas that foster interaction of people. 
         
E.  GENERAL   PLAN   MAP 
Areas  designated  for  potential  residential  development  on  the  General  Plan  map  are  generally 
contiguous  to  existing  residential  areas.  Future  residential  development  (particularly  at  sites 
appropriate for infill development) would take place in portions of the Planning Area which are 
either already served by the existing infrastructure or which can be served by extending the 
existing  infrastructure.  In  order  to  better  balance  anticipated  residential  development, 
additional  land  for  industrial  and  commercial  development  has  been  designated  on  the 
General Plan map. Areas to the east, southeast, south and southwest of the existing city limits 
would  accommodate  future  residential  development,  while  a  large  area  to  the  northeast  of 
the existing city limits (and a smaller area in the southwest near 1‐80) would accommodate future 
industrial and commercial development (see Figure 1).

 CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
 Urban Development & Community Design 
 F.  IMPLEMENTATION    
 Urban Growth and Development 
 A.     Revise  the  existing  Dixon  Zoning  Ordinance,  Subdivision  Ordinance  and  all  other 
        applicable ordinances to achieve consistency with the Dixon General Plan, as adopted. 
 B.     Map  all  planning  actions,  such  as  rezonings  and  variances,  on  a  large  display  map, 
        keyed to the year action was taken. Use this map to pinpoint areas which require special 
        studies and possible amendment on the General Plan map. 
 Historic Preservation, Community Design and Appearance 
 C.     Develop  an  historic  preservation  program  which  will  establish  general  criteria  for 
        historical  preservation  in  Dixon,  procedures  which  will  assist  neighborhood  groups  in 
        establishing historic areas, promoting historic preservation and coordinate and guide 
        historic preservation efforts in Dixon. 
D.      Continue  to  require  street  trees  to  be  planted  in  newly  developed  areas,  both  to 
        beautify Dixon and to enhance its rural character. 
 E.     Continue  to  require  design  review  of  all  new  development  prior  to  the  issuance  of  a 
        development  permit.  The  review  should  determine  whether  the  proposed 
        development/remodeling  would  be  in  keeping  with  community  character,  and 
        whether the proposed action satisfies the applicable development ordinances. 
F.      Strictly enforce Dixon's Sign Ordinance, and have non‐conforming signs either brought 
        into conformance with the ordinance or removed. 
 G.     Establish  guidelines  for  the  owners  of  property  located  within  areas 
        designated  Agricultural  on  the  General  Plan  map  which  would  assist  them  in  the 
        voluntary maintenance of Dixon's open space buffers.

A.  SETTING 
A GRICULTURE AND  S OILS  
The Dixon Planning Area is characterized by large tracts of agricultural land surrounding the City 
of  Dixon,  and  much  of  the  land  within  the  Planning  Area  is  currently  in  agricultural 
production. The Dixon area is underlain with soils of Quatenary‐age alluvium, consisting of an 
unstratified  mix  of  sand,  silt,  clay  and  gravel.  Most  land  surrounding  the  City  of  Dixon 
consists  of  Class  I  soils,  which  have  few  limitations  affecting  their  use.  Class  II  soils  comprise 
several small  areas  in  the  Dixon  Planning  Area,  and  have  some  limitations  that  reduce  the 
variety  of  crops  which  can  be  grown  or  that  require  moderate  soil  conservation  practices. 
Virtually all of the farmland surrounding Dixon consists of the following four soil types: 
                                 Soil	Type	                                        Capability	Unit	
                          Yolo	silty	clay	loam	                                         I‐1	(17)	
                                Yolo	loam	                                              I‐1	(17)	
                         Capay	silty	clay	loam	                                         I‐1	(17)	
            Brentwood	clay	loam,	1	to	2	percent	slope	                                 I1s‐3	(17)	
	
Soils with a capability unit of I‐1 (17) are suitable for irrigated row crops, forage crops, orchards 
and dry farmland small grains. Soils with a capability unit of IIs‐3 (17) are suitable for irrigated 
row  crops,  field  crops  and  some  orchards.  The  crops  most  often  grown  on  these  soils 
include:  sugar  beets,  tomatoes,  alfalfa,  almonds,  apricots,  prunes,  beans,  corn,  wheat  and 
barley. Crops raised in the Dixon area include sugar beets, tomatoes, alfalfa, corn and barley, as 
well as some orchard crops. 
Much of the agricultural land in the Dixon Planning Area has been classified by the California 
Department  of  Conservation  (Division  of  Land  Resource  Protection)  as  "Prime  Farmland"  (see 
Figure  4).  Areas  are  designated  as  "Prime  Farmland"  when  they  are  found  to  have  the  best 
combination of physical and chemical characteristics for crop production, and have the soil 
quality, growing season and moisture supply needed to produce sustained yields of crops when 
treated  and  managed.  Lands  identified  as  "Prime  Farmland"  must  have  been  used  for  the 
production of irrigated crops within the last three years.

Under  the  Land  Conservation  Act  ("Williamson  Act"),  farmers  are  able  to  enter  into  land 
conservation contracts with Solano County which enable them to enjoy reduced property taxes in 
exchange  for  maintaining  their  land  in  agricultural  production.  Once  entered  into  by  a  farmer,  a 
Williamson  Act  Contract  is  binding  for  a  period  of  ten  years.  Contracts  are  automatically 
renewed each year unless the farmer files a Notice of Non‐Renewal. After the filing of such a 
Notice,  the  land  may  not  be  converted  to  other  uses  for  ten  years,  during  which  time  the 
property  taxes  are  gradually  increased  to  reflect  the  full  market  value  of  the  land.  Ten  years 
after the filing of a Notice of Non‐Renewal, the land is free of land use restrictions and the 
farmer  is  denied  further  property  tax  benefits  associated  with  the  former  Williamson  Act 
contract.  Figure  5  shows  areas  currently  in  agricultural  preserve  status  under  Williamson  Act 
contracts.

California.  Fresh  groundwater  resources  within  the  Sacramento  Valley  occur  in  Post‐Eocene 
continental  sediments  deposited  in  the  last  38  million  years.  The  principal  water‐bearing 
formation in the Dixon area is the Tehama Formation, which is composed of coarse, clean sandy 
deposits.  The  Tehama  Formation  can  range  up  to  2,250  feet  thick.  Overlying  the  Tehama 
Formation are sediments of the Putah Plain. These sediments are approximately 165 feet thick, 
and also yield water. However, the yield, storage capacity and transmissivity of the Putah Plain 
sediments  are  decreased  by  the  presence  of  finer‐grained,  muddier  sediments  which  provide 
impermeable barriers to water movement. 
The groundwater quality in the area is very good, with natural filtration taking place as water 
percolates  through  the  porous  layers  of  the  soil.  Because  the  water  is  drawn  from  deep, 
protected aquifers, very little, if any, treatment is required to ensure a safe, palatable supply. 
Chlorine  is  added  to  the  domestic  water  supply  to  provide  residual  disinfection  in  system 
pipelines. 
Drainage  ponds  which  store  water  during  much  of  the  year  also  assist  in  recharging  the 
groundwater basin.  The following drainage ponds are maintained by the City of Dixon: 
          Pond A – located on Porter Road; 
          Pond B1 – located on Industrial Way; 
          Pond B2 – located on Doyle Lane; 
          Pond C – located on Yale Drive.

Flooding 
Dixon  is  located  on  an  alluvial  fan  formed  by  Putah  Creek,  located  north  of  the  city.  The  land 
within the Planning Area generally slopes downward from the northwest to southeast, and 
drainage generally follows the historic courses of Dickson  Creek and Dudley Creek, by way of 
canals,  roadside  ditches  and  sloughs,  to  the  Sacramento  River.  Ponding  occurs  in  some  low‐
lying portions of the Planning Area. 
Areas  which  would  be  flooded  as  a  result  of  a  100‐year  storm  (the  single  storm  with  the 
intensity that has a 1‐in‐100 (1%) chance of occurring every year) have been designated by the 
Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA).  The  major  flood  hazard  areas  within  the 
Dixon  Planning  Area  are  located  along  Dickson  Creek  and  Dudley  Creek  (see  Figure  6).    As 
shown in Figure 6, the majority of the proposed urbanized area of Dixon is outside of the flood 
zone and therefore not subject to flooding during a 100‐year event.2

   Recent changes in state law encourage planning to protect land uses from a 200‐year flood (a standard which 
requires more protection than the use of the 100‐year flood zone).  However, official mapping of the 200‐year 
flood zones in Dixon is not yet available.

CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
Natural Environment Element 
A  variety  of  public  agencies  are  responsible  for  addressing  flood  safety  issues  in  the  Planning 
Area.  These are (in alphabetical order): 
         California Department of Water Resources (DWR) 
         DWR  implements  the  California  Water  Code,  including  the  Cobey‐Alquist  Flood  Plain 
         Management  Act.  DWR  regulates  activities  in  California’s  floodways,  encourages 
         preventative flood control maintenance, and operates some flood‐control projects. 
         Central Valley Flood Protection Board 
         This board was the Reclamation Board. It was given a new name and charter by Senate 
         Bill 17 (2007), including an expanded membership and expertise‐based seats including 
         disciplines such as engineering, hydrogeology and flood management. 
         Dixon Resource Conservation District (DRCD) 
         DRCD was organized on September 2, 1952, and operates under Division 9 of the Public 
         Resources Code.  The DRCD was formed to construct, operate, and maintain the Dixon 
         Drain;  a  seventy‐mile  long  system  of  ditches  designed  to  provide  winter  drainage, 
         reduce duration of flooding, and diminish ponding of winter water on agricultural lands. 
         Dixon Regional Watershed Joint Powers Authority (JPA) 
         The JPA was formed in 2004 and is comprised of the City of Dixon, DRCD, Maine Prairie 
         Water  District,  and  Reclamation  District  2068.    The  purpose  of  the  JPA  is  to  improve 
         mechanisms  to  fund,  construct,  own  and  operate  new  or  upgraded  drainage  facilities 
         that provide drainage to two or more of the participating entities. 
         Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
         FEMA is an agency whose mission is to reduce the loss of life and property from natural 
         and  human‐made  disasters  through  a  comprehensive,  risk‐based  emergency 
         management system. One of their responsibilities is to maintain flood zone maps. 
         Solano County Water Agency (SCWA) 
         SCWA is a Special District originally formed in 1951 as the Solano County Flood Control 
         and  Water  Conservation  District  (SCFCWCD)  by  an  act  of  the  California  Legislature.  In 
         1989, that legislative act was amended, renaming the District the SCWA. In total, SCWA 
         serves approximately 538,782 acres and a population of approximately 421,657 people 
         (SCWA’s  UWMP  2005).  SCWA  has  authority  to  supply  untreated  water  and  to  provide 
         flood control.

                                                                               Natural Environment Element 
       Solano County Water Agency Flood Hazard Warning System 
       The Solano County Water Agency Flood Hazard Warning System was created in 2006 to 
       provide  up‐to‐date  information  to  the  community  and  public  agencies  on  potential 
       flooding in Solano County. 
       Solano Resource Conservation District (Solano RCD) 
       The Solano RCD was formed in 1956 under Division 9 of the California Public Resources 
       Code.  The  mission  of  the  District  is  to  protect,  promote  and  enhance  the  soil,  water, 
       wildlife, plant‐life and air quality resources within Solano County. Solano RCD provides 
       landowners  and  urban  dwellers  assistance  by  providing  direct  conservation  planning 
       services,  through  educational  outreach,  and  modeling  best  management  practices  at 
       demonstration sites throughout the county. 
       State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) 
       The  SWRCB  issues  a  number  of  Water  Quality  Orders  related  to  compliance  with  the 
       Clean  Water  Act  and  the  National  Pollution  Discharge  Elimination  System  (NPDES) 
       program.    These  Orders  govern  activities  such  as  construction  activity,  industrial 
       discharges, and post‐construction (design) criteria for development. 
Both these agencies and the City of Dixon are subject to the following flood‐related laws and 
regulations: 
       Assembly Bill 162 (2007) 
       This  bill,  in  contrast  to  the  regulations  provided  by  the  Cobey‐Alquist  Flood  Plain 
       Management  Act,  focuses  on  providing  flood  protection  for  California  communities 
       through  requirements  implemented  by  local  general  plans.  It  calls  for  flood‐related 
       provisions  in  the  state‐mandated  Land  Use,  Conservation,  and  Safety  elements  of  the 
       general plans.  
       Cobey‐Alquist Flood Plain Management Act 
       The Cobey‐Alquist Flood Plain Management Act (California Water Code Section 8400 et 
       seq.)  found  that  land  use  regulations  related  to  floodplain  management  are  best 
       developed  at  the  local  level.  Local  governments  are  asked  to  ensure  no  structures  or 
       other  obstructions  are  in  flood‐prone  areas  that  would  impede  the  motion  of  flood 
       waters. No specific provisions are in this act related to the General Plan. 
The City of Dixon is listed by the RWQCB as a NPDES Phase II program municipality.  In 2003, the 
City adopted a five‐year Storm Water Management Plan outlining how the City will comply with 
the NPDES program requirements.  Compliance with the Plan is monitored through an Annual

Dam Inundation 
Dixon is downstream from Monticello Dam, a water storage dam built in the 1950s.  This 304‐
foot‐tall  concrete  dam  holds  more  than  1.6  million  acre‐feet  of  water;  if  this  water  were 
suddenly  released  during  a  catastrophic  failure,  Dixon  and  a  number  of  other  communities 
downstream of the dam would be inundated.  A map of areas which would be flooded by the 
failure of Monticello Dam is shown in Figure 7.

Because  of  the  highly  unlikely  event  of  a  failure  of  Monticello  Dam,  the  arrangement  of  land 
uses in the Dixon Planning Area is not based on the potential for flooding from dam failure.

S EISMIC  H AZARDS  
Lands and structures in Dixon are potentially subject to groundshaking as a result of geologic 
activity.  Although there are no known active earthquake faults in the Planning Area, Dixon is 
subject  to  groundshaking  when  earthquakes  occur  on  faults  in  the  region  (see  Figure  8).  
Inactive  faults  are  present  in  the  surroundings,  and  while  such  faults  are  not  expected  to 
generate impacts to the Dixon area, information on these faults is provided herein. 
The Midland Fault zone, which is considered inactive, traverses the Planning Area between I‐80 
and the intersection of West A Street and Pitt School Road. Faults active within the last 10,000 
years include an unnamed fault approximately 11 miles north of Dixon and the Cordelia Fault, 
located  approximately  20  miles  southwest  of  the  city.  In  April,  1892,  earthquakes  caused 
considerable damage in the Dixon area, even though this seismic activity was thought to have 
originated  elsewhere.  No  evidence  of  more  recent  seismic  activity  has  been  found  along  the 
known  faults  in  the  Dixon  area.  The  seismicity  of  the  area  appears  to  be  minimal,  and  is  not 
likely  to  produce  groundshaking  of  over  0.5  g.  A  contrary  view,  held  by  a  USGS  seismologist 
(Eaton, 1986), suggests that the 1892 quake and its large aftershocks occurred along the Great 
Valley/Coast  Range  zone,  in  a  location  analogous  to  those  of  the  damaging  magnitude  6.7 
Coalinga  and  Kettleman  quakes.  Earthquakes  occurring  in  this  zone  would  produce  greater 
groundshaking and liquefaction effects in Dixon. 
Because the water table is fairly high in the Dixon area, liquefaction of soils may occur during an 
earthquake.  Structures  supported  by  alluvium  may  experience  some  movement  due  to 
foundation heaving and differential settlement if liquefaction occurs.

CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
Natural Environment Element 
Prior to human modification of the environment, most of the Planning Area was dominated by 
native  bunch  grasses  in  an  association  called  the  California  Prairie.  This  native  vegetation  has 
been almost completely eliminated by agriculture and other human activities. 
Potential habitats in the area are currently dominated by various types of crops. The greatest 
diversity of vegetation occurs around old farm homesteads and older portions of Dixon where 
mature specimens of many types of trees, shrubs and landscape plants have been established. 
Very little native vegetation exists in the Planning Area today. 
The remaining areas of wildlife habitat can be found in three types of locations: 
      Narrow,  linear  corridors  along  roadsides,  power  lines,  canals  and  the  railroad, 
         especially where these areas coincide. This category includes the corners of fields which 
         are not mowed, and windbreaks of trees along roadways. 
      Tall, old trees and mature shrubs around old farm houses. 
      Small  patches  of  wetlands,  seasonal  wetlands  and  linear  riparian  vegetation  on  the 
         banks  of  canals  and  in  ditches.  These  areas  may  include  cattails  (Typha  sp.),  tules 
         (Scirpus sp.), algae and seasonal wetland species which disappear in the dry season. 
Of  these  areas,  the  corridors  are  most  prevalent,  while  wetland  areas  are,  overall,  the  most 
valuable to wildlife. Although most vegetation around homesites is not native, it does provide 
cover and food for those species able to tolerate daily human disturbance. 
Riparian  habitat  areas  are  commonly  found  within  the  100‐year  floodplain.  California 
Department of Fish and Game policy is to permit no net loss of riparian habitat, which means 
that  those  who  propose  to  develop  or  otherwise  damage  a  riparian  habitat  must,  at  a

Service and/or the California Department of Fish and Game, may be particularly vulnerable  to 
habitat modification. The following special‐status species potentially occur in the Dixon area: 
    Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsoni) is classified by the State as threatened, which means 
        that  although  not  presently  threatened  with  extinction,  it  is  likely  to  become  an 
        endangered species in the foreseeable future in the absence of special protection and 
        management efforts. Swainson's hawk is a listed as a Category 3 species by the federal 
        government,  which  means  that  it  is  now  a  non‐candidate  species,  but  had  previously 
        been considered a candidate species, and had been included on past lists of endangered 
        or threatened species. 
    Burrowing  owl  (Athene  cunicularia)  is  identified  by  the  State  as  a  species  of  special 
        concern,  which  means  that  the  increased  threats  to  this  species  have  prompted  the

B.  P ROJECTIONS  
A GRICULTURE AND  S OILS  
As  development  pressures  in  the  Dixon  area  increase,  the  demand  for  land  suitable  for 
development  is  expected  to  result  in  the  conversion  of  land  which  is  currently  in  agricultural 
production,  and  some  development  may  take  place  on  soils  which  have  been  identified  as 
among the most productive in the country. As construction takes place in developing areas, soil 
erosion and loss may occur as a result of wind action in excavated areas. 
O PEN  S PACE  
A growing population is expected to place an increased demand on local resources, and as land 
which  is  now  considered  open  space  is  converted  to  other  uses,  the  amount  of  open  space 
remaining within the Planning Area will be reduced. 
H YDROLOGY AND  F LOODING  
Increased  development  within  the  Dixon  Planning  Area  would  be  expected  to  increase  the 
amount  of  impervious  surface  in  areas  which  are  currently  not  paved  or  built‐over,  with  a 
corresponding  increase  in  the  amount  of  stormwater  runoff  following  each  storm.  Increased 
runoff could be expected to contribute to additional flooding problems in those portions of the 
Planning Area already susceptible to flooding.  In 1999, the City adopted the Dixon Storm Drain 
Report which evaluates the drainage system in each drainage basin.  The South Almond Street 
Area Drainage Study (2003) and Core Area Drainage Study (2004) further evaluate the drainage 
system serving these basins. 
S EISMIC  H AZARDS  
Although no active faults have been identified in the Planning Area, future development would 
increase the number of people who would potentially be exposed to injury or suffer property 
damage as a result of seismic activity originating in areas nearby.

Acknowledging that Class I and II agricultural lands are a finite resource, it is one of the City's 
goals  to  protect  the  remaining  prime  agricultural  soils  within  the  Planning  Area  from  premature 
urbanization. 
The  City  also  recognizes  that  development  in  natural  hazard  areas  can  incur  both  social 
costs (such as the loss of life and property damage) and public costs (such as emergency flood 
relief  and  utility  line  repair).  The  City  will,  therefore,  strive  to  prevent  loss  of  life,  to  reduce 
personal  injuries  and  property  damage,  and  to  minimize  economic  and  social  disruption 
resulting  from  earthquakes,  geologic  hazards,  fires,  floods  and  other  hazards  through 
responsive land use planning.

    1.  The  City  shall  preserve  agricultural  lands  and  prevent  their  premature  conversion  to 
         urban uses. 
    2.  The City shall protect existing agriculturally‐related operations from potential land use 
         conflicts. 
O PEN  S PACE  
    3.  The  City  shall,  to  the  greatest  extent  possible,  preserve  natural  resource  and  wildlife 
         habitat areas, reduce risk in hazardous areas and provide recreational opportunities by 
         reserving the following areas for open space uses: 
     Natural  Resources  ‐  The  productive  Class  I  and  II  soils  which  surround  Dixon.  As  the 
         currently  urbanized  area  of  Dixon  is  completely  surrounded  by  these  soils,  it  will  be 
         necessary to accept the conversion of some Class I and II soils to urban uses to enable 
         future development. Other factors, such as the viability and configuration of individual 
         fanning units, the extent of conflict with existing urban development, and constraints on 
         spraying will be considered in selecting the direction of urban expansion. 
     Hazardous Areas ‐ Fault zones and floodways. 
     Recreational  Land  ‐  Community,  neighborhood  and  linear  parks,  or  trail  connections 
         between community facilities. 
    4.  The  City  shall  ensure  that  open  land,  structures  having  non‐sensitive  uses  and  other 
         means will be used to buffer residential areas from I‐80, wherever possible. North of the

         Solano  and  other  affected  agencies,  define  and  maintain  open  space  buffers  between 
         these  three  urban  areas.  The  southern  open  space  buffer  area  shall  be  located  in  the 
         area bounded generally by I‐80, Batavia Road and Midway Road, and the northern open 
         space buffer area shall be located in the area bounded generally by I‐80, Tremont Road 
         and Old Davis Road. 
     6.  The City shall support and participate in the establishment of open space buffer areas to

     7.  The  City  will  endeavor  to  protect  groundwater  quality  from  pollution  by  point  (single 
         location) and non‐point sources (many diffuse locations).   
     8.  The  City  shall  seek  to  minimize  toxic  runoff  from  such  sources  as  homes,  commercial 
         and industrial sites, and roadways.  Examples of potential programs include: 
      The  use  of  “bioswales”  and  similar  features  (such  as  infiltration  trenches,  filter  strips, 
         and vegetated buffers) to trap contaminants; 
      Installation of grease/oil separators to keep these contaminants out of storm runoff; 
      Regular  street  sweeping  programs  to  prevent  the  buildup  of  oil,  grease,  and  other 
         contaminants and keep them from being swept into creeks and rivers; 
      Minimizing pesticide use and promoting the use of natural pest controls; 
     Flooding3 
     9.  The City shall strive to reduce the risks to life and property arising from flooding to an 
         acceptable level, consistent with the City's Master Drainage Plan. 
     10. The  City  shall  ensure  that  floodways  will  be  left  open  for  agriculture  and  recreational 
         use in areas of particular risk, and where the need for protection is minimal.

Considerations	in	determination	of	noise—compatible	land	use	
A.	      Normalized	Noise	Exposure	Information	Desired	
Where	sufficient	data	exists,	evaluate	land	use	suitability	with	respect	to	a	"normalized"	value	of	CNEL	or	Ldn.	
Normalized	values	are	obtained	by	adding	or	subtracting	the	constants	described	in	Table	I	to	the	measured	or	
calculated	value	of	CNEL	or	Ldn.	
B.	      Noise	Source	Characteristics	
The	 land	 use‐noise	 compatibility	 recommendations	 should	 be	 viewed	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 specific	 source	 of	 the	
noise.	For	example,	aircraft	and	railroad	noise	is	normally	made	up	of	higher	single	noise	events	than	auto	traffic	
but	 occurs	 less	 frequently.	 Therefore,	 different	 sources	 yielding	 the	 same	 composite	 noise	 exposure	 do	 not	
necessarily	create	the	same	noise	environment.	The	State	Aeronautics	Act	uses	65	dB	CNEL	as	the	criterion	which	
airports	 must	 eventually	 meet	 to	 protect	 existing	 residential	 communities	 from	 unacceptable	 exposure	 to	
aircraft	noise.	In	order	to	facilitate	the	purposes	of	the	Act,	one	of	which	is	to	encourage	land	uses	compatible	
                                                               
                                              City of Dixon General Plan 
                                                            NE‐27 

CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
Natural Environment Element 
with	the	65	dB	CNEL	criterion	wherever	possible,	and	in	order	to	facilitate	the	ability	of	airports	to	comply	with	
the	Act,	residential	uses	located	in	Community	Noise	Exposure	Areas	greater	than	65	dB	should	be	discouraged	
and	considered	located	within	normally	unacceptable	areas.	
C.	          Suitable	Interior	Environments	
One	objective	of	locating	residential	units	relative	to	a	known	noise	source	is	to	maintain	a	suitable	interior	noise	
environment	at	no	greater	than	45	dB	CNEL	of	Ldn.	This	requirement,	coupled	with	the	measured	or	calculated	
noise	reduction	performance	of	the	type	of	structure	under	consideration,	should	govern	the	minimum	accept•	
able	distance	to	a	noise	source.	
D.	          Acceptable	Outdoor	Environments	
Another	 consideration,	 which	 in	 some	 communities	 is	 an	 overriding	 factor,	 is	 the	 desire	 for	 an	 acceptable	
outdoor	noise	environment.	When	this	is	the	case,	more	restrictive	standards	for	land	use	compatibility,	typically	
below	the	maximum	considered	“normally	acceptable"	for	that	land	use	category,	may	be	appropriate.

      24. The  City  shall  encourage  recycling,  reclamation  and  conservation  programs  (including 
             water conservation), along with other programs aimed at conserving natural resources. 
      25. The  City  shall  use  zoning  and  other  land  use  regulations  to  control,  and  in  some 
             instances  prohibit,  development  in  hazardous  areas.  The  extent  of  development 
             limitation will be commensurate both with the degree of hazard involved and with the 
             public  costs  which  would  be  incurred  if  emergency  or  remedial  public  actions  became 
             necessary.

The  General  Plan  Map  applies  two  designations  intended  to  conserve  and  protect 
environmental  values.  The  Agricultural  (A)  designation  is  applied  to  all  land  within  the  Dixon 
Planning Area which has not been designated for urban development. The edge of residential 
and  other  urban  uses  was  defined  so  as  to  minimize  the  length  of  the  perimeter,  extent  of 
indentation,  and  conflict  with  property  lines  and  established  cultivation  patterns.  A  total  of 
approximately  2,100  acres  of  land  currently  in  agricultural  use  is  designated  for  future  urban 
uses  on  the  General  Plan  Map  (including  approximately  600  acres  of  land  designated  "Future 
Residential", where development is not anticipated until after the end planning period).   As of 
2006, there were no active Williamson Act contracts in the city, and 103 active Williamson Act 
contracts in the Planning Area. 
The  Functional  Open  Space  (F)  designation  extends  along  I‐80,  providing  separation  from  the 
traffic noise generated by the freeway. Areas for use as temporary retention/detention ponds 
would  also  fall  in  this  category  (although  specific  locations  are  not  identified  on  the  General 
Plan Map).

 A. Encourage agriculture as an interim use in all industrial and rural residential zones. 
 B. Permit  agricultural  uses  and  structures  in  the  open‐space  flood  zone  only  if  adequate 
    flood‐proofing measures are taken, and only if it is determined that the measures will 
    not cause additional flooding and/or drainage problems in other areas. 
 C. Adopt regulations governing the uses of land in areas with significant natural hazards. 
 D. Implement  a  hazard  reduction  program  in  which  structures  are  inspected  for 
    conformance  with  the  California  Building  Code.  Give  first  priority  to  emergency  and 
    critical facilities, older non‐residential structures and public facilities. 
 E. Comply with the Countywide Habitat Conservation Plan. 
 F. Adopt  stringent  buffering  standards  to  protect  new  residential  development  from 
    freeway, highway, railroad and industrial noise. 
 G. Update  and  re‐evaluate  the  City's  noise  data  on  a  periodic  basis  to  determine  if 
    additional protection is required. 
 H. The City shall establish performance standards to limit water pollution and require that 
    all new development include measures to reduce potential water pollution. 
 I. Update the City’s Storm Water Quality Management Plan as needed to comply with the 
    NPDES General Permit for the Discharge of Storm Water from Small Municipal Separate 
    Storm Sewer Systems, Order No. 2003‐0005‐DWQ, or as amended. 
 J. As  soon  as  possible  after  the  publication  of  official  U.S.  flood  maps  for  Dixon  showing 
    the 200‐year flood area, update this General Plan to include mapping and, if necessary, 
    additional policies and implementation items to comply with state law. 
 K. Update  the  City’s  Subdivision  Ordinance  and  Zoning  Ordinance,  as  needed,  to  ensure 
    consistency in floodplain development regulations with the General Plan.

C.  ISSUES 
The primary issues associated with economic development in Dixon are: 
        How to accommodate industrial development compatible with existing development 
         which  will  provide  expanded  employment  opportunities  for  those  living  in  the  Dixon 
         Planning Area? 
        How  to  accommodate  commercial  development  compatible  with  existing  development 
         which  will  meet  the  needs  of  those  living  in  the  Dixon  Planning  Area  and  surrounding 
         areas?

     such purposes. 
10.  The City shall ensure that general industrial activities are concentrated only in the areas 
     where  they  are  currently  located  or  designated,  in  order  to  avoid  unsightly  or 
     incompatible scattered development. 
11.  The City shall require that defunct activities or abandoned structures, including signs on

25.     The  City  shall  encourage  the  development  of  appropriate  commercial  businesses  and 
        special events which can provide support to the distinctive atmosphere of the Downtown 
        area. 
26.   The City shall continue efforts to relocate Highway 113 to Pedrick Road (or an alternate 
        alignment),  and/or  to  designate  an  alternative  bypass  route  for  through  truck 
        movements,  in  order  to  provide  further  protection  to  and  preservation  of  the  valued 
        functions and character of the Downtown area. 
       
F.  GENERAL   PLAN   MAP 
Industrial 
The industrial land use designations are divided into three categories: 
     Planned  Business/Industrial  (PI)  ‐  Includes  those  uses  which  demonstrate  by  the 
        quality of their development and the nature of their operations that they can locate in 
        proximity  to residential and commercial uses with a minimum of environmental conflict. 
                                                      
                                       City of Dixon General Plan 
                                                  ED‐ 5 

                                                                    CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
                                                                             Economic Development Element 
      Strict landscaping, buffering and design standards would be adhered to by businesses 
      and industries located in these areas. The building intensity standard for the Planned 
      Business/Industrial designation is based upon the maximum site area coverage of 40 
      percent defined in the City's Zoning Ordinance for the ML District (Section 12.13.07) 
      and  a  maximum  building  height  of  40  feet  (Section  12.13.09).  A  minimum 
      requirement  of  750  feet  of  net  site  area  per  employee  at  peak  levels  is  proposed  to 
      further define this standard, together with a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 1.6. 
     General  Industrial  (GI)  ‐  Establishments  located  in  these  areas characteristically  require 
      large  parcels  of  land  with  good  truck  and/or  rail  access.  Due  to  the  nature  of  their 
      operation, uses in this category are typically poor neighbors in residential areas. Building 
      intensity  standard  indicators  for  the  General  Industrial  designation  are  as  follows, 
      based upon sections 12.14.07 and 12.14.09 of the City's Zoning Ordinance: maximum site 
      area coverage of 40 percent; and a maximum height of 40 feet (within 200 feet of 
      any  residential  or  agricultural  district,  or  75  feet  within  500  feet  of  either  of  these 
      districts).  A  minimum  requirement  of  1,000  square  feet  of  net  site  area  per  peak  period 
      employee is proposed to further define this standard, together with an FAR of 1.6. 
     Employment Center (E) ‐ This designation is applicable only in those areas for which 
      a Specific Plan is to be prepared for future adoption by the City, and represents an 
      'umbrella' designation  pending the submission of more detailed patterns  of specific 
      land  uses.  Includes  only  non‐residential  uses  consistent  with  the  types  included 
      under  the  Planned  Business/Industrial  (PI),  the  Professional/Administrative  Office 
      (0),  and  the  Highway  Commercial  (HC)  designations  defined  above  and  below.  The 
      requirements defined in the City's Zoning Ordinance under Sections 12.13 (ML ‐ Light 
      Industrial  District),  12.07  (PAO  ‐  Professional  &  Administrative  District),  and 
      12.10  (CH  ‐  Highway  Commercial  District)  shall  provide  the  general  framework  for 
      compliance.  The  standards  of  building  intensity,  height,  and  coverage,  and  of 
      employee density for Employment Center uses shall fall within the ranges defined for 
      these component designations and shall not exceed them. 
Commercial 
The commercial land use designations are divided into the following categories: 
     Professional/Administrative  Offices  (0)  ‐  Land  uses  which  provide  professional 
      services  to  the  surrounding  residential  areas.  Typically,  they  are  open  only  on 
      weekdays  from  8:00  AM  to  6:00  PM.  A  maximum  site  area  coverage  of  40  percent, 
      and a maximum building height of 30 feet are defined in the City's Zoning Ordinance 
      for this type of use. A minimum requirement of 750 square feet of net site area per 
      peak period employee is proposed for this designation, together with a Floor Area Ratio 
      (FAR) of 1.2. 
                                        City of Dixon General Plan 
                                                   ED‐6 
 

CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
Economic Development Element 
      Downtown (D) ‐ Establishments centered around the intersection of First and "A" Streets. 
       The physical appearance of this area as well as the mixture of retail establishments 
       (such  as  specialty  stores,  professional  offices,  civic  facilities,  theater,  restaurants, 
       financial  institutions,  and  other  similar  uses)  contribute  to  the  uniqueness  of  this 
       category.  The  City's  Zoning  Ordinance  specifies  a  maximum  height  of  50  feet  for 
       buildings in the Central Commercial District (Section 12.09.07), and a minimum of 200 
       square  feet  of  net  site  area  per  peak  period  employee  is  proposed  for  this 
       designation, together with a FAR of 3.0. 
      Neighborhood  Commercial  (NC)  ‐  Typically,  establishments  in  this  category 
       require  larger  sites  and  more  floor  area  than  establishment  in  the  Downtown.  For 
       example,  a  drugstore,  variety  store  or  supermarket,  together  with  a  range  of  smaller 
       stores  or  service  establishments,  would  be  typical  of  uses  in  this  category.  Each  of 
       these generate a considerable amount of traffic and serve a large volume of customers. 
       They  require  large  parcels  with  large  parking  lots.  The  City's  Zoning  Ordinance 
       specifies  a  maximum  height  of  20  feet  for  buildings  in  Neighborhood  Commercial 
       Districts  (Section  12.08.09).  A  minimum  requirement  of  750  square  feet  of  net  site 
       area per peak period employee is proposed, with an FAR of 0.8. 
      Community  Commercial  (CC)‐  This  designation  is  applicable  only  to  parcels 
       exceeding 15 acres. Centers of this size typically serve a larger population and trade 
       area than a Neighborhood Commercial center, and accommodate stores requiring a 
       larger  site  area  than  are  usually  located  in  such  centers.  Community  Commercial 
       centers  will  usually  also include a supermarket, super‐drugstore, and similar stores 
       in addition to a limited number of smaller stores and service establishments. The area 
       indicated for Community Commercial center uses is located on the south side of West 
       'A' Street, west of Evans Road. The City's Zoning Ordinance does not currently contain 
       provisions  for  a  District  specifically  governing  centers  of  this  type,  although  the 
       requirements defined in Section 12.08.09 (Neighborhood Commercial Districts) will be 
       applicable until any new Section is prepared and adopted. The same minimum net site 
       area  per  peak  period  employee  and  the  same maximum  F.A.R.  of  0.8  as  indicated  for 
       Neighborhood Commercial uses is proposed. 
      Highway Commercial (HC) ‐ These uses cater primarily to the traffic passing Dixon on I‐
       80. Examples of establishments which provide services to tourists and travelers include 
       motels, fast food and other restaurants, and gas stations. The areas indicated for Highway 
       Commercial uses lie in proximity to (and primarily on the east side of) 1‐80 and its access 
       ramps where they are easily accessible by car and highly visible from the roadway. The 
       City's  Zoning  Ordinance  specifies  a  maximum  height  of  40  feet  for  buildings  in  Highway 
       Commercial Districts (Section 12.10.08). A minimum requirement of 750 square feet of 
       net site area per peak period employee is proposed, with an FAR of 0.8. 
      Commercial  Services  (SC)  ‐  This  category  provides  space  for  a  variety  of  activities 
                                                       
                                        City of Dixon General Plan 
                                                   ED‐ 7 

                                                                     CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
                                                                                 Economic Development Element 
         ranging from small scale commercial service establishments to larger operations of a 
         semi‐industrial  character.  These  areas  are  not  ideal  neighbors  for  residential  uses. 
         Examples  of  typical  uses  include  automobile  repair,  glass  shops,  plumbing  shops, 
         cleaning  and  dyeing,  and  similar  establishments.  The  City's  Zoning  Ordinance  specifies  a 
         maximum  height  of  40  feet  for  buildings  in  Commercial  Services  Districts  (Section 
         12.11.08). A minimum requirement of 750 square feet of net site area per peak period 
         employee is proposed, with an FAR of 0.8. 
Commercial land uses are distinguished by scale and character, rather than by use. For example, 
many  retail  stores  are  appropriate  in  each  of  the  Commercial  sub‐categories,  but  this  should 
not be interpreted as recommending identical uses in each sub‐category. Uses within each 
subcategory should be similar in terms of character and scale. For example, a bakery or small 
specialty  store  is  appropriate  in  Downtown,  while  stores  requiring  larger  floor  area  and 
generating a larger sales volume are appropriate uses in a Neighborhood Commercial area. 
Similarly, restaurants are appropriate uses in the Downtown area, while motels and tourist‐
oriented fast‐service restaurants are only appropriate in Highway Commercial areas. 
One  additional  type  of  use  indicated  on  the  General  Plan  Map  is  the  Core  Area  Mixed  Use  (MU) 
designation. The purpose of this designation (which is directly related to the PMU [Planned 
Mixed Use] district contained in the City's Zoning Ordinance in Chapter 12.12) is to encourage 
the adaptive reuse of older residential structures adjacent to the Downtown area as offices and 
retail uses, and to recognize and protect the unique character of the older architectural styles 
at  the  Downtown  fringe.  The  objective  is  to  preserve  and  enhance  a  harmonious  mingling  of 
office  and  retail  uses  with  adjoining  residential  uses.  No  maximum  site  area  coverage 
requirement  is  currently  stated  for  this  area  and  type  of  mixed  use  in  the  City's  Zoning 
Ordinance, although a height limit of three stories or 36 feet is defined (see Section 12.12.08). A 
minimum  requirement  of  750  square  feet  of  net  site  area  per  peak  period  employee  or 
occupant is proposed, with an FAR of 2.0. 
 
G.  IMPLEMENTATION 
Industrial 
A.       Amend  the  Dixon  Zoning  Ordinance  and  map  and  Subdivision  Ordinance  to  achieve 
         consistency with the Dixon General Plan map and industrial land use classifications. 
B.       Strictly enforce the City's standards for the design, landscaping and decorative screening 
         of  unsightly  open  storage  areas  or  processing  operations.  Periodically  review  these 
         standards to determine whether they are adequate or in need of amendment. Develop and 
         enforce similar standards for other visually disruptive uses in the Planning Area. 
C.       Encourage and promote continued agricultural use and production in vacant areas

CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
Economic Development Element 
       designated for industrial use. 
D.     Require  the  inclusion  of  economic  considerations  as  part  of  the  environmental 
       assessment for any proposed industrial development in the Dixon Planning Area. 
Commercial 
E.     Amend  the  Dixon  Zoning  Ordinance  and  map  and  Subdivision  Ordinance  to  achieve 
       consistency with the Dixon General Plan map and commercial land use classifications. 
F.     Review  all  proposals  for  commercial  development  to  ensure  that  the  proposed 
       development  can  be  adequately  served  by  the  existing  infrastructure,  or  provide  the 
       opportunity for builder mitigation. 
G.     Require the inclusion of economic considerations within the environmental assessment 
       developed  for  any  proposal  to  construct  a  new  neighborhood  shopping  center  or  any 
       commercial development in the Dixon Planning Area. 
H.     Focus the economic impact report on the short‐ and long‐range effects of the proposed 
       project on existing commercial development, and particularly on the economic health and 
       viability  of  the  Downtown  area.  Include  in  the  report  an  analysis  of  the  effects  of  the 
       proposed new development on the fiscal condition of the City. 
Downtown Area 
I.     Encourage  downtown  property  owners  and  business  owners  to  prepare  and  adopt  a 
       Downtown  Design  Concept  Plan  as  a  basis  for  defining  criteria  and  standards  of

A.  SETTING 
Regional Access               
Dixon is located on the Interstate 80 corridor connecting San Francisco and Sacramento. The 
Dixon Planning Area is served by the following five 1‐80 interchanges: 
        Pedrick Road; 
        State Route 113 (First Street); 
        Pitt School Road; 
        West A Street/Dixon Avenue; and 
        Midway Road. 
Secondary  regional  access  to  Dixon  is  provided  by  State  Route  113,  which  extends  in  a  north‐
south  orientation  between  State  Route  12  in  Solano  County  to  State  Highway  99  in  Sutter 
County. Through Dixon, State Route 113 is two lanes wide between Cherry Street and H Street, 
with  a  center  two‐way  left  turn  lane  provided  between  the  Union  Pacific  Railroad  tracks  and 
Industrial Way. North of H Street State Route 113 widens to four lanes.  State Route 113 (First 
Street) is designated as a Principal Arterial. 
Local Circulation 
The local street system in the Dixon Planning Area is primarily developed on a north‐south/east‐
west grid system. Dixon Avenue/West A Street, H Street and Stratford Avenue provide principal 
east‐west circulation in Dixon. Pitt School Road, Lincoln Street, Almond Street, Adams Street and 
First  Street  provide  principal  north‐south  circulation.  Existing  24‐hour  traffic  volumes  on  key 
Dixon roadways are shown in Appendix E. 
Arterial  roadways  serve  intracity  circulation  requirements,  and  are  designed  to  carry  relatively 
large  volumes  of  traffic  (up  to  20,000  ADT),  to  receive  from,  and  distribute  to,  the  collector 
streets traffic with origins and destinations in different sections of the city, or to conduct traffic 
between the city and the freeway (I‐80) or highway (State Route 113) network. Collector streets 
carry  less  traffic,  and  provide  convenient  and  appropriately  designed  linkages  between  local 
streets and the arterials. North Adams Street, "A" Street and Pitt School Road are classified as 
minor arterials. The following roadways are classified as collectors: 
        Stratford Avenue                                                  Industrial Way

Railroad tracks generally parallel I‐80 in a northeast‐southwest configuration and traverse the 
city  near  the  downtown  area.  The  only  street  crossings  of  the  railroad  tracks  are  located  on 
North First Street and West A Street. Because of the limited number of crossings, access between 
the eastern and western portions of the city can be limited when trains pass through. 
Rail Service 
The  Union  Pacific  Railroad  provides  freight  service  to  Dixon.  Rail  passenger  service  is  not 
provided to Dixon, although through passenger trains utilize the rail line through the city. 
Transit Service 
Dixon  is  not  currently  served  by  regularly  scheduled  public  transit  service.  The  City  of  Dixon 
operates a general public dial‐a‐ride system (Readi‐Ride). The service operates within the city 
limits  and,  to  a  limited  extent,  to  immediately  adjacent  unincorporated  areas.  Ridership  consists 
primarily  of  school‐age  children,  handicapped  residents  and  seniors.  About  100  trips  per  day  are 
typically provided. Route 30, operated by the Solano Transportation Authority, which provides 
intercity service to Vacaville, Davis, Sacramento and Fairfield,  stops in Dixon at the Market Lane 
Park‐and‐Ride  Lot  The  Lot  has  89  parking  spaces  and  bicycle  racks.    The  Downtown 
Transportation Center, located on North Jefferson Street, includes 86 parking spaces and bicycle 
racks with room for expansion to approximately 200 parking spaces. 
 
Bikeways 
The City of Dixon has an approved Bikeways Plan which will be used to plan future extensions of 
the existing system and provide coordination with a regional bikeways plan.   An intercity bike

  B.  PROJECTIONS 
As those portions of the Planning Area which have been designated for future development are 
built‐out, additional streets and roadway improvements which would be required to adequately 
serve those developments would be added to the local transportation network.  
C.  ISSUES 
The primary issues related to transportation and circulation in Dixon are: 
       How to accommodate growth while maintaining or improving existing levels of service 
        along the local circulation network. 
       How to improve and expand the existing road network to serve existing and future land 
        uses safely and efficiently. 
         
D.  GOALS 
The primary transportation and circulation goals are: 
       To maintain or improve existing levels of service along the local circulation network.

                                                                    CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
                                                              Transportation and Circulation Element
     To provide a safe and efficient circulation system that provides access to residential, 
      commercial, industrial and recreational area by all modes of travel. 
       
E.  POLICIES 
1.    The City shall ensure that Dixon's existing and proposed street configuration and 
      highway  network  maintains  traffic  operations  at  Level  of  Service  "C"  or  better,  while 
      acknowledging  that  this  objective  may  be  difficult  to  achieve  in  those  locations  where 
      traffic  currently  operates  at  Levels  of  Service  below  "C"  for  limited  periods  of  time. 
      Achieving this policy will require a variety of traffic improvements, including: 
     Improving existing arterials; 
     Construction of arterials and collector streets in newly developing areas; and 
     Intersection improvements. 
2.    The  City  shall  provide  additional  transportation  alternatives  to  the  private  automobile 
      (an improved transit system, park‐and‐ride lots, bicycle facilities, etc.) 
3.   The  City  shall  encourage  the  continued  development  and  expansion  of  local  public 
      bus/van  transit  systems,  if  it  can  be  demonstrated  that  the  service  can  be  financially 
      supported. New development should be designed to maximize access and use of public 
      transit, where feasible. 
4.   The  City  shall  support  cycling  as  a  transportation  mode  which  promotes  personal  health, 
      recreation and enjoyment while minimizing energy consumption and air pollution. The 
      City  shall  improve  and  expand  existing  bikeway  facilities  in  accordance  with  the 
      Bikeways  Master  Plan,  and  shall  provide  connections  to  newly  developed  areas,  where 
      feasible. 
 
 
5.   The City shall support walking as a transportation mode which promotes personal health 
      and recreational enjoyment while minimizing energy consumption and air pollution. The 
      City  shall  improve  and  expand  existing  pedestrian  facilities  and  provide  connections  to 
      newly developed areas, where feasible. 
6.    The  City  shall  pursue  the  relocation  of  State  Route  113  from  First  Street  to  a  route 
      outside the downtown area. In the short‐term, the City shall encourage the designation 
      of  alternative  routes  for  through  truck  traffic  to  avoid  conflicts  within  the  Downtown 
      area.

        facilities are constructed and maintained to appropriate standards. 
13.     The  City  shall  provide  adequate  capacity  on  arterials  and  collectors  to  discourage 
        diversion to local streets. 
         
F.  GENERAL   PLAN   MAP 
The  General  Plan  map  indicates  the  location  of  major  existing  and  proposed  circulation  routes 
within the Planning Area. The General Plan calls for the City to pursue the construction of grade 
separated railroad crossings within the Planning Area. , As of 2010, locations for such crossings 
will be at Parkway Boulevard, West B Street (pedestrian and bicycle only), and Pedrick Road.  
The existing crossing at Vaughn Road will also be eliminated by re‐routing the road to avoid 
the railroad tracks as outlined in the Northeast Quadrant Specific Plan.  
G.  IMPLEMENTATION 
A.     A combination of developer dedications and new special assessment districts can provide 
        an  equitable  approach  to  financing  roadway  and  circulation  improvements. 
        Implementation  of  such  a  financing  plan  will  first  require  the  completion  of  a 
        comprehensive  traffic  improvements  plan  for  the  Dixon  area.  Some  improvements  will 
        benefit  the  entire  area,  while  others  will  benefit  sub‐areas  or  specific  parcels.  The  traffic 
        improvement plan should specify the extent of benefit each improvement provides, by 
        area. These benefit classifications can form the basis of special assessment districts. 
B.      Monitor traffic volumes on local streets in residential areas, particularly east‐west streets 
                                                         
                                          City of Dixon General Plan 
                                                     TC‐ 5 

                                                                    CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
                                                              Transportation and Circulation Element
    such as West H Street and Stratford Avenue, to determine the extent of any undesirable 
    diversion of cross‐town traffic from the arterial system. 
C.  If  warranted,  initiate  measures  to  discourage  through‐traffic  on  residential  streets  and 
    collectors. These efforts could include traffic control devices such as diverters, reduced 
    speed limits, additional stop signs and similar traffic management devices. 
D. Initiate discussions with Caltrans to seek supplemental access to and from the eastbound 
    lanes  of  I‐80  to  serve  the  planned  non‐residential  areas  shown  on  the  General  Plan  map, 
    particularly those to the north of the Pitt School Road interchange, as well as those in the 
    south‐west  area.  Possible  improvements  include  expansion  or  redesign  of  interchanges 
    to permit more direct access to these areas. 
E.  Maintain liaison and discussions with Caltrans and Solano County to continue efforts to 
    designate an alternate through truck route to First Street. 
F.  Request  approval  from  the  California  Public  Utilities  Commission  for  new  grade 
    separated railroad crossings.

A.  SETTING 
S ANITARY  S EWERAGE  F ACILITIES  
Wastewater generated in Dixon is collected by sewer lines varying in size from 6 to 27 inches in 
diameter. Once collected, the sewage is transported by a 42‐inch outfall line to the wastewater 
treatment  plant  located  approximately  2  miles  south  of  the  city.  The  City  is  currently 
operating under a Cease and Desist Order issued by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality 
Control Board which provides a timeline for the City to address water quality issues associated 
with  the  City’s  wastewater  treatment  plant.    Under  the  Order,  the  City  is  required  to  provide 
meet specific water quality requirements related to salinity, and to provide treatment capacity 
to  accommodate  the  projected  development  for  the  next  five  years.  This  however  is  not 
adequate to provide for the complete build‐out of the entire General Plan Planning Area. 
W ATER  S UPPLY  
Water is supplied within the Dixon Planning Area by two water purveyors: 
    A  joint  powers’  authority  comprised  of  the  City  of  Dixon  and  the  Solano  Irrigation  District 
         know as the Dixon Solano Water Authority (DSWA) was created in August 2010.  DSWA 
         currently serves the Dixon Industrial  Park,  the  Watson  Ranch,  Pheasant  Run,  Regency, 
         Connemara, Schooner Ridge, Suffolk Downs, Brookfield, and a major portion of the Valley 
         Glen  subdivisions.  This  system  will  also  provide  water  to  most  newly  developing 
         portions  of  the  Dixon  Planning  Area.  All  water  in  the  DSWA  service  area  is  groundwater 
         from naturally occurring aquifers. Five wells pump this water from depths of between 
         1,500  and  1,800 feet below the ground surface into the distribution system. The total 
         capacity  of  these  wells  is  approximately  8,000  gallons  per  minute,  while  providing  a 
         water pressure ranging between 55 to 65 pounds per square inch. The total volume of 
         water sold in 2010 was 650 million gallons. 
    The  California  Water  Service  Company  (Cal‐Water)  serves  the  remainder  of  the  developed 
         land  within  the  Dixon  city  limits.  Most  of  the  land  within  the  Central  Dixon 
         Redevelopment Project is located within the Cal‐Water service area. In 2010, California 
         Water Service Company will operate nine wells in the Dixon area. These wells will have 
         the capacity to produce approximately 7,760 gallons of water per minute at a pressure 
         ranging from 40 to 50 pounds per square inch. Production capacity in 2009 averaged 1.4 
         million gallons of water per day and totaled   508 million gallons of water for the year.

         The  Cal‐Water  supply  wells  range  in  depth  from  900  to  1,300  feet  below  the  ground 
         surface. 
All of the water supply in Dixon, for both the DSWA and Cal‐Water service areas, is produced 
from  alluvial  deposits,  which  are  recharged  from  rainfall  and  irrigation  of  the  Sacramento 
Valley  floor  area.  The  wells  generally  have  very  high  yields,  ranging  from  several  hundred  to 
more than 1,500 gallons per minute.4 
To meet drinking water quality standards, the developed water supplies are chlorinated prior to 
conveyance to customers.  In addition, groundwater from some of the Cal‐Water service wells 
produce water with levels of nitrates that exceed drinking water standards.  To reduce the levels 
of nitrates prior to delivery, these wells have specific treatment and monitoring programs.   
D RAINAGE  
Dixon is located on an alluvial fan formed by Putah Creek, located north of the city. The gentle 
slope is to the southeast, and drainage generally follows the historic courses of Dickson Creek 
and  Dudley  Creek,  by  way  of  canals,  roadside  ditches,  and  sloughs,  to  the  Sacramento  River. 
These  facilities,  operated  by  the  Dixon  Resource  Conservation  District  (DRCD)  transport  rainfall 
runoff from the city and agricultural areas into a drainage canal operated by Reclamation District 
2068, which then delivers the runoff to the Sacramento River via Haas and Cache Sloughs. 
In 2004, the Dixon Regional Watershed Joint Powers Authority (JPA) was formed by the City of 
Dixon,  Dixon  Resource  Conversation  District,  Maine  Prairie  Water  District,  and  Reclamation 
District 2068.  The JPA regulate discharges from the City into the regional system and outlines 
improvement projects which will improve the drainage capacity of the regional system including 
discharges from the City. 
The City of Dixon has a highly developed system of storm drain pipelines that collect runoff from 
developed  properties.    The  storm  drainage  system  conveys  runoff  to  a  series  of  drainage 
detention  and  retention  basins.    These  basins  were constructed  to  capture  increases  in  runoff 
due  to  urbanization.    The  City  drainage  system  is  intended  to  reduce  or  minimize  flooding  of 
downstream rural properties due to the City’s growth.5 
P ARKS AND  R ECREATION  
The City of Dixon currently has six parks which serve the local area:

capacity to accommodate 21,000 square feet of floor space and a total force of approximately 
60 sworn and unsworn personnel. 
Fire Protection 
The City of Dixon operates the Dixon Fire Department which serves the City of Dixon. The Dixon 
Fire  District,  which  serves  a  300‐square  mile  rural  area  extending  from  Winters  to  Rio  Vista  in 
northern  Solano  County,  contracts  with  the  City  for  fire  protection.  The  department  operates 
from a modern headquarters located on Ford Way housing 8 firefighting vehicles and associated 
support vehicles.  A modern training facility is also at this site. The Department has a Fire Chief, 
two  Assistant  Fire  Chiefs,  and  18  line  personnel.  Daily  scheduled  staffing  is  6  and  minimum 
staffing  is  5.  Approximately  12  volunteer  firefighters  supplement  the  daily  staffing  and  during 
significant emergencies.  Administrative support is provided by one Administrative Manager and 
one  Clerk.  The  Department  maintains  Automatic  and  Mutual  Aid  relationships  with  all 
surrounding fire departments.  
The  City  collects  an  AB1600  fire  protection  impact  fee  on  new  development  to  fund  the 
expansion  of  fire  protection  facilities.    Future  plans  include  a  fire  station  in  the  Southwest 
Development  Area  in  order  to  improve  response  times  and  capabilities  for  current  and  future 
development. 
Ambulance Service 
The Dixon Fire Department provides engine based Advanced Life Support (ALS) services within 
the City Limits.  Transport Ambulance Service is provided by Medic Ambulance which provides 
basic  and  advanced  life  support,  emergency  and  non‐emergency  service.    An  ALS  transport 
ambulance is typically based in Dixon on a 24 hour basis.  These services are provided through a 
public private partnership. The response time standard for first response paramedic services is 7 
minutes and the transporting ambulance must arrive on scene within 12 minutes. 
Emergency Access Issues 
The City of Dixon is transected by the two railroad lines near the midpoint of town in a northeast 
to  southwest  direction.  From  time  to  time,  the  trains  can  block  the  main  roads  of  North  First 
Street and West A Street. For passenger trains the delay is typically less than one minute. Freight 
trains  are  usually  longer  and  travel  at  slower  speeds  but  most  delays  are  still  less  than  two 
minutes. Future plans of the City have a second fire station on the southwest area and a (future) 
overpass on Parkway Boulevard to lessen the impact upon emergency response to the southern 
part  of  the  City.  Should  an  event  occur  that  has  the  access  to  the  southern  part  of  the  City 
blocked, the Emergency Plan would be used to mitigate the issue with assistance from the Police 
and Public Works Departments as well as CalTrans (as needed).

A private waste disposal company (Recology Dixon) serves the Dixon area. There is generally one 
collection per week in residential, commercial and light industrial area, although the frequency 
of collection increases to three times per week in some commercial and industrial areas. 
The  solid  waste  collected  in  the  Dixon  area  is  transported  to  the  Recology  Hay  Road  Landfill 
located at 6426 Hay Road, approximately eight miles south of Dixon. This landfill operates under 
a  Class  11‐2  Permit,  which  allows  for  the  disposal  of  municipal  waste.  The  remaining  life‐
expectancy of this landfill is 59years.  
B.   PROJECTIONS 
A projected population increase of nearly 100 percent between 1990 and 2010 would result in 
increased traffic and an increase in the demand for all public services within the Dixon Planning 
Area. Although it will be possible to require new development to pay the costs associated with 
providing  the  services  which  such  development  will  require  through  the  assessment  of  impact 
fees,  such  fees  can  only  be  used  for  the  construction,  operation  and  maintenance  of  facilities 
and the provision of services which are directly related to the new development. It will not be 
possible to ask developers (who would be able to pass impact fees along to future residents with 
the price of their homes) to provide the funds necessary to upgrade the existing level of public 
services  within  the  community  beyond  any  improvement  which  might  coincide  with  the 
payment of impact fees which are directly associated with their developments. 
S ANITARY  S EWERAGE  F ACILITIES  
Additional  development  and  increased  population  and  employment  in  Dixon  will  require 
improvements to the wastewater treatment plant and the sewer main system. 
W ATER  S UPPLY  
Demands for water service as a result of new development within the Dixon Planning Area will 
call for modifications to be made in the delivery and pumping systems of the DSWA. Two Water 
Supply  Assessments  prepared  in  2005  concluded  that  there  is  sufficient  water  supply  to  meet 
the demands of the proposed and assumed future development projects and other water uses 
within the DSWA service area for the next 20 years and beyond.  The groundwater basin (Putah 
Creek  Fan  portion  of  the  Solano  Sub‐basin)  used  by  DSWA  is  not  known  to  be  in  overdraft 
condition  and  can  provide  enough  water  without  exceeding  its  safe  yield  to  serve  the

development  proposed  for  the  remainder  of  the  DSWA  service  area  outlined  in  the  DSWA 
(DSMWS) Water Master Plan  (Solano Irrigation District, 2005).  
Water  that  is  used  to  serve  the  customers  of  California  Water  Service  that  reside  in  Dixon  is 
pumped  from  a  ground  water  basin  which  is  currently  not  adjudicated  but,  according  to 
California Water Service, has a more than ample supply for the community served.  Legal issues, 
as  well  as  water  quality  and  climatic  factors,  could  impact  the  water  supply  in  Dixon.  
Historically,  California  Water  Service  has  taken  steps  to  address  impacts  that  may  occur  as 
evidenced by the numerous system improvements under construction in 2010. 
D RAINAGE  
With  additional  development  in  the  Dixon  Planning  Area,  the  number  of  acres  covered  with 
impervious surfaces (paved areas and buildings) would increase, with a corresponding increase 
in the volume of storm water runoff which would need to be collected and disposed of via the 
local  and  regional  drainage  networks.    New  development  must  comply  with  design  guidelines 
required  pursuant  to  the  State’s  National  Pollution  Discharge  Elimination  System  (NPDES) 
General  Permit  Attachment  4,  or  as  amended,  to  mitigate  the  stormwater  impacts  of  new 
development or redevelopment. 
P ARKS AND  R ECREATION  
A  growing  population  in  Dixon  will  place  increased  demands  on  local  parks  and  recreational 
facilities. In addition, as the age characteristics of the local population shift, an increased variety 
of  recreational  facilities  and  activities  may  be  in  demand.  Based  on  a  projected  population  of 
approximately 21,800 and using the standard of 5 acres of developed recreational facilities per 
1,000  residents,  the  Dixon  Planning  Area  would  need  a  total  of  approximately  102  acres  of 
developed  park  lands  and  recreational  facilities  by  the  end  of  the  planning  period.  The  Parks 
Master Plan calls for a total of 113.74 acres of developed park lands and recreational facilities to 
insure adequate space for needed facilities as established by current level of service standards 
and  to  maintain  three  acres  as  a  minimum  neighborhood  park  size  and  twenty  acres  as  a

Increased  development  within  the  Dixon  area  would  place  increased  demands  on  the  Dixon

Additional  development  would  result  in  an  increased  need  for  fire  protection  and  emergency 
services  in  the  Dixon  Planning  Area.  In  order  to  maintain  an  adequate  level  of  fire  protection 
service, additional firefighters and equipment may be necessary. 
A new fire sub‐station in the Southwest annexation area will be needed to maintain reasonable 
and adequate response times. 
P UBLIC  S CHOOLS  
Additional  residential  development  in  the  Dixon  area  will  necessitate  the  construction  of 
additional classrooms and other facilities, since existing school facilities are currently operating 
at or above capacity. As the number of students increase, the demand for additional teachers, 
administrators and support staff would also be expected to increase proportionately. 
In  developing  new  educational  facilities,  the  Dixon  Unified  School  District  intends  to  limit 
student enrollment to 650 at elementary schools, 1,000 at the middle school and 2,240 at the 
high  school.  For  planning  purposes,  the  District  has  established  the  following  student  yield 
factors: 
                      Grade	Level		                                  Students	per	Household	
                          K‐5	                               0.35	Single	Family,	0.21	Multi‐Family	
                           6‐8	                              0.15	Single	Family,	0.10	Multi‐Family	
                          9‐12		                             0.20	Single	Family,	0.12	Multi‐Family	
                        TOTAL	                               0.70	Single	Family,	0.43	Multi‐Family	
	
The future demand for schools may vary, depending on the actual number and types of housing 
units which are constructed. Based on student generation rates established by the Dixon Unified 
School District, the development of an estimated 2,499 housing units between 1996 and 2010 
would add an estimated 1,610 public school students in grades K ‐ 12 to the local school district. 
Approximately 800 of these students would be in grades K ‐ 5, 350 of these students would be in 
grades 6 ‐ 8, and 460 of these students would be in grades 9 ‐ 12. 
The School District collects a one‐time school impact mitigation fee of $6.25 per square foot on 
new  residential  construction  and  $0.47  per  square  foot  on  non‐residential  construction.  If 
projections  prove  accurate,  the  increase  in  student  population  would  require  expanding 
student capacity at the C.A. Jacobs Middle School

New development of the magnitude anticipated under the General Plan would not have adverse 
effects on the local solid waste collection service, although the increased volume of solid waste 
which would require disposal would shorten the expected life of the landfill currently in use. 
C.  ISSUES 
The primary issue related to the provision of public services in Dixon is: 
    How  will  growth  be  accommodated  while  maintaining  (or  improving)  the  current  level  of 
        public services within the Dixon Planning Area? 
D.  GOALS 
The central goal of this chapter is: 
    Provide  an  adequate  level  of  public  services  and  facilities  to  ensure  the  continued  health, 
        education, welfare and safety of all local residents. 
E.  POLICIES 
G ENERAL  
    1.  The City shall create a system of public service provision which will: 
        Support  and  encourage  a  contiguous  pattern  of  land  use,  and  discourage  premature 
           development; 
        Maintain or improve current service standards; and 
        Minimize potential environmental, fiscal and social impacts.

   2.   New development shall pay its fair share of the costs of all required public facilities and 
        services  by  means  of  adequate  mitigation  fees.  An  equitable  basis  for  allocating  costs 
        between  new  development  and  existing  areas  will  be  defined  where  capital 
        improvements  raise  the  quality  of  existing  service  or  remedies  an  existing  problem  in 
        service  provision.  However,  the  premature  upgrading  and  replacement  of  all  types  of 
        facilities  and  equipment  caused  by  new  growth  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  new 
        development. 
   3.  The City shall ensure that public facilities are planned to promote economic development 
        consistent with the overall General Plan and its specific economic development policies. 
   4.  The City shall encourage and control growth to the extent that local service networks can 
        support it. 
   5.  The  City  shall  establish  an  equitable  means  of  financing  facility  expansions/capital 
        improvements,  and  link  decisions  regarding  such  expansions  and  improvements  to  the 
        policies of the General Plan.

        capacity requirements generated by new development will be provided in a timely, cost‐
        effective and environmentally sound manner. Achieving this policy will require a variety 
        of improvements, including: 
        Installing major new conveyances; 
        Expansion of existing sewage treatment capacity; and 
        Expansion of existing effluent disposal facilities. 
   7.  The  City  shall  ensure  that  development  does  not  exceed  the  capacity  of  the  local 
        wastewater treatment facilities. 
   8.  The City shall direct development to those areas which can be efficiently served either by 
        existing wastewater treatment facilities or by one or more satellite plants (to serve areas 
        that the existing wastewater treatment plant cannot readily serve).

       principles in the design of private development projects and public facilities.  These basic 
       principles include:  
       Natural Surveillance  
       A design concept directed primarily at keeping intruders easily observable. Promoted by 
       features  that  maximize visibility  of  people,  parking  areas  and  building  entrances: doors 
       and windows that look out on to streets and parking areas; pedestrian‐friendly sidewalks 
       and streets; front porches; adequate nighttime lighting. 
       Territorial Reinforcement 
       Physical design can create or extend a sphere of influence. Users then develop a sense of 
       territorial control while potential offenders, perceiving this control, are discouraged. This 
       experience  is  promoted  by  features  that  define  property  lines  and  distinguish  private 
       spaces  from  public  spaces  by  using  landscape  plantings,  pavement  designs,  gateway 
       treatments, and “CPTED" fences. 
       Natural Access Control 
       A design concept directed primarily at decreasing crime opportunity by denying access to 
       crime targets and creating in offenders a perception of risk. This is gained by designing 
       streets,  sidewalks,  building  entrances  and  neighborhood  gateways  to  clearly  indicate 
       public  routes  and  discouraging  general  access  to  private  areas  through  structural  and 
       design elements. 
       Target Hardening 
       Accomplished  by  features  that  prohibit  entry  or  access:  window  locks,  dead  bolts  for 
       doors, interior door hinges.

           standards,  such  as  ISO,    for  communities  similar  to  Dixon  in  relationship  to  actual 
           needs. 
      A requirement for built‐in protection for commercial building in excess of 3,000 square 
           feet and in any “H,” “I,” and “R” occupancy regardless of square footage; 
      The  spacing  of  fire  stations  consistent  with  recommended  industry  standards,  such  as

   36. The  City  shall  require  proponents  of  new  development  projects  to  contribute  to  the 
       acquisition  of  sufficient  land  to  enable  the  construction  of  those  educational  facilities 
       which would be necessary to accommodate students from such projects, either through 
       the dedication of land or through the payment of in‐lieu fees. When project proponents 
       are  also  required  to  dedicate  land  for  parks  or  recreational  facilities,  such  dedications 
       shall  in  no  way  be  used  to  reduce  the  total  amount  of  land  which  must  be  dedicated 
       exclusively for educational facilities, even in instances where such lands are immediately 
       adjacent to the proposed educational facilities. 
   37. Prior  to  considering  or  approving  any  development  project,  the  City  shall  require  a 
       developer to obtain a certification from the Dixon Unified School District that all major 
       requirements  imposed  by  the  District,  regarding  the  assurance  of  adequate  school 
       facilities for future residents, have been met. 
   38. The City shall cooperate with the Dixon Unified School District to promote the provision 
       of  adequate  school  facilities,  and  to  define  equitable  and  supportable  funding 
       mechanisms where this does not conflict with other financing requirements. 
   39. The  City  shall  ensure  that  residential  growth  does  not  exceed  the  capabilities  or 
       capacities of the Dixon Unified School District to provide adequate educational facilities. 
   40. The  City  shall  provide  a  mechanism  for  promoting  a  partnership  between  the  Dixon 
       Unified School District and the City for achieving adequate educational facilities. 
   41. The  City  shall  cooperate  with  the  Dixon  Library  to  promote  the  provision  of  adequate 
       library facilities, and to define equitable and supportable funding mechanisms where this 
       does not conflict with other financing requirements.

                                                     ENERGY ELEMENT 
                            
A.  INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this Element is to identify the goals, policies, and implementation programs that 
will be used to address the following: 
    
      The  impacts  of  air  quality  which  does  not  meet  state  and  federal  standards  on  public 
         health; 
      State mandates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; 
      The need to provide reliable and cost efficient energy supplies for Dixon’s future needs; 
      Implement the 2008 City Council adopted Energy Strategic Plan. 
    
Policies and programs have been drawn from models provided by the Sacramento Metropolitan 
Air  Quality  Management  District,  the  California  Attorney  General’s  Office,  the  California  Air 
Pollution Control Officers Association (CAPCOA) and selected based on their appropriateness for 
a community with Dixon’s population, transit system, and infrastructure network.  Many of the 
policies  and  programs  have  cross  benefits  addressing  air  quality,  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) 
emission,  and  energy  goals.    They  also  enhance  General  Plan  policies  and  programs  found  in 
other  Elements  of  this  General  Plan  regarding  making  Dixon  friendly  for  bicyclists  and 
pedestrians and maintaining Dixon’s small town character. 
 
B.  SETTING  
T HE  N EED  FOR  AN  A IR  Q UALITY  &   E NERGY 
E LEMENT  
The  City  is  committed  to  reducing  energy  consumption, 
increasing energy efficiency and improving the air quality of our 
community.    
Addressing  air  quality  and  energy  in  this  dedicated  Element 
recognizes that these are important local and regional concerns. 
Just as issues of land use, circulation, open space, conservation, 
noise, housing, and safety are essential to a community’s well‐
being,  the  issues  of  air  quality  and  energy  conservation  are 
critical components of a vibrant, safe, and prosperous city.   
The policies contained in this Element offer an effective way to 
reduce  energy  use  and  improve  both  local  and  regional  air  quality.    Such  policies  will  help 
                                         City of Dixon General Plan 
                                                    AQ‐1 

                                                                     CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
                                                                                Air Quality and Energy Element 
improve the health and quality of life of people locally and throughout the region, and ensure 
that Dixon continues to thrive well into the future.   
Changes  in  land  use  patterns,  transportation  systems,  building  technology,  landscape  design, 
agricultural  practices,  and  human  behavior  can  all  lead  to  greater  energy  efficiency,  resource 
conservation and improved air quality.  This Element is therefore connected with the Land Use, 
Housing,  Circulation,  and  other  elements  of  this  General  Plan.    This  Element  expands  on  and 
provides more specific direction regarding air quality, walking, biking, and energy conservation 
policies in the other Elements. 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change 
Several recent state laws focus on the need to reduce California’s contribution to GHG emissions 
and climate change.  These include: 
                                               Assembly  Bill  32,  the  Global  Warming  Solutions  Act 
                                       of  2006,  requires  communities  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  to 
                                       1990 levels by the year 2020. This translates into a reduction 
                                       of  approximately  25%  from  what  emissions  would  be  in 
                                       California under a "business as usual” scenario.  
                                               Governor  Schwarzenegger's  Executive  Order  S‐3‐05 
                                       calls for further GHG cuts of 80 percent below 1990 levels by 
                                       2050.  This is the level believed necessary to off‐set the most 
                                       significant  physical  impacts  to  the  environment  of  climate 
                                       change. 
                                               Senate  Bill  375,  signed  in  2008,  is  intended  to  link 
                                       regional  transportation  plans  with  state  GHG  reduction 
                                       goals. Under Bill 375, state agencies and local metropolitan 
                                       planning organizations (such as the Association of Bay Area 
Governments)  are  required  to  develop  Sustainable  Community  Strategies  (SCS)  to  cut  GHG 
emissions.   
According  to  the  California  Attorney  General,  transportation  (primarily  in  private  cars) 
represents 41 percent of the state's GHG emissions.  Energy and electricity used in homes and 
commercial  and  industrial  buildings  are  also  large  contributors.  Land  use,  planning,  and 
transportation  decisions  by  counties  and  cities  are  therefore  central  to  California’s  efforts  to 
limit air pollution and climate change.

CITY OF DIXON GENERAL PLAN 
Air Quality and Energy Element 
CAPCOA  has  issued  their  “Model  Policies  for  GHG  emissions  in  General  Plans.”    This  document 
identifies  ten  top  actions  by  local  governments  as  being  the  most  effective  and  efficient  for 
reducing GHG emissions.  These ten actions address the following: 
     1.     Smart growth: jobs/housing balance, transit‐oriented development, infill development. 
     2.     Transit, bicycle, and pedestrian connections. 
     3.     Energy and water efficient buildings. 
     4.     Green procurements and alternative fuel vehicle use. 
     5.     Alternative fuel facilities and infrastructure. 
     6.     Renewable energy generation. 
     7.     Energy efficiency, solid waste reduction/recycling, and energy recovery. 
     8.     Urban forestry (tree planting) programs and requirements. 
     9.     Public outreach/education. 
     10.    Regional cooperation. 
Air Quality in the Sacramento Region 
Air quality is impacted by many of the same sources which are believed to impact GHG emission.  
With the Sacramento Region among the nation’s top twelve areas with degraded air quality, the 
need to decrease the level of air pollutants in the region’s cities is apparent.  Sensitive persons 
such as children, seniors, and those with respiratory conditions, are vulnerable to the impacts of 
air pollution.  For example, studies have shown that children who live in areas with heavy vehicle 
traffic are more likely to have reduced lung function, and are more likely to be hospitalized for 
asthma.    The  American  Lung  Association  of  California  and  the  California  Air  Resources  Board 
(CARB) estimate the following annual health impacts of air pollution: 
        School absences                                    4.7 million; 
        Lost workdays                                      1.4 million; 
        Respiratory illnesses including asthma             210,000; 
        Hospitalizations                                   7,700; 
        Premature deaths                                   8,800. 
          
Air Quality Criteria Pollutants 
The United  States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and CARB have established national

The concentration of ground level ozone is greatest on warm, windless, sunny days, and is often 
accompanied  by  temperature  inversions.  Ozone  forms  through  chemical  reactions  between 
volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). These reactions occur over time 
in  the  presence  of  sunlight.  High  levels  of  ozone  create  a  public  health  concern  because  it 
increases susceptibility to respiratory infections and diseases, and increases the risk of cardiac 
disorders.  The  principal  sources  of  VOC  and  NOx  are  the  combustion  of  fuels  and  the 
evaporation of solvents, paints, and fuels. In the Sacramento Region, over 70% of these ozone 
precursors  are  produced  from  motor  vehicles.    Figure  2  indicates  the  number  of  days  the 
standards  for  ozone  were  exceeded  in  the  last  two  years  and  the  corresponding  maximum 
readings.  All the days occurred between the months of April and September, with the highest 
number  of  days  between  July  and  September,  illustrating  the  link  between  warm  summer 
temperatures and ozone.

Airborne  dust  contains  respirable  particulate  matter  (PM10),  which  consists  of  particles  or 
droplets less than 10 microns in diameter. PM10 emissions are caused by road dust, diesel soot, 
combustion  products,  tire  and  brake  abrasion,  construction  operations,  and  fires.  The  level  of 
PM10  in  the  air  is  a  public  health  concern  because  it  can  bypass  the  body’s  natural  filtration 
system  more  easily  than  larger  particles,  and  can  lodge  deep  in  the  lungs  causing  respiratory 
problems and permanent lung damage. It also scatters light and significantly reduces visibility. 
Fine  particulate  matter  (PM2.5)  is  defined  as  extremely  small  suspended  particles  or  droplets 
with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns. PM2.5 consists mostly of combustion byproducts from 
the  reaction  of  exhaust  sulfates  and  nitrates,  along  with  finer  dust  particles.  It  is  more  closely 
linked  to  adverse  health  effects,  and  contributes  to  hospital  and  emergency  room  visits  and  is 
associated  with  asthma,  bronchitis,  cardiac  arrhythmia,  heart  attack,  and  premature  death.    
According to the YSAQMD, PM  2.5  concentrations are typically highest in the late fall and winter 
when conditions are colder and more stagnant and thus are more conducive to the build up of 
PM  2.5.    The  increased  activity  from  residential  wood  combustion  may  also  be  a  contributing 
factor to the higher levels typically observed during the late fall, early winter season. 
Toxic air contaminants (TACs) are air pollutants which may cause or contribute to an increase in 
deaths  or  serious  illness,  or  which  may  pose  a  present  or  potential  hazard  to  human  health. 
While  ambient  air  quality  standards  have  not  been  established  for  the  hundreds  of  identified 
TACs, exposure to these pollutants can cause or contribute to chronic health effects. Exposure to 
TACs  during  infancy  or  childhood  could  affect  the  development  of  the  respiratory,  nervous, 
endocrine or immune systems – increasing the risk of cancer later in life. Short‐term effects of 
TACs include irritation to the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs and can result in coughing, headache, 
dizziness, and nausea. Long‐term contact is associated with increased risks of developing cancer,

lung diseases such as asthma, damage to the immune system, and allergies. Of all the toxic air 
contaminants measured in CARB’s monitoring network, diesel particulate matter has been found 
to  contribute  the  greatest  overall  statewide  risk  to  public  health;  furthermore,  proximity  and 
long‐term exposure to diesel emissions have been proven to increase the risk of lung cancer by 
as  much  as  40  percent.  Motor  vehicles  are  the  primary  source  of  the  top  three  toxic  air 
contaminants, thus contributing to the risk of developing adverse health effects in the region.  
Causes of Poor Air Quality  
The region’s poor air quality can largely be attributed to emissions from man‐made and natural 
sources,  the  Central  Valley’s  geography  (which  tends  to  trap  polluted  air),  and  weather 
conditions. Man‐made sources include air pollution emissions from stationary, area and mobile 
sources.  CARB identifies the following as key man‐made sources of air pollution as well as their 
effects and control measures.

Air Quality and Energy Element 
Natural sources of poor air quality include biogenic hydrocarbons, natural wind‐blown dust and 
wildfires.  The  mountains  surrounding  the  Sacramento  Valley  create  a barrier  to  airflow,  which 
can trap air pollutants in the Valley when meteorological conditions are right. The Valley itself is 
flat,  providing  a  place  for  air  pollutants  to  settle.  In  the  Valley,  air  quality  is  at  its worst  when 
temperature  inversions  trap  pollutants  near  the  ground—usually  in  the  warmer  summertime 
months. 
The portion of the region which does not meet the federal and/or state standards for known air 
pollutants  is  referred  to  as  the  Sacramento  non‐attainment  area.    A  “nonattainment” 
designation  indicates  that  a  pollutant  concentration  has  exceeded  the  federal  standard.    The 
Sacramento non‐attainment area is classified as a “serious” nonattainment area for the federal 
eight  hour  ambient  air  quality  standard  for  ozone  (Figure  4),  the  state  twenty‐four  hour 
standard for  PM10,  and  partial  non‐attainment  for  the  federal  twenty‐four  hour  standards  for 
PM2.5.

City of Dixon Energy Strategic Plan            
The City is addressing citywide energy use and conservation through a citywide Energy Strategic 
Plan adopted in 2008.  The Plan addresses energy efficiency, GHG reduction, renewable energy 
resources, transportation efficiency and water conservation.  The vision of the Energy Strategic 
Plan is to work with public and private agencies to provide energy independence and reduce the 
City’s environmental impact while providing jobs and reducing costs.    
The policies in the Energy Strategic Plan are intended to support and reinforce the community‐
wide  goals  contained  in  the  General  Plan.    This  Element  provides  policies  and  implementation 
tasks to conserve and produce energy, and establishes the framework for community focus on 
this  issue.    The  City  will  lead  the  way  by  increasing  the  efficiency  of  municipal  operations.  
However, municipal operations represent only a small percentage of total energy use in Dixon.  
Therefore, community‐wide efforts in both the public and private sectors are needed to achieve 
meaningful reductions overall in energy use.  
Renewable Energy
The City is committed not only to saving energy, but also to producing renewable energy locally 
in order to lower the cost of government and business operations and reduce our impact on the 
environment.   
Renewable  energy  sources  capture  energy  from  on‐going  natural  processes  such  as  sunlight, 
wind, flowing water, biological processes, and geothermal heat.  In contrast, most energy used 
                                                       in  the  US  today  comes  from  nonrenewable 
                                                       sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas. 
                                                       Although  only  a  small  percentage  of  the  nation’s 
                                                       energy  needs  are  currently  met  by  renewable 
                                                       sources,  there  is  growing  interest  in  renewable 
                                                       energy.    The  wind  farms  south  of  Dixon  are  one 
                                                       example of a recent renewable energy installation; 
                                                       the  installation  of  solar  panels  on  the  roofs  of 
                                                       private homes and businesses is another.

C.  PROJECTIONS 
Continued  development  will  increase  the  amount  of  air  pollutants  and  GHGs  created  in  Dixon 
and the region, including emissions from stationary and mobile sources.

Air Quality and Energy Element 
The  major  source  of  emissions  within  the  City  will  continue  to  be  the  operation  of  motor 
vehicles. Land use planning measures can reduce emissions from such sources by reducing the 
length  and  number  of  vehicle  trips  and  by  encouraging  residents  to  use  alternative  forms  of 
transportation.  
For stationary sources (homes and businesses), energy conservation measures can reduce GHG 
emissions and the City’s contribution to climate change by reducing the use of energy generated 
from fossil fuels.  The use of renewable energy sources, which generally do not emit GHGs, will 
also help reduce Dixon’s contribution to climate change. 
The completion of a Climate Change Action Plan, recommended as an implementation program, 
will provide more specific data on the sources of GHG and programs to reduce emissions.  The 
Plan will require periodic review and updating to ensure goals are met. 
D.  ISSUES 
I MPORTANCE OF  A IR  Q UALITY  
The quality of the air we breathe directly affects our health, environment, economy and quality 
of  life.  The  Federal  Clean  Air  Act  of  1977  directed  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  to 
establish  national  ambient  air  quality  standards  (NAAQS).  Primary  standards  protect  public 
health.  Secondary  standards  protect  public  welfare  associated  with  the  presence  of 
contaminants in the ambient air.  
Although air quality is a regional issue, there are steps that Dixon can take to improve air quality 
and  to  avoid  adverse  localized  air  pollution  impacts.  Local  efforts  over  the  past  two  decades 
have contributed to the improvement in air quality, and will continue to play an important role 
in achieving federal and state air quality standards. 
I MPORTANCE OF  E NERGY  C ONSERVATION AND  E FFICIENCY  
Energy  conservation  and  efficiency  means  using  energy  more  wisely.    There  are  many 
opportunities  to  do  so,  including  developing  compact  and  walkable  land  use  patterns,  using 
green building technologies, and implementing water conservation measures, the enforcement 
of  policies  in  areas  such  as  land  use,  building  and  transportation  and  incentives  to  promote 
energy efficiency will be critical to achieving the City’s goals.   
Programs  which  aim  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  through  energy  efficiency  and  conservation 
measures often have the dual benefit of reducing customer costs.  Using energy more wisely will 
save residents and businesses money and will lead to a healthier environment.

A hazard that is deemed to be a tolerable exposure to danger given the expected benefits to be
obtained. Different levels of acceptable risk may be assigned according to the potential danger
and the criticalness of the threatened structure. The levels may range from "near zero" for nuclear
plants and natural gas transmission lines to "moderate" for open space, ranches and low-intensity
warehouse uses.

monthly income (GMI) for housing, including utilities.
Affordability Requirements
Provisions established by a public agency to require that a specific percentage of housing units in a
project or development remain affordable to very low- and low-income households for a
specified period.
Agriculture
Use of land for the production of food and fiber, including the growing of crops and/or the
grazing of animals on natural prime or improved pasture land.

from parcels to existing arterials is common.
Assisted Housing
Generally multi-family rental housing, but sometimes single-family ownership units, whose
construction, financing, sales prices, or rents have been subsidized by federal, state, or local
housing programs including, but not limited to Federal Section 8 (new construction, substantial

Refers to eight classifications of land mapped by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil
Conservation Service. The five agricultural classifications defined below - except Grazing
Land - do not include publicly owned lands for which there is an adopted policy preventing
agricultural use.
Prime Farmland
Land which has the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for the production
of crops. It has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce
sustained high yields of crops when treated and managed, including water management,
according to current farming methods. Prime Farmland must have been used for the production
of irrigated crops within the last three years.
Farmland of Statewide Importance
Land other than Prime Farmland which has a good combination of physical and chemical
characteristics for the production of crops. It must have been used for the production of
irrigated crops within the last three years.
Unique Farmland
Land which does not meet the criteria for Prime Farmland or Farmland of Statewide
Importance, that is currently used for the production of specific high economic value crops. It has
the special combination of soil quality, location, growing season, and moisture supply needed to
produce sustained high quality or high yields of a specific crop when treated and managed
according to current farming methods. Examples of such crops may include oranges, olives,
avocados, rice, grapes, and cut flowers.
Farmland of Local Importance
Land other than Prime Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Importance, or Unique Farmland that is
either currently producing crops, or that has the capability of production. This land may be
important to the local economy due to its productivity.
Grazing Land
Land on which the existing vegetation, whether grown naturally or through management, is
suitable for the grazing or browsing of livestock. This classification does not include land
previously designated as Prime Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Importance, Unique Farmland,
or Farmland of Local Importance, and heavily brushed, timbered, excessively steep, or rocky
lands which restrict the access and movement of livestock.
Fault
A fracture in the earth's crust forming a boundary between rock masses that have shifted.
Flood, 100-Year
The magnitude of a flood expected to occur on the average every 100 years, based on historical

data. The 100-year flood has a 1/100, or one percent, chance of occurring in any given year.
Flood Plain
The relatively level land area on either side of the banks of a stream regularly subject to flooding.
That part of the flood plain subject to a one percent chance of flooding in any given year is
designated as an "area of special flood hazard" by the Federal Insurance Administration.
Floor Area Ratio
The gross floor area permitted on a site divided by the total net area of the site, expressed in
decimals to one or two places. For example, on a site with 10,000 net square feet of land area, a
Floor Area Ratio of 1.0 will allow a maximum of 10,000 gross square feet of building floor area
to be built. On the same site, and FAR of 1.5 would allow 15,000 square feet of floor area; and
FAR of 2.0 would allow 20,000 square feet; and an FAR of 0.5 would allow only 5,000 square
feet. Also commonly used in zoning, FARs typically are applied on a parcel-by-parcel basis as
opposed to an average FAR for an entire land use or zoning district.
Gateway
A point along a roadway entering a city or county at which a motorist gains a sense of having
left the environs and of having entered the city or county.
General Plan
A compendium of city or county policies regarding long-term development, in the form of maps
and accompanying text. The General Plan is a legal document required of each local agency by
the State of California Government Code Section 65301 and adopted by the City Council or
Board of Supervisors. In California, the General Plan has seven mandatory elements (Circulation,
Conservation, Housing, Land Use, Noise, Open Space, Safety and Seismic Safety) and may
include any number of optional elements (such as Air Quality, Economic Development,
Hazardous Waste, and Parks and Recreation). The General. Plan may also be called a "City Plan",
"Comprehensive Plan', or "Master Plan".
Goal
A general, overall, and ultimate purpose, aim, or end toward which the City or County will
direct effort.
Groundwater
Water under the earth's surface, often confined to aquifers capable of supplying wells and springs.
Groundwater Recharge
The natural process of infiltration and percolation of rainwater from land area or streams through
permeable soils into water-holding rocks that provide underground storage ("aquifers").

Trip
A one-way journey that proceeds from an origin to a destination via a single mode of

has one "production end" (or origin - often from home, but not always), and one "attraction end",
(destination).
Trip Generation

Volume-to-Capacity Ratio
A measure of the operating capacity of a roadway or intersection, in terms of the number of
vehicles passing through, divided by the number of vehicles that theoretically could pass through
when the roadway or intersection is operating at its designed capacity. Abbreviated as "V/C". At a
V/C ratio of 1.0, the roadway or intersection is operating at capacity. if the ratio is less than 1.0,
the traffic facility has additional capacity. Although ratios slightly greater than 1.0 are possible,
it is more likely that the peak hour will elongate into a "peak period".
Wetlands
Transitional areas between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or
near the surface, or the land is covered by shallow water. Under a "unified" methodology now
used by all federal agencies, wetlands are defined as "those areas meeting certain criteria for
hydrology, vegetation, and soils".
Williamson Act
Known formally as the California Land Conservation Act of 1965, it was designed as an
incentive to retain prime agricultural land and open space in agricultural use, thereby slowing its
conversion to urban and suburban development. The program entails a ten-year contract between
the City or County and an owner of land whereby the land is taxed on the basis of its agricultural
use rather than its market value. The land becomes subject to certain enforceable restrictions, and
certain conditions need to be met prior to approval of an agreement.
Zoning

allowable uses for real property and size restrictions for buildings within these areas; a program
that implements policies of the General Plan.
Zoning District
A designated section of a city or county for which prescribed land use requirements and building
and development standards are uniform.
Zoning Map
Government Code Section 65851 permits a legislative body to divide a county, a city, or portions
thereof, into zones of the number, shape, and area it deems best suited to carry out the purposes of
the zoning ordinance. These zones are delineated on a map or maps, called the Zoning Map.

                              (Approved by Voters, April 8, 1986)
The proposed city ordinance reads as follows:
The people in the City of Dixon, County of Solano, do ordain as follows:
AUTHORIZATION TO THE DIXON CITY COUNCIL:
The people in the City of Dixon, County of Solano, hereby authorize the Dixon City Council to
limit annual residential growth in the City of Dixon to a number of new dwelling units equal to
3% or less of the total number of housing units existing on December 31st of each prior calendar
year, said limitation to begin in the year of adoption of this measure. (3% in 1986 would equal
100 units.)
Furthermore, said unit limit us intended to be designated within the limits of the City's General
Plan Goals, Objectives and Policies, in order to arrive at an approximate mix of 80% single
family housing units (including single family attached duplex units) to 20 % multiple dwelling
units. The annual limit is subject to exceptions set forth in Section B.4, below, of PURPOSES
AND FINDING, and an exclusion for Planned Developments and any Unit thereof, that received
final City approval prior to the date of enactment of this measure, as set forth in Section B.5,
below.
PURPOSES AND FINDINGS:
The people in the City of Dixon, County of Solana, hereby find as follows:
A.       PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this measure to augment the policies of this City as stated in its General Plan
and Ordinances, regarding the regulation of residential development. To accomplish this
purpose, the City needs to control its annual proposed residential development to achieve a
balanced housing mix. It is the intent of the people of the City of Dixon to realize a steady,
controlled rate of balanced residential annual growth. This controlled growth is to assure that the
services provided by the City and other service agencies will be adequate in the foreseeable
future. Services should be provided in such a way as to avoid overextension or scarcity of
resources of existing facilities, to bring deficient services or facilities up to full operating
standards, and utilize long range planning techniques to minimize the cost of the expansion of
facilities to the public.
B.       FINDINGS

                                                  B‐1

                                                                    APPENDIX B 
                                                              TEXT OF MEASURE “B” 
The people of the City of Dixon hereby find and declare as follows:
1. Regional Need for Housing. Dixon's share of the Housing Needs Determination of the San
Francisco Bay Region, adopted by ABAG for the years 1980-1990 is stated therein as 866 units.
The annual dwelling unit limit proposed by this measure exceeds this City's fair share as set
forth in the ABAG's Regional Housing Needs Determination.
2. Housing Programs and Activities. (a) The City has formed a Redevelopment Agency, of
which housing is an important component. The City plans to rehabilitate deteriorating housing,
provide for senior citizen housing and affordable housing in central Dixon. (b) The City has
authorized self-help housing development of affordable housing. (c) The City has approved
Watson Ranch PUD, which contains buildable site inventories for approximately 60 housing
units. (d) The City has also approved a somewhat controversial development called Chardonnay
PUD, which provides for 352 multiple housing units scheduled to be built over the next 3 years.
(e) In addition, the City has approved Pitt School Village Planned Development.
3. Benefits to Public Health and Welfare. Dixon, now in the process of revising its General
Plan, is faced with proposals for the annexation of land for residential development, which could add
substantially to the population of the City of Dixon in the near future, if such were approved.
But, at this time, Dixon is faced with drainage and flooding, traffic, school overcrowding and
other services problems. Because City-used facilities for drainage, traffic and schools are already
at or near capacity, our City may not have enough facilities and available resources to now
provide for already approved development to be built, let alone areas proposed to be annexed.
Lack of downstream drainage capacity severely limits the current development potential of
Dixon. Drainage improvements will be needed that involve substantial expenditures of public
funds, time and resources, and planning and coordination with other agencies already severely
restricted in their ability to commit their already burdened resources.
Total effects of proposed annexations on traffic generated will have severe impacts on existing
downtown traffic congestion, not to mention air quality and noise levels.
Schools are presently at or over capacity and will be further impacted by new development.
In addition, irreversible environmental changes would include loss of agricultural land with
Class l prime soils, in the City's immediate area, with no mitigation. Dixon is primarily an
agricultural community. For all of the above stated reasons, Dixon must regulate its rate of
growth and housing mix so that it can conserve its existing resources and facilities and
adequately plan for additional growth at a rate that it can, hopefully, accommodate. The people
of Dixon find that the annual rate of growth stated herein for development yet to be approved,
with the exceptions and exclusions elsewhere set forth is, thus, necessary to promote the public
health, safety and welfare of Dixon by the adoption of this measure.
4. Housing Mix and New Construction. A concern of the people of Dixon that relates to the
number of dwelling units allowed to be built each year is housing and swelling unit mix.

                                                                   APPENDIX B 
                                                             TEXT OF MEASURE “B” 
Recently, the City Council approved a large multiple unit dwelling complex that will alter the
housing mix of the City of Dixon by some 352 units, and increase its multiple dwelling inventory
by almost 50%. To adequately address community housing goals, consistent with the General
Plan Housing Objectives, and in consideration of the provisions contained in this measure, the
people of Dixon find that residential housing projects should be evaluated for their conformity
with Dixon's housing mix goal of an approximate mix of 80% single family housing units
(including single family attached duplex units) to 20% multiple dwelling units.
In cases where the number of new units to be built is any one year (being a number equal to 3%
of the dwelling units existing in the City during the previous year) is found by the Council to be
insufficient for a particular residential development project, when considered with other
proposed units to be built during any one year, an exception may be made for a larger number of
units in any one year, provided that (a) such exceptions do not occur more than two years in a
row, and provided (b) in no case will the total number of units approved exceed the average of
3% per year over each consecutive five year period, and (c) that exceptions will be made only for
the below-listed categories and criteria, as follows:
(i) Public Services. Where the cost of public services, utilities, infrastructure or school
construction borne by a particular residential project and required by the City, are found by the
Council, on the evidence presented to it, to prevent such project from being economically
feasible, considering the number of dwelling units allowed to be built together with such public
services, etcetera, an exception may be granted by the Council;
(ii) Regional/Community Housing Needs. Where, on the evidence presented, the Council finds it
necessary to increase the number of residential units to be built in any one year above said 3% to
meet regional/community housing needs, art exception may be made by the Council.
5. Approved Planned Development Redevelopment Exclusion. The people of the City of Dixon
find that the provisions of this measure, including the limitation on the number of dwelling units
to be constructed in one year, as above stated, and the mix of 80% single family to 20% multiple
unit construction guideline above stated, shall not apply to the following: (a) Any Planned
Development or Unit thereof, that received final approval by the City Council prior to the
effective date of the enactment of this measure. (b) Housing projects in the Central Dixon
Redevelopment Area.
6. Fiscal and Environmental Resources. The findings contained in Section B.3. of this measure
are incorporated herein by reference, as fully as if set forth in detail. Fiscal and environmental
resources of Dixon are limited, particularly after the passage of Proposition 13, and considering
that the City cooperates with other agencies whose resources are also limited, for the provision of
facilities and services, such as drainage, fire protection, water and school districts. Of course, the
resource of prime agricultural land is irreplaceable. The people of Dixon desire that new
development pay its own way; however, as stated above, generation of tax income for rapidly
built residential units seldom keeps pace with the cost of providing services, and particularly

where such services and facilities are already impacted.
7. Duration of this Measure. This measure and the provisions herein contained are intended to be
included in appropriate elements of the 1985-1986 General Plan revision of the City of Dixon.
This measure is to be in effect until the year 1996 when it will again be placed on the ballot at
the regular City Council election for reconsideration by the voters; provided, however, that the
City Council shall comply with the requirement of Government Code Section 65588.
