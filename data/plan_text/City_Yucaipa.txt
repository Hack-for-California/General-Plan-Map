quaint historic Uptown, good schools, and civic spirit.
Yucaipa’s reputation as a premier community is not an accident.
Rather, Yucaipa’s progress is the result of strong leadership,
thoughtful planning and design, and an imaginative and
independent spirit. Yucaipa has taken great pride in preserving the
best of its built and natural environment, remaining flexible and
open to changes in land use to capitalize on opportunities, and
encouraging resident and business involvement to shape its future.
This model of success continues to pay community dividends.
Yucaipa’s General Plan builds on the past to forge a more
prosperous future for the community. The General Plan’s vision
reflects what the community aspires to become. Its policy
framework guides decisions about future economic development
projects, service priorities, capital improvements, and budgeting.
Through adherence to budget priorities and implementation
programs, the General Plan’s goals and policies are supported by
actions that lead to improvements in community quality of life.

 1. INTRODUCTION
                                           YUCAIPA’S HISTORY
                                           Before delving into Yucaipa’s vision for the future, however, it is
                                           important to take a step back to the past. The values that Yucaipa’s
                                           residents hold today are products of the community’s unique
                                           topography, long history, and built environment. Understanding
                                           Yucaipa’s evolution and change as a community provides a
                                           foundation for identifying opportunities for the future.
                                           So let’s start from the beginning.
                                           Where It All Began
                                           The community that became Yucaipa grew out of the natural
                                           landscape. Rivers flowing southwest from the San Bernardino
                                           mountains deposited minerals downstream over thousands of
                                           years, creating a fertile environment for inhabitants of the valley.
                                           The Yuhaviatam, referred to as Serrano Indians by later explorers,
                                           were the first inhabitants of the Yucaipa Valley. Later missionaries,
                                           homesteaders, and pioneers would be drawn by the grassy plains,
                                           creeks, shaded canyons, and rich grassy lands of the Yucaipa
                                           Valley. Under the name Yucaipa Ranchería, the Yukaipat site is

general location of the original Yukaipat.
                                           Agriculture Takes Root
                                           Fed by downstream wash from the mountains, Yucaipa’s fertile
                                           valley and climate were well suited for agriculture, its first industry.
                                           During the 1800s, the Yucaipa Valley was used as grazing land for
                                           a satellite property of San Gabriel Mission’s Rancho San
                                           Bernardino. For the next 100 years, the Yucaipa Valley became
                                           known for its agriculture and ranching enterprises. Yucaipa lands
                                           were transferred from the missions to Antonio Maria Lugo in 1842,
                                           and later to Diego Sepulveda. Sepulveda built the Rancho Yucaipa,
                                           which stands today as California Historical Landmark 528. Vestiges
                                           of this ranching history are still visible around the area.
                                           Early California Settlements
                                           Shortly following California statehood in 1850, settlers began to
                                           migrate to the Yucaipa Valley. John Dunlap settled on the
                                           Sepulveda Ranch, which became known as “Dunlap Acres.” In
                                           1869, Dunlap expanded agricultural operations to include grain.
                                           The Dunlaps also built Casa Blanca in 1882 and the first school on
                                           Cherrycroft Drive, now restored under private ownership. Ranches
Casa Blanca was the home of John Dunlap,   were also established in Wildwood Canyon, the North Bench area,
     one of the early settlers of Yucaipa. and Live Oak Canyon. The only other early industry in the Yucaipa
                                           Valley to generate as much excitement was gold mining, which
                                           had a short-lived success due to mining in the Crafton Hills.

“Where the Big Red Apple Grows”
The early 1900s saw changes in Yucaipa Valley’s agriculture, from
large-scale ranching to apple orchards. From 1900 to 1910, the
Redlands-Yucaipa Land Company bought 11,000 acres in Yucaipa,
and soon thereafter, developers began to sell ranches to make way
for a burgeoning apple industry. For several decades, apple
production became a staple for the local economy, and the goal
was to create the “apple kingdom” of the Southwest. As people
migrated to Yucaipa in search of wealth, a town center began to
form at the corner of Yucaipa Boulevard and California Street.
Surviving the Great Depression
The Great Depression brought significant change to Yucaipa
Valley’s agricultural industry. Lower prices in the apple markets
caused growers to shift production to peaches, citrus, walnuts,
grain, and other fruit. Unemployment was the defining sign of that
time. In those difficult conditions, Yucaipans lived off the land and U-KI-PA (Yucaipa) brand apples, patent
supported one another through the Yucaipa Cooperative Exchange.           dates back to the early 1920s.
One of Yucaipa’s most notable successes dates back to the 1930s,
when Leo and Cleo Stater founded Stater Brothers in Yucaipa.
World War II and Transition
The 1940s marked another significant turning point in Yucaipa.
Yucaipans were actively involved in the worldwide war effort. From
sending soldiers abroad to running top-secret projects, Yucaipa
residents lent their time and experience to the war effort. During
this time, Yucaipa became known as “The Egg Basket of Southern
California” for its poultry operations. Peach production replaced
the apple industry, which gradually moved to Oak Glen. A landing
strip was also established in the area known now as Chapman
Heights, and a volunteer fire department was established.
                                                                      CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 1-3

1. INTRODUCTION
                                        Yucaipans Settle Down
                                        By the 1950s, Yucaipans had survived the Depression and the war,
                                        and now settled down to focus on family and community. The
                                        1950s and 1960s were boom years, with ranches giving way to
                                        housing for residents. Yucaipa saw arrival of a hospital and sheriff's
                                        station. The first mobile-home park was built in 1947, and many
                                        other parks followed. In 1963, the Yucaipa Joint Unified School
                                        District was established after more than a decade of discussions.
                                        Devastating floods during the 1960s also led to drainage
                                        infrastructure projects to guard against future flooding.
                                        Present Day Yucaipa
                                        Yucaipa’s recent history is denoted by its transition to cityhood.
                                        The 1970s brought Crafton Hills College, one of only 113 in
                                        California. The 1980s and 1990s saw the redevelopment of citrus
                                        groves into the Chapman Heights planned development. During
                                        the 1980s, the Yucaipa Valley Water District opened a modern
                                        wastewater treatment plant and built water systems to serve the
                                        community. This period also brought the County Regional Park.
                                        After many attempts at cityhood, Yucaipa voters passed Measure K
                                        and became an incorporated city on November 27, 1989.
                                        Since incorporation, the City of Yucaipa has continued to preserve
                                        the community’s character and maintain a careful balance between
                                        the needs of business, residents, and the environment. The City
                                        adopted a new plan for the freeway corridor that will support
                                        Yucaipa’s local economy. Civic leaders, residents, and stakeholders
  Yucaipans enjoy the vast open spaces  have preserved Crafton Hills and Wildwood Canyon State Park.
       surrounding the community.
                                        Capital improvements have improved water, sanitation, roads, and
                                        other infrastructure. Revitalization efforts have also strengthened
                                        the Uptown as a central gathering place for the community.

1. INTRODUCTION
                                        SHAPING THE FUTURE
                                        Yucaipa’s General Plan represents the community, its values, and its
                                        aspirations. Yucaipa residents, businesses, schools, and other
                                        institutions and stakeholders participated in a variety of venues to
                                        define issues and propose recommendations for the General Plan.
           Yucaipa’s General Plan       More than 50 duly-noticed meetings were held over the course of
     update included extensive          three years to inform the general plan update.
   outreach to the community;
     more than 50 duly-noticed          Key meetings and forums included:
   public workshops, hearings,
                                          + General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC). The City Council
        and meetings were held
                                             appointed a 13-member GPAC that included representatives of
                   over three years.
                                             local businesses, commission members, and residents. The
                                             GPAC helped craft the General Plan vision and land use plan,
                                             reviewed all draft chapters, and made recommendations to the
                                             City Council. During the update, the GPAC held two dozen
                                             publicly noticed meetings that were open to all.
                                          + Commission/Committee Workshops. City commissions and
                                             committees helped shape Yucaipa’s General Plan by identifying
                                             relevant issues, providing comment, and reviewing draft
                                             products. Ten meetings were held with these groups:
                                             - Parks and Recreation Commission
                                             - Healthy Yucaipa Committee
                                             - Youth Advisory Committee
                                             - Trails and Open Space Committee
                                             - Economic Development Advisory Committee
                                          + City Council Workshops. Following GPAC and Commission
                                             meetings, the City Council reviewed each General Plan chapter/
                                             element in separate workshops—community design and land
                                             use; housing and neighborhoods; public services and public
                                             safety; parks/recreation/trails and open space; transportation;
                                             and economic development. Comments were included into
                                             each chapter prior to completion of the public review draft.
                                          + Interagency and Public Review. Once the elements were
                                             completed, the draft General Plan was assembled and
                                             circulated to a wide range of public agencies, the general
                                             public, and other interested parties. It was available for review
                                             on the City’s website, and copies were available at City Hall,
                                             the Yucaipa library, and other locations. Comments received
                                             on the General Plan were carefully reviewed for incorporation.
                                          + General Plan Adoption Hearings. Publicly noticed hearings to
                                             consider the General Plan and environmental impact report

1. INTRODUCTION
                                        Using the General Plan
                                        The General Plan has multiple uses for different interests. The City
                                        Council and Planning Commission use it to evaluate land use
                                        changes and make decisions on projects, services, capital
                                        improvements, and specific development proposals. City staff use it
                                        to regulate development projects, prioritize services, and make
                                        recommendations to elected officials. Stakeholders also use the
                                        General Plan to advocate for programs, projects, and services.
                                        Understanding the structure of the General Plan helps stakeholders
                                        effectively use it. Each chapter introduces the chapter topic,
                                        describes its context, and explains its importance to a community.
                                        A series of goals and policies show how the City will achieve the
                                        General Plan vision. The final chapter lists implementing programs.
                                          + Goals. A goal is a general description of the result that Yucaipa
                                             seeks to create or preserve through the implementation of its
                                             General Plan. A goal is typically a long-term condition that a
                                             community aspires to achieve over the life of the general plan.
                                             It is achieved through adherence to policies and programs.
                                          + Policies. A policy is a specific statement that guides decision
                                             making as the City works to achieve a goal. The General Plan’s
                                             policies set the standards that will be used by City staff, the
                                             Planning Commission, and City Council in their review of land
                                             development projects and in decision-making processes.
                                          + Programs. To help ensure that appropriate actions are taken to
                                             implement the General Plan, the City implements general plan
                                             goals and policies through a series of codes and ordinances,
                                             master plans and capital improvements, programs and
                                             services, financing, and other measures.
                                        When implementing Yucaipa’s General Plan, it is important to note
                                        that it addresses multiple objectives through its goals and policies.
                                        Adherence to an individual goal or policy is not intended to
                                        preclude achievement of other goals and policies. Implementing
                                        goals and policies often requires balancing priorities at a particular
                                        time or for particular circumstances and decisions. The City Council
                                        has final discretion over how to balance adherence to goals and
                                        policies when multiple ones affect a single decision.
                                        The City faces the same practical limitations when implementing
                                        programs. The City implements a wide range of programs, some of
                                        which are ongoing efforts while others are service level options.
                                        However, it is possible that programs will change in nature, or the
                                        schedule of completion for programs will change. This may be due
                                        to changes in staffing levels, funding levels, or other contingencies.
                                        The City Council will make final determinations as to the programs
                                        to be pursued and the timetable for completion.

INTRODUCTION
Yucaipa’s quality of life is defined by its pattern and design of land
uses that determine where people live, work, shop, and socialize.      In This Element:
Quality of life depends on how these particular land uses are
                                                                       +   Community Structure

                                                                       +   Project Level Guidance
To that end, Yucaipa’s Community Design and Land Use Element
addresses the type, location, and extent of land uses in the City to
ensure that such uses meet the needs of the community. This
element also addresses the design and appearance of the built and
natural environments in the community. As the City evolves, this
element provides guidance for shaping the City's design by
preserving its natural environment while encouraging well-
designed growth that benefits the community.
The Community Design and Land Use Element comprises more
than land uses and regulations on community aesthetics. Attention
to Yucaipa’s built environment represents the City’s investment in
quality of life. Thoughtful planning about the community’s
structure, distribution of land uses, public infrastructure, and
appearance of buildings—these dimensions reflect how residents
perceive quality of life and how employers and retailers view
Yucaipa as a desirable place for commerce.
                                                                            CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 2-1

                                             Plan through a correlating set of zoning designations that
                                             determine the type of land use, intensity or density, standards,
                                             and appearance of proposed developments.
                                        +    Overlay Districts. The municipal code contains overlay districts
                                             that provide regulatory guidance on addressing public safety,
                                             biotic, resource, hillside, noise, and other resource concerns.
                                             Overlay districts also include planned development districts.

                                        This element provides an overview on the planning context. The

                                        by goals and policies to achieve the community’s vision.
                                        Goals and policies provide guidance at three scales:
                                        +    Citywide Focus. These policies affect the entire community,

COMMUNITY STRUCTURE
Yucaipa’s community structure, its form and pattern of land uses,
is a function of its natural environment and the needs of a
developing and maturing community. An understanding of
community structure provides the foundation for responsive goals
and policies that further the long-term vision of the community.
Features
Yucaipa’s community structure is derived from its history, natural           Community design is created
environment, and design vision. The Crafton Hills, national forest,                 at multiple levels—from
and Yucaipa Hills provide a visual backdrop for the valley. Major                   citywide to districts and
tributaries have etched channels into Yucaipa’s landscape, creating                neighborhoods, down to
defined elevation changes called benches. The major tributaries
converge at Live Oak Canyon, at the southwest portion of the City.
                                                                                      individual projects and

Within that context, the features that collectively contribute to            must function effectively and
Yucaipa’s community design include the following.
                                                                            convey a sense of identity and
Districts and Neighborhoods                                                 place at the appropriate scale.
Yucaipa has a variety of residential and commercial districts, each
with a distinct purpose and identity. Residential neighborhoods or
larger planning areas range from the rustic North Bench and
Wildwood Canyon areas, to the established Central Core (including
Uptown) and Chapman Heights, to the lower density Dunlap Acres.
Dunlap Industrial and Uptown each have different types of
businesses that cater to different consumers. Looking forward, the
Freeway Corridor and College Village will also have distinct districts.
This element supports opportunities to create a cohesive and
attractive image for each district and neighborhood.
Paths and Corridors
Paths and corridors are the circulation or transportation links of a
community and are vital to the way people perceive their city.
Yucaipa’s long, straight corridors span the community and give
motorists views of commercial areas, neighborhoods, and the
mountains. Prominent scenic corridors are Yucaipa Boulevard,
Bryant Street, Oak Glen Road, and Live Oak Canyon Road, and
Wildwood Canyon Road. An extensive network of trails
complements these resources. This element provides guidance on
                                                                        Oak Glen Road, a scenic corridor, connects

as they move about the community. Unlike many cities, Yucaipa’s

 2. COMMUNITY DESIGN AND LAND USE
                                             major landmarks include its hillsides—Yucaipa Hills, Crafton Hills,
                                             and Wildwood Canyon—which offer panoramic vistas throughout
                                             the community. Zanja Peak and other peaks and ridgelines are
                                             natural landmarks that overlook Yucaipa. Major creeks (e.g., Wilson
                                             Creek, Wildwood Creek), drainage channels, and elevated benches
                                             are also defining landmarks or features of Yucaipa. Preserving
                                             Yucaipa’s landmarks is a priority in the general plan.
                                             Gateways
                                             Yucaipa’s visual impression is expressed by its entry points (often
                                             referred to as gateways) along its major transportation corridors.
                                             These entry points help to define one’s entrance or sense of arrival
                                             to the community, a particular neighborhood, or district. The
                                             quality of gateways communicates an impression. Some gateways
                                             are located near the freeway, and others are located along major
                                             streets. As the City implements the General Plan, gateways will be

                                             Activity Centers
                                             Activity centers are clusters or concentrations of uses that provide
                                             vibrancy, convenience, and variety in a community. Yucaipa

                                             dynamic activity centers. This element calls for focused
                                             development, coordinated landscaping, pedestrian features, and
                                             other infrastructure and aesthetic improvements along Yucaipa
                                             Boulevard to link these activity centers. Future opportunities for
                                             activity centers may also exist at other locations as residential
                                             neighborhoods more fully develop in the future.
                                             Edges
                                             Unlike many communities, Yucaipa is bounded by hills and natural
                                             open space that frame the community and serve as the edge or
                                             boundary of the community. These include the Crafton Hills,
                                             Yucaipa Hills, and San Bernardino National Forest. Roadways also
                                             define the edges of the City’s neighborhoods and districts. Yucaipa
                                             Boulevard and Oak Glen Road are dividing lines for Dunlap Acres
                                             and the North Bench. Wildwood Canyon Road generally separates

                                        The General Plan Land Use Plan guides for how land is developed
                                        in the community. Yucaipa’s Land Use Plan includes three related

                                        Allowed Land Uses
                                        The Land Use Plan contains a general description of the allowed
                                        uses of land (referred to as land uses) in the community. Table
                                        CDL-1, Yucaipa Land Use Designations, describes each “land use”
                                        category and the general uses allowed within each category.
                                        Additional descriptions of allowable land uses and the associated
                                        permitting processes (e.g., by-right, conditional, or other) for these
                                        land uses are provided in the municipal code. As projects are
                                        considered and General Plan amendments considered, reference
                                        should be made to Table CDL-1 and the municipal code.
                                        Land Use Map
                                        The table of land use designations is followed by Figure CDL-2,
                                        Land Use Plan. This map illustrates the location of allowed land
                                        uses within Yucaipa. For clarity, the Land Use Plan also shows the
                                        land use designations within specific plan areas. This map is
                                        intended to identify allowed land uses and how they complement
                                        Yucaipa’s community form, as described earlier. However, one
                                        should refer to the specific plans for the Freeway Corridor and
                                        Uptown to understand the allowed uses.
                                        Overlay Districts
                                        In planning for different land uses, certain areas of Yucaipa merit
                                        oversight to address specific concerns. These site-specific concerns
                                        may be due to steep topography, public safety hazards, habitat, or
                                        other issues. In these areas, the General Plan designates parcels
                                        with overlay districts. Projects or land uses within an overlay district
                                        must adhere to specific siting, development, or environmental
                                        regulations in addition to the regulations of the underlying land
                                        use district. Figure CDL-3, Land Use Modification Overlay Districts,
                                        illustrates the location of overlays that apply to this element.

Implications of the Land Use Plan
Yucaipa has significant vacant land available for new housing,
commercial, and industrial uses. To effectively plan for
infrastructure and services for those areas requires calculating the
maximum buildout anticipated under the General Plan. The term
buildout refers to the total amount of development allowed in
Yucaipa along with population, households, and jobs.
Density and Intensity
The buildout anticipated under the general plan is a function of the
acreage of available land and the amount of development allowed
on a property. Density and intensity are quantitative measures for
determining how much development may occur on a property. It
should be noted that not all parcels can accommodate the
maximum density or intensity allowed due to environmental
constraints, development standards, and project design aspects.
Residential Density
For residential land, each parcel has a land use designation that
allows a range of densities (units) per acre. Most parcels cannot be
developed at maximum density due to site characteristics,
infrastructure needs, and development standards. Buildout capacity
is calculated by multiplying the number of units allowed per acre
by the amount of gross acreage. The following graphic illustrates
building arrangements at different densities.
Nonresidential Intensity
For nonresidential land, each parcel has a land use designation that
allows a range of intensities, referred to as floor area ratio (FAR).
FAR is determined by the amount of building square footage
allowed on a site, the area of the parcel covered by a building, and
its height. With these three variables, a 1.0 FAR could range from a
one-story building that covers the entire lot to a four-story building
that covers 25 percent of the lot. Buildout capacity is a function of
the applicable FAR multiplied by developable acreage.
Building Design
Though density and the FAR determine the size of a project, these
standards do not specify the character or appearance of a building.
Different interpretations of the same FAR and/or density can result
in buildings of very different character and appearance. The
municipal code contains other regulations that affect a building’s
form, character, and appearance. These include height limits,
setbacks, open space requirements, and other design elements.
Graphics in the sidebars show a few examples of how buildings
can be configured on a lot based on density and height.

                                         Buildout Capacity
                                         Buildout refers to the total population, jobs, housing, and building
                                         square footage anticipated in a city under its comprehensive
                                         general plan. Buildout capacity is calculated by three factors: 1) the
                                         density and intensity allowed per acre; 2) the number of acres of
                                         land that can be developed; and 3) the increases in population and
                                         employment associated with new development at buildout.
                                         Table CDL-2, Yucaipa Buildout Summary, shows the maximum
                                         number of housing units and nonresidential square footage (e.g.,
                                         square footage for commercial, industrial, and other uses)
                                         assuming every parcel in Yucaipa develops. The table also shows
                                         the maximum number of people and jobs in Yucaipa as of full
                                         buildout. Although buildout is “theoretical”, it provides a baseline
                                         for determining potential impacts to transportation, water,
                                         schools, and other public services so that measures can be
                                         implemented to address impacts.

CITYWIDE DESIGN
Community design is created at multiple levels, with citywide
design features as the first level. Yucaipa’s citywide design
objectives focus on encouraging a sustainable land use pattern,
enhancing community design features, protecting viewsheds and
corridors, and improving the overall image of the community.
Balanced Land Uses
Yucaipa civic leaders have sought to create a land use pattern that
fits together in a coherent manner, fosters a sense of place,
respects the natural environment, and serves community needs.
Noted below, Yucaipa’s land use pattern is designed to serve
immediate community needs and achieve other livability goals.
Land Use Mix
Successful communities require a mix of land uses to support
themselves. This includes residential land for housing, commercial
and industrial land for jobs and services, parks and open spaces for
recreation, and institutional lands for public services and
infrastructure. This balance is not static; it may change over time as
Yucaipa matures, safety hazards are mitigated, the economy
changes, or the needs of the community change. Overlay Districts
provide additional land use guidance where needed.
Community Form
To that end, Yucaipa’s land use plan maintains open space
resources and rural designations along the periphery of the city.
The flatlands at the base of the hills, between the creeks, and along
canyons contain the residential planning areas. Yucaipa’s
development patterns become more concentrated toward the
Central Core and Uptown. A network of parks, trails, and open
spaces connects the many neighborhoods and districts. Overlay
Districts provide additional land use guidance where needed.
Strategic Growth
Yucaipa supports strategic growth to position itself for the future.
Carefully guided growth in areas such as the College Village, the
Uptown, and Freeway Corridor will ensure that the economy
remains strong; jobs are available; public services, facilities, and
infrastructure are available; and new residents can find housing in
neighborhoods. This targeted growth strategy takes advantage of
opportunities without compromising existing quality of life. Overlay
Districts provide additional land use guidance where needed.
Adherence to the following goal and policies furthers a balanced
land use pattern in Yucaipa.

Hillsides and Ridgelines
Yucaipa’s hills and ridgelines provide breathtaking visual backdrops
for the entire community to enjoy. Besides their visual qualities,
Yucaipa’s hillsides provide recreational opportunities, wildlife
habitat, and ecological benefits. Since incorporation, the City has
managed and protected hillsides and ridgelines to preserve and
protect these features that help define the city’s character.
The City recognizes the importance of protecting Yucaipa’s hillsides
and ridgelines, while balancing the interests of property owners.
The disposition of these resources depends on: 1) land ownership;
2) the nature, slope, and prominence of ridgeline/hillsides; and 3)
whether the proposed site is located within an overlay district.
Land Ownership
Since incorporation, Yucaipa has sought to preserve unique
hillsides and ridgelines as undeveloped open space. Over time,
certain hillsides and ridgelines were purchased by a conservancy or
state agency for preservation, while others were preserved in
accordance with local, state, or federal resource agency
requirements. Crafton Hills, Wildwood Canyon State Park, City-       Crafton Hills frames Yucaipa and provides
owned property on Limekiln, and El Dorado Ranch Park fall under      a dramatic backdrop in the community.
these criteria and are protected from development in perpetuity.
The Freeway Corridor Area is not covered by a conservancy.
Prominent Ridgelines
For areas outside conservancy lands, the City Council adopted
Ordinance 81 shortly after incorporation to protect ridgelines.
Although development is not completely prohibited, “no structure
shall be permitted within a 150-foot horizontal distance from the
centerline of prominent ridgelines and no finished pad is allowed
within 50 feet of a ridge’s top elevation.” Prominent ridges are
shown on Figure CDL-4, Hillside Overlay District. The Freeway
Corridor does not include prominent ridgeline protections.
Hillside Overlay
Yucaipa also regulates eligible development in the hillsides through
its hillside/ridgeline development standards in the municipal code.
Regulations apply to all development proposed on properties with      Yucaipa Ridge and the San Gorgonio
slopes that exceed a certain grade. Generally, regulations require    Wilderness overlook the North Bench.
increasingly more acreage dedicated for open space as the slope of
the property increases. The interior of Yucaipa is exempt from these
requirements. Crafton Hills, Yucaipa Hills, and the Freeway Corridor
are within the Hillside Overlay, and thus development in these
areas is subject to overlay regulations.
                                                                        CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 2-19

Community Design Features
Community design entails features that are common throughout
the City, not specific to certain land uses or projects. These
improvements are typically visible along streets, in the public right-
of-way, and other highly visible areas. Landscaping, streetscape,
lighting, signage, and public art are important amenities that can
beautify and strengthen sense of place.
Landscaping
Landscaping enhances aesthetics and functionality of streetscapes,
outdoor spaces, and buildings. Well-maintained and carefully
selected landscaping also furthers environmental goals. Plants
improve the infiltration and filtering of rain and stormwater,
reducing erosion and siltation of water bodies. Yucaipa has chosen
a landscaping palette that is suited to its location in a transition
zone, local conditions (soil and climate), and water availability.
Streetscapes
Streetscapes include a series of decorative features that create a
unifying effect along a road and entice people to stroll or gather.     Landscaping, lighting, signage, and public
These elements include landscaping and street trees, sidewalks,         art improve and beautify Uptown.
benches, public art, lighting, and other features. The level and type
of amenities depend on whether the street functions primarily as a
travel corridor or for other purposes. Yucaipa continues to
implement efforts to beautify streetscapes in Uptown and along
Yucaipa Boulevard, Oak Glen Road, and other key corridors.
Lighting and Signage
Appropriate lighting illuminates streets, business districts, and
parks, contributing to pedestrian and public safety. However, in
some areas, such as the North Bench and Wildwood Canyon areas,
the desire for dark-sky views limits lighting. Like landscaping, clear,
well-designed, and appropriately scaled signage adds character
and visual interest to the community or a particular project, as well
as improving circulation and movement between and within areas.
City lighting and signage regulations provide further guidance.
Public Art
Public art can stimulate creativity, capture the aspirations of the
community, express the City’s heritage, make places more
interesting and attractive, and foster community pride. Yucaipa
continues to support and expand its visual and performing arts,
and this emphasis is expanding to public art. Yucaipa’s Art in Public
Places Program, when implemented, will help to attract new
business development, enhance and beautify the City’s built
environment, and support local and regional artists.

Corridors and Viewsheds
Corridors are the circulation or transportation links of Yucaipa and
are vital to the way people perceive their community. Yucaipa’s
long, straight corridors give motorists views of commercial areas,
neighborhoods, and hillsides. These corridors create edges in
Yucaipa, including the literal edges at the City’s boundaries, edges
between different land uses, and edges between projects. The
quality of corridors leaves a lasting visual impression of the City.
Yucaipa’s major transportation corridors are also scenic corridors.
Bryant Street, Yucaipa Boulevard, Wildwood Canyon Road, Oak
Glen Road, and Live Oak Canyon Road provide scenic views of
hillsides (Crafton Hills, Yucaipa Hills, Yucaipa Ridge), creeks and
channels (e.g., Wilson Creek and Wildwood Creek), and other
natural features. The Freeway Corridor also provides a panoramic
vista through to Live Oak Canyon.
The planning goal is to define the City’s boundaries, gateways, or
entryways and to provide visual links between the community’s
major activity centers and destinations. This element calls for
carefully designed development, coordinated and sustainable
landscaping, pedestrian features, lighting, and other aesthetic
improvements along corridors to link activity centers.

Community Image
When people come to Yucaipa to shop, work, or recreate, they
gather an impression of the community. This impression is shaped
by many features—natural topography, neighborhood quality,
business districts, residents, layout of streets, schools, and public
amenities, among others. Identifying and strengthening these
features help to define and maintain community image.
Yucaipa’s community character is defined by its natural setting. For
casual drivers and Yucaipa residents, their first impression of
Yucaipa is its surrounding natural environment. Crafton Hills,
Yucaipa Hills, and the national forest frame the community.
Canyons and streams etch the landscape. Moreover, the City’s
quiet environment evokes the feel of a foothill community. This
peaceful environment is a draw for residents and visitors.
Yucaipa’s image is also reflected in neighborhoods (North Bench,
Wildwood Canyon, Central Core, Dunlap Acres, and Chapman
Heights), which offer a range of lifestyles. Some neighborhoods are
suburban, while others are rural. Yucaipa’s image is enhanced by
its activity centers—Crafton Hills College, Uptown, parks and
recreational facilities, and other notable gathering places. These
places offer modern amenities in the community.
                                                                      Gateways mark the arrival to neighborhoods
Preserving and enhancing Yucaipa’s community image is essential;      and other places in the community.
it not only increases a sense of pride in residents, but creates a
positive climate for business and makes a positive impression on
visitors. The City can foster a cohesive community identity through
the implementation of strategic design elements. Physical elements
include well-designed gateways at primary entrances to the City.
These gateways define the City and create a sense of arrival.
Code compliance and safety help foster and reinforce a positive
community image and maintain property values. This includes
ensuring that residential neighborhoods are well maintained, that
infrastructure is modern and kept in good working condition, that
streetscapes are well designed and attractive, and that the
community is safe. These are just a few ways that physical elements
can enhance pride in the community and improve property values.
Marketing and media also play an important role in shaping
community image and promoting it to residents, visitors, and
business. As the “Jewel of the Inland Empire,” Yucaipa has a great
story to tell. Through targeted media efforts, Yucaipa can create a
positive impression on those outside the community, correct long-
standing misperceptions of the community, and improve the pride
of residents and business in Yucaipa.

FOCUS AREA GUIDANCE
Community design also occurs at the district/neighborhood level.
While many areas of the community are well established, specific
districts will have a long-term impact on the City’s future—
Uptown, Freeway Corridor Specific Plan, Dunlap Industrial Corridor,
and College Village. The following provides focus area guidance to
support and improve the character and identity of each district.
Historic Uptown
Yucaipa’s original historic Uptown district dates back to the early
1900s, long before Yucaipa’s incorporation. The Uptown is laid out
like a traditional Main Street, with small shops and buildings along
Yucaipa Boulevard, Bryant, and California, and older residential
neighborhoods surrounding the commercial core. The Uptown
contains numerous historic buildings, both residential and
commercial, that lend a historic character to the district. Historic
markers identify buildings dating back to the city’s early days.
The Uptown Business District Specific Plan was originally adopted
in 1995 to provide a long-term design and development strategy
to revitalize Yucaipa’s Uptown. The plan focused on design
guidelines for streetscape, architecture, and development
implementation programs. The goals were to promote economic
vitality, preserve and enhance the historic character, enhance
aesthetics, and improve vehicular circulation. In 2014, the specific
plan was amended to specify design and development regulations.         Yucaipa’s Little Theatre is a long-
                                                                        standing fixture in the Uptown District.
The Uptown Business District continues to transform into a vibrant
mixed-use district. The intent is to provide destination-oriented
activities, festivals, and traditional commercial and residential uses.
Land use regulations and density incentives encourage the
construction of a range of higher density and/or mixed residential.
To create a more vibrant environment, the area is slated for a new
performing arts center, cultural arts, and educational land uses.
The City has also invested significant public funds to transform
Yucaipa Boulevard into a walkable, shopping-oriented experience.
Keys to this transformation include maintenance and rehabilitation
of the Uptown’s physical environment—buildings, streetscapes,
and landscaping (including extension of streetscape improvements
from 2nd Street to 5th Street). The City is laying the groundwork
for increased private investment. Yucaipa’s land use, development,
and regulatory incentives encourage increased private investment.
In additional to physical improvements, the implementation of a
well-defined marketing and special-events strategy is drawing the
types of businesses desired and increasing customers without
                                                                         Quaint streets, sidewalks, and stores
competing with commercial centers elsewhere in Yucaipa.                  are part of the Uptown experience.

Freeway Corridor
The Freeway Corridor is the largest undeveloped area in Yucaipa.
Located along I-10, this 1,242-acre area has unparalleled access,
locally and regionally, to employment centers. Hills, ridgelines, and
canyons offer stunning views, habitat for wildlife, and
opportunities for recreation. Other areas are suitable for residential
developments in highly amenitized neighborhoods. In 2008, the
City Council adopted a specific plan for this area.
As part of the development of the Freeway Corridor Specific Plan,
residents and stakeholders defined key objectives for the plan.
These objectives were: 1) maintain the impression of Yucaipa as a
rural community; 2) ensure that resultant development meets the
needs of City residents and brings in tax revenues; and 3) provide
appropriate land use intensities/densities that lead to economically
viable development opportunities for property owners.
The Freeway Corridor Specific Plan designates this area for new
homes in distinct neighborhoods. These neighborhoods will offer
an array of lifestyles, from rural living in the interior of the area to
suburban settings. Regional commercial uses fronting I-10 are
intended to capture regional sales demand. Along with this
development, maintaining the area’s natural features—its hillsides,
viewsheds, and natural open space—remains a key goal.
Capitalizing on opportunities in the Freeway Corridor will require
major investments in infrastructure. Although impact fees would
ultimately pay for most of the infrastructure costs, making the
upfront investment will require creative approaches, a variety of
funding and financing mechanisms, and public investment. This
will require private-public partnerships and coordination with
property owners, the City, and other stakeholders.

Dunlap Industrial Corridor
The Dunlap Industrial Corridor is located along the north side of
Interstate 10 north of the Oak Glen Road/Live Oak Canyon Road
interchange. This 150-acre industrial and manufacturing district is
home to the majority of industrial and regional commercial
businesses. With convenient access to the I-10 freeway at two
interchanges, the Dunlap Industrial Corridor is well suited to
businesses serving the greater Inland Empire.
The Dunlap Industrial Corridor serves as the gateway to Yucaipa
and defines an image to residents, visitors, businesses, and tourists.
This area is also an important economic engine for the community,
a place for construction- and industrial-based businesses, and of
vital importance to the community’s future. Three objectives are
therefore critical for this area: 1) physical land use mix; 2)
infrastructure upgrades; and 3) aesthetic improvements.
Land Use Mix
Yucaipa’s land use plan allows for industrial, construction-based,
and retail business. Because this industrial area is the only part of
Yucaipa designated for light industrial uses, the General Plan seeks
to preserve this area and maintain its integrity and ability to
accommodate the intended uses. Land use intensity standards and
development procedures are intended to encourage well-designed
projects that support local business. The City continues to make
investments in road and drainage improvements in the Dunlap
Industrial Corridor to support local businesses.
Aesthetic Enhancements
The Dunlap Industrial Corridor is intended to serve business
needs—in particular light manufacturing and compatible uses. At
the same time, additional considerations are involved in freeway-
located development. Billboards, cell towers, and disjointed
freeway land uses can degrade aesthetics and discourage                Sorenson Engineering and many other local
commerce for certain types of businesses. As such, the General         businesses anchor the Dunlap Industrial
                                                                       Corridor area of Yucaipa.
Plan encourages cost-effective aesthetic enhancements along the
roadways and building design features that create a higher quality
environment that supports the local economy.
Environmental Considerations
Dunlap Industrial Corridor’s location near the I-10 freeway provides
excellent access to the region. This locational advantage also brings
with it higher levels of noise, vibration, and air pollution. The City
successfully worked with Caltrans to add a new freeway lane to
reduce traffic congestion and install soundwalls and vegetation to
significantly reduce noise and improve air quality near the freeway.
The City continues to work with property owners and developers to
incorporate building and site design features in new and
rehabilitated industrial projects to address these considerations.
                                                                        CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 2-33

College Village
The College Village Overlay District applies to 50 acres of
undeveloped land adjacent to the Crafton Hills College campus on
the north side of Yucaipa Boulevard between 14th and 16th
Streets. Given the district’s prominent location along Yucaipa
Boulevard, its proximity to I-10, and its connections south to
Dunlap Acres and the industrial corridor, the College Village is well
positioned to capture new development opportunities in the City
and anchor Yucaipa’s western gateway leading to the I-10.
The College Village is envisioned as a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly
mixed-use area that serves the housing and commercial needs of
the college, the community, and the region. Yucaipa encourages
horizontal and vertical integration of compatible uses, connectivity
between the uses with appropriate pedestrian linkages, public
open space, improved mobility options, and high-quality design.
The development code provides guidance on project design.
The General Plan allows significant flexibility in the land use mix,
intensity and density of development, and design standards.
Residential development is intended to provide opportunities for
student housing and housing for veterans and school faculty.
Appropriate commercial uses include shopping, dining, and
professional offices. The College Village may also include related
institutional uses (e.g., innovation center, business incubator, or
satellite campus facilities) that interact synergistically with
educational land uses.
The following goal and policies, along with the City’s development
code, support the long-term objectives for the College Village.

PROJECT LEVEL GUIDANCE
Design quality is an essential component in creating a community
that is attractive for residents, businesses, and visitors. Poor quality
designs inevitably lead to lower values, higher maintenance costs,
and lower quality of life. Adhering to basic design principles
ensures that new and rehabilitated projects earn the greatest
return on investment, make a positive contribution to the
surrounding neighborhood, and stand the test of time.
Project level guidance refers to site design, landscaping, building
design and orientation, architectural details, building materials,
and land use buffers and transitions. Project level guidance is not
intended to impose rigid, costly, or unnecessary regulations.
Rather, it is intended to encourage developer creativity, enhance
property values, and improve aesthetics that add value and
consider adjacent land uses and the City’s natural amenities.
In reviewing plans, the City encourages applicants to adhere to
principles of quality design that are practical and financially
feasible. Projects are evaluated according to some basic principles.
+   Will the project be a good neighbor? Although all
    development projects have some level of impact, new projects
    should strive to improve the surrounding neighborhood or
    commercial area. Its design should minimize impacts to the
    privacy, quiet, and views of neighbors; traffic and safety
    problems; and damage to the natural environment.
+   Does the project exhibit good design? While recognizing the
    limitations of practicality and development feasibility, projects
    should strive to incorporate principles of balance, whether the
    project is residential, commercial, or industrial. The project and
    its individual components should be designed as a whole and
    avoid monotony in form, detail, and siting.
+   Is the project designed to adequately fit its intended use? A
    single-family, multifamily, or other residential development
    should exhibit quality design. Commercial and industrial
    buildings should be designed to support business activities
    without sacrificing basic considerations of aesthetics, scale,
    and compatibility with surrounding and adjacent uses.
+   Does the project make good use of the site? Yucaipa has a
    wide variety of terrains that present challenges and
    opportunities for development. The project should be designed
    to fit the site, rather than substantially altering the site to
    accommodate a “stock” plan. Preserving topography, natural
    grade, vegetation, and natural views should be priorities.
Adherence to the following goal and policies will help improve
project design quality in a cost-effective manner.
                                                                         CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 2-37

                                                     designs to respect the site’s topography and fit into
                                                     the natural contours of the slope, thereby protecting
                                                     views to and from the development.

                                                     characteristics and features of a site, such as
                                                     viewsheds, heritage trees, and rock outcroppings,
                                                     during the design and development of new projects.
                                         CDL-10.4    Design Variation. Encourage identifiable architectural
                                                     designs, design variations, and well-planned projects
                                                     that are visually interesting, neighborhood or district
                                                     oriented, and well integrated with the surroundings.
                                         CDL-10.5    Private Landscaping and Parks. Require developers to
                                                     incorporate appropriately sized and drought-tolerant
                                                     vegetation with sufficient maintenance to provide a
                                                     mature-looking landscape in three-five years after
                                                     installation. Require private recreational facilities in

                                         CDL-10.6    Parking. Design parking lots and structures to be
                                                     functionally and visually integrated and connected
                                                     with the comprehensive project design; off-street
                                                     parking lots should not dominate the street scene.
                                         CDL-10.7    Basins. Design retention/detention basins to be visually
                                                     attractive, with natural landscaping and a public use
                                                     component such as trails, and well integrated with any

                                                                         2. COMMUNITY DESIGN AND LAND USE
Policies: Building Design
CDL-10.9    Building Materials. Use high-quality, natural building
            materials that evoke a sense of quality and
            permanence, such as stucco, plaster, stone, and
            wood; natural colors and textures are preferred.
CDL-10.10 Building Massing. Reduce the bulk and perceived size
            of large buildings by dividing their mass into smaller
            parts, stepping down to adjacent structures, recessing
            openings for doors/windows, and using pedestrian-
            scale features; single-plane massing is discouraged.
CDL-10.11 Building Footprint. Require and enforce appropriate
            residential and nonresidential development standards,
            including adequate building setbacks, to ensure that a
            building’s footprint does not negatively affect adjacent
            uses or the visual quality of the area.
CDL-10.12 Architectural Detail. While recognizing sensitivity to
            budget, require publicly visible sides of a building to
            contain architectural detail and façade articulation,
            strong patterns of shade and shadow, and integrated
            architectural detail; blank walls are discouraged.
CDL-10.13 Sustainable Designs. Designs should incorporate
            sustainability concepts: incorporate measures to wisely
            reduce, conserve, or manage energy and water;
            control off-site drainage; and recycle construction and
            demolition debris as practical and cost-effective.
Policies: Transition and Buffers
CDL-10.14 Lighting. Exterior lighting should be subdued and
            avoid glare for occupants of adjacent properties.
            Lighting should enhance building design, improve
            safety and security, and wisely use energy; lighting
            intensity should be sensitive to surrounding properties
            and other environmental considerations.
CDL-10.15 Landscaping. Implement creative landscape design
            transitions and buffers to create visual interest and
            reduce conflicts between different land uses. Promote
            water conservation with natural landscaping.
CDL-10.16 Building Setbacks. Require setbacks and other design
            elements to buffer residential units to the extent
            possible from the impacts of abutting roadway,
            commercial, rural, and industrial uses.
CDL-10.17 Walls and Fences. Use walls or fences to protect the
            privacy of residential areas; soften appearance of walls
            by varying alignment, adding landscaping and/or
            berms, and using surface detailing and natural
            materials.
                                                                     CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 2-39

2. COMMUNITY DESIGN AND LAND USE
                                         Preservation, Reuse, and Revitalization
                                         Since incorporation, the City has sought to maintain a well-
                                         designed land use plan and community form. Civic leaders have
                                         sought to preserve rural areas, expand parks and open spaces,
                                         protect neighborhoods, and support industry and commerce.
                                         However, civic leaders also recognize the importance of remaining
                                         open to emerging opportunities. Because of this, the City supports
                                         reuse and revitalization efforts that offer significant community
                                         benefits—economic, aesthetic, and public safety.
                                         Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Properties
                                         As Yucaipa matures, opportunities for property improvements will
                                         arise that benefit the community. For instance, removal of
                                         properties from the Wilson Creek and Wildwood Creek floodplains
                                         and the extension of utilities will allow the improvement of parcels
                                         without costly flood insurance or significant fees. In other cases,
                                         Yucaipa’s housing stock and neighborhoods will benefit from
                                         increased levels of repair, improvement, and rehabilitation. Yucaipa
                                         encourages and supports these types of investments.
                                         Yucaipa’s commercial and industrial areas offer additional
                                         opportunities for transition to more productive uses that provide
                                         employment opportunities and meet the needs of residents and
                                         business. Among others, these areas could include Dunlap
                                         Industrial Corridor, Freeway Corridor Specific Plan, and College
                                         Village. Changes in land uses that strengthen the economy with
                                         jobs and revenue-generating commercial and industrial businesses
                                         that support the economy are encouraged.
                                         Yucaipa has established Land Use Modification Overlay Districts
                                         that identify areas that are intended for preservation, regulation, or
                                         transition depending on the use and associated municipal codes.
                                         Specific Plan and Overlay District areas (e.g., Uptown Business
                                         District, Wilson Creek Innovation Center, Freeway Corridor, College
                                         Overlay, etc.) are areas slated for development in the future. In
                                         other cases, the Land Use Modification Overlay District establishes
                                         minimum development or design standards (e.g., Custom Home
                                         Overlay) for regulating future projects within an overlay.
                                         Mobile home Parks
                                         Other opportunities for property improvement will arise over time.
                                         As Yucaipa began to develop in the 1950s, the City established one
                                         of the largest inventories of mobile home parks in the county. The
                                         majority of mobile home parks are in good condition and are
                                         preserved through existing mobile home park overlay designations.
                                         In other cases, several lack modern amenities, require
                                         rehabilitation, and pose safety and code enforcement concerns. As
                                         appropriate, these properties could be considered for transition to
                                         other uses provided statutory requirements are followed.
     2-40 | CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN

                                                                          2. COMMUNITY DESIGN AND LAND USE
To that end, the City has established three mobile home park
overlays (MHP) to encourage the preservation and/or transition of
properties depending on their current and future status:
+    MHP1: includes all mobile-home parks in Yucaipa, including
     family and senior-restricted parks
+    MHP2: includes mobile home parks restricted for affordable
     housing and senior occupancy and protected from transition
+    MHP3: includes properties eligible for transition to other land
     uses provided applicable local, State, and Federal regulations
     are adhered to
In facilitating property reuse and investments, careful planning and
attention to design is warranted. New development is to be
compatible with the character of stable commercial or residential
neighborhoods. Where it benefits the community, the City
encourages appropriate land use changes and development that
incorporates well-designed transitions between land uses and
properties. Where necessary to achieve minimum district sizes (e.g.,
10 acres), the City also encourages assemblage of properties.
The following goal and policies provide guidance for how to be
responsive to opportunities for land use change.
GOAL CDL-11: PRESERVATION AND REUSE
Revitalization, reuse of structures, and transition of
land uses where appropriate to materially improve
structures and the visual quality in Yucaipa.
Policies
CDL-11.1       Community Preservation. Encourage the rehabilitation
               of neighborhoods and commercial and industrial
               areas, and the application of code compliance efforts
               where needed to preserve and maintain community
               quality of life.
CDL-11.2       Land Use Change. Where opportunities for land use
               changes arise, seek input from property owners, the
               surrounding neighborhood or district, and other
               stakeholders during the consideration process so as to
               determine appropriateness or inform strategies.
CDL-11.3       Project Compatibility. Strive to ensure appropriate
               transitions in scale, density, and intensity between
               residential and nonresidential uses; between adjacent
               residences or uses within a defined neighborhood; and
               within areas of different densities.
                                                                      CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 2-41
2. COMMUNITY DESIGN AND LAND USE
                                         CDL-11.4 Reuse of Underutilized Land. Encourage the transition
                                                  of underutilized land uses, projects in significant
                                                  disrepair, or marginal uses to other uses offering
                                                  greater community benefits, provided that appropriate
                                                  transitions and design treatments are incorporated.
                                         CDL-11.5 Mobile Home Park Transition. The City will complete a
                                                  study evaluating the potential reuse of certain mobile
                                                  home parks, removal of the mobile home park overlay,
                                                  and/or transition to other land uses; and establish
                                                  standards to guide consideration of park reuse
                                                  requests through a closure mitigation ordinance or
                                                  other regulations.
                                                  Provisions for potential mobile home park reuse shall

INTRODUCTION
Since incorporation nearly 25 years ago, Yucaipa has become one
of the most desirable communities in the Inland Empire. In             In This Element:
addition to the many amenities offered, Yucaipa is known for its
                                                                         + Neighborhood Quality
quality housing, neighborhoods, and amenities. Housing choices,
the affordability of housing to residents of all ages, and quality       + Housing Sites
neighborhoods draw residents to live in Yucaipa. The housing             + Housing Design
element is about how Yucaipa maintains the quality and availability      + Housing Choices
of its housing stock and neighborhoods for its residents.
                                                                         + Housing Assistance
Perhaps more than other elements of the General Plan, a housing          + Housing Programs
element is immersed in detailed legal requirements. Due to the
persistent statewide shortage of housing, state law requires
periodic updates to housing elements. This housing element covers
the planning period of 2014–2021, and subsequent updates will
be required. A housing element is required to address the
production, maintenance, and improvement of housing for all
income levels of current and future residents.
The Housing and Neighborhoods Element is Yucaipa’s plan for
accommodating current and future housing needs of residents and
providing quality neighborhoods for residents to invest in. By
providing quality housing opportunities for Yucaipa’s growing
population; strengthening its neighborhoods with public services
and facilities; and assisting residents, the workforce, and seniors in
meeting housing needs, Yucaipa will continue to be one of the
more sought-after communities in southern California.
                                                                            CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 3-1

                                        Related Plans
                                        The Housing and Neighborhoods Element sets goals and policies
                                        that are intended to facilitate the construction, improvement, and
                                        maintenance of housing and neighborhoods that provide
      General Plan vision themes        opportunities for residents of all incomes in Yucaipa.
           in this element include:
                                        The housing element is associated to related planning efforts:
                  “Small-Town Rural
                                          + Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). The RHNA is a

                     public facilities”      focus areas are detailed in the Uptown Specific Plan, College
                                             Overlay District, and Freeway Corridor Specific Plan. These
                                             plans supplement the housing discussion herein.
                                          + Infrastructure Master Plans. Water cost and availability is a key
                                             issue affecting housing in Yucaipa. The Yucaipa Valley Water
                                             District prepares an urban water management plan to ensure
                                             that adequate water is available for future development.
                                        Organization of Element
                                        State law prescribes the content of a housing element. For this
                                        General Plan, the housing element consists of three related plans—
                                        the housing plan, the housing technical report (appendix to the
                                        General Plan), and the implementation plan.
                                          + Housing Plan. The housing plan presents the general context
                                             of issues important to Yucaipa, followed by specific goals,
                                             policies, and implementation programs that address the
                                             development, improvement, and conservation of housing.
                                          + Technical Report. The technical report provides the foundation
                                             for the goals, policies, and programs. It encompasses a
                                             housing needs assessment, constraints analysis, inventory of
                                             housing sites, and evaluation of programs. The technical report
                                             is adopted as an appendix to the housing element.
                                          + Implementation Plan. Unlike other elements of the General
                                             Plan, the housing implementation plan must also be adopted.
                                             Therefore, the specific programs designed to further housing
                                             goals and policies are part of the element itself.
                                        The following sections provide context for each topic addressed in
                                        this element, followed by goals and policies to achieve the General

Yucaipa’s neighborhoods offer a mix of rural and suburban
lifestyles. Each neighborhood has a defined identity based on its
topography, history, lot sizes, and built environment. Combined
with appropriate attention to public facilities, infrastructure, and
public safety efforts, Yucaipa provides a quality living environment.

of Stanley Ranch, Rolling Hills, and areas north of Oak Glen Road.
The North Bench is defined by its unique natural environment.
Framed by the Crafton Hills and situated on an alluvial plain, the
North Bench offers panoramic views of the valley floor. The area
offers predominantly rural living, with ½- to 1-acre lots, limited
agriculture, and equestrian uses. The custom home overlay district
covers the North Bench and requires larger homes.

                                        Dunlap Acres has a rich history dating back to the Serrano Indians
                                        and the later settlers who ranched in the area. The Dunlap area is

                                                                              3. HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS
Neighborhood Amenities
Yucaipa’s residential neighborhoods are highly amenitized.
Standard amenities include public facilities, parks, infrastructure,
public safety programs, and housing improvement programs.
These facilities and programs, individually and collectively, are all
essential to maintaining the quality of life in neighborhoods.
Public Facilities and Infrastructure
In providing public facilities and infrastructure, the City employs a
tailored approach for neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods have
more extensive infrastructure—including streets, sidewalks, parks,
and trees. In areas like North Bench and Wildwood Canyon,
residents value a more undeveloped state with less infrastructure.
Capital improvement plans establish the appropriate level of
infrastructure based on need and preferences.
Safe Neighborhoods
City staff continually work to maintain Yucaipa’s status as one of
the safest communities in San Bernardino County. Traffic safety is a
high priority for streets on which residents walk to school, parks, or
elsewhere. For certain neighborhoods, efforts focus on installing
sidewalks and crosswalks or providing safe routes to school. In
other cases, traffic management improvements (e.g., signage,
                                                                         Sidewalk repairs improve the safety
speed humps, signals, and lighting) are used to calm traffic.
                                                                           and livability of neighborhoods.
The Development Services Department, Community Development
Department, and Police Department implement a variety of
municipal codes and programs to ensure the health, safety, and
welfare of residents. Notable programs include crime-free multiple-
family housing inspections, abandoned vehicle abatement, building
and land use regulations, graffiti abatement, noise regulations, and
others. These efforts allow Yucaipans to enjoy the peaceful setting
of their residential neighborhoods.
Housing Preservation
Quality housing maintains property values, protects residents from
health hazards, and improves the image of Yucaipa. This requires
code compliance and periodic housing repair and rehabilitation.
Yucaipa has long supported the preservation of mobile homes by

ensure that land is adequately designated for residential uses and
that infrastructure will be made available to support new housing.

Yucaipa’s housing production goal is 1,605 units (see Table HN-1).
These production goals include targets for affordability levels. The
price and rents for housing are approximate and are adjusted for a
household with four people. Broadly speaking, the City’s strategy is
to facilitate the construction of rental apartment projects for lower
income households, while the housing “market” provides for the
needs of moderate and above moderate income housing.

                                        due to higher density land use designations. Housing units are
                                        anticipated to be accommodated on vacant RM-7200–designated
                                        parcels, with potentially higher densities in the Uptown District.
                                        Central Yucaipa will offer moderately priced housing opportunities.
                                        Gradual buildout within the Central Core will take advantage of
                                        transportation infrastructure, help revitalize parts of the Central
                                        Yucaipa Core, and support economic activity in Uptown.

                                        Dunlap Acres is projected to accommodate a small percentage of
                                        the projected housing growth over the life of the General Plan. The
                                        growth is projected on vacant residential lots—due to many parcels
                                        being removed from the flood zone designation—and in the

                                        continue to encourage the construction of additional water, sewer,
                                        and other infrastructure in this area to accommodate the
                                        development of housing consistent with the General Plan.

Affordable Housing Strategy
Yucaipa has redesignated several areas for higher density multiple-
family housing to accommodate affordability goals in the 2014–
2021 Regional Housing Needs Allocation. These areas are at the
intersection of Oak Glen Road and Colorado Street, the Freeway
Corridor Specific Plan, and the College Village.
Freeway Corridor Specific Plan
The first site for higher density, multiple-family housing is three
parcels within the Freeway Corridor Specific Plan. No site plans
have been considered, submitted, or approved to date. In 2009,
the City Council adopted an R-24 land use district for 40 acres,
allowing a density of 20 to 24 housing units per acre. This site
could accommodate 800 to 1,000 new multiple-family residential
units. Additional detail on the mix of land uses, neighborhoods,
and housing is available in the Freeway Corridor Specific Plan.
Oak Glen Road and Colorado Street
The second site for higher density, multiple-family housing is at the
northeast corner of Oak Glen Road and Colorado Street. No site
plans have been considered, submitted, or approved to date. In
2009, the City Council adopted an RM-24 land use district for this
20-acre site, allowing a density of 20 to 24 units per acre. This site
could accommodate 400 to 500 new multiple-family residential
units. Additional detail on the mix of land uses, neighborhoods,
and housing can be found in the housing technical report.
College Village
The College Village covers approximately 50 acres directly below
the college on the north side of Yucaipa Boulevard. This area is
slated for up to 400 housing units for students, faculty, and
veteran-students and retail/commercial uses that anchor Yucaipa’s
Gateway District and support adjacent land uses (e.g., Yucaipa
High School, commercial and industrial areas). The General Plan
allows for significant flexibility in the land use mix, intensity and
density of development, and design standards.
Specific Affordable Projects
Urban Housing Communities developed a 50-unit affordable
apartment project at 12279 3rd Street in Central Yucaipa. Located
in the RM land use district, the project received a 100 percent
density bonus for affordable senior housing. The project is entitled
on a 4.8-acre site at a density of 16 units per acre. Project funding
includes a HOME loan, low income housing tax credits, deferral of
impact fees, and other funds. Occupancy is restricted to very low
income seniors. The San Bernardino County Housing Authority
guarantees the availability of project-based vouchers for 30 years.

                                                                               3. HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS
HOUSING DESIGN
With the appropriate sites identified for housing, ensuring quality
housing is essential. This includes aesthetics, site design, life-cycle
costs, and the adaptability of housing for its occupants. As
described below, Yucaipa strives to balance adherence to municipal
codes, more-subjective design standards, cost considerations, and
affordability to encourage new products of lasting value.
Design Guidelines
Residential design includes not only the aesthetics of the building,
but its layout, orientation, quality of materials, landscaping, and
other features that contribute to the livability of the home. When
practical, housing should incorporate sustainable “green” practices
(including energy and water conservation) in its design, site
planning, and construction. For larger tracts, housing products
must be electric-vehicle and solar-panel ready. Finally, the City
encourages new housing to include design features that improve
accessibility for people of all abilities and ages.
Environmental Concerns
Yucaipans enjoy the natural setting of their community. At the
same time, Yucaipa’s natural features present challenges. Hillsides,
floodplains, biological resources, and geologic hazards affect all
residential development projects in some way. In addition, the
provision of water and sewer infrastructure is critical. The municipal
code contains overlay districts that provide guidance on how to
address environmental concerns. As described below, for
developments proposed within overlay districts, special studies are
required to identify concerns up front so that appropriate
mitigations can be addressed during the project review process.
Regulatory Framework
City codes provide a basic regulatory framework, but regulations
cannot address every situation. To facilitate the type of
development desired and realize the greatest community benefits,
Yucaipa’s regulatory framework is flexible and incentive based.
Tools such as planned developments, specific plans, minor
variances, and density bonuses allow flexibility when appropriate.
City staff strives to provide thorough reviews in a timely manner.
Finally, incentives are provided to stimulate desired development
and realize the community benefits that improve quality of life.
Adherence to the following policies will ensure that new housing
projects will be appropriately sited, affordable to different income
levels, and designed consistent with community expectations.
                                                                        CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 3-11

HOUSING CHOICES
Yucaipa provides a variety of housing products and prices in
different neighborhood settings. This diversity of housing helps to
meet the needs of residents seeking a range of housing types, such
as apartments, townhomes, affordable condominiums, single-
family homes, senior housing, or other accommodations.
Family Housing
Although Yucaipa began as a predominantly senior community,
the City has experienced significant growth in younger families.
Yucaipa’s largest growing segment continues to be family
households, including families with children, couples, and
individuals who have entered the workforce. Projections indicate a
continued increase in family households, balanced somewhat by
the increase in seniors as current residents age.
Yucaipa offers families a wide variety of single-and multiple-family
housing options for different lifestyles and incomes. Many planned
residential developments (e.g., Chapman Heights) and future
development areas (e.g., Freeway Corridor Specific Plan) are
targeted for Yucaipa’s family households. Condominiums and
apartments are also being built in Central Yucaipa, in close
proximity to shopping, the Uptown, and other local amenities.           Chapman Heights and other subdivisions
                                                                          provide family housing opportunities.
College Faculty, Staff, and Students
Yucaipa is home to Crafton Hills College, one of California’s more
than 100 community colleges. Crafton Hills College has an
estimated 5,000 students and an estimated 500 faculty,
administrators, and other support staff—making it the largest
employer in the city. As the college expands, student enrollment is
expected to increase to approximately 11,500 students by 2025,
which is also expected to increase the demand for additional
housing in the City.
The demand for college-related housing depends on the number of
students living independently, faculty, and the desire to live close
to the college. Surveys show that one of four CHC students live on
their own, though data are not available on where they live.
However, given the very few apartments in Yucaipa, many students
probably live in surrounding cities. No information is readily
available on where college faculty and staff reside.
The City of Yucaipa is working to prepare a College Village Overlay
District that will support education, retail, and commercial uses.
Although the precise housing types, configuration, and occupancy
are still not determined, the intent is to provide housing
opportunities that will attract additional faculty and prospective
students to teach and/or enroll at Crafton Hills College and four-
year educational institutions in Yucaipa.
                                                                     CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 3-13

3. HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS
                                         Senior Housing
                                         Yucaipa continues to have a stable senior population that has
                                         averaged around 7,000 over the past few decades. Although the
                                         past decades have also seen an influx of younger families, a strong
                                         demand remains for housing that can accommodate seniors of all
                                         ages. This includes single-family housing, multiple-family housing
                                         (condominiums), apartments, and mobile homes. Retirement
                                         facilities also help to serve the needs of Yucaipa seniors.
                                         Seniors have special housing needs. Commonly cited needs include
                                         property maintenance and repair—exterior and interior.
                                         Maintaining accessibility, a greater need for older residents, can be
                                         addressed with the installation of a range of accessibility features.
                                         Finally, rental assistance (e.g., housing vouchers) is useful for
                                         enabling seniors to afford apartments, reducing the severity of
                                         overpaying for housing and allowing them to be self-sufficient.
   Golden Oaks provides retirement
   options in independent housing.       Yucaipa offers a range of senior housing. Twenty-one mobile home
                                         parks (many of them under rent stabilization) are reserved for
                                         seniors. In 2012, the City used redevelopment funds and mortgage
                                         revenue bonds to refinance two parks (290 units) and deed restrict
                                         them as affordable to lower income seniors until 2050. The City’s
                                         four other senior projects provide affordable apartments for more
                                         than 200 senior households earning lower incomes.
                                         Housing for People with Disabilities
                                         At some point, most Yucaipa residents will experience a disability.
                                         These include physical, mobility, vision, hearing, and age-related
                                         disabilities. The Census Bureau reports that more than 6,500
                                         Yucaipa residents (13 percent) have a disability. These include
                                         physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities that impair or
                                         substantially limit life activities. Because of that, disabled persons
                                         have special needs for more accessible or service-enriched housing.
                                         Providing quality housing for disabled people is a challenge. Most
                                         single-family homes are inaccessible to people with mobility
                                         limitations. Housing units may need to have wider doorways and
                                         hallways, access ramps, larger bathrooms with grab bars, lowered
                                         countertops, and other features common to “barrier-free” housing.
                                         Location is also important for disabled people who rely on public
                                         transit to travel to services like grocers or medical offices.
                                         Yucaipa is home to more than 30 residential care facilities (e.g.,
                                         group housing) for adults requiring assisted living. These are
                                         typically retirement homes (e.g., Golden Oaks) or assisted care
                                         facilities (e.g., Wildwood Canyon Villa). San Bernardino County has
                                         a network of service providers to address the needs of disabled
                                         people. The Inland Regional Center provides assistance to the
                                         developmentally disabled population. Veterans of Foreign War,
                                         Homes for Our Troops, and other groups are also active.

Emergency Housing Needs
Homelessness is a pressing issue for many cities, and the varied
dimensions involved have implications for housing programs.
Recent state law has attempted to address this need by requiring
all communities to allow for housing accommodations suited to
the needs of people who lack housing. This includes emergency
shelters, transitional housing, and permanent supportive housing.
The housing element implementation program proposes code
amendments to achieve compliance with changes in state law.
Obtaining an accurate count of homeless people is difficult due to
their transient nature, different definitions of homelessness, and
political and funding issues. The 2015 San Bernardino County
Homeless Census identified 2,140 persons living on the streets or in
facilities that serve homeless persons in the county. This same
count identified only 9 homeless people who are living in Yucaipa
or reported their last known address in Yucaipa. This count appears
reasonable based on police department estimates.
The San Bernardino County Homeless Partnership is a multiagency
effort to implement the county’s 10-year Strategy to End Chronic
Homelessness. Strategies include homeless prevention, outreach
and assessment, emergency shelters, transitional housing, support
services, permanent supportive housing, and permanent housing.
Locally, Interfaith Community Support of Yucaipa Valley (a
nonprofit, multichurch-sponsored ministry) distributes food to the
needy and provides essential resources to promote self-sufficiency.
Farmworker Housing
Agricultural operations in Yucaipa consist of two chicken ranches, a
small Christmas tree farm, and a seasonal pumpkin patch. A small
winery is in the foothills. Grazing is permitted in open space areas
but the cattle are brought in from outside the City. The chicken
ranches employ 100 workers. Other than these nonconforming
uses, the City no longer has agricultural land use districts that
would permit active row crops, ranching, or farming.
With respect to housing need, livestock operations, including
poultry, are year-round enterprises that do not require migrant or
seasonal labor. Should farmworker housing be needed, Yucaipa
allows caretaker and labor quarters as an accessory use to a
primary agricultural, commercial, industrial, or institutional use.
Given Yucaipa’s nominal farmworker labor force, their housing
needs can be addressed through City housing programs.
Implementation of the following goal and policies will expand
housing for residents needing a variety of accommodations.
                                                                     CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 3-15

HOUSING ASSISTANCE
Yucaipa is home to people with a variety of housing needs. This
includes those seeking apartments, first-time homeownership
options, and special needs housing. Yucaipa recognizes the varied
housing needs of its residents and seeks to assist, wherever feasible
and practical, in the provision of housing opportunities that can
address the needs of its residents and workforce.
Market Rate Housing
Yucaipa recognizes that homeownership offers many individual
and community benefits. It brings independence and freedom, the
opportunity to build wealth and economic stability, and greater
personal safety and security for families. Community involvement
and volunteerism are also known to improve when one benefits
from stable homeownership. Moreover, quality housing is known
to improve the academic performance of children and youth.
Therefore, the City continues to dedicate a significant amount of its
land resources for expanding opportunities to purchase a home.
Although Yucaipa’s housing stock is predominantly single-family,
opportunities exist to find suitable apartment living. Future sites for
multiple-family housing include the College Overlay, Freeway
Corridor Specific Plan, and infill locations throughout Yucaipa.
These RM–land use designated areas are intended to provide
opportunity for a greater range of residential densities to facilitate
the development of apartments and townhomes in appropriate
locations where infrastructure and services can be provided.
Preservation of Affordable Rental Housing
                                                                           Affordable rental housing projects
Through public financing, Yucaipa has a substantial stock of
affordable housing. These include projects financed through local,
state, or federal funding or projects that currently have limitations
on sales prices or rents. Yucaipa’s affordable housing includes:
  + Five senior apartment projects provide 217 units of housing
     deed restricted as affordable to lower income seniors.
  + Five family apartment houses and duplexes provide 70 units
     deed restricted as affordable to lower income families.
  + Two senior and two family mobile home parks offer 500 units
     of affordable, deed-restricted units for low income residents.
  + Several dozen additional mobile home parks provide an
     additional 3,500 units, the majority under rent stabilization.
The City supports the preservation of long-term affordability
covenants on its stock of affordable housing where feasible.
Policies geared toward that goal follow.
                                                                        CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 3-17

HOUSING PROGRAMS
Yucaipa will implement the following programs to achieve the
goals, policies, and objectives in the 2014–2021 Housing Element.
As required by state law, Table HN-2 provides a summary of the
objectives, timeframes, and other implementation measures.
1. Code Enforcement Program
The City code enforcement program is responsible for ensuring
compliance with municipal codes to maintain the value and safety
of property and structures and protect the health, safety, and
welfare of residents. The program addresses overgrown vegetation,
substandard buildings, accumulation of debris and vehicles, yard
sales, graffiti, storm water drainage, green pools, unpermitted
construction, land use violations, and other health and safety
codes. City officers work with residents and businesses to remedy
code violations in a timely manner.
Objective: Continue to implement a broad code enforcement
program for residential, commercial, and other land uses to ensure
compliance with City ordinances.
2. Building Inspection Program
City building officials are responsible for inspecting housing to
ensure the health and safety of occupants. For a nominal fee, a City
building inspector will conduct a field investigation to determine
the physical condition of multiple-family properties at the request
of interested buyers. The City also inspects mobile homes at least
once every seven years (required under the Mobile home Parks Act
and Special Occupancy Parks Act). In accordance with the
Department of Housing and Community Development, these
inspections focus primarily on serious code violations.
Objective: Inspect mobile home parks every seven years and other
multiple-family projects at the request of potential buyers.
3. Single-Family Home Repair
Maintaining the quality of single-family residences prevents blight
and maintains property values. As a member of the county CDBG
consortium, the City has historically offered funds to repair single-
family homes. The county offered eligible homeowners HOME and
CDBG funding. In 2012, both programs were significantly curtailed
due to CDBG cutbacks, effectively eliminating this program. Until
funding is restored or an alternative to redevelopment financing is
developed, the City will seek funding opportunities. This may
include working with Habitat for Humanity or other nonprofit
organizations to secure funding for single-family home programs.
Objective: Seek funding to restore the housing program for the
repair, maintenance, and rehabilitation of single-family homes.
                                                                      CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 3-19

3. HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS
                                         4. Multiple-Family Housing Repair
                                         Historically, the City participated in the county’s Multifamily
                                         Residential Rental Housing Revenue Bond Program that provides
                                         funding for new construction, acquisition, and/or rehabilitation of
                                         multifamily housing. To qualify for funding, a specified number of
                                         units are required to remain affordable to eligible, low-income
                                         households for a specified number of years. In past years, the grant
                                         focused on existing projects. The County is now concentrating its
                                         efforts on the construction of new projects or the rehabilitation
                                         and deed restriction of existing projects. This program has not been
                                         widely used in Yucaipa for its public housing stock, and the
                                         availability of future county funds is unlikely in the future.
                                         Objective: Seek funding to restore a program to fund the repair,
                                         maintenance, and rehabilitation of multifamily homes.
                                         5. Crime-Free Multifamily Housing
                                         Yucaipa recognizes that providing housing safe from crime and
                                         blight protects the health, safety, and welfare of all residents. The
                                         City’s voluntary Crime Free Multiple-Family Rental Housing Program
                                         is a key crime prevention program on rental properties. All
                                         applicable projects are enrolled as a condition of a business license.
                                         The program includes training seminars for the property managers
                                         and a requirement that each new lease or rental agreement
                                         contain a “crime free” addendum that enables the property
                                         owner/manager to evict people engaged in criminal activity. This
                                         program continues to maintain the quality of life in Yucaipa.
                                         Objective: Continue implementation of the program as a
                                         precondition for receiving a business license in the City.
                                         6. Mobile Home Parks
                                         Yucaipa adopted its Mobile Home Rent Stabilization Ordinance in
                                         1991 to establish a comprehensive strategy for regulating space
                                         rents in mobile home parks and preserving affordable housing.
                                         Under the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, mobile home park spaces
                                         are rent restricted, and rent increases are limited after a vacancy.
                                         Some spaces are under long-term leases and exempt from rent
                                         control. The City also established an overlay district that protects
                                         mobile home parks as the primary permitted land use. While these
                                         codes have preserved mobile home parks, certain older parks have
                                         deteriorated to the point that rehabilitation is no longer feasible. In
                                         these cases, exploring opportunities for reuse is warranted. Yucaipa
                                         will explore opportunities for reusing dilapidated mobile home
                                         parks where situations warrant and are feasible.
                                         Objective: Regulate mobile home rents as permitted under state
                                         law and the Mobile Home Overlay District; consider reuse options
                                         for severely dilapidated mobile home parks.

7. Uptown Specific Plan
The Uptown Business District Specific Plan encompasses 16 city
blocks of small, neighborhood-serving commercial business and
many older homes on substandard lots. One of the key plan
objectives is a mix of viable commercial and residential land uses.
To promote a “downtown,” mixed-use character, the plan strongly
encourages senior housing and mixed-use developments, and it
offers by-right 100 percent density bonus to 16 units per acre as a
means to facilitate revitalization. Additional incentives are offered
through a development reserve. The City has been successful in
attracting a new senior project, completing street improvements,
and installing pedestrian amenities within the plan area.
Objective: Provide opportunities for infill housing and facilitate the
development of 50 units. Amend specific plan to increase density
potentially to 24 units per acre where feasible.
8. Freeway Corridor Specific Plan
The 1,242‐acre Freeway Corridor Specific Plan will provide a
regionally significant commercial center, 2,400 residential units,
and 550+ acres of open space, schools, and other amenities. To
address the RHNA, the City Council adopted the R-24 land use
district, allowing multiple-family housing as a by-right use on 40
acres. For the R-24 land use district, the plan allows a density of 20
to 24 units per acre, which yields a development capacity of 800
units. This site is intended to address the unmet regional housing
needs allocation. This assumes a minimum density of 20 units is
achieved. Greater density is possible under state density bonus law.
Objective: Implement, revisit and revise, as needed, the Freeway
Corridor Specific Plan and work with property owners to encourage
the development of the property.
9. Housing Incentives (Density Bonus Program)
Ordinance 297 allows developers to receive a density bonus for
qualified affordable projects and to request concessions (e.g.,
parking, development standards, and financial incentives, etc.) to
make the project financially feasible. The City waives developer fees
for the deed-restricted affordable bonus units. Senior housing and
multiple-family housing projects in Uptown can also receive a 100
percent density bonus (an increase from 8 to 16 units per acre). As
a financial incentive for affordable housing under density bonus
law, eligible impact fees could also be waived or deferred. The City
has used this program for senior affordable housing projects.
Objective: Continue to implement and monitor the housing
incentives (density bonus) program. Encourage noncity utilities to
provide financial incentives for affordable housing projects.
                                                                       CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 3-21

                                         10. Minor Variance Program
                                         The minor variance program is intended to ensure that any
                                         property, because of special circumstances (e.g., size, shape,
                                         topography, location, or surroundings), is allowed privileges of
                                         other properties in the same vicinity. To administer this process, the
                                         City may approve requests for minor variances. General items
                                         include: 1) up to 20 percent of minimum floor width of single
                                         residential design; 2) up to 30 percent of parking requirements,
                                         not to exceed two spaces, 3) 30 to 40 percent of front, side, and
                                         rear yard setbacks subject to conditions; and 4) up to 50 percent of
                                         maximum gross floor area requirements.
                                         Objective: Continue to implement the minor variance program and
                                         seek opportunities to facilitate housing production.
                                         11. Government Constraints
                                         State law regulates community care facilities, housing for
                                         employees, and other similar uses that serve six or fewer persons.
                                         Such uses shall be: 1) defined consistently with state law; 2) treated
                                         the same as a residential use, 3) allowed by right in all residential
                                         zones, and 4) subjected to the same fees, taxes, and permits as
                                         other residential uses in the same zone. In this regard, the
                                         municipal code must be updated to comply with state law. The
                                         social care facilities land use should be updated to reflect the
                                         definition of residential care facilities in state law. Similarly,
                                         definitions for caretaker and labor quarters should be updated to
                                         be consistent with Section 17021 of the Health and Safety Code.
                                         Objective: Revise definitions and permit process for social care
                                         facilities, farm labor quarters, and other uses to achieve consistency
                                         with state law.
                                         12. Residential Design Standards
                                         The municipal code provides design standards for mobile homes,
                                         planned developments, high density multiple-family housing, social
                                         care facilities, and other specific uses. Most of the design standards
                                         are related to permitted land use, density, structure size, parking,
                                         heights, and other, similar development standards. In contrast,
                                         minimal design standards regulate single-family housing, the
                                         predominant development pattern in Yucaipa. Carefully chosen
                                         design guidelines can address community concerns—including
                                         mansionization, incompatible development, right to privacy, and
                                         aesthetic concerns. As with all regulations, the challenge is
                                         adopting guidelines that add and maintain long-term property
                                         values without unduly impeding new development.
                                         Objective: Consider development and adoption of design standards
                                         for single-family homes that are feasible, not cost prohibitive, and
                                         improve the value of properties and neighborhoods.

13. Planned Development
The PD process is intended to facilitate the development of
properties, including housing, where greater flexibility in design is
desired to provide a more efficient use of land than would be
possible through strict application of land use district regulations.
This process is also intended to serve as an alternative site planning
process that encourages more creative and imaginative planning of
mixed use, multiphased residential, commercial, or industrial
developments within the framework of a single cohesive plan. This
tool has been used to facilitate the Chapman Heights project and
other smaller infill residential projects as the need arises.
Objective: Offer the planned development permit process, where
appropriate, to facilitate residential projects that further City goals.
14. Assistance to Lower Income Housing
Yucaipa offers incentives to accommodate affordable housing.
Housing Program 12 offers a density bonus program that allows
progressively higher densities for affordable housing projects. The
City seeks grant funding, such as the MHSA program used for
senior housing, to finance affordable housing for extremely low
and very low income seniors. Developers may also request minor
variances (Program 10) to modify most development standards.
Finally, the City allows certain fees to be deferred until occupancy,
making it more feasible for developers to obtain housing loans.
These tools encourage the construction of housing affordable to
extremely low, very low, and lower income households.
Objective: Offer density bonuses, expedited permitting, and
financial and regulatory incentives for affordable housing,
including extremely low income housing. Encourage noncity
utilities to offer financial incentives for affordable housing.
15. Energy Conservation
Yucaipa recognizes the importance of encouraging energy
conservation and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to achieve
local and statewide goals. To that end, the City requires residential
developers to adhere to the latest Green Building Code with 20
percent reductions in indoor water use, 50 percent diversion of
construction waste, achievement of California Energy Standards,
and other standards. The General Plan EIR contains mitigation
measures that further greenhouse gas emission (GHC) reductions.
The City’s Climate Action Plan, along with city regulations, also
requires residential projects to incorporate other measures as
appropriate (e.g., solar-panel and electrical-vehicle ready)
Objective: Require adherence to the latest Green Building Code and
other cost-effective practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
and responsibly conserve resources.
                                                                         CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 3-23

3. HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS
                                         16. Nonprofit Acquisition of Mobile Home Parks
                                         Mobile homes represent over one-quarter of the City’s housing,
                                         and proper management is critical to the well-being of the
                                         residents. In past years, the City used redevelopment funds to issue
                                         mortgage revenue bonds, which assisted nonprofits in acquiring
                                         mobile home parks and preserving them as affordable for the long
                                         term. The City of Yucaipa has also used the Independent Cities
                                         Finance Authority to refinance bonds on two mobile home parks to
                                         finance additional capital improvements to the projects and
                                         continue to secure long-term covenants on both projects. As
                                         additional opportunities arise, the City will continue to facilitate
                                         and encourage nonprofit acquisition of mobile home parks and
                                         other opportunities to assist the finance of needed park repairs.
                                         Objective: Seek opportunities and funds to help nonprofits to
                                         acquire, improve, and deed restrict mobile home parks.
                                         17. Rental Housing Assistance
                                         The Housing Authority of the County of San Bernardino (HACSB)
                                         coordinates Section 8 rental assistance on behalf of Yucaipa.
                                         HACSB extends rental subsidies to very low income households.
                                         The HACSB implements the Move-to-Work national demonstration
                                         program that allows significant flexibility in its program. In
                                         conjunction with housing voucher assistance, the HACSB requires
                                         voucher holders to participate in employment training, life skills,
                                         and other programs designed to improve the ability of participants
                                         to become more self-sufficient and transition off rental assistance
                                         within five years. For HASCB-owned units, the HACSB provides
                                         project-based vouchers to keep projects affordable in perpetuity.
                                         Objective: Promote the program by providing brochures at the
                                         public counter, senior center, library, and realtors.
                                         18. Homeownership Assistance
                                         The City historically provided homeownership assistance programs
                                         through participation with the County of San Bernardino. Under
                                         the HOME program, interest-free deferred (“silent second”) loans
                                         were provided to eligible households. Homeownership assistance
                                         was provided through the single-family home mortgage revenue
                                         bond program. This program offered below-market, 30-year, fixed-
                                         rate loans to first-time homebuyers. In recent years, however, both
                                         of these programs were defunded by the County of San Bernardino
                                         due to funding cutbacks in HOME and CDBG. Until funding is
                                         restored or an alternative to redevelopment financing is developed,
                                         the City will seek funding opportunities, such as grants or nonprofit
                                         organizations, to assist in restarting these programs.
                                         Objective: Seek additional funding           to   provide  affordable
                                         homeownership opportunities.

19. Housing at Risk of Conversion
Yucaipa has 300 units of senior and family affordable apartments
and 310 mobile home units that receive public assistance in return
for long-term affordability covenants. Presently, none are at risk of
conversion through 2021 because: 1) the projects are owned by
nonprofits or the housing authority, who have not expressed an
intent to convert the projects, and 2) the residential projects have
long-term deed restrictions guaranteeing affordability. Although
none is at risk, the City will continue to monitor projects to
determine whether assistance can be provided. One example is
where the City worked with ICFA to issue mortgage revenue bonds
to secure funding for capital improvements in mobile home parks.
Objective: Monitor the affordable housing stock and work with
owners to facilitate and encourage maintenance and rehabilitation.
20. Reasonable Accommodation
The City’s Ordinance No. 297 was adopted to give individuals with
disabilities reasonable accommodation in the application of the
City’s rules, policies, practices, and procedures (including land use
and zoning regulations), as necessary to allow disabled persons to
use and enjoy a dwelling. Reasonable accommodation is provided
through two means: minor and major accommodations. A minor
accommodation involves an action that can be removed or
terminated in 90 days or less after the need for the reasonable
accommodation ends, and a major accommodation is an action or
physical modification to a property that cannot be restored or
terminated within 90 days after the accommodation ends.
Objective: To further housing for disabled residents, process
reasonable accommodations as requests arise.
21. Emergency Shelters
Adopted in 2010, Ordinance No. 296 allows emergency shelters as
a by-right use in the CS district pursuant to management and
operational standards in state law. The same ordinance allows
conditional permitting of transitional housing and supportive
housing in the RM district. Finally, single-room-occupancy uses are
allowed by right in the RM district pursuant to requirements in
state law. With respect to services, CDBG funds are allocated to
Yucaipa Valley Family Welfare to serve the poor and homeless
through the Family Service Association. The City also participates in
the MHSA program that allocates housing vouchers to residents
with mental disabilities. These programs help to serve those in
need of emergency housing and assistance.
Objective: Support homeless services through participation in the
County’s consolidated plan and continuum of care programs.
Convene a City Council ad hoc group to address homelessness.
                                                                      CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 3-25

3. HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS
                                         22. Transitional and Permanent Supportive Housing
                                         Adopted in 2010, Ordinance No. 296 allows transitional and
                                         permanent supportive housing in designated land use districts and
                                         conditionally allowed in the RM land use district. In accordance
                                         with state law, transitional and permanent supportive housing
                                         must be treated like any residential use allowed in the same zone.
                                         So both uses should be allowed as a by-right use in the RL, RS, RM,
                                         and PD land use districts if configured like a single-family
                                         residential unit, and allowed by right in the RM, RM-24, and PD
                                         land use districts if configured as a multiple-family project.
                                         Moreover, development standards should be the same as any other
                                         single-family or multiple-family residential use in the same district.
                                         Objective: Amend municipal code to allow transitional and
                                         permanent supportive housing in all land use districts allowing
                                         residential uses subject to the same permitting requirements as
                                         other housing uses.
                                         23. Environmental Regulations
                                         Yucaipa implements measures to protect the city’s environmental
                                         resources from residential development. The municipal code sets
                                         forth various overlays—agricultural preserve, biotic resources,
                                         cultural resources, mineral resources, and scenic resources. In
                                         addition, the hillside preservation ordinance regulates the amount
                                         of open space on hillsides. These overlays and regulations do not
                                         extend to areas where higher density residential sites are proposed
                                         for multiple-family housing; therefore, these regulations do not
                                         preclude achieving the regional housing needs goals. Rather, these
                                         overlays (in combination with density transfer provisions) allow for
                                         more creative solutions than would otherwise be possible.
                                         Objective: Continue to implement overlay designations.
                                         24. Fair Housing
                                         Yucaipa promotes fair housing for all persons of protected status.
                                         regardless of protected status. The City is a member of the San
                                         Bernardino County CDBG Consortium, which contracts with the
                                         Inland Fair Housing Mediation Board (IFHMB) for fair housing
                                         services. The City refers fair housing complaints to IFHMB and
                                         provides information brochures at City Hall, the library, and other
                                         locations. The City’s municipal code appears to comply with fair
                                         housing in most cases; however, the definitions of single dwelling
                                         and multiple dwelling units should be revised to eliminate the
                                         references to the number of families in a unit.
                                         Objective: Continue to provide referrals and informational
                                         brochures regarding fair housing in appropriate venues. Also,
                                         amend municipal code definition of “dwelling unit” by removing
                                         number of families to eliminate a potential fair housing constraint.

Yucaipa is also defined by a sense of community that is derived        + Biological Resources
from the many services provided to residents, businesses, and
visitors. Yucaipa’s wealth of parks and recreational amenities is      + Cultural & Paleontological Resources
unparalleled in the region. Private, nonprofit, educational, and
faith-based organizations work together to serve Yucaipans of all
ages in many other ways. Be it cultural arts, human services,
recreation, or education, these services reflect the spirit of the
community and add to the quality of life enjoyed by residents.
The Parks, Recreation, Trails, and Open Space Element affirms the
importance of these resources for Yucaipa. This element provides
policy direction for three topics: 1) the provision of parks,
recreation, and community services; and 2) the preservation and
conservation of multipurpose trails and natural open space; and 3)
preservation of the City’s biological, cultural, and paleontological
resources. By affirming these core values, Yucaipa seeks to preserve
these amenities and way of life for future Yucaipans to enjoy.

                                             broad goals and policies to provide ample parks, recreation, and
                                             community services as well as to conserve and preserve Yucaipa’s
                                             natural environment.
                                             These goals and policies are implemented by the following:

                                                                          4. PARKS, RECREATION, TRAILS, AND OPEN SPACE
Emerald Collar Concept
Yucaipa’s topography, streams and channels, and climate zone
have resulted in a unique natural environment. The Crafton Hills,
National Forest, Wildwood Canyon, and prominent ridgelines
frame Yucaipa and provide panoramic views. Intermittent
waterways have etched benches and canyons into the landscape.
Coupled with climate and water resources, many of these natural
areas provide habitat for wildlife, including sensitive species.
The Yucaipa General Plan recognizes the value of the natural
environment and memorializes it through a visionary concept
referred to as the “Emerald Collar.” As shown in Figure 4-1, this
vision encompasses an interconnected series of hillsides, open
spaces, canyons, and drainage channels that frame the community,
link to prominent ridgelines and permanent open space resources,
and connect the many park and recreation facilities within Yucaipa.
To appreciate the scope of this project, the Emerald Collar connects
to open space areas beyond the City’s limits. The Emerald Collar
extends northward to the San Bernardino National Forest and
connects to the east with links to San Gorgonio Wilderness and
Wildlands Conservancy Lands. Potential extensions south and
southeast beyond City limits may include the San Timoteo area, the
City of Redland’s open spaces, and areas managed by the Regional
Conservation Authority.
Yucaipa’s General Plan goals and policies in this and other
elements affirm this vision and seek to further the following:
   + Development of an integrated system of parks and recreational
     facilities that offer passive and active recreation for residents of
     all ages and backgrounds.

PARK FACILITIES
Yucaipa’s park and recreational facilities draw residents and visitors
to attend community events, play sports, or simply enjoy the
outdoors. More than a dozen parks, special use facilities, and joint
use facilities offer opportunities for passive and active recreation.
Yucaipa Park System
Local Parks
Yucaipa residents have access to mini and neighborhood parks.
Neighborhood parks range in size from 1 to 10 acres and are
intended to serve residents living within a half mile of the park.
Mini parks offer a quiet retreat from everyday life to enjoy nature,
walk pets, picnic, or enjoy a stroll. Neighborhood parks offer
opportunities for children to enjoy a playground or for youth and
adults to enjoy active recreation. Mini and neighborhood parks are
in Crafton Hills, Dunlap Acres, and the Central Core.
                                                                               Yucaipa Community Park offers a wide

Yucaipa’s community parks are 10 to 30 acres and feature larger
amenities, such as fields for soccer, baseball, and softball leagues.
Yucaipa Community Park is the City’s signature 32-acre facility and
houses the community center. This facility features volleyball
courts, playgrounds, premier walking trails, picnic shelters,
barbecues, and an outdoor amphitheater. This facility serves as a
hub to gather information and experience the opportunities the
community center has to offer, including its gymnasium.
Yucaipa Regional Park
Yucaipa Regional Park is a 385-acre facility at the base of the
foothills of the Crafton Hills and adjacent to Yucaipa Community
Park. The park features four lakes for swimming, fishing,
paddleboats, water slides, and other amenities. Its natural setting
provides walking trails, picnic facilities, a recreational vehicle–only
campground, and outdoor tent camping. Moreover, with an array
of annual and seasonal events, Yucaipa Regional Park attracts tens
of thousands of visitors each year.                                         Yucaipa Regional Park is a favorite for water
                                                                              recreation, camping, hiking, and events.

                                             While parks are located where land is available, schools provide
                                             playgrounds and athletic fields within most neighborhoods. Joint
                                             use agreements with the Yucaipa-Calimesa Joint Unified School
                                             District allow shared public access to school facilities during
                                             weekends and after-school programs at elementary and middle
                                             schools. Crafton Hills College allows public use of recreational
                                             facilities, Olympic-sized pool, and adjacent hiking trails. Athletic
                                             leagues also work with local schools to share facility use.

Park Facility Planning
The City’s Parks and Recreation Master Plan is the blueprint for
addressing park and recreational facilities. Yucaipa’s parks are
planned according to several criteria: 1) the total quantity of park
acreage; 2) the accessibility of parks to homes; and 3) the
amenities for different parks relative to community needs.
Acreage
The City’s Quimby park ordinance establishes a standard of 3.5
acres of parkland per 1,000 residents. With this standard,
Yucaipa’s need for parkland at its buildout (80,000 residents) is
280 acres. Existing and proposed mini, neighborhood, community,
and regional parks meet that standard. However, given changing
demographics, the City has identified a need for neighborhood
parks. The City will identify options for adding neighborhood parks
in Dunlap Acres, Central Core, and portions of the North Bench.
Accessibility
The parks and recreation master plan proposes that residents have
access to a community or neighborhood park within 0.5 to 1 mile
of their neighborhood. The North Bench does not meet this
standard, although the larger lots and proximity to natural areas
suggest less need for public parks. Even with a new park, the west
part of Dunlap Acres will need additional parkland. The Central
Core (south of Yucaipa Boulevard) also needs additional parks due
to the higher allowable residential densities.
Amenities
Parks and recreational facilities should have appropriate amenities.
The parks and recreation plan uses participation rates to determine
the types of facilities and amenities desired by residents. Looking
toward the future, Yucaipa’s demographics will likely change, with
a projected increase in families with children. This change will likely
increase the need for smaller neighborhood parks that are
equipped with tot lots, playground equipment, and other
amenities suited for younger children.
Funding
Quimby ordinance fees, developer agreements, and grants fund
the acquisition of land. Impact fees and grants pay for the
improvements to parks. Though these fees are sufficient to develop
new parks and recreational facilities, additional funds are needed
to maintain and renovate existing parks and recreational facilities.
Funding sources may include, but are not limited to, assessment
districts, foundation grants, and gifts.
The following goal and policies help to ensure a responsive and
comprehensive park and recreational system for Yucaipa.
                                                                               CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 4-7

Recreational Services Planning
Looking toward the future, Yucaipa will continue to plan for the
emerging needs of the community. These needs may arise out of
demographic change, preferences for different types of recreational
activities or programs, and emerging issues in health and wellness.
Changing Demographics and Preferences
The City’s population makeup will continue to change, and these
shifts influence preferences for recreational programs. Yucaipa’s
senior population is anticipated to increase, but surveys point
toward a greater demand for more “active” recreational outlets
than in past generations. On the other end of the age spectrum,
significant increases in the younger adult population will require a
focus on more children- and youth-oriented activities and facilities.
Community Health: Healthy Yucaipa
In 2012, Yucaipa became one of 24 communities in San
Bernardino County to adopt a healthy community agenda. To
implement this effort, the City’s Healthy Yucaipa Committee
advises the City Council on matters affecting health and wellness.
The committee focuses on four areas: healthy food choices,
support of national awareness programs, local promotion and
marketing, and community services. Healthy Yucaipa will pursue
initiatives in its Healthy Eating Active Living Ordinance.
Facility Needs
Matching facility needs with recreational preferences of current
and future residents is an ongoing priority. The City’s 2012 Facility
Assessment identified the need for additional recreational facilities
to allow for passive and active recreational opportunities. The City
is planning a cultural center/fine arts center, a new or expanded
library facility, teen center, and theater for performing arts.
Recreational facility needs will continue to be evaluated to keep up
with population increase and changing recreational needs. The City
may also consider the feasibility of a family resource center.
Increasing Role of Partnerships
For many years, the City of Yucaipa has shared the responsibility of
providing recreational services with community organizations.
Where certain recreational programs have a high facility cost,
Yucaipa has taken a lead role in providing those services. In other
cases, the nonprofit sector and local schools continue to provide
programs, particularly on their own facilities. The City and
community also share the provision of recreational programs
through an increasing number of shared use agreements.
The following goal and policies will ensure the provision of
programs and services responsive to the community’s needs.
                                                                            CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 4-13

MULTIPURPOSE TRAILS
Yucaipa natural open spaces provide the setting for a latticework of
hiking, biking, and equestrian trails in Crafton Hills, Yucaipa Hills,
San Bernardino National Forest, and Wildwood Canyon. These
same trails also connect to county, state, and federal open spaces.
To the south, trails extend through Calimesa and Redlands, and
connect to trails in the badlands and other Riverside County areas.
Yucaipa’s trail network serves three distinct types of users: people
on foot, bike riders, and equestrians. Although each group travels
at a different speed and has partially different travel requirements,
the City’s multipurpose trail network is designed to allow the
complementary use of shared trails. Observing standard trail
courtesy and right-of-way rules allows the shared use of trails.
Yucaipa’s network of multipurpose trails offers many health and
quality of life benefits for the entire community. Walking, hiking,
jogging, and biking improve overall health. These activities also                Horseback riding is a favorite in

also encourage recreational activities, which have a positive effect
on the health and well-being of residents. These and other quality
of life benefits make multipurpose trails a valued asset.
Multipurpose trails are also an important feature of Yucaipa’s
Emerald Collar. As part of flood control and water resource
projects, the City continues to build formal trails along natural
drainage courses, which link together parks, schools, recreational
facilities, and other community destinations. These same trails also
link to larger parks, including Yucaipa Regional Park, El Dorado
Ranch Park, and Wildwood Canyon State Park.

NATURAL OPEN SPACES
Yucaipa’s breathtaking natural open space beckons to its residents.
Bounded by the Crafton Hills, San Bernardino National Forest, and
rolling hills to the south, Yucaipa’s natural land resources include
vast open space, biological resources, and rolling terrain and
hillsides. Yucaipa is committed to balancing its built environment
while maintaining the quality of its natural lands, water, air, and
other essential resources that sustain a desirable quality of life.
Natural Resources
San Bernardino National Forest
San Bernardino National Forest, an expansive area of more than
1,000 square miles, frames the northernmost side of Yucaipa. The
forest supports both passive and active recreational activities—
hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, fishing, camping, scenic
drives, outdoor education, skiing, and other winter sports. In
addition to recreational areas, the many prominent peaks and
meandering canyons and ridgelines offer unparalleled scenic views
of the Yucaipa Valley for hiking enthusiasts.
The San Gorgonio Wilderness, east and northeast of Yucaipa,
ranges from rolling foothills to rugged wilderness extending to the
11,500-foot-high Mt. San Gorgonio. With its diverse landscape,
San Gorgonio Wilderness is a transition zone between the desert,
mountain, and coastal ecosystems. The Oak Glen Preserve, a 2,100-
acre portion of this range, includes Wilshire and Galena Peak, an
important lambing ground for bighorn sheep. Ponds, streams,
wetlands, oak and pine forests, chaparral, and willow woodland
provide valued habitats for a range of fauna.
Wildwood Canyon State Park
Wildwood Canyon State Park, a 900-acre state park, was created
through efforts of Yucaipa residents, Yucaipa Valley Conservancy,
and The Wildlands Conservancy. The park was created to preserve
the scenic and natural state of two of Yucaipa’s historic ranches.
While the State of California has provided funding, these groups
maintain the park through donations. These groups are also
working to expand 3,500 more acres in Wildwood Canyon.
                                                                                  Wildwood Canyon State Park
Today, Wildwood Canyon offers recreational opportunities for
hiking, bicycling, horseback riding, sightseeing, and cultural events.
Home to hundreds of species of flora and fauna, Wildwood
Canyon contains ancient oak woodlands and diverse wildlife,
including multiple species of birds, mice, and snakes. Mule deer
and desert cottontail share Wildwood Canyon with bobcats, black
bears, gray foxes, and skunks. Cougars also use the canyon as a
travel corridor to the San Bernardino Mountains.
                                                                             CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 4-19

                                             In 2009, the Yucaipa Valley Conservancy donated 334 acres along
                                             Oak Glen Road to the City of Yucaipa, with the requirement that
                                             the land be a permanent open space and open to the public. In
                                             addition to providing a place for community members to enjoy the
                                             views and traverse the natural terrain, the area is home to alluvial
                                             scrub, oak trees, and sycamore riparian habitat, among others. Part
                                             of the park’s property has been set aside as mitigation areas for
                                             critical flood control and transportation projects.
                                             Crafton Hills
                                             The Crafton Hills have a colorful history back in the early 1800s and
                                             the Gold Rush era. Today, the Crafton Hills remain a defining
                                             feature of Yucaipa, providing beautiful vistas and habitat for many
                                             species of plants and animals. Hikers, horseback riders, bicyclists,
     Mountain bikers enjoy views of spring

                                             about the hills, plants, animals, and natural history.
                                             The Crafton Hills Open Space Conservancy (CHOSC) was formed to
                                             protect the area for its significant watershed and ecological,
                                             aesthetic, and other benefits. Since that time, CHOSC has preserved
                                             two-thirds of its 4,500 acres through acquisition and cooperative
                                             management with San Bernardino County and the cities of
                                             Redlands and Yucaipa. The conservancy continues to be “dedicated
                                             to working together to save a beautiful area for education,
                                             recreation, and wildlife habitat preservation.”

Scenic Resources
The City’s location at the base of the San Bernardino Mountains
affords some of the most breathtaking views in the region.
Yucaipans can enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding hillsides,
ridgelines, and peaks from multiple vantage points. Additionally,
views of open space areas, such as canyons, benches, and
channels, contribute to the unique character of Yucaipa.
Yucaipa scenic resources fall into four classifications—natural areas,
night (dark) skies, scenic/view corridors, and site-specific vistas.
Natural Areas
Yucaipa’s natural features—the Yucaipa Hills, Crafton Hills, and
their associated ridgelines and canyons—provide scenic resources
that are unique in southern California. Even in the community, the
topography provides unique places from which to enjoy mountain
views. Erosion from flooding and earthquakes have created
elevations or benches that define neighborhoods and provide views
of Yucaipa from various vantage points.
Vistas and Views
Throughout Yucaipa, residents can enjoy scenic vistas. Views are
available from park and recreational facilities (Flag Hill Veterans             Yucaipa boasts vistas from multiple
Memorial Park), institutions (Crafton Hills College and City Hall),              vantage points in the community.
trails along Crafton Hills, private property, and many other places.
Protection of these views from buildings, radio/cell phone towers,
electric or telephone transmission lines, and similar appurtenances
is a high priority for Yucaipa’s elected officials and the community.
Night (Dark) Skies
Surrounded by undeveloped hills, Yucaipa is removed from more
urbanized areas of the county and the associated glare of lights.
The semirural environment and large open space areas contribute a
very low level of background lighting. In the evening hours,
residents enjoy some of the best night-sky and stargazing views of
any community in the valley. Dark skies lend a more rural character
to the North Bench and Wildwood Canyon.
Scenic/View Corridor
Scenic/view corridors include the major transportation corridors
that traverse Yucaipa and afford views of surrounding topography.
Four major roadways—Bryant Street, Yucaipa Boulevard, Wildwood
Canyon Road, and Oak Glen Road—are designated scenic
corridors. These corridors provide unimpeded views of the
surrounding mountains, hillsides, prominent ridges, canyons, valley
floor, and a variety of other natural features in Yucaipa.

                                               are clearly among the most cherished features of the community.
                                               This General Plan articulates Yucaipa’s commitment to protect its

                                               Yucaipa supports the acquisition of natural open space for the
                                               benefit of the public and protection of biological resources. This
                                               may include acquisition and/or maintenance agreements with the
                                               Crafton Hills Open Space Conservancy, the Wildlands Conservancy,

                                               and land owners, and other entities. Yucaipa also works with the
                                               California Department of Fish and Wildlife and regional
                                               conservation districts to ensure that sensitive vegetation is
                                               protected and that the natural state of open space is preserved.
                                               Restoration of Creeks
                                               Yucaipa is actively restoring its ephemeral creeks and channels.
                                               Yucaipa’s many channels are not only the historical source of water

                                               Protection of Hillsides and Scenic Resources
                                               The City uses several tools to protect hillsides and scenic resources.
                                               Yucaipa’s Hillside Ordinance provides specific development
                                               guidelines that preserve and protect prominent ridgelines, hillsides,

                                               the ordinance requires specific targets for setting aside open space
                                               areas. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District also regulates setbacks
                                               and landscaping along designated local corridors to preserve views
                                               and provide greater uniformity in landscape treatments.

                                            BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
                                            Yucaipa lies in a transition zone between the valley floor and slopes
                                            of the San Bernardino National Forest. Significant natural open
                                            space areas surround Yucaipa to the west (Crafton Hills), east
                                            (Wildwood Canyon State Park), and south (San Timoteo Canyon
                                            natural areas in Calimesa and Redlands). These areas are also linked
                                            to the San Gorgonio Wilderness to the east. These resources
                                            provide a setting for the biological resources in Yucaipa.
                                            Biological Setting
                                            Yucaipa’s location in a transition zone supports diverse land cover.
                                            While most of the interior of the community is urbanized, the
                                            surrounding areas are relatively undisturbed. Several scrub
                                            communities (coastal sage scrub and montane scrub) are found in
                                            Crafton Hills, Live Oak Canyon, North Bench, and Wildwood
                                            Canyon. Three chaparral communities (Ceanothus, scrub oak, and
   Mixed sage scrub, common to Yucaipa,     chamise) cover Crafton Hills and Yucaipa Hills. Forest covers parts
   covers many of the hillsides and washes. of Wildwood Canyon, and valley grasslands populate hillsides.
                                            Open space and relatively untouched habitats support native plant
                                            species. In the spring, these areas exhibit an abundance of
                                            blooming native wildflowers, including California poppy
                                            (Eschscholzia californica), California lilacs (Ceanothus spp.), white
                                            sage (Salvia apiana), black sage (Salvia mellifera), sage brush
                                            (Artemesia spp.), buckwheat (Eriogonum spp.), and several species
                                            of monkey flower, lupine, and phacelia, to name a few. These
                                            areas also support large stands of woodlands, including native oak
                                            woodlands, and some of the oak trees are hundreds of years old.
                                            A variety of resident and migratory wildlife species occur within
                                            and adjacent to Yucaipa. Yucaipa provides habitat for common
                                            and special-status species of invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles,
                                            birds, and mammals. Common bird species in the area include

Sensitive Biological Resources
The federal and California endangered species acts were enacted to
protect any species of plant or animal that is sensitive, endangered,
or threatened with extinction and the habitats in which these
species are found. Sensitive resources are known to occur in
Yucaipa based on historical data from the region, the presence of
suitable habitat, and project-specific surveys.
Sensitive Vegetation
Sensitive vegetation communities are those that have cumulative
losses throughout the region, relatively limited distribution, support
or potentially support sensitive plant or wildlife species, or have
particular value to other wildlife. Sensitive vegetation communities
identified in Yucaipa are:
  + Riversidian alluvial fan sage scrub
  + Southern sycamore alder riparian woodland
  + Southern cottonwood riparian woodland
  + Southern coast live oak riparian forest
  + Southern riparian scrub and southern riparian forest
  + Southern willow scrub
  + Canyon live oak ravine forest
Special Status Plant Species
State and federal law define special status plant species as those
that are considered rare, threatened, or endangered by various
regulatory agencies. To date, 106 special status plant species are
known to occur in the broader region that includes Yucaipa, but
only 44 species occur at Yucaipa’s elevation range, and only 5
special status plant species have been identified in Yucaipa:
  + Yucaipa onion (Allium marvinii)
  + Plummer’s mariposa lily (Calochortus plummerae)                                   Yucaipa Onion
  + Parry’s spineflower (Chorizanthe parryi var. parryi)
  + Slender-horned spineflower (Dodecahema leptoceras)
  + Parish’s checkerbloom (Sidalcea hickmanii ssp. parishii)
No critical habitats for these or other special status plant species
have been designated in Yucaipa. However, a community-wide
assessment of habitat has not been completed.

                                             Wildlife corridors allow wildlife to move between open space areas.
                                             Yucaipa is surrounded on three sides by regional wildlife corridors.
                                             The California Essential Habitat Connectivity Project has also
                                             identified a critical linkage just south of Calimesa that connects the
                                             extensively forested slopes of the San Bernardino Mountains with
                                             the rugged montane habitats in the San Jacinto Mountains. Several
                                             potential wildlife corridors may exist in Yucaipa. Crafton Hills and
                                             Wildwood Canyon connect the San Bernardino National Forest and
                                             San Gorgonio Wilderness. Ridgelines, canyons, and creek beds in
                                             Yucaipa could also be used as local travel routes for wildlife to
                                             resources (e.g., food, cover, water) in a smaller, more defined area.

                                             Wetland and riparian resources are also considered sensitive
                                             biological resources and are regulated by federal and state law.

Protecting Our Legacy
Yucaipa is fortunate to have a wide range of biological resources
that add variety to the community. Moreover, Yucaipa remains
committed to protecting its sensitive species to the betterment of
its environment and the community. The City is implementing
several tools to protect sensitive biological resources.
Community-Wide Mitigation
Yucaipa partners with resource and conservation agencies to
develop and implement a community-wide mitigation program.
This program is designed to preserve (and enhance where feasible)
open spaces along with addressing flooding, ground water
recharge, and water quality. Program goals are achieved through
environmentally sensitive projects and the conservation and/or set-
aside of open space for habitat near projects being mitigated.
Yucaipa’s strategies continue to evolve in collaboration with the
Army Corps of Engineers, Santa Ana Regional Water Quality
Control Board, state and federal wildlife agencies, Inland Empire
Resource Conservation District, Wildlands Conservancy, County
Flood Control District, Yucaipa Valley Conservancy, and others.           Reconstructed Oak Glen Creek offers an
                                                                          example of a habitat mitigation project.
Biotic Resources Overlay
The City’s Biotic Resources Overlay District provides regulations and
guidelines to protect and conserve the community’s biological
resources. Regulations apply to incorporated areas that have been
identified by local, state, and/or federal agencies as habitat for
unique, rare, threatened, or endangered plants or animals.
Requirements include preparation of biology studies as determined
by the City and municipal code, and, if qualified resources are
found, development of appropriate mitigation measures. The EIR
and Biological Technical Report for the General Plan provide
additional information about sensitive biological resources.
Local Plant Protection and Management
Yucaipa’s Municipal Code sets regulations and guidelines for the
management of plant resources while promoting the continued
health of the City’s abundant and diverse plant resources. In
addition to general provisions, the Municipal Code sets forth
specific measures for tree protection from insects and diseases,
mountain forest and valley tree conservation, riparian plant
conservation, and oak tree conservation. These local ordinances, in
conjunction with the Biotic Resources Overlay and Communitywide
Mitigation provide a framework for Yucaipa’s conservation work.
The following goal and policies help to preserve, conserve, and
manage Yucaipa’s biological resources.

CULTURAL/PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Yucaipa has a rich array of cultural resources dating back to the
area’s first inhabitants more than 10,000 years ago. Cultural
resources consist of places, sites, structures, artifacts, and
landscapes that are considered important for scientific, traditional,
religious, or other reasons. Resources may be historical,
paleontological, archaeological, architectural, or archival in nature.
Paleontological Resources
Paleontological resources are the fossilized remains of organisms
from prehistoric environments. There are two types of resources:
vertebrate and invertebrate. These resources are found in geologic
strata conducive to their preservation, typically sedimentary
formations. Paleontological sites are areas that show evidence of
prehuman activity. Often they are simply small outcroppings visible
on the surface or sites encountered during grading. While the sites
are important indications, the geologic formations are the most
important, since they may contain important fossils.
Potentially sensitive areas for the presence of paleontological
resources are typically based on the underlying geologic formation.
According to the California Geological Survey, Yucaipa and its
surrounding area contain approximately 24 different rock units and
17 subunits that are distinguishable by age and characteristics.
Rocks include Holocene to Pleistocene alluvial deposits, Miocene
sediments, and Oligocene volcanics, with Oligocene, Mesozoic, and
Precambrian granitic and metamorphic basement rocks.
The Potential Fossil Yield Classification (PFYC) system is a scale for
determining the sensitivity of a particular rock formation for fossils.
The PFYC system classifies rock units on a scale of 1 to 5—
extremely low to very high likelihood of finds. The General Plan EIR
shows Yucaipa’s geologic units according to this scale. Areas
denoted with PYFC value of 3a (purple) have a moderately patchy
potential. Based on this scale, Figure PR-6, Cultural and
Paleontological Resources Sensitivity, notes that areas within the
community that have moderate-patchy sensitivity for fossils.
Fossils are known to occur from the Mill Creek Formation/Potato
Sandstone within the City’s boundaries and surrounding areas.
Paleontological resources may be encountered during excavations
of more than six feet below ground surface in these rocks. Very
deep excavations have potential to encounter Pleistocene fossils
under the younger alluvial sediments. The only other rock unit
sensitive both at and below the surface is the San Timoteo
Formation, which is in the southwestern part of Yucaipa.

                                             Native American History
                                             The Yucaipa Valley was thought to be home to at least three Native
                                             American (Serrano) villages. These villages were near streams
                                             and/or the prehistoric marsh: (1) Yucaipa Creek Village, which
                                             extended from about Interstate 10 north to the current Western
                                             Heights water reservoir; (2) Oak Glen Creek Village, and (3)
                                             Wildwood Canyon Village. The first was occupied into historic
                                             times and contains Euro-American and native artifacts.
                                             Information on prehistoric culture is based mostly on the Yukaipa't,
                                             a group of villages thought to be home to the Yucaipaiem clan.
                                             The Serrano were primarily seminomadic hunter-gatherers, but also
                                             employed some agriculture. The Serrano lived in the fertile
                                             Yukaipa't for most of the year, but would make excursions into the
         Yucaipa Rancheria, circa 2014       mountains to gather acorns and other items during harvest season.
                                             Under the name Yucaipa Ranchería, the Yukaipa't site is presently
                                             designated California Historical Landmark No. 620.
                                             Today, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians and the Morongo
                                             Band of Mission Indians are federally recognized American Indian
                                             tribes near Highland and in Riverside County. Both tribes belong to
                                             one of several clans of Serrano Indians that hearken back to the
                                             original inhabitants of the Yucaipa Valley. These groups and others
                                             continue to be consulted as part of the General Plan update.
                                             Mission and Rancho Periods
                                             Serrano society was left relatively intact during the period of initial
                                             Spanish colonialization. In 1772, Spanish explorer Pedro Fagès
                                             traveled through the region to identify native groups. Spanish
                                             influence on Serrano life was negligible until the 1810s, when a
                                             mission was established near Serrano territory. By the end of the
                                             mission era in 1834, most Serrano had been relocated to nearby
                                             missions or forcibly moved to other reservations.
                                             Agriculture in the Yucaipa Valley began during the 1810s with
                                             grazing for a satellite property of San Gabriel Mission’s Rancho San
                                             Bernardino. In the 1830s, the Mexican government secularized
                                             California’s missions, and the title for Rancho Yucaipa lands came
                                             into the possession of Antonio Maria Lugo in 1842. That same year
                                             Diego Sepulveda built an adobe, Rancho Yucaipa, which still stands
                                             today as California Historical Landmark No. 528.
                                             The Rancho Yucaipa lands soon became known for agriculture and
                                             grazing, with thousands of sheep and cattle. Mormon settlers who
   In the early 1900s, Yucaipa was known for founded the town of San Bernardino in the late 1840s presumably
     orchards of peaches, apples, and plums. purchased Rancho San Bernardino in 1851. However, Mormon
                                             settlers eventually returned to Utah in 1857, leaving the ownership
                                             of the title for the land in the federal courts until 1865, when
                                             property ownership was officially granted to the Lugos.

Early California Settlements
In 1869, John Dunlap purchased Yucaipa lands and expanded
agricultural operations to include grain and cattle. Land was leased
to former Chinese rail workers around 1870 to cultivate vegetables.
At its peak, China Gardens farmed 300 acres. The Bear Valley
Water Company also hired Chinese to dig waterways in Redlands.
After the Geary Act in 1892, many Yucaipa Chinese were deported.
The Dunlaps also built Casa Blanca in 1882, and the first school on
Cherrycroft Drive, now restored under private ownership.
Early settlers in Yucaipa were also drawn by the prospect of gold.
Although one quartz mine in Crafton Hills led to a promise of gold,
wealth was mostly found in ranching, orchards, and agriculture.
Throughout the early 20th century, ranching gave way to apple
production, which grew to a height of over 4,000 acres. As apple
orchards later moved to the Oak Glen area, cultivation expanded to              Casa Blanca Ranch circa 2014
include citrus, peaches, and plums. This mix of ranching and
orchards remained intact through the early 1900s.
Yucaipa’s Modern Era
The early 20th century saw the gradual development of Yucaipa
from its original downtown district. Streets, homes, churches, and
businesses began to populate Yucaipa. The latter half of the 20th
century brought a new hospital, fire service, roadways, and
modern parks. A new school district was formed that served
Yucaipa and surrounding communities. The 1960s also saw the
transition of the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway into Interstate 10,
further opening up Yucaipa Valley for suburbanization.
The latter half of the 20th century brought significant residential
development. Most significant for Yucaipa’s development was the
completion of a sewer system to collect and treat wastewater.
Water districts also formed to serve the community. Whereas
residential projects continued throughout the community, the most
defining development was in the 1980s. The 1,000-acre Chapman
Heights project, the largest in Yucaipa, replaced former orchards
and an airfield and ushered in the present era for Yucaipa.
Today, Yucaipa is home to about 49 cultural resources—21
prehistoric resources, 4 historical archaeological resources, 1
multicomponent site, and 24 historic built-environment resources.

Like most developing cities, Yucaipa has challenges to ensuring a
prosperous economy. Of residents’ retail expenditures, nearly half
takes place outside of Yucaipa. Taxable retail sales per household
were less than a third of the level countywide. Of the City’s
employed residents, almost nine of ten commute outside of
Yucaipa for work. The local economy has not yet fully developed.
This pattern matters because non-residential land uses generate
revenues to provide facilities and services for the entire community.
The Economic Development Element recognizes the importance of
the local economy to Yucaipa’s future. The element establishes
long-term goals that describe what the community desires its local
economy to provide in occupations, goods, and services, the kinds
of shopping and business districts, the City’s fiscal sustainability
and resiliency, and the role of the City in developing a strong local
economy. This element’s policies guide decision-making that will
lead to the achievement of economic development goals.

                                        Related Plans
                                        Several plans and studies informed the preparation of the
                                        Economic Development Element. Although these plans and studies
                                        are not part of the element, those seeking a deeper understanding
     General Plan vision themes         of the local economy and the opportunities for economic

                                             Economic Development Advisory Committee prepared an
                                             Economic Development Strategic Plan. The plan identified four
                                             goals (along with short- and mid-term actions):
                                             1) Encourage commercial and industrial growth that respects
                                                  the environment and market demand.
                                             2) Provide a strong         public    partnership   for  economic
                                                  development.
                                             3) Promote retail, tourism, and entertainment sectors that
                                                  enhance the City’s quality of life.
                                             4) Develop a quality workforce that will enhance, attract, and
                                                 retain business.

                                             issues or areas during the boom of the early to mid-2000s, a
                                             period that likely may not be replicated for some time. The

                                             addressing several key gaps. Specifically, it addresses:
                                             1) The broader demand for commercial, industrial, and office
                                                  opportunities citywide.
                                             2) The impact of the economy on the City's financial and
                                                  fiscal performance.
                                             3) Direction for broad goals that could be included in the
                                                  General Plan for different districts in Yucaipa.
                                        This element provides a broad framework that focuses on long-
                                        term policies. Yucaipa employs a separate economic development
                                        strategy to identify shorter-term goals and programs. The General
                                        Plan affirms the use of the strategy in this role.

Organization of Element
The Economic Development Element establishes two overarching
long-term goals: 1) increase the number of jobs in Yucaipa suited
to the skills and education of residents; and 2) increase the variety
of retail, dining, and entertainment businesses to improve quality
of life and reduce the need to travel elsewhere for goods, services,
and activities. This element is organized into five sections.
Growing a Strong and Resilient Local Economy
A strong local economy that is resilient to fluctuations in the
business cycle is an end in itself, but it is also important as a
means. Non-residential land uses—retail, office, medical, and
industry—generate municipal revenues that help pay for public
facilities and services that contribute to Yucaipa’s quality of life.
This section addresses development of the local economy.
Expanding Retail, Entertainment, and Tourism
Retail, restaurants, and entertainment businesses are important
because they provide needed goods and services and generate
sales and property taxes for the City. Yucaipa lacks a full spectrum
of shopping, dining, and entertainment, requiring residents to
travel to other cities. This section addresses the expansion of retail
(shopping and dining), entertainment, and tourism in Yucaipa.
Improving the Freeway Corridor
The Freeway Corridor is the largest remaining undeveloped area in
Yucaipa, and its prudent development is essential to the future
economic health of Yucaipa. Not only does this area provide land
for residential development, but also land to capture regional sales,
professional businesses, and other uses beneficial to Yucaipans.
This section provides broad guidance to envision its development.
Maintaining and Enhancing the City’s Fiscal Balance
How land is developed and used in the City greatly determines the
amount of revenues the City receives and the costs required to
provide public facilities and services. The General Plan is the
primary tool the City has to guide land use and development that
will provide revenues to pay for facilities and services. This section
directly addresses the City’s long-term fiscal health.
Implementing an Economic Development Program
Yucaipa has extensive authority to regulate land use and
development and to invest public resources to provide
infrastructure and public facilities. However, much of what
happens in economic development within a community occurs
through other organizations and regional agencies. This section
addresses how Yucaipa, on its own and in partnership with
external organizations and agencies, works toward its vision.
                                                                       CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 5-3

5. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
                                        Economic Context
                                        Most economic development opportunities will likely occur in
                                        several key areas of Yucaipa. This does not mean that opportunities
                                        will not arise in other areas of the City or with individual projects.
                                        Indeed, it is advisable to periodically update the General Plan to
                                        capitalize on changing market conditions and new opportunities.
                                        For the current General Plan, the key focus areas for economic
                                        development are the Uptown District, Freeway Corridor, Dunlap
                                        Industrial Corridor, and College Village.
                                        Uptown District
                                        The Uptown District is Yucaipa’s original downtown, dating back
                                        to the early 1900s. Through good planning, active City
                                        involvement, and the commitment of business and property
                                        owners, public and private investment have been transforming
                                        Uptown into a vibrant, mixed-use district that provides destination-
                                        oriented activities, festivals, and traditional commercial and
                                        residential uses. In the short term, the area is planned for
                                        additional performing arts, cultural arts, and educational uses.
                                        The Uptown District is on the right path, and the General Plan does
                                        not call for any significant changes. The key economic development
                                        needs for the Uptown District are:
                                          + Business Development. The City should enhance efforts to
                                             assist existing businesses to anchor the Uptown. Efforts should
                                             also be directed to attract new businesses that will expand the
                                             range of goods and services available in Uptown. These efforts
  Visitors to the Uptown are greeted by      should also draw additional consumers to the Uptown.
       the Historic Yucaipa archway.
                                          + Activities and Events. Uptown is already well known to most
                                             Yucaipa residents. Realizing the vision for the district, however,
                                             will require attracting visitors from the larger region.
                                             Expanding activities and events will play a fundamental role in
                                             building its public image and recognition and attracting
                                             visitors from the region to patronize local businesses.
                                          + Public Relations and Marketing. Converting events and
                                             activities into visitors and increased retail spending will require
                                             strategic and coordinated public relations and marketing. The
                                             City’s efforts in Explore Yucaipa and other, similar campaigns
                                             will continue to publicize and market the Uptown.
                                          + Infrastructure improvements. The City has made significant
                                             public infrastructure improvements in recent years. Continuing
                                             investment into physical infrastructure (e.g., streetscapes) will
                                             improve the attractiveness and desirability of the Uptown for
                                             businesses and consumers from Yucaipa and beyond.

Dunlap Industrial Corridor
The Dunlap Industrial Corridor is home to Sorensen Engineering,
light industry, construction, and other complementary uses. Dunlap
Industrial Corridor and the area along Calimesa Boulevard at
Avenues G and I are the only areas in the City that allow light
industrial uses. Key needs of the Dunlap Industrial Corridor are:
   + Land Use Regulation. Because this industrial area is the only
     part of Yucaipa designated for light industrial uses, the
     General Plan seeks to preserve this area and maintain its
     integrity and ability to accommodate the intended uses. Parcel
     consolidation is also key to encouraging newer developments.
   + Infrastructure Upgrades. The primary infrastructure need in this
     area is road rehabilitation and circulation improvements to
     improve connections to the freeway and the rest of Yucaipa.
     Paying for these upgrades may necessitate collaborating with
     property owners to establish an assessment district,
     infrastructure finance district, or similar mechanism.
   + Aesthetic Enhancements. The appearance of Dunlap Corridor
     could be improved. The General Plan calls for the City to
     collaborate with business and property owners to identify and
     implement appropriate aesthetic improvements that are not
     cost-prohibitive for businesses in that area.
   + Business Development. Continued and enhanced efforts to
     assist existing businesses in expanding operations and to
     attract new businesses to create jobs in Yucaipa.
College Village
The College Village is intended to be a pedestrian-friendly, mixed-
use district with student and faculty housing, retail (including
dining and entertainment), institutional uses, and offices. With          The Yucaipa/Oak Glen Shopping
                                                                        Center is the largest single-shopping
daytime students and convenient access from Yucaipa Boulevard,

this area has the potential to be a dynamic destination. Moreover,
with an experience-oriented environment, this area will be
positioned for e-commerce. Key issues for this area are:
   + Land Use Regulations. Through the land use and development
     code and/or overlay mechanism, a flexible mix of land uses
     complementary to Crafton Hills College and the surrounding
     neighborhoods is essential to obtaining the college village
     experience desired for this activity node.
   + Planning for Management and Promotion. Plans should be
     prepared for the operation and maintenance of the public
     realm and for public relations and marketing. These plans
     should ensure that Crafton Hills College Village is distinct from
     and serves a different niche than the Uptown.

5. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
                                        Freeway Corridor
                                        The Freeway Corridor Specific Plan area has a thousand acres of
                                        mostly undeveloped land that is intended for retail, office, and
                                        residential development. If Yucaipa is to have a regional-scale retail
                                        shopping center, it would most likely be developed in the Freeway
                                        Corridor, because the area has sufficient land, freeway visibility,
                                        and access. This area also has the potential to accommodate office-
                                        based businesses to increase the number of jobs in Yucaipa.
                                        Although development under the specific plan has not yet
                                        occurred, the General Plan does not call for significant change in
                                        planned land uses. In the future, though, the City may consider
                                        amendments to the specific plan to align the land use plan with
                                        market demand, community needs, and feasibility. This may
                                        include a fulfillment center to generate sales-tax revenues if market
                                        conditions will not support development of a regional-scale retail
                                        shopping center. Key economic development needs include:
                                           + Infrastructure. Development in the freeway corridor will require
                                             major investments in infrastructure. These investments may
                                             require public funds, grant funds, development impacts fees,
                                             and private investment through community facilities districts,
                                             infrastructure financing districts, and other mechanisms.
                                           + Coordinated Planning and Development. There is a variety of
                                             property owners in the specific plan area. Financing the
                                             infrastructure improvements and developing a unified
                                             community in the area will require coordination among the
                                             property owners and public involvement and leadership.
                                           + Aesthetic Improvements. Developed portions of the freeway
                                             corridor merit visual improvements (buildings, signage, roads,
                                             etc.) to increase its attractiveness as a place for commerce.
                                             Attention to aesthetics is also important because the freeway
                                             corridor serves as an important gateway to Yucaipa.
                                        Other Areas
                                        Yucaipa has other commercial corridors and nodes (e.g., major
                                        retail destination at Yucaipa Boulevard and Oak Glen). Although
                                        these areas are not expected to accommodate major new projects,
                                        they are important parts of the local economy. A key objective of
                                        the General Plan is to maintain the economic vitality of these other
                                        areas and ensure that new development contributes to and
                                        complements existing development. The goals and policies of the
                                        economic development element apply throughout the City, not just
                                        in areas described as a likely focus of new development.

THE LOCAL ECONOMY
Yucaipa’s local economy has competitive strengths and economic
opportunities in many sectors, including manufacturing, education,
health care and medical services, and professional services. The
General Plan seeks to establish and maintain a balanced diversity
across these four sectors. This section addresses the objective of
increasing the number and quality of jobs in Yucaipa by focusing
on base sectors of the economy (e.g., manufacturing, construction,
and light industrial) although many of the policies apply to the
nonbase (e.g., commercial, service, etc.) sectors.
Job Creation
The City’s economic development strategic plan establishes job
creation as a key economic development goal. Three primary
strategies for creating sustainable long-term jobs in the community
and reducing out-commuting to other communities for work are
business expansion, business attraction, and business creation.
Business Expansion
Generally, three-quarters of all new jobs in a regional economy are
                                                                        Sorenson Engineering, the City’s largest

rounded and successful economic development programs dedicate          manufacturing for a range of applications.
a majority of resources to working with existing businesses. In
economic development terms, the expansion of existing businesses
yields the largest return on investment in creating new jobs.
Complementing business expansion is local business retention.
Keeping existing jobs from moving to another community is far
easier and more cost-effective than attracting new jobs.
Yucaipa influences the local economy through land and facilities.

                                           Business Attraction
                                           Business attraction serves important roles. First, bringing new
                                           businesses to the community can help diversify the local economy
                                           and protect it against shocks affecting individual economic sectors.
                                           Second, realizing the community’s vision for a more complete
                                           offering of local goods and services, which is established as a key
                                           economic development goal in Section 5.2, requires new business
                                           in addition to even more successful existing businesses. Finally, the
                                           publicity generated by the arrival of new businesses helps build the
                                           City’s image as a dynamic and business-friendly community.
                                           A key business attraction strategy is quality of life. From exemplary
                                           parks and recreation to education and public safety, Yucaipa offers
                                           some of the highest quality of life in the Inland Empire. While
                                           potential new businesses may look at a regional labor force when
                                           evaluating where to locate, they will also prioritize their locational
                                           decisions on the quality of life available to managers and top-level
                                           employees that will transfer to operate a new facility. The City
                                           recognizes the importance of quality of life and the effectiveness of
                                           measures to improve it as a business attraction strategy.
Yucaipa’s market night draws out residents Business Creation
        and visitors to the Uptown.
                                           Although economic development investments to assist start-up
                                           business create fewer new jobs and investment, new businesses
                                           provide value to the community beyond jobs. New business not
                                           only brings new income to Yucaipa, but more importantly, creates
                                           wealth that is invested locally. These dollars are recirculated into
                                           the local economy, adding additional services, products, and
                                           revenues. Finally, new business leaders have greater incentive to be
                                           involved in the community where they live and do business.
                                           The City of Yucaipa supports start-up businesses through the
                                           provision of low-cost space for start-up companies. The purpose of
                                           the Business Incubator Center is to assist new, expanding, or
                                           fledgling small businesses by providing affordable space, shared
                                           administrative/office services and equipment, along with
                                           management assistance services, thus helping businesses succeed,
                                           creating new jobs and bringing new dollars into the area economy.
                                           The Chamber of Commerce also partners with Yucaipa to help
                                           create and support local businesses in the community.
                                           The following goal and policies addresses the objective of
                                           increasing the number and quality of jobs in Yucaipa through
                                           business attraction, retention, expansion and investment.

           resources and exercise discretionary land-use authority
           to support the retention, expansion, and attraction of

  5. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
                                           RETAIL, ENTERTAINMENT, AND TOURISM
                                           Yucaipa is a desirable place to live. However, because Yucaipa is a
                                           newer community and near the edge of the urban area, the City is
                                           underserved by retail, dining, and entertainment business. Yucaipa
                                           residents travel to other communities to spend the majority of
                                           dollars for retail goods, except health and personal care services.
                                           Thus, expanding commercial development—particularly retail,
                                           entertainment/arts, tourism and hospitality—is a primary goal.
                                           Retail and Experience-Oriented Shopping
                                           The traditional retail sector of the nation’s economy is in transition.
                                           Shopping through the internet, often referred to as “e-commerce”,
                                           continues to increase, rising to 7 percent of all retail sales in 2015.
                                           This trend is also responsible for communities losing retail sales.
                                           Although there is no clear consensus on the future of e-commerce,
                                           it is clear that Americans will make fewer and fewer purchases at
                                           traditional bricks-and-mortar stores. While no community can alter
                                           this national trend, Yucaipa has distinct advantages to capture
                                           local sales through offering experience-oriented shopping.
                                           Experience-oriented shopping offers advantages over traditional
                                           shopping. In experience-oriented shopping, the experience is of
                                           equal if not greater importance than the material need for a good
                                           or service. The experiential value may accrue from socialization with
                                           friends, entertainment, and the quality of the place. Experience-
                                           oriented shopping thus becomes a destination trip, drawing from a
                                           community or regional trade area, even though it might not offer a
                                           corresponding amount of retail square footage. Downtowns,
                                           lifestyle centers, and malls all attempt to provide this experience.
                                           Full-service restaurants are often a key part of the business mix that
                                           defines an experience-oriented shopping area. They have been very
                                           important in the initial transformation of older downtowns into
                                           destinations because people are often willing to go farther when
                                           looking for a fine meal. As destinations evolve, restaurants become
                                           part of the synergistic mix, becoming only one part of a visitor’s
Uptown streetscapes, dining, and of stores outing. Specialized retailers, unique goods and services, and
  create experience-oriented shopping.     entertainment are the backbone of a well-developed destination.
                                           The Uptown is focused on providing experience-oriented shopping,
                                           with walkable streets, attractive shops selling a wide range of
                                           goods and services, places to sit and socialize, restaurants, and
                                           other places of interest. Periodic festivals also make the Uptown
                                           known as a destination. Crafton Hills College represents another
                                           opportunity. With a growing student population, easy access from
                                           Yucaipa Boulevard, and planned development of this site, this
                                           future hub of activity has the potential to be a dynamic commercial
                                           destination and place for experience-oriented shopping.

Entertainment and Tourism
Entertainment, tourism, and hospitality services represent a second
way for improving retail sales and commercial activity in Yucaipa,
including sectors traditionally underserved in the community.
Coupled with Yucaipa’s experience-oriented shopping and regional
draws, Yucaipa is well positioned for growth in these sectors.
Entertainment and the Arts
Yucaipa recognizes the importance of entertainment and cultural
arts to the development of its local economy and quality of life.
Communities that invest in entertainment and arts can reap the
benefits of increased jobs, economic growth, and quality of life. Art
and cultural organizations and the associated special events held
by these organizations can also incentivize secondary event-related
spending by their audiences, who spend dollars in the many
restaurants, hotels, retail stores, and other businesses in Yucaipa.
Yucaipa looks forward to strengthening its cultural arts program as
a key community objective and economic stimulus in the Uptown.          Regional attractions draw visitors to
The development of a Performing Arts Center and Cultural Arts         Yucaipa from across southern California.
Center will attract visitors from the broader region, strengthen the
local economy, and improve property values in Uptown. The City’s
emphasis on arts also allows greater synergy with the theatre arts
already present in Uptown and professional degrees offered by
Crafton Hills College in music, art, and theatre.
Tourism and Hospitality
Yucaipa’s location as a gateway to Oak Glen and San Bernardino
National Forest draws thousands of visitors to Yucaipa annually.
Yucaipa is also home to local tourist attractions, including state
and regional parks, the Uptown district, and recreational events.
The City of Yucaipa also maintains an active schedule of festivals
(e.g., Music and Arts Festival), sporting and recreational events,
and other venues year round that draw day and weekend visitors.
These amenities provide a strong base for the tourism industry.
The hospitality sector works in tandem with tourism, and is
responsible for supplying services for visitors and local tourists.
Hospitality services include lodging and other accommodations as
well as ancillary services used by tourists, including food and
beverage, transportation, leisure activities, and entertainment. The
Chamber of Commerce and City of Yucaipa, through its Explore
Yucaipa Program and other efforts, coordinate their marketing and
programming efforts to attract and provide services for tourism.
The following goal and policies are intended to support a growing
retail, entertainment, and tourism sector in Yucaipa.
                                                                      CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 5-11

                                                                                      5. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
FREEWAY CORRIDOR
With more than 100,000 daily vehicles along the Interstate 10 and
significant increases projected in vehicles over the next 20 years,
the Freeway Corridor is the most undercapitalized economic
development asset in Yucaipa. With its vacant land resources,
strategic location along the freeway, and potential for residential
and nonresidential uses, the development of the Freeway Corridor
is critical to the long-term economic and fiscal health of Yucaipa.
Interstate 10 offers a prime economic opportunity to locate new
business in southern Yucaipa. The Freeway Corridor Specific Plan is
intended to allow office and retail development near the I-10,
along with residential neighborhoods in the interior. If Yucaipa is
going to attract large-format retailers, they will most likely desire to
locate in the Freeway Corridor area, with its good access and
visibility from the freeway. Similarly, larger office-based businesses
will seek to locate in the plan area, with easy access to the freeway.
Capitalizing on opportunities in the Freeway Corridor will require
major investments in physical infrastructure. These improvements
include water, drainage, freeway ramps, and roads among others.
Although impact fees would ultimately pay for most of the
infrastructure costs, making the upfront investment will require
creative approaches, including a variety of funding and financing
mechanisms, and public investment. This will require coordination
with property owners, the City, and other stakeholders.
Economic development strategies for the Freeway Corridor, and in
particular areas already developed, should consider the role of
visual improvements. Increased attention to the design and
appearance of buildings, roadway improvements, signage, and
landscaping will improve how employers and retailers view Yucaipa
as a desirable place for business. The City seeks practical ways to
improve aesthetics of these community features that can also yield
an economic benefit to commerce within the Freeway Corridor.
GOAL ED-3: FREEWAY CORRIDOR
A fully developed Freeway Corridor that provides
office-based employment, accommodates large-
format retailers, and attracts consumer spending
from the region while maintaining and enhancing a
unique sense of place in Yucaipa.

                                                       from the I-10 freeway and conveys the image of

                                         LAND USE AND FISCAL BALANCE
                                         Managing a municipal corporation is a challenging endeavor.
                                         Cities, like businesses, have to manage their operations to preserve
                                         the bottom line. Both have costs for their workforce, facilities
                                         maintenance, needed goods and services, and utilities. The ability
                                         to attract, retain, and develop a skilled and qualified workforce
                                         drives the long-term ability of businesses and local governments to
                                         effectively control costs and maintain quality.
                                         Unlike most governmental agencies, however, many private sector
                                         businesses have vigorous top-line strategies—marketing and
                                         advertising, innovating new products and services, and expanding
                                         geographic trade areas. These top-line strategies drive revenues
                                         that flow into businesses, allowing the development of new
                                         product lines and services that benefit customers. In addition,
                                         businesses with growing top-line revenues do not have to focus as
                                         ruthlessly on bottom-line operations management to remain viable.
                                         In reality, municipal governments also manage their top line. Many
                                         do not realize they have a top line, and most do not talk about it
                                         as such. Nevertheless, for local governments, how land is used in
                                         their cities—for homes, production of goods and services, or leisure
                                         activities—determines almost exclusively how much money city hall
                                         takes in each year and has available for reinvesting in the
                                         community. In addition, each city’s general plan is its top-line
                                         management strategy, whether or not they treat it that way.
                                         The economic analysis for the General Plan identified two trends: 1)
                                         Yucaipa has a low level of inflation-adjusted taxable retail sales per
                                         household compared to neighboring cities and San Bernardino
                                         County; and 2) the City’s total inflation-adjusted revenue per
                                         household is nearly flat. This indicates that revenues are keeping
                                         pace with population growth. However, if trends continue, there
                                         will be limited revenue for new initiatives or increased investment
                                         in public facilities and services. The Economic Development

Element, in conjunction with other elements of the general plan,
intend to improve performance on these top-line revenue issues.
The City’s policies for managing its fiscal resources are established
in City Council resolutions and through the budgeting process.
Yucaipa has two contingency accounts to serve as buffers against
severe changes in the local economic environment; 1) the General
Fund Emergency Contingency (up to 20% of the annual General
Fund Expenditure Budget) and 2) Reserve for Economic
Uncertainties Contingency. These fiscal policies have resulted in
sufficient revenues to set aside for economic contingencies.
Through the following fiscal-balance goals and policies, the City
seeks to maintain its tradition of excellent fiscal management and
allow for a mix of land uses that generate increasing levels of
revenues in excess of demands for public facilities and services.
GOAL ED-4: FISCAL BALANCE
A fiscally well-balanced City that generates sufficient
revenues to continuously reinvest in public facilities,
infrastructure, and community services that support
the premier quality of life in Yucaipa.
Policies
ED-4.1        Fiscal Return of Land Use and Development. Ensure
              that     shorter-term       actions    and     longer-term
              development patterns result in a mix of land use and

5. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
                                         ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                                         Yucaipa’s economic development program is the set of policies,
                                         programs, and projects undertaken to achieve desired goals.
                                         Economic programs typically help businesses with the three factors
                                         of production (land and facilities, labor, and capital) and their
                                         overall management. While Yucaipa can greatly influence land and

                                         beneficial for the City, its tax revenues, and its workforce. Yucaipa
                                         will primarily address the availability of land and facilities through
                                         planning and zoning; investment in infrastructure; and partnering
                                         with real estate brokers, developers, and property owners.
                                         Securing a quality workforce is an ongoing priority for businesses.
                                         Workforce training is typically provided by regional government
                                         entities, like the San Bernardino County Workforce Investment
                                         Board, with funding from the federal government. Yucaipa’s
                                         primary role in workforce training and development will be to link
                                         local businesses to regional programs and to develop partnerships
                                         with the Yucaipa-Calimesa Joint Unified School District, Crafton
                                         Hills College, and other educational institutions.
                                         When businesses invest in new products and services and need to
                                         expand operations, a significant cash investment is often required.
                                         Because businesses have typically invested in new products and
                                         services, they often lack capital to expand facilities and operations.
                                         Cities can provide financial assistance directly through gap
                                         financing or industrial revenue bonds, or indirectly through
                                         enterprise, empowerment, or foreign trade zones. Yucaipa assists
                                         local businesses in finding sources of capital for facilities.
                                         Local economic development often helps businesses improve
                                         management skills and operations to become more productive.
                                         This may involve linking them with small business development
                                         centers; providing venues for business networking; coordinating
                                         marketing activities for clusters of related businesses; or providing
                                         an ombudsman to assist in negotiating the local, state, and federal
                                         regulatory environment. Yucaipa’s role in this regard will be to
                                         work with the Inland Empire Small Business Development Center
                                         and other, similar partners to explore ways to improve access to
                                         and increase the availability of services for businesses in Yucaipa.

Workforce Development
Yucaipa recognizes that economic growth and development comes
from the ability of residents not only to work, but to innovate.
Therefore, the City of Yucaipa prioritizes development of its
workforce. This includes helping to create appropriate job
opportunities that benefit Yucaipa’s workforce as well as enabling
the local workforce to obtain the skills needed to meet job
requirements of existing and future businesses.
Investments in human capital provide significant future returns—
returns to the local economy through improved labor productivity
and competitiveness; returns to individuals through improved
earnings and wealth; job creation, by attracting new business; and
returns to the community through greater spending and tax
revenue. Yucaipa thus seeks to support investments that augment
workforce skills, knowledge, health, or other productive attributes.
Local efforts in education include:
  + Adult Education. The City supports efforts of local and regional
     partners to provide opportunities for high school degrees,
     continued education supporting adults, occupational training,
     and other skills that improve workforce readiness.
  + Pathway Education. The City supports and participates in
     Yucaipa High School’s linked learning academies in health,
     STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math), computer
     technology, and medical services.                               Crafton Hills College provides education
                                                                            and training opportunities.
  + College Education. Crafton Hills College offers workforce
     training and certification and graduates hundreds of students
     each year for high-demand positions in health care,
     paramedics, fire services, and other professions.
  + Four-Year Degrees. The City actively partners with Crafton Hills
     College and other institutions to expand educational
     opportunities, including four-year graduate and postgraduate
     programs on the CHC campus and other satellite campuses.
Economic Development Strategy
Yucaipa’s economic development strategic plan (EDSP) is the City’s
approach to improving the local economy and workforce readiness.
The EDSP identifies additional shorter-term goals and objectives,
and provides a detailed plan for implementation. The Economic
Development Advisory Committee (EDAC) periodically evaluates the
EDSP’s progress, recommends updates, and advises the City
Council on potential investments in economic development
activities. In tandem with the EDAC, the City partners with the
Yucaipa Valley Chamber of Commerce on actions and activities that
further goals of this Element and the EDSP.

INTRODUCTION
A well-designed transportation network enables quality of life.
Yucaipans travel for virtually every service and amenity—whether to
get to work, obtain medical care, attend school, or participate in
recreational, social, and religious pursuits. Our ability to access the
variety of places and activities we depend on is not possible
without a safe, functional, and connected transportation system.

Yucaipa encompasses a wealth of natural environs, open space,             + Comprehensive Street Network
and distinctive communities that present unique opportunities and         + Transportation Network Operation
challenges for the delivery of transportation services. Although
Yucaipa’s location ensures that automobile travel will remain the         + Active Transportation
primary choice for getting around, the City acknowledges the need         + Transit Service
for alternative means of travel. At the same time, Yucaipa is             + Scenic Transportation Corridors
committed to improving transportation options in ways that
preserve Yucaipa’s natural environment and community appeal.
The transportation element is Yucaipa’s plan for a balanced,
multimodal transportation network. The element is intended to
facilitate safe and efficient movement of automobiles, bicyclists,
pedestrians, and public transit riders. This element provides
guidance to support the needs of business, emergency service
providers, and other roadway users. The element also recognizes
key objectives for improving air quality, reducing the environmental
impacts of vehicular travel, and achieving other community goals
such as expanded transit service and pedestrian mobility.

                                                                                           6. TRANSPORTATION
TRANSPORTATION PLAN
Adjacent land use often influences the functionality and character
of the street environment. A well-integrated transportation
network acknowledges the complementary relationship between
travel needs and land use. Because of Yucaipa’s natural topography
and distance from some major employment centers, Yucaipans
must rely on automobile travel. As a result, the City recognizes the
need to invest in appropriate strategies that improve roadway
efficiency while maintaining the community’s identity.
Yucaipa’s transportation network is designed to accommodate
travel demand and minimize excessive delays and traffic congestion
during peak hours. Street design standards specify the width and
other roadway features to ensure safety and provide sufficient
roadway capacity to accommodate travel demand. As streets are
further improved, the City is establishing a network of streets that
is optimally managed, provides appropriate linkages between
communities, and improves mobility for its residents.
Street Classifications
Yucaipa’s street network has been developed based upon a
hierarchy of roadway classifications, each with different design
standards. This layered approach allows the City to vary the design
of streets to allow for different travel speeds, modal options (e.g.,
pedestrian and bicycling), and priorities. These standard street
classifications, along with context-sensitive design parameters
described later, provide the backbone of the street network.
Each roadway classification, right-of-way, and its corresponding
                                                                      Yucaipa’s roundabouts help to calm traffic
functionality are described below.                                      and create a pedestrian environment in
                                                                             the historic Uptown District.
Freeway/Interstate
Freeways are multi-lane, limited access, high speed roadways
dedicated to serve regional and interregional vehicular travel.
Access to freeways is restricted to interchange ramps. Freeways are
under the jurisdiction of the California Department of
Transportation (Caltrans), with specific right-of-way requirements.
Interstate 10 runs along the southern edge of Yucaipa.
Major Arterial Highways
Major arterials serve regional traffic and the right-of-way
dimensions are consistent with the County Master Plan of
Highways. This street classification is not a common street type in
Yucaipa but it is included to be consistent with San Bernardino
County standards. It covers Mill Creek Road (Highway 38) near the
northern city limits of Yucaipa. Typical right-of-way is 120 feet.
                                                                      CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 6-3

6. TRANSPORTATION
                                        Major Highway
                                        Major highways are intended to serve through-traffic movement
                                        across urban areas or to major traffic generators and attractors.
                                        They are subject to controlled access from properties fronting the
                                        right-of-way. Major highways are designed to accommodate
                                        between four to six lanes of traffic, bicycle lanes, with a right-of-
                                        way width of 104 feet and a curb-to-curb width of 80 to 92 feet.
                                        Secondary Highway (Arterial)
                                        Secondary highways serve traffic from collector streets and major
                                        highways. They are subject to controlled access from the properties
                                        fronting on the right of way. Secondary highways are designed to
                                        accommodate four lanes of traffic, bicycle lanes, right-of-way of 80
                                        to 88 feet, curb-to-curb width of 64 feet, and sidewalks.
                                        Collector Street
                                        Collector streets circulate localized traffic and move vehicles from
                                        local residential roads to secondary highways and arterials.
                                        Collector streets are designed to accommodate two to four lanes of
                                        traffic with a typical right-of-way width of 66 feet, curb-to curb
                                        width of 44 feet, and sidewalks on both sides of the street.
                                        Controlled/Limited Access Collector
                                        A controlled/limited access collector has the same dimensions as a
                                        collector street. This roadway differs in the number and frequency
                                        of permitted access points and driveways from private property.
                                        Reducing or regulating private property access helps to reduce
                                        traffic conflicts and optimize traffic flow.
                                        Residential Collector
                                        A residential collector is a modified collector street. While serving
                                        to circulate local traffic, the typical segment has only one lane in
                                        each direction, a right-of-way width of 60 to 66 feet, and
                                        sidewalks on both sides. This classification is used for residential
                                        streets requiring a narrow curb-to-curb width for traffic calming.
                                        Local Streets
                                        Local streets provide direct access to properties, distribute traffic to
                                        and from arterials and collector streets, and discourage through-
                                        traffic. Local streets are designed to accommodate two lanes of
                                        traffic, with a right-of-way width of 60 feet, curb-to-curb width of
                                        36 to 40 feet, and sidewalks on both sides of the streets.

COMPREHENSIVE STREET NETWORK
Yucaipa acknowledges the importance of a comprehensive and
well-connected transportation network to support residential and
nonresidential growth, and accommodate current and future travel
demand associated with growth. Beyond supporting the land use
plan, Yucaipa’s transportation network is also designed to
accommodate         other    needs—concerns          with   surrounding
environment, the needs of business, and other roadway users.
Supporting the Land Use Plan
As development continues in accordance with the General Plan,
Yucaipa’s transportation plan is intended to support these efforts.
In some cases, this level of development will necessitate the
construction of additional roads. In other cases, existing roadways
will need improvements to accommodate projected use.
Yucaipa continues to make transportation improvements for:
  + Improving Access to Rural Areas. Yucaipa has areas of the
     community that are rural and have limited access. Roadway
     and multi-purpose trail improvements are needed to improve
     accessibility and connectivity to portions of the North Bench,
     Yucaipa Hills, and other areas of the community.
  + New Development Areas. Areas planned for extensive new
     development, such as the Freeway Corridor Specific Plan, will
     require an extensive internal network of local roads and major
     arterials to provide access to residential neighborhoods and to
     commercial areas adjacent to the freeway.
  + Infill within Developed Areas. With large tracts of vacant land
     available, new roads will be required. For instance, planned
     infill development for the Wilson Creek Specific Plan or similar
     larger developments may necessitate new roads or
     improvements to existing roads in order to provide access and
     to adequately accommodate increased volumes of traffic.
  + Selected Infrastructure Projects. Achieving other General Plan
     goals (e.g., promoting economic development) will require
     targeted infrastructure projects. This might include designated
     truck routes, freeway interchanges, and supporting facilities,
     such as park-ride lots, transit facilities, and multi-purpose trails.
  + Retrofitting Roadways. Yucaipa is also retrofitting roads to
     improve efficiency of travel across the city. This includes
     projects to widen Yucaipa Boulevard, install roundabouts or
     other intersection improvements, and install sidewalks and
     bicycle lanes to encourage alternative modes of transportation.
                                                                           CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 6-7

                                        Neighborhood Context and Uses
                                        The General Plan and public works standards establish design
                                        standards (width, lanes, parking, sidewalks, etc.) for different types
                                        of roads. These standards should reflect the function of particular
                                        streets, the character and design of the neighborhood/district, and
                                        the needs of roadway users. Yucaipa’s street standards are
                                        intended to help manage congestion, facilitate travel, and comply
                                        with local and county regulations.
                                        Improvement Service Level
                                        Care is also taken to address the varied needs of the many
                                        neighborhoods and districts (commercial, residential, or mixed) and
                                        the overall character of development from rural to suburban. The
                                        City’s “Improvement Level System” (ILS) is designed to allow for a
                                        varying level of transportation infrastructure based on the existing
                                        and projected land use patterns and service needs. Four specific
                                        levels of transportation improvements are applied to different areas
                                        in the city depending on the proposed land use plan.
                                        Level 1 applies to areas with a greater level of development, such
                                        as Uptown and Central Core. Full curb, gutters, sidewalks,
                                        drainage, and lighting are typical improvements for these areas.
                                        Level 2 applies to areas outside the Central Core, and more
                                        developed portions of Wildwood Canyon. Level 3 applies to low
                                        density areas (such as certain North Bench neighborhoods) where
                                        lots are generally at least one acre in size. Typical features include
                                        rolled curb, gutters, natural parkway/multipurpose trail areas, and
                                        natural drainage features. Level 4 applies to rural areas where
                                        infrastructure is provided only for public health and safety.
                                        Multimodal Circulation
                                        In response to state mandates, such as the Complete Streets Act,
                                        many cities are creating multimodal transportation networks that
                                        not only provide efficient movement of vehicular traffic, but also
                                        prioritize the safe movement of different roadway users. In fact, a
                                        truly integrated circulation network considers the needs of all users
                                        of roadways—pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, and motorists.
                                        Streets that accommodate all of these modes can maximize the
                                        social and environmental benefits of transportation infrastructure
                                        Yucaipa’s approach to multimodal transportation varies by context.
                                        When streets have sufficient right-of-way and are well traveled,
                                        they are equipped with features that make them complete and
                                        useable for different roadway users. In other cases, Yucaipa
                                        employs a complete network approach that prioritizes modes of
                                        travel along streets. For example, streets designated with on-street

Economic Development and Access Needs
Yucaipa’s transportation network design is also intended to
address other considerations. For Yucaipa to improve the economic
competitiveness of its Dunlap Industrial Corridor, Uptown, and
Freeway Corridor, trucking routes are essential. Ongoing
improvements to emergency access are also important.
Trucking Routes
Yucaipa’s commercial and industrial sectors provide job, goods,
and services for residents and businesses. Over the life of the
General Plan, new development in Yucaipa, particularly in the
Freeway Corridor, will result in increases in population,
nonresidential square footage, and demand for goods and services.
A well-functioning network of truck routes will allow materials and
goods to be delivered to and from Yucaipa businesses.
Yucaipa’s truck routes are located on secondary and major
highways that serve primary business districts or activity centers,
connect with freeways for regional access, or connect to
neighboring communities. Truck routes include:
   + Dunlap Boulevard and Calimesa Boulevard
   + Oak Glen and Live Oak Canyon Road from I-10 to city limits
   + Yucaipa Boulevard from Oak Glen Road to city limits
   + Sand Canyon/14th Street, from Oak Glen Road to city limits
   + Portions of Bryant, 5th, California, and D Street
Emergency Access
Yucaipa’s diverse topography presents a challenge for ensuring safe
access for fire and emergency service vehicles and police response.
Certain areas in the North Bench have less right-of-way to
accommodate all emergency service vehicles. In other areas, certain
roadway segments are incomplete. Paved roads may abruptly
transition to unpaved roads, making safe passage challenging
during inclement weather or other poor road conditions. The City
seeks to remove these safety impediments wherever feasible.
In other areas, roadway improvements are needed to eliminate or
mitigate low water crossings where heavy rains result in flooding.
Future development in other areas of Yucaipa, such as Yucaipa
Hills, will also have access concerns. Yucaipa’s Hazard Mitigation
Plan identifies the specific low water crossings, and the City’s
capital improvement program contains a schedule for the planning,
designing, and funding of projects that improve emergency access.
The following goals and policies support future growth, while
considering the needs of all user groups and community character.

  + LOS B (Stable flow). Other roadway users begin to be
     noticeable. Freedom to select desired speeds is relatively
     unaffected, but there is a slight decline in freedom to
     maneuver in the road. The general level of comfort and
     convenience is somewhat less than at LOS A, because the
     presence of other users begins to affect individual behavior.
  + LOS C (Stable flow). This LOS marks the beginning in which the
     operation of individual users becomes affected. The selection
     of speed is affected by the presence of other drivers, and
     maneuvering within the traffic stream requires substantial
     vigilance on the part of the user. The general level of comfort
     and convenience declines noticeably at this level.
  + LOS D (High density, but less stable flow). Speed and freedom
     to maneuver are severely restricted, and the driver or
     pedestrian experiences a generally poor level of comfort and
     convenience. Small increases in traffic flow will generally cause
     operational problems at this level. Less stable flow is generally
     not problematic for a short duration.

     speeds are reduced to a low value. Freedom to maneuver
     within the traffic stream is extremely difficult and generally
     accomplished by forcing a vehicle or pedestrian to “give way.”
     Comfort and convenience levels are poor. Operations at this
     level are usually unstable because small increases in flow or
     minor variations within the stream will cause breakdown.

                                         to manage level of service along road segments and intersections.
                                         This includes widening roadways where needed, adopting tailored
                                         roadway standards to accommodate nonmotorized transportation,

Intelligent Transportation System
As communities continue to develop, planners and engineers
increasingly look toward technology to manage congestion.
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) involve the design, analysis,
and control of information technology for transportation systems.
Transportation systems are invariably complex and involve the
interaction of humans, vehicles, information technology, and
physical infrastructure. ITS can play an integral role in the
maximizing the ability of transportation systems to provide efficient
and enhanced mobility services for all modes of travel.
Local examples of ITS projects include traffic signal coordination
projects along major roadways. For instance, the City has
implemented traffic signal coordination along Yucaipa Boulevard to
help reduce traffic congestion and improve traffic flow. Other
arterials with multiple consecutive traffic signals, including Oak
Glen Road and Sand Canyon Road, may also be candidates for this
type of ITS traffic signal coordination and improvement, which can
reduce traffic congestion and vehicle emissions. Yucaipa uses ITS
solutions where feasible and beneficial for the community.
Sustainability
California’s Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (SB32) is one of
the more defining legislative acts in recent decades. It requires that
local governments statewide address the issues of climate change,
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and plan for a more sustainable
transportation system. Increasing concerns over greenhouse gases
and climate change, urban runoff from roadways, and improving          Yucaipa’s program to install sidewalks has
water quality also underscores the importance of rethinking how        improved safety in many neighborhoods.
transportation infrastructure affects the environment.
Yucaipa acknowledges that roadway infrastructure may result in a
wide range of environmental challenges—such as stormwater
management, heat island effects, energy use, and waste
management. The City actively seeks cost-effective practices that
will improve the sustainability of the transportation system. Among
others, techniques include the use of pervious pavements and low
impact strategies to manage stormwater, energy-efficient street
lighting systems, and more-reflective pavement surfaces and
landscaping treatment to reduce heat island effects.
The following goal and policies further a more sustainable and
efficient transportation network that balances multiple priorities.

ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION
California state law has changed the landscape of traditional
transportation planning, shifting the focus away from a design
philosophy that favored the automobile and optimized traffic flow,
and toward a more comprehensive street design approach. The
Complete Streets Act of 2008 requires that cities plan for a
multimodal transportation network that serves motorized and
nonmotorized modes of transportation. As such, Yucaipa’s street
system is designed to also encourage and promote bicycling and
walking as viable and alternative means of transportation.
Bicycle Transportation
Yucaipa’s multipurpose trails provide opportunities for recreational
bicyclists to enjoy expansive scenic views and the natural
environment. Yucaipa acknowledges that a comprehensive, safe,
and well-maintained bikeway network with supporting facilities has
multiple benefits. It can help to increase the mode share for
bicycling. Reducing the number of short vehicle trips by shifting
those trips to bicycling helps improve circulation and reduce         Yucaipa continues to secure
greenhouse gas emissions, and contributes to a healthier city.           millions in grants to fund
                                                                      sidewalks; build safe routes
Therefore, Yucaipa provides opportunities for bicyclists to enjoy
                                                                        to schools; improve multi-
scenic views and the environment and travel to community
                                                                      purpose trails; and invest in
destinations—parks and schools, Uptown, and other destinations.
Bicycle networks included several types of routes.                             projects that improve
                                                                         accessibility, connectivity,
   + Class I Bike Path. These are off-street paved pathways for            and safety of the roads.
     exclusive use by bicyclists and pedestrians, with cross-flows of
     motorists minimized. Yucaipa maintains two miles of Class I
     bike paths along Oak Glen Road.
   + Class II Bike Lane. These provide a restricted right-of-way
     designated for (semi)exclusive use of bicycles, with through-
     travel by vehicles or pedestrians prohibited. Yucaipa has over
     25 miles of Class II bike lanes throughout the community.
   + Class III Bike Route. These are on-street signed or marked (or
     pavement striping where appropriate) bicycle routes along or
     adjacent to roads shared by bicyclists and vehicles. Class III
     routes extend 18 miles along Yucaipa’s residential streets.
   + Class IV Separated Bikeways. These provide a right-of-way
     designated exclusively for bicycle use and which are protected
     from vehicular traffic by grade separation, flexible posts,
     physical barriers, on-street parking, or other means.
Yucaipa continues to invest in projects that will enhance the quality
of life for its residents and provide infrastructure investments that
support bicycling as a low cost, healthy, and sustainable
transportation option for the community.

                                            Pedestrian Transportation
                                            Virtually every trip in Yucaipa begins and ends with walking.
                                            Therefore, the pedestrian environment affects all residents and
                                            visitors—whether driving or riding transit, each individual is a
                                            pedestrian at some point in their journey. Adequate pedestrian
                                            infrastructure, together with land uses that promote pedestrian
                                            activities, can help increase walking as a means of transportation,
                                            recreation, as well as exercise, and can consequently provide
                                            significant health benefits to those who are able to participate.
                                            Yucaipa is committed to developing an interconnected pedestrian
                                            network that focuses on the safe and efficient movement of people
                                            regardless of age and ability. Over the past decade, the City has
                                            secured grants for pedestrian projects and was recently awarded
                                            $2.1 million from Caltrans for Safe Routes to School projects. The
                                            grants also allowed Yucaipa to invest in pedestrian projects that
                                            focus on improving accessibility, connectivity, and safety. These
                                            projects included the installation of ADA accessible ramps,
                                            pedestrian signage, signals, and striping improvements.
                                            Neighborhood Traffic Safety
Radar speed feedback signs help to remind   Although Yucaipa does not experience gridlock like many urban
motorists to drive safely in neighborhoods. areas, managing traffic, congestion, and safety concerns are still
                                            important. Local residential streets may be subject to cut-through
                                            traffic, excessive vehicle speeds, and above-average traffic volumes.
                                            In response to these concerns, using the City’s Neighborhood
                                            Traffic Calming Program, the City develops Neighborhood Traffic
                                            Management Plans. To alleviate concerns, the City may incorporate
                                            a range of improvements—including signage, striping, speed
                                            humps, signals, and other traffic calming strategies.
                                            Providing safe routes through neighborhoods can encourage
                                            parents to allow children to walk or bicycle to and from school. The
                                            City of Yucaipa works with the Yucaipa-Calimesa Joint Unified
                                            School District to develop safe and designated routes for walking
                                            or bicycling to and from school. The City prepares recommended
                                            routes and prioritizes improvements to the safe routes to school as
                                            part of the annual capital improvement program. The police
                                            department also holds bicycle rodeos and other programs at
                                            schools to teach safe walking and bicycling practices.
                                            Figure T-2, Bikeway Network, illustrates Yucaipa’s bicycle network.
                                            The multipurpose trail network is featured in the Parks, Recreation,
                                            Trails, and Open Space Element of the General Plan.
                                            The following goal and policies further the City’s efforts to create
                                            an interconnected, convenient, and accessible bicycle network.

operates one freeway express route along the I-215. Beginning in           of air pollutants annually.
2015, the 209 freeway express route will link Montclair and San
Bernardino transit centers. Pending successful implementation and
ridership levels, Omnitrans has also identified the potential for
starting three additional freeway express routes, one of which
extends along the I-10 to its terminus in Redlands/Yucaipa.
Freeway express bus service focuses on serving commuter trips that
typically cover longer distances and operate during peak periods.
These routes provide an alternative to single-occupancy vehicle
trips and typically use high occupancy vehicle lanes along freeways.
Yucaipa’s existing transit center or another suitable location near
park and ride facilities could be a hub for a freeway express route.
Accessed by OmniGo and park-and-ride commuters, this facility is a
logical stop for an intracounty express bus route.
Park and Ride Facilities
Yucaipa supports ridesharing as a means of reducing the use of
personal automobiles, vehicle miles traveled, and air pollution.
Caltrans maintains an 80-space park-and-ride facility near the
interchange of Yucaipa Boulevard and Interstate 10, where vehicles
can park for free. Future park-and-ride sites for ridesharing will be
most appropriately located within or near major activity centers,
adjacent to the freeway, and/or at specific freeway interchanges.
Future development of the Freeway Corridor Specific Plan, along
with developments in Calimesa, will significantly increase the
number of job and residents near Interstate 10. These
developments are anticipated to increase the demand for transit.
Additional park-and-ride lots at appropriate locations along the I-
10 will improve the feasibility of extending freeway express routes
in the west valley to Yucaipa. Figure T-3, Transit Routes, details
existing and planned mass transportation routes servicing Yucaipa.

SCENIC TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS
Because of Yucaipa’s location in the foothills of the San Bernardino
Mountains, its natural topography lends itself to expansive views
for residents and visitors. Crafton Hills, El Dorado Ranch Park,
Wildwood Canyon State Park, Yucaipa Regional Park, and other
open space areas all provide exceptional views from the road.
Planning for the preservation of scenic resources and protection of
views from the roads is a high priority for the community.
Scenic Highways
A scenic route can be a highway, road, drive, or street that, in
addition to its transportation function, provides opportunities for
the enjoyment of natural and man-made scenic resources and
access or direct views to areas views of exceptional beauty, historic
or cultural interest. The counties of Riverside and San Bernardino
have designated highways where such roadways provide scenic
value worthy of preservation as scenic highways.
State and County Designated Scenic Highways
Scenic highways traversing through or connecting to the City are in
the State’s Master Plan for Scenic Highway Designation. Highway
38 traverses, which travels from Redlands through Yucaipa to the
San Bernardino Mountains is an official designated scenic highway
by the County of San Bernardino and State of California. Oak Glen
Road to the south of Yucaipa (in Riverside County) is a scenic
roadway that is eligible for official designation as a scenic highway.
                                                                         Oak Glen Road, a local scenic corridor,
Yucaipa Scenic Corridors                                                   offers panoramic views of the San

The Yucaipa General Plan establishes six scenic transportation
corridors or highways. These scenic corridors are: Yucaipa
Boulevard, Bryant Street, Oak Glen Road, Wildwood Canyon Road,
Sand Canyon Road (Yucaipa Boulevard to City limits), Live Oak
Canyon Road, and future spine roads in the Freeway Corridor
Specific Plan. Each of these roadways offers unparalleled views of
surrounding hills, mountains, and other natural features.
To protect scenic resources along these corridors, a Scenic
Resources Overlay District is applied to an area extending
approximately 200 feet on both sides of the ultimate road right-of-
way of State, County and City-designated Scenic Highways. Within
this area, development is subject to certain standards, including
building and structure placement, utilities, access drives,
landscaping, roads/walkways/parking, grading, and signage.

highways and their relationship to adjacent scenic highways.

Protecting the public’s health, safety, and welfare is a fundamental
goal of any municipality, and this goal is a central part of Yucaipa’s In This Element:
mission. Yucaipa is committed to protecting its residents from
natural and human-caused hazards due to geology, flooding,               + Geology and Seismic Safety
wildfires, severe weather, air pollution, and climate change. This       + Flood Safety
Public Safety Element is designed to address the community’s             + Fire Safety
safety, health, and welfare as they relate to these hazards.
                                                                         + Emergency Preparedness

buildings, and infrastructure systems, however, these features are
                                                                         + Air Quality and Climate Change
also the source of hazards. Earthquake faults that flank the hills
can trigger landslides. The streams and rivers that created the
“benches” and canyons over time can overflow channels and lead
to flooding. The grasslands covering the hills present a risk of
wildland fires. Even severe weather can present safety hazards.
In light of these concerns, this Public Safety Element is intended to:
1) recognize the local hazards associated with Yucaipa’s natural
environment (geology, landforms, waterways, and weather), and
2) identify methods to manage these risks and protect people,
property, infrastructure, and structures from harm. As the policies
and actions are implemented over the next 20 years, the City of
Yucaipa will be increasingly less impacted by disasters, and in the
process, become more self-reliant, sustainable, and prosperous.

7. PUBLIC SAFETY
                                        Purpose and Scope
                                        The Public Safety Element is a state-mandated general plan
                                        element that is intended to identify and protect the community
                                        from risks due to natural and human-caused hazards. The element
                                        addresses the following hazards with associated goals and policies:
                                          + Natural Hazards. Natural hazards include a range of seismic
                                             and geologic hazards, flooding hazards, wildland and urban
                                             fire hazards, and severe weather, most of which are caused by
                                             inclement weather or natural events.
                                          + Human-Caused Hazards. These include air pollution, climate

 An attractive, peaceful, and
 safe community                           + Emergency Preparedness. Emergency preparedness refers to
                                             the range of procedures, methods, and protocols the City of
 Health, safety, and well-                   Yucaipa uses to prepare for emergencies and disasters,
 being of our residents                      respond to them, and recover from them.
                                        Related Plans
                                        Yucaipa’s Public Safety Element is implemented by various plans for
                                        protecting the community. Some of these plans are provided by
                                        the City of Yucaipa; others are provided by other organizations.
                                          + Drainage and Flooding. The City’s Master Plan of Drainage
                                             (MPD) provides an assessment of drainage and infrastructure
                                             needs and a plan for the maintenance and construction of
                                             detention basins to protect from flooding hazards.
                                          + Fire Service Planning. The Yucaipa Fire Department, through a
                                             contract with the California Department of Forestry and Fire
                                             Protection (CAL FIRE), prepares a fire services plan to provide
                                             fire protection and emergency medical services to the city.
                                          + Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP). Yucaipa’s HMP identifies hazards
                                             and establishes a plan to prepare for emergencies and disasters
                                             and mitigate potential impacts. In accordance with Government
                                             Code §§8685.9 and 65302.6, the City is adopting the HMP
                                             concurrent with the General Plan. The City Manager or
                                             Applicant's Authorized Agent is authorized to make any revisions
                                             as required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
                                          + Emergency Operations Plan. The City’s Emergency Operations
                                             Plan provides a comprehensive organizational and procedural
                                             guide for preparing for, responding to, and recovering from
                                             natural disasters or human-caused emergencies.
                                        The next sections provide context for each topic, followed by goals,
                                        policies, and programs to achieve the General Plan vision.

GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC SAFETY
The City’s location in the Yucaipa Plain, and the Crafton and
Yucaipa Hills, coupled with the many streams that flow through
the community, has contributed to its naturally undulating terrain.
The natural forces (flooding, earthquakes, winds, etc.) responsible
for Yucaipa’s unique terrain also have the potential to damage
structures, roads, and utility systems as well as threaten people.
Geologic Hazards
The City rests primarily on alluvium deposited by the Yucaipa Creek
and its tributaries. Older deposits consisting of alluvial fan
conglomerate and other decomposed, clay-rich alluvia cover
Central Yucaipa and Dunlap Acres. Younger alluvial deposits cover
the river wash areas and Dunlap Acres west of Oak Glen Road.
Parts of west Yucaipa are on Reservoir Canyon Hill, which is
composed of crystalline rocks and older alluvium. Crafton Hills and
Yucaipa Hills are composed of crystalline and metamorphic rock.
Yucaipa’s geologic setting can, under certain circumstances,
present hazardous conditions. These hazards are most frequently
triggered by seismic or flood events.
   + Unstable Soils. Yucaipa’s clay soils and young, relatively low-
     compacted soils can shrink or swell depending on moisture
     content. This occurs particularly during flood or earthquake.
     Structures on these soils may experience shifting, cracking, and
     breaking damage as soils shrink, subside, or expand. Unstable
     soils are primarily adjacent to the drainage courses.
   + Slope Instability. Slope failures occur most often along steep
     canyons, hillsides, and channels and can be triggered by
     flooding and earthquakes. Although Yucaipa has a low to
     moderate potential, landslides have occurred in Crafton Hills
     and in northern Yucaipa. These areas are also subject to a
     higher risk of mud/debris flow due to the topography.            Excessive rainfall after a fire can lead to
                                                                      slope instability and mud/debris flows.
   + Ground Subsidence. Ground subsidence involves the settling of
     ground surface due to extraction of oil, gas, or groundwater.
     Although Yucaipa does not have extraction fields, the Yucaipa
     Basin is in overdraft and thus has a low to moderate potential
     for ground subsidence throughout the community. Isolated
     cases of ground subsidence have occurred in the past.
   + Soil Corrosiveness. Many studies in Yucaipa have documented
     the presence of corrosive soils, which are those with a low pH.
     Corrosive soils can be responsible for premature eroding of
     buried metal pipes and concrete foundations. In terms of
     location, Yucaipa’s soils can be corrosive on its adjacent
     hillsides, in Central Yucaipa, and portions of Dunlap Acres.
                                                                       CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 7-3

7. PUBLIC SAFETY
                                        Seismic Hazards
                                        Yucaipa is in a seismically active region. The San Andreas Fault and
                                        San Jacinto Fault Zone accommodate up to 80% of the slip rate
                                        between the North American and Pacific plates. The San
                                        Bernardino segment of the San Andreas transects the northern
                                        portion of the community along the base of Yucaipa Ridge. The
                                        San Andreas is the dominant fault in southern California and is
                                        capable of producing an 8.0 magnitude (M) earthquake, which is
                                        also capable of threatening property and lives.
                                        Yucaipa has surface traces of active faults capable of producing
                                        damaging earthquakes. The Chicken Hill Fault runs through west
                                        Yucaipa and parallels Oak Glen Road south of Yucaipa Boulevard.
                                        The Crafton Hills Fault runs along the southeast front of the
                                        Crafton Hills of Yucaipa. Northern Yucaipa is also transected by a
                                        series of fault lines, designated Alquist-Priolo Zones (AP zones).
                                        Among others, recent earthquakes include:
                                           + 2008 Chino Hills earthquake (M5.5)
                                           + 2005 Yucaipa earthquake (M4.9)
                                           + 2003 Big Bear earthquake (M5.4)
                                           + 2003 Yucaipa earthquake (M5.2)
                                           + 2001 Yucaipa earthquake (M5.1)
                                           + 1998 Crafton Hills earthquake (M4.5)
                                           + 1994 Highland earthquake (M5.0)
                                        Seismic hazards depend on the fault, soil types, and water table.
                                        Geologic hazards in Yucaipa include:
                                           + Ground Shaking. Yucaipa is subject to severe ground shaking
                                             due to fault ruptures along many of its active faults. The most
                                             intense shaking that could damage structures is expected from
                                             the San Andreas Fault, which passes along northern Yucaipa.
                                             Additional shaking could also occur adjacent to or near the
                                             many active faults and trace faults crossing the community.
                                           + Liquefaction. Yucaipa is generally susceptible to liquefaction,
                                             which is the loss of the strength or cohesion of soil. This can
                                             occur on young, loose, unconsolidated sediments. Whereas
                                             much of the City has liquefaction concerns, the only area at
                                             high risk of liquefaction is near Mill Creek Canyon, where
                                             groundwater levels are within 50 feet of the surface.
                                           + Seismically Induced Settlement. Much of Yucaipa is underlain
                                             by young, unconsolidated alluvial deposits and artificial fill that
                                             may be susceptible to seismically induced settlement. Sparse
                                             information is available on historical occurrences. This
                                             hazardous condition is most likely to occur in the Dunlap Acres
                                             planning area, portions of the North Bench, and along creeks.

Protecting Our Community
Protecting Yucaipa from the threat of geologic hazards is achieved
through the identification of hazards, mitigation of structures at
risk, enforcement of building codes and development standards,
and public education and emergency preparedness.
Hazard Identification
The City of Yucaipa has established a Geologic Hazard Overlay
District in the Municipal Code for designated areas within the
community where active faults, liquefaction, subsidence, and
mudflows may present a threat to structures, property, and people.
Figure S-1, Geologic Hazard Overlay District, designates the general
location of potential geologic and seismic hazards in Yucaipa.
Geotechnical Study
For building and structures proposed within the Geologic Hazards
Overlay District or other areas required by the City Building Official,
a geotechnical hazard study is required as part of the application.
The geotechnical study must document the potential for geologic
and seismic hazards in accordance with local regulations and state
law. Seismic hazard mitigation measures identified by the
geotechnical study, overlay district, or City Building Official must be
incorporated into the project design prior to approval.
Structures at Risk
Advances in engineering techniques and building codes have
reduced the threat of seismic-related collapse in new buildings.
However, buildings built before modern seismic standards are at
risk —unreinforced masonry, precast concrete tilt-up walls, soft-
stories, and nonductile concrete frames. Of particular concern are
Yucaipa’s 42 mobile home parks. Critical infrastructure (gas, water,
electric lines, and aboveground water storage reservoirs) can also
be damaged during an earthquake. The City is pursuing programs
to upgrade facilities, infrastructure, and housing units.
Building Codes and Development Standards
Proposed projects in the Geologic Hazards Overlay District must
adhere to California building codes and state law. These codes
provide minimum standards to protect property and public safety
by regulating the design and construction of excavations,
foundations, building frames, retaining walls, and other features to
mitigate the effects of earthquakes. State law provides additional
seismic safety standards for schools, hospitals, infrastructure, and
critical facilities. Seismic hazard mitigation measures are included.
Adherence to the following goal and policies will help mitigate
potential harm from Yucaipa’s geologic and seismic hazards.
                                                                        CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 7-5

FLOOD SAFETY
Floods are natural and recurrent events that generally do not pose
a hazard in an undeveloped area; it is only when floods interact
with the built environment—typically, structures built in the
floodplain, where they obstruct floodwaters—that they become
hazardous to property, structures, and people.
Natural Setting
Yucaipa is bisected by several waterways. Wilson Creek runs in a
southwesterly direction and Wildwood Creek runs to the southeast.
Drainage occurs through many small, fluctuating creeks—Yucaipa
Creek, Oak Glen Creek, Chicken Springs Wash, Spoor Creek, and
Gateway Wash. Wilson and Wildwood creeks and their tributaries
converge in Live Oak Canyon, west of Interstate 10, and then flow
to the San Timoteo River.
Yucaipa has generally warm to dry weather and averages only 20
inches of rainfall annually. Therefore, most of the creeks are dry
during most of the year, except along their upper reaches, which
may have small, sustained year-round flow. However, Yucaipa is
also subject to intense local storms. Floodwaters from the upper
reaches of the mountains converge in Yucaipa’s waterways,
creating the potential for flooding and safety hazards.
During the late 1960s, Yucaipa storms caused widespread damage
to roads, homes, utilities, and property. Since then, the City has
completed multimillion-dollar projects to protect the community
from flooding. Although channel improvements have significantly
                                                                        The 2010 flash floods damaged

to cause local flooding. Recent flooding events include:

   + 2010 January Flash Flood/Mudslides
   + 2005 August Flash Flood
   + 2002 November Flash Flood
   + 1999 August Flash Flood
   + 1995 January Storm
   + 1993 February Storm
   + 1992 Winter Storms
To prevent and control flooding, Yucaipa and the San Bernardino
County Flood Control District manage a network of channels,
detention basins, and other flood control infrastructure. More than
28 miles of drainage infrastructure, a dozen detention basins, and
natural streams divert floodwaters and recharge groundwater.
Additional facilities and flood protection infrastructure are planned.
Figure S-2a, Drainage and Recharge Facilities, shows areas capable
of accommodating floodwaters and groundwater recharge.

                                         Flood Hazards
                                         Because of Yucaipa’s steep terrain and seasonal storm events, the
                                         community is subject to a wide range of flooding hazards. The
                                         predominant flooding hazards are riverine flooding, mudflows,
                                         dam inundation, and urban flooding. These flooding hazards are
                                         described below and mapped on subsequent pages.
                                         Riverine Floods
                                         Riverine flooding is the most prevalent flood hazard in Yucaipa and
                                         the source for the most devastating floods in the city. Yucaipa has
                                         many fluctuating waterways—Yucaipa Creek, Oak Glen Creek,
                                         Wildwood Creek, Chicken Springs Wash, and Spoor Creek.
                                         Although generally dry, these creeks can quickly accumulate water
                                         during storm events, as intense rainfall at higher elevations in the
                                         Yucaipa Ridge or Crafton Hills converges downstream in Yucaipa.
                                         These floods can overflow channels or adjacent floodways, quickly
                                         creating hazardous conditions for residents and motorists.
                                         The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is responsible
                                         for identifying flood hazards for communities across the nation.
                                         FEMA prepares maps that delineate Special Flood Hazard Areas-a
                                         100-year and 500-year flood event. A 100-year flood is a flood

   crossings and created safety hazards. The California Department of Water Resources also has identified
                                         areas prone to a 100-year flood using approximate assessment
                                         procedures, without specific depths and other flood hazard data.
                                         These maps are not FEMA regulatory floodplain maps.
                                         Mudflow/Debris Flow
                                         A mud/debris flow refers to a moving mass of loose mud, sand,
                                         soil, rock, water, and air that travels down a slope under the
                                         influence of gravity. A mud/debris flow can also flow down a
                                         stream, ravine, canyon, arroyo, or gulch. These flows develop when
                                         water rapidly accumulates in the ground during heavy rainfall or
                                         rapid snowmelt, changing loose earth into a flowing river of mud.
                                         Mud/debris flows can travel miles from the source, growing as they
                                         pick up trees, boulders, cars, and other materials.
                                         Generally, areas most susceptible to mud/debris flow include steep
                                         slopes, landforms subject to erosion, and river channels. In areas
                                         burned by forest and brush fires, a lower threshold of rainfall may
                                         trigger mud/debris flows. In the past few decades, Yucaipa has
                                         experienced many smaller mud/debris flows and landslides along
                                         the Crafton Hills, northern Yucaipa, the Yucaipa Hills, and Oak Glen
                                         area that have damaged structures and roads. Planning for these
                                         situations is an essential post-fire recovery operation.
                                         Figure S-2b, Floodplain Safety Overlay District, shows Yucaipa’s
                                         potential safety hazards of riverine flooding and dam inundation.

Dam Inundation
Yucaipa has four open reservoirs. Built in 1978, three reservoirs are
located in Yucaipa Regional Park and serve recreational purposes.
These dams are owned and operated by the San Bernardino Valley
Municipal Water District. The fourth reservoir is located in Crafton
Hills, above the Yucaipa Regional Park. Originally built in 2001, the
Crafton Hills Dam was improved in 2013, and the reservoir was
tripled in size in 2014. An intertie along Mills Creek diverts water
from the State Water Project to fill the expanded Crafton Reservoir.
                                                                           Yucaipa continues to prioritize

Yucaipa Valley Water District, Western Heights Water Company,
and South Mesa Water Company. During a significant natural
disaster, these reservoirs could fail and lead to localized inundation,
although to a significantly lesser degree than dams. Water districts
are required to ensure that closed reservoirs are built, maintained,
and retrofitted in accordance with state safety standards.
Urban Flooding
Urban flooding refers to the built environment of the city.
Although Yucaipa’s flood control and drainage infrastructure direct
the majority of floodwaters, flooding during intense storms is
inevitable due to the volume of water draining from the
mountains. Moving debris can quickly overwhelm or impede well-
designed channels and basins, spilling onto streets and property.
Typically, storm drains are designed for normal rainfall and provide
protection from a normal storm event. However, when larger
storms occur or storm drains are blocked, flooding may occur.
Several areas in Yucaipa are more susceptible to urban flooding. In
particular, Dunlap Acres and areas below the confluence at
Yucaipa Creek and Wildwood Creek are subject to flooding. Areas          Completion of the Oak Glen Creek Basins

The City continues to invest in flood control projects (detention
basins, storm drains, streets, and sidewalks, etc.) to reduce flood
risks. However, due to Yucaipa’s unique topography and built
environment, urban flooding remains a concern in Yucaipa.

                                         The City continuously works on flood control projects to remove
                                         properties from delineated floodplains/ floodways and works with
                                         FEMA to make map revisions in accordance with federal law.
                                         Yucaipa’s Master Plan of Drainage (MPD) and the City’ capital
                                         improvement program outlines planned improvements to flood
                                         control infrastructure– including detention basins, desilting basins,
                                         flood channel stabilization, and improvements to drainage facilities
                                         and infrastructure needed to provide protection from flooding
                                         events. MPD projects are consistent with the Hazard Mitigation
                                         Plan and Yucaipa’s annual Capital Improvement Program.
                                         Mutual Aid Agreements
                                         Yucaipa maintains mutual aid agreements that provide for
                                         voluntary cooperative efforts and provision of services from other
                                         agencies when local capabilities are exceeded during an
                                         emergency. Yucaipa has mutual aid agreements with adjacent
                                         jurisdictions, San Bernardino County Flood Control District, Yucaipa
                                         Valley Water District, the State of California, federal agencies,

7. PUBLIC SAFETY
                                         FIRE SAFETY
                                         Yucaipa is subject to a range of urban fire hazards due to its built
                                         environment–its buildings, roads, and adjacency to other cities.
                                         Yucaipa’s dry weather conditions, topography, high winds, and
                                         vegetation also place the city at a very high risk of wildfire. Left
                                         uncontrolled, fires have the potential to damage or destroy
                                         structures, roadways, and utility systems and disrupt the economy.
                                         Fire Hazard Setting
                                         Yucaipa’s fire hazard responsibilities include response to urban
                                         fires, wildland fires, and emergency medical response.
                                         Urban Fire
                                         Yucaipa’s built environment has a medium to low fire hazard.
                                         Developed areas include some apartments, offices, mercantile, and
                                         industrial occupancies not normally requiring extensive rescue.
                                         Lower-hazard occupancies include a one-, two- or three-family
                                         dwellings, scattered small business, and industrial occupancies.
                                         Each year, Yucaipa averages 350 fires, including 100 vegetation
                                         fires, 100 structure fires, 75 vehicle fires, and 75 miscellaneous
                                         fires. Most urban fires can be extinguished within a few hours.
                                         Yucaipa’s fire service responsibilities extend beyond firefighting
                                         suppression to include a range of paramedic and lifeline services.
                                         Approximately 70% of CAL FIRE calls (more than 7,000 calls
                                         annually) are for medical services. The Fire Department also
                                         responds to about 500 traffic collisions each year. Because of
                                         Yucaipa’s demographics and the nature of fire service calls, the
                                         provision of licensed paramedics trained in advanced life support
                                         during emergencies has become increasingly important.
                                         Yucaipa Fire maintains aid agreements with surrounding agencies
                                         to provide assistance during and after a fire emergency. Automatic
                                         aid agreements are in place with the City of Redlands Fire
                                         Department and Riverside County Fire Department. Yucaipa Fire
                                         maintains mutual aid agreements with the US Forest Service for
                                         wildland areas north and east of Yucaipa. Mutual and automatic
                                         aid agreements are also in place with the San Bernardino County
                                         Fire Department. Yucaipa Fire also maintains a cooperative
                                         agreement with the San Bernardino County Fire Department.
                                         The Insurance Service Office (ISO) is a leading source of information
                                         about property casualty insurance risk for local government. ISO
                                         helps establish fire insurance premiums for residential and
                                         commercial properties based in part on a city’s fire protection. ISO
                                         rankings are based on four criteria: a community’s emergency
                                         communications, fire department equipment and operations, and
                                         water supply. ISO rates each community’s fire suppression system
                                         on a 10-point scale, with one (1) being the highest ranking that
                                         can be achieved. Yucaipa maintains a Class 3 ISO rating.

Wildland Fire
Wildland fire is a critical concern in Yucaipa. Expansive open areas
are susceptible to destructive wildland fires, which can be
exacerbated by dry weather and Santa Ana winds. The National
Fire Plan designates Yucaipa as a “community at risk” of high
wildland fire hazard (CAL FIRE 2014). Vegetation fuel types in the
City include annual grasses and a variety of brush with low fuel
moisture that are highly susceptible to and capable of carrying fire.
Since 2000, the City of Yucaipa has experienced many wildland
fires due to a natural causes, human error, and arson. Over the
past decade, all of the notable fires have occurred in hillsides
surrounding Yucaipa. According to CAL FIRE, USFS, and USGS,
notable fires include:
   + 2015 Mill 2 Fire burned 35 acres
   + 2013 Mentone/Yucaipa Fire burned 534 acres
   + 2011 Mill Fire burned 100 acres
   + 2009 Pendleton Fire burned 860 acres
   + 2009 Oak Glen Fire burned 1,015 acres
   + 2009 Crafton Hills Fire burned 350 acres
   + 2007 Yucaipa Ridge Fire burned 280 acres
   + 2007 Jefferson Fire burned 125 acres
Responsibility for wildland fire prevention and suppression includes
the city, state, and federal government. The federal government
has the primary responsibility in Wildwood Canyon, Yucaipa Hills,
and National Forest. These “federal responsibility areas” (FRA) total
8% of the acreage within the City and sphere of influence. Areas
where the State of California has primary responsibility (called
“State Responsibility Areas” or “SRA”) comprise 17%, primarily in
the Crafton Hills and El Dorado Ranch Park. Local responsibility
areas comprise most of the developed areas in Yucaipa.
According to CAL FIRE, half of the City of Yucaipa is designated as
a very high fire severity zone (VHFZ) based on fuels, terrain, and
weather. These lands are characterized by fire-prone land cover—
primarily valley grasslands, mixed chaparral, and shrub
communities. Significant residential growth is planned over the
buildout of Yucaipa; however, only 3,500 units will be located in a
VHFSZ. Of those total units, only a fraction is permitted within SRA
lands (~200 units) or within FRA lands (~150 units).
The City of Yucaipa designated fire-prone areas with a fire safety
overlay district. Figure S-3, Fire Safety Overlay District, designates
these areas as FR-1 (very high fire severity zones) and FR-2, which
are lands vulnerable to fire due to proximity to FR-1 areas.
                                                                       CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 7-19

                                         Yucaipa has opted for the CAL FIRE staffing of 3-person crews, plus
                                         an assigned Fire Captain at all times on each engine. Through
                                         agreements with cooperating fire departments and assigned
                                         Yucaipa fire engines, CAL FIRE makes available a total of 4 to 5 fire
                                         engines plus a chief officer on a standard structure fire response
                                         depending on the reported type of structure, for a total
                                         complement of 13 to 16 personnel. Staff arriving at an incident is
                                         paramedic qualified and can provide advanced life support services.
                                         Yucaipa Fire strives to meet National Fire Protection Association
                                         (NFPA) standards for responding to fire and other emergencies.
                                         NFPA recommends that first responders arrive at the fire scene in
                                         five minutes or less at least 90% of the time. Response time is
                                         measured from the time of the 911 call to arrival at the scene.
                                         Yucaipa Fire currently averages about five minutes to all parts of
                                         the city, including the Wildwood Canyon and Oak Glen areas.

Water Supply
Adequate and reliable water supplies are essential to suppress fires.
Yucaipa adheres to fire infrastructure and flow requirements in
accordance with the California Fire Code (2013), National Fire
Protection Association standards, and local standards. Table S-2
shows the City’s fire flow standards for new development projects.

  Note: The City requires new projects in undersupplied areas to provide fire sprinkler systems
       and adequately sized on-site reservoirs to provide fire flow requirements
Yucaipa’s water system (water lines, tanks, pump stations, etc.) is
sized to handle the highest demand on the system. This is
calculated assuming a worst-case scenario for the fire hydrant
farthest from the connection to the distribution system, at the
highest elevation, assuming the supply reservoir is half full. Water
pipes are sized to allow a maximum daily flow plus fire flow that
provides a residual pressure of 20 psi (pounds per square inch) and
maximum velocity of 10 fps (feet per second) system wide.
Yucaipa’s water system provides adequate water supply, although
some areas may comply with lower standards in effect at that time.
CAL FIRE maintains fire pre-plans (included in each assigned fire
engine) that address water shortages, building types/construction
types, water sources, and other features of the area in question.
When a response is initiated in these areas, the Incident
Commander can request additional water resources (e.g., water
tenders, mutual aid, aerial support, etc.) as needed.
Water supplies can be interrupted or curtailed due to drought, fire,
earthquake (which damage facilities and infrastructure), or power
failure. In case of emergency, YVWD maintains backup generators
for critical infrastructure to avoid supply interruptions. YVWD can
maintain or supplement water supplies through interties with
adjacent water companies or standby production wells. Critical
facilities are compliant with state seismic safety standards.
In cases of extended-attack fires or wildland fires, CAL FIRE uses a
triage of strategies. CAL FIRE maintains emergency land use
agreements with the County and Yucaipa Valley Water District to
draw water from Yucaipa Reservoir, Crafton Hills Reservoir, and
Yucaipa Regional Park. Water tenders are used to transport water
to a fire when hydrants or other supplies are not near the fire.
Cooperative agreements with other agencies are also employed.

                                         Fire Access Standards
                                         Yucaipa’s has adopted the California Fire Code (CFC) with
                                         amendments to address local fire hazard concerns. Specific
                                         requirements for fire access include:
                                            + Roadway Design. Access roads and public and private streets
                                              shall not exceed a 12% grade, be capable of supporting
                                              75,000 pounds, and built with all-weather driving capabilities
                                            + Subdivision Access. Subdivisions must have two points of
                                              vehicular ingress and egress from streets, one of which may be
                                              used for emergency purposes only.
                                            + Road widths. Roads shall be at least 24 feet wide citywide and
                                              allow for 2-way traffic and 26 feet in FR1 areas; emergency
                                              vehicle access only is required to have a 20-foot minimum.
                                            + Bridge Design. Per the California Fire Code, access bridges
                                              meet nationally recognized design standards, including a
                                              capability of supporting 75,000 pounds.
                                            + Project Perimeter. Projects must provide adequate vehicular
                                              access for firefighting vehicles to the perimeter of a project
                                              that is adjacent to a fuel modified area or fire hazard area.
                                         Vegetation Management
                                         The Yucaipa Municipal Code incorporated the latest 2013 CFC and
                                         appendices, and amended it to address vegetation management.
                                         New structures in areas containing combustible vegetation must
                                         secure a fuel modification plan approved by the Fire Official. The
                                         plan must address water supply, access, building ignition and fire
                                         resistance, fire protection systems and equipment, defensible
                                         space, and vegetation management consistent with the CFC’s
                                         “Requirements for Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Areas.”
                                         In accordance with the California Public Resources Code, properties
                                         upon or adjoining hazardous fire areas must maintain a 100-foot
                                         defensible space around structures, with most intensive fuel
                                         management within the first 30 feet around the structure.
                                         Electrical transmission lines must have at least 10-foot clearances.
                                         To facilitate emergency access and evacuation, 10-foot clearances
                                         are required along each side of portions of highways and private
                                         streets that are improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicles.
                                         Additional vegetation management strategies are employed in
                                         state and federal responsibility areas. The United States Forest
                                         Service, CAL FIRE, and San Bernardino National Forest maintain a
                                         system of fuelbreaks to protect Yucaipa from wildfires. Fuelbreaks
                                         are listed in the Oak Glen/Banning Hazardous Fuel Reduction
                                         Project and the Inyo-Mono-San Bernardino Unit Fire plans.
                                         Fuelbreaks are located below Yucaipa Ridge, the interface of
                                         Yucaipa Hills and Oak Glen, Crafton Hills, and Wildwood Canyon.

Building, Development, and Signage Regulations
Yucaipa has adopted the latest edition of the California Fire Code,
with all appendices, and amended it to address local concerns. The
Fire Marshall reviews plans for structures and buildings citywide,
including fire-prone areas. Checklists are used to address fire code
requirements, including but not limited to: street and building
signage, water supply, water infrastructure, sprinkler requirements,
building requirements (sprinklers, smoke detectors, roofing, etc.),
access roads, and vegetation management among others.
The City enforces uniform building address and street sign letters.
Street sign letters must be at least 4” in height and 3/8” in width.
As required by the Fire Code, addresses for single-family structures
shall be 4” in height, 3/8“ in width, on contrasting backgrounds,
and plainly visible and legible from an access roadway or the street.
Commercial and multi-family projects shall have numbers of 8” in
height and 1/2“in width, and on contrasting background.
Industrial address letters must be 12” in height and1” in width.
Hazardous Materials
Yucaipa Fire is responsible for inspecting facilities that handle
hazardous materials, generate or treat hazardous waste, and/or
operate an underground storage tank. Yucaipa Fire also responds
to situations where local traffic accidents lead to a spillage of
hazardous materials. Additional governmental agencies help
protect Yucaipans from hazardous waste and materials. As the
certified unified public agency (CUPA), the County of San
Bernardino Fire Department implements the hazardous waste and
materials standards for Yucaipa. This program covers seven areas.
   + Aboveground Petroleum Storage Act (APSA) Program
   + Area Plans for Hazardous Materials Emergencies
   + California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program
   + Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventories
   + Hazardous Material Management Plan (HMMP)
   + Hazardous Waste Generator Program
   + Onsite Waste Treatment Program
   + Underground Storage Tank Program
While Yucaipa does not have large hazardous waste generators or
facilities typical for cities, other facilities present key fire hazards.
Southern California Gas Company operates a high-pressure gas
transmission and distribution pipeline that extends along Interstate
10 and then northward along the western portion of the city and
the southernmost section of the community north of the I-10. If
this high-pressure gas distribution line ruptured during an
earthquake, the released gas could result in a significant fire.

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
Management of emergencies and disasters consists of: 1) event
preparedness; 2) response during or soon after the event; (3) post-
event recovery; and 4) hazard mitigation. To accomplish these
phases requires quick, dynamic, and effective response from
multiple entities. This requires preparation by public agencies,
neighborhoods, businesses, and families.
Planning For Disasters
Yucaipa Fire Department, Police Department, and the Deputy City
Manager coordinate emergency preparedness planning, response,
and recovery efforts. These include:
Preparedness
Yucaipa adheres to the National Incident Management System
(NIMS) for emergency preparedness. NIMS is a systematic approach
for government, nongovernmental organizations, critical
infrastructure owners and operators, and the private sector to work
together to manage threats and hazards. The NIMS provides a
comprehensive and standardized incident management system for
agencies that are involved in emergency management and/or
incident response. The City of Yucaipa is NIMS-compliant as         Community events like “Are You Ready
                                                                      Yucaipa?” draw more than 1,000

for federal preparedness grants and award.
Response Phase
Yucaipa follows the Standardized Emergency Management System
(SEMS) to structure its response phase of emergency management.
Adopted by California, SEMS unifies all elements of emergency
management into a single integrated and standardized system.
SEMS incorporates an incident command system, field-level
emergency response system, multi/inter-agency coordination,
mutual aid, and operational area concept. Yucaipa is SEMS-
compliant and therefore eligible for reimbursement of response-
related costs under state disaster assistance programs.
Recovery/Prevention
Yucaipa coordinates and manages recovery/prevention activities
following emergencies/disasters through the City Manager and the
Emergency Services Coordinator. City staff may also assist in
facilitating and leading the recovery process. For declared
emergencies, City staff complete a detailed damage/safety
assessment that is forwarded to County OES for inclusion in the
County’s IDE report. After-Action Reports will identify corrective
actions and make recommendations for correcting problems noted
in the response/recovery effort, or during exercises and training.
The City’s Emergency Operations Plan and Hazard Mitigation Plan
provide additional information on these and other topics.

                                         Protection and Preservation of Public Facilities,
                                         Critical Infrastructure, and Lifeline Services
                                         Disaster planning and recovery depend on a reliable network of
                                         public facilities, critical infrastructure, and lifeline services. Public
                                         facilities include police and fire stations, schools, community
                                         centers, and emergency operations and communication centers.
                                         Critical infrastructure includes generators, water and sewer lines,
                                         utilities, transportation routes, etc. Lifeline services critical to health
                                         and safety include water, sewer, energy, waste disposal,
                                         communications, and others. Figure S-4, Critical Facilities and
                                         Infrastructure, identifies critical facilities and infrastructure.
                                         Emergency preparedness extends beyond construction activities to
                                         planning in system redundancies so that a single event (e.g., power
                                         failure or road failure) does not prevent the provision of essential
                                         services, such as paramedics, water supply, or other service.
                                         California law mandates that buildings, bridges, and infrastructure
                                         be built in accordance with state and federal building standards to
                                         protect from flooding, earthquakes, fire, and other disasters. The
                                         City periodically upgrades facilities in accordance with the above.
                                         Evacuation Routes
                                         With its location in the foothills and near wildlands, Yucaipa is
                                         subject to natural hazards. These include 100-year floodplains,
                                         active faults and geological hazards, very high fire severity zones,
                                         and other natural hazards. During an emergency, evacuation
                                         routes are needed to move people to safe locations and move
                                         equipment to affected hazard areas. Yucaipa has three levels of
                                         evacuation routes, depending on the emergency.
                                           + Local Routes. Eight arterials (Bryant, Oak Glen, Yucaipa, 14th
                                               Street, Wildwood Canyon, County Line, Calimesa Boulevard,
                                               and Mesa Grande) are designated as evacuation routes.
                                           + Regional Routes. The San Bernardino County General Plan has
                                               designated Oak Glen Road as the primary regional evacuation
                                               routes for the Oak Glen Mountain community.
                                           + Federal and State Routes. Interstate 10 is the primary federal
                                               evacuation route while Highway 38 is the primary state-
                                               designated evacuation route from the mountain communities.
                                         The precise evacuation route to use during an emergency depends
                                         on many factors, including the type of natural disaster, location of
                                         incident, weather conditions, road conditions, and traffic volume.
                                         Figure S-5, Evacuation Routes in Yucaipa, identifies the local,
                                         regional, and state/federal evacuation routes in the city.

7. PUBLIC SAFETY
                                         SEVERE WEATHER
                                         Typically, communities focus public safety programs on addressing
                                         community-wide hazards such as earthquakes, fire, flooding, and
                                         other hazards that have a widespread impact and cost. However,
                                         severe weather conditions can also cause substantial damage to
                                         property and infrastructure and result in injuries and loss of life.
                                         Yucaipa recognizes that the frequency of severe weather in the
                                         community makes it a public safety concern for residents.
                                         Weather Hazards
                                         According to the City’s Hazard Mitigation Plan, Yucaipa is generally
                                         susceptible to high winds, extreme heat, torrential rain and
                                         lightning, and occasional snow or freezes.
                                         High Winds
                                         Yucaipa’s location at the base of the San Bernardino Mountains
                                         makes it susceptible to straight-line winds that can exceed 100
                                         miles per hour, knocking down trees and power lines and
                                         disrupting utility service. From October through February, Yucaipa
                                         also experiences warm and dry Santa Ana winds that descend from
                                         the high desert and can reach speeds of 100 miles per hour. The
                                         most significant hazard from high winds is an increased wildfire
                                         danger, but winds can down trees and power lines, damage
                                         property, and create hazards for aircraft. Every year, Yucaipa
                                         experiences numerous high wind events.
                                         Extreme Heat
                                         Yucaipa is known for exceptionally dry and hot weather,
                                         particularly during summer when maximum temperatures often
                                         exceed 100 degrees. Extreme heat becomes a broader health
                                         hazard when it either affects residents (due to the potential for
                                         heat-related illness) or results in electric power outages. Periodic
                                         extreme heat events in San Bernardino County influence the ability
                                         of utilities to provide electric service. Although formal stage alerts
                                         causing service interruption have not occurred frequently in several
                                         years, load warnings and voluntary reductions have occurred.
                                         Rainfall and Freezing Weather
                                         Due to elevation and topography, Yucaipa experiences more
                                         intense storms than other cities. Thunderstorms from July through
                                         September can create lightning strikes, erratic high winds, and
                                         torrential rains. Yucaipa’s elevation also results in seasonal freezing
                                         weather and one to four inches of snow each year. Normal rainfall
                                         and snow events rarely lead to significant safety hazards. However,
                                         freezing conditions can lead to slippery roads and a higher risk of
                                         automobile accidents. Freezing weather, when coupled with power
                                         outages, can also leave residents unable to heat homes.

Protecting Our Community
The lead agency responsible for addressing severe weather events
and the impacts on the Yucaipa community is incident specific.
Utility companies are responsible for service disruption from
downed power lines or heat events. The fire department is
responsible for wind-driven fires and provides sandbags to protect
against rainfall and mudslides. The public works department is
responsible for clearing downed trees that block streets. The police
department would direct traffic in cases of downed or
malfunctioning signals.
GOAL S-5: SEVERE WEATHER
Minimize the impacts of severe weather conditions
on residents, businesses, and visitors.
Policies
S-5.1        Wind Protective Features. Promote the installation of
             protective wind barriers on homes and buildings, such
             as vegetation walls, glass panel windscreens, roof
             clips, hedges, or rows of trees.
S-5.2        Public Trees and Vegetation. Maintain trees and
             vegetation in public rights-of-way and close to critical
             facilities (e.g., police, fire, hospital facilities) and utility
             lines to lessen tree failure and property damage risks.
S-5.3        Signage. Require all signage and moving structures
             susceptible to high wind damage to be tied down
             appropriately, or brought down or covered when high
             wind alerts are in effect.
S-5.4        Roadway Closures. Close down non-essential
             roadways and redirect traffic onto other routes during
             thunderstorms, torrential rain, or snow/freezing
             conditions where warranted to protect the public.
S-5.5        Cooling Centers. Designate public buildings or specific
             private buildings with air conditioning as public

                                          NOISE AND VIBRATION
                                          Noise is defined as unwanted sound. From the rumbling of trucks
                                          on the roadways to the whine of leaf blowers on a quiet morning,
                                          noise and vibration can interrupt our conversations, thoughts, and
                                          leisure. Many excessive sources of noise (e.g., freeways) are also
                                          often accompanied by vibration. Noise and vibration sensitivity
                                          varies throughout the day or evening, at different locations, and
                                          among receptors. Despite these variations, most people agree that
                                          noise and vibration adversely affect health and well-being.
                                          Unlike most cities in southern California, Yucaipa is far from many
                                          urban noise sources—airports, railroads, and heavy industry. Yet
                                          Yucaipa’s noise and vibration environment still varies throughout
                                          the community. While the North Bench and Wildwood Canyon
                                          have more localized noise sources, commercial centers or business
                                          districts experience higher levels of noise from business, roads, and
                                          traffic. Interstate 10 is the largest source of noise and vibration, the
                                          contours of which extend for some distance from the freeway.
                                          Measuring Noise and Vibration
   Interstate 10 is the primary source of Noise is a complex subject and can be measured in different ways.
noise and vibration in southwest Yucaipa. Noise is measured by an A-weighted sound pressure level, or dBA,
                                          which accounts for sound pressure level, the pitch of sound, and
                                          the way the human ear responds to both pressure and pitch. CNEL
                                          is the average sound level over a 24-hour period, with a penalty of
                                          5 dB added from 7 pm to 10 pm and a penalty of 10 dB added for
                                          the hours of 10 pm to 7 am. Details on noise fundamentals are
                                          found in the noise study conducted for the General Plan update.
                                          Vibration is an oscillatory motion through a solid medium in which
                                          the motion’s amplitude can be described in terms of displacement,
                                          velocity, or acceleration. Vibration is normally associated with
                                          activities such as railroads or vibration-intensive stationary sources,
                                          but can also be associated with construction equipment such as
                                          jackhammers, pile drivers, and hydraulic hammers. Heavy trucks
                                          can also generate significant levels of ground borne vibrations.
                                          Potholes, pavement joints, and uneven pavement surfaces can
                                          increase the vibration from passing vehicles.
                                          Noise and vibration levels do not affect all land uses or people
                                          equally. Certain land uses are more sensitive to levels of noise and
                                          vibration. For example, residential, school, health care facilities, and
                                          open space/recreation areas (where quiet environments are
                                          necessary for enjoyment, health, and safety) are more sensitive to
                                          noise. Generally, commercial and industrial uses are not considered
                                          noise- and vibration-sensitive uses unless the interior level of noise
                                          and vibration exceeds state or federal occupational standards.

Land Use Planning and Compatibility
Yucaipa is responsible for protecting residents and visitors from
unacceptable noise and vibration. Table S-3 shows that the City
requires specific land uses to achieve an interior noise level of 45–
50 dBA and exterior noise level of 60–65 dBA depending on land
use. When nontransportation sources are the primary noise source,
the City also uses hourly standards. These standards are intended
to ensure that land uses within Yucaipa are compatible and do not
detract from quality of life due to unacceptable levels of noise.

     levels are substantially mitigated through the reasonable use of best available noise
     reduction technology and interior noise does not exceed 45 dBA with windows and
     doors closed.
Under the municipal code, no ground vibration is allowed which
can be felt without the aid of instruments at or beyond the lot line,
or which produces a particle velocity greater than or equal to two-
tenths (0.2) inch per second measured at or beyond the lot line.
Construction activities are generally exempt during working days.
Future Noise Levels
Yucaipa’s predominant source of noise levels is transportation
related. Based on noise measurements, projected noise levels were
identified and calculated at buildout of the general plan and then
compared with City standards to determine the most noise-
impacted areas. Areas having an average day-night sound level (Ldn)
of 60 dBA (if residential) or 65 dBA or greater (less sensitive uses)
were identified. Figure S-6, Noise Hazard Overlay District, shows
the greatest future sources of noise will be roadways:
   + Sand Canyon                                          + Colorado Road
   + Yucaipa Boulevard                                    + County Line Road

7. PUBLIC SAFETY
                                         Protecting Our Community
                                         The state and federal government regulate sources of noise from
                                         transportation sources or the workplace. Therefore, the City works
                                         to control noise through the following programs and policies.
                                         Noise Insulation Standards
                                         Yucaipa enforces State of California Noise Insulation Standards
                                         (California Administrative Code, Title 24) and Chapter 35 of the
                                         Uniform Building Code. These regulations specify that acoustical
                                         studies must be prepared for all new multiple-family projects,
                                         condominiums, hotels, and motels proposed for areas within the
                                         60 CNEL contour. In accordance with noise insulation standards,
                                         project applicants must demonstrate that building design features
                                         can reduce interior noise levels to 45 CNEL or better.
                                         Noise Ordinance and Vibration Standards
                                         The municipal code gives the City authority to regulate noise at its
                                         source (except transportation sources), protect noise-sensitive land
                                         uses, and regulate the level of vibration. The municipal code also
                                         specifies permitted periods for construction and grading activities
                                         to exceed specified noise thresholds, vibration thresholds, and
                                         exemptions where applicable. Construction activities typically have
                                         some level of exemption during working hours. These standards
                                         are also applicable to nontransportation sources of noise and
                                         vibration and periodic nuisances within the community.
                                         Noise Overlay District
                                         Yucaipa applies a noise hazard overlay district to areas where the
                                         Ldn is 65 dBA CNEL or greater. For new projects, the 60-dBA CNEL
                                         contour represents areas in which proposed noise sensitive land
                                         use should be evaluated. Projects should strive to meet the 60-dBA
                                         CNEL noise standard. An exterior noise level of up to 65 dBA CNEL
                                         will be allowed for new projects, provided exterior noise levels have
                                         been substantially mitigated through the reasonable application of
                                         the best available noise reduction technology and interior noise
                                         exposure does not exceed 45 dBA with windows and doors closed.
                                         Land Use Planning
                                         To ensure land use compatibility, City programs focus on reducing
                                         noise and vibration levels by shielding the receiver, thus
                                         interrupting the path of noise and vibration. This is achieved by
                                         three means: 1) proactive land use planning that separates
                                         potentially incompatible uses; 2) building design and site planning;
                                         and 3) reducing noise and vibration from the freeway and
                                         roadways through appropriate barriers (e.g., walls, landscaping,
                                         berms, and other appropriate techniques). Sounds walls should be
                                         the last resort after all other practical design-related noise and
                                         vibration reduction measures have been undertaken.

GOAL S-6: NOISE AND VIBRATION SAFETY
Appropriate community noise and vibration levels
that balance the need for peaceful environments for
sensitive land uses with the needs of local businesses
and regional land uses.
Policies
S-6.1      Noise Assessment. Assess the compatibility of
           proposed land uses with the noise environment when
           preparing, revising, or reviewing applications for
           development projects or land use changes.
S-6.2      Acoustical Studies. Require acoustical studies for
           proposed projects within areas that exceed 60 dBA;
           discourage siting of new noise-sensitive uses in areas
           exceeding 65 dBA without appropriate mitigation.
S-6.3      Noise Insulation and Vibration Standards. Require new
           projects to comply with noise insulation and vibration
           reduction standards in local, regional, state, and
           federal regulations, as applicable.
S-6.4      Noise Nuisance Standards. Regulate the control of
           residential noise nuisances—such as parties, barking
           dogs, other animals, and limited agricultural
           operations—through the City's municipal code.
S-6.5      Development Patterns. Locate new development in
           areas where noise levels are appropriate for the use.
           Limit development of noise-producing uses adjacent
           to noise-sensitive receptors and require that noise-
           producing land uses have adequate mitigation.
S-6.6      Land Use-Noise Compatibility. Require mitigation of
           exterior and interior noise to the levels in Table S-1.
           Encourage the use of building design, site planning,
           landscaping, and other features to reduce noise levels.
S-6.7      Vibration Reduction. Minimize vibration impacts from
           construction sites, roadways, and other sources with a
           combination of setbacks, structural design features,
           and operational regulations as appropriate.
S-6.8      Street Improvements to Reduce Noise. Employ noise
           mitigation practices and materials when designing or
           improving streets; emphasize use of natural buffers or
           setbacks between roads and noise-sensitive areas.

                                         twofold: air pollution and a global “greenhouse” effect.
                                         Air Quality
                                         Air pollution has long been a health concern in Southern California.
                                         Smog is the term used to describe air pollutants, including ground-
                                         level ozone (smog’s main ingredient), particulate matter, carbon
                                         monoxide, and nitrogen oxide. When released to the air, these
                                         gases react with each other in sunlight to produce smog. Ocean
                                         breezes then sweep the smog inland, where warmer air traps the
                                         smog close to the ground where people live and breathe.
                                         San Bernardino County has long experienced poor air quality. Just
                                         25 years ago, 60% of all days in San Bernardino County had
                                         unhealthful air quality in 1990. Since then, stringent regulations
                                         implemented by the South Coast Air Quality Management District
                                         and technological advances have led to significant improvements in
                                         air quality. In 2015, only 30% of the days each year in San
                                         Bernardino County have unhealthful air quality.
                                         Southern California is now in compliance with state and federal
                                         standards for many criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO),
                                         nitrogen oxides (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2, and lead (Pb). However,
                                         the region continues to be in severe and/or extreme nonattainment
                                         status for particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), and ozone (O3). The
                                         City’s primary source of air pollution is ozone (O3), while other
                                         areas in the County also have high levels of particulate matter.
                                         Even at today’s levels, poor air quality continues to affect health.
                                         Breathing ozone can trigger chest pain, coughing, throat irritation,
                                         and congestion. It can worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and
                                         asthma. Ground-level ozone also can reduce lung function, inflame
                                         lung linings, and even permanently scar lung tissue. Ozone is also
                                         known to affect sensitive vegetation and ecosystems, including
                                         forests, wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas.
                                         Several regulatory agencies are involved in improving air quality.
                                         The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is
                                         responsible for assuring that the ambient air quality standards are
                                         attained and is responsible for promulgating regulations for
                                         stationary sources. The California Air Resources Board focuses its air
                                         pollution activities on air pollution emanating from transportation
                                         sources–vehicles, trucks, railroads, and marine vessels. The federal
                                         Environmental Protection Agency regulates airplane emissions.

Climate Change
Just as air pollution adversely affects health, it also affects climate.
The Earth’s temperature depends on a balance between incoming
energy from the sun, and outgoing energy that is radiated to space
as heat. Atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and other gases trap energy and
prevent heat from escaping into the atmosphere. The cumulative
impact of millions of GHG-generating activities affects this balance.
The reduction in the release of heat back into the atmosphere has
been credited with global warming. The consequences of climate
change are hard to predict. Globally, impacts could include warmer
temperatures, decreasing snow pack, sea level rise, and impacts on
water resources, wildlife, habitat, and agricultural production.
However, according to the California EPA, even if actions were
taken to significantly curtail GHG emissions, the built-up emissions
in the atmosphere would result in some level of climate warming.
The California Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32) and the California Global
Warming Solutions Act have attempted to address climate change
issues in a comprehensive manner. On the federal government
level, the courts have ruled that GHGs are a source of pollution that
is covered under the Clean Air Act. As such, state and federal
statutes have been expanded to cover a diverse set of topics, such
as land use and transportation, energy and renewables, water
efficiency and conservation, and waste and recycling.
Yucaipa contributes to the production of greenhouse gas emissions
in a variety of direct and indirect ways. Like most jurisdictions in
southern California, the City of Yucaipa’s greenhouse gas emissions
are predominantly the result of five activities: building energy
usage, on-road transportation sources (e.g., vehicles), off-road
equipment, solid waste management, and wastewater and water
services. Consequently, these five areas also represent the best and
most productive opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas
reductions to meet the City’s mandated targets.
SANBAG’s Regional Reduction Plan contains a regional assessment
of GHG generation and programs for jurisdictions to implement
that collectively achieve reductions in regional GHGs. Building off
the regional plan, Yucaipa’s Climate Action Plan presents the
greenhouse gas inventories and sets forth local measures to reduce
GHG emissions under the City’s jurisdictional control to achieve the
City’s reduction targets. The CAP is based upon the Regional
Reduction Plan, but has been revised to accommodate the growth
projections for 2020 from the proposed 2015 General Plan update.
                                                                         CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 7-43

7. PUBLIC SAFETY
                                         Protecting Our Community
                                         The City of Yucaipa has adopted a number of plans and regulations
                                         that attempt to improve air quality in the community, reduce
                                         hazards for residents, and address requirements in state and
                                         federal law. These programs are summarized below.
                                         Climate Action Plan
                                         The City of Yucaipa has adopted a Climate Action Plan (CAP) to
                                         address requirements under the California Global Warming
                                         Solutions Act of 2006. The CAP presents the greenhouse gas (GHG)
                                         inventory for Yucaipa, identifies the effectiveness of California,
                                         regional, and countywide initiatives to reduce GHG emissions, and
                                         concludes with City strategies to achieve GHG targets for Yucaipa.
                                         The General Plan Environmental Impact Report contains mitigation
                                         measures that are being followed through the duration of the
                                         general plan to reduce GHG emissions as required by state law.
                                         Public Nuisance Ordinances
                                         If it is determined during project-level environmental review that a
                                         project has the potential to emit nuisance odors beyond the
                                         property line, the City has the authority to require odor
                                         management plans. Such facilities could include, but are not
                                         limited to wastewater treatment, composting or recycling,
                                         painting/coating operations, food processing facilities, and other
                                         such businesses. Commercial poultry ranches must also have an
                                         approved manure management plan to control odors and
                                         associated public nuisances. Odor management plans shall identify
                                         best available control technologies to reduce odors.
                                         Land Use Planning
                                         Air pollution is most acute near freeways, industrial areas, diesel
                                         truck routes, and busy/congested roadways. As such, CARB
                                         recommends that “sensitive land uses” such as residences, care
                                         facilities, schools, day‐care centers, playgrounds, or medical
                                         facilities not be located near major sources of pollution. The
                                         General Plan provides policies to avoid placing sensitive land uses
                                         near sources of air pollution without the preparation of a health
                                         risk assessment (HRA). Similarly, qualified polluting industries that
                                         are relocating to or expanding must also prepare required HRA
                                         prior to approval of local permits.
                                         The following goal and policies are intended to support local and
                                         regional goals to improve air quality and mitigate climate change.

7. PUBLIC SAFETY
                                         SAFETY PROGRAMS
                                         In accordance with Section 65302 of the Government Code, this
                                         section outlines feasible implementation actions that Yucaipa will
                                         undertake to achieve the goals, policies, and objectives in the
                                         Safety Element. Table S-3 provides a summary of the objectives,
                                         timeframes, and implementation measures.
                                         1. Drainage Master Plan
                                         Historically, Yucaipa has been subject to intense flooding that has
                                         resulted in personal and economic damages in the community. In
                                         1993, Yucaipa completed and adopted a master drainage plan
                                         (MPD) that specified $90 million worth of improvements to its
                                         stormwater facilities, including spillover detention and desilting
                                         basins. Yucaipa’s MPD assesses planned improvements to flood
                                         control channels and detention basins; desilting basins; flood
                                         channel stabilization; and improvements to drainage facilities and
                                         infrastructure needed to provide protection from flooding events.
                                         Action. Continue to implement projects identified in the Master
                                         Plan of Drainage; amend plan as needed to maintain accuracy and
                                         relevance for flood planning purposes.
                                         2. Flood Plain Safety Overlay District Map
                                         Yucaipa’s Floodplain Safety Overlay District identifies areas within
                                         the city that need additional protection from flooding hazards. In
                                         accordance with FEMA regulations, two flood risks were identified.
                                         Floodplain Review Area 1 (FP 1) includes areas subject to a 100-
                                         year flood. Floodplain Review Area 1 (FP 2) includes areas between
                                         the 100-year flood and subject to a 500-year flood. These maps are
                                         used for planning purposes, including prioritizing capital
                                         improvements to reduce flooding risks and requiring enhanced
                                         development regulations for properties within a review area.
                                         Action. Continue to update plan as capital improvement projects
                                         are completed, risks are identified or modified, or flood insurance
                                         rate map revisions are made.
                                         3. Building and Development Standards
                                         The Yucaipa Municipal Code contains enhanced building codes and
                                         development standards for projects located within the floodplain.
                                         Enforcement of these codes is a precondition for FEMA to make
                                         available flood insurance policies for Yucaipa property owners and
                                         businesses. Development projects may be subject to FP 1 or FP 2
                                         regulations, flooding studies, or other mitigation. In certain areas
                                         where flood risks have not been defined by FEMA, the City
                                         Engineer may require additional studies or mitigation.
                                         Action. Maintain the floodplain management ordinance in
                                         accordance with the National Flood Insurance Program and require
                                         adherence to the ordinance and state and federal laws.

4. Low Water Crossings
In 1999, the City Council adopted a resolution to prioritize projects
that would eliminate low water crossings at several areas as a
precondition for applying for federal grant funding to build bridges
over the drainage channels and provide “all weather” crossing for
traffic. These roads were always closed to traffic during significant
storm events. Since then, the City has built bridges or completed
“low water crossing replacements” at 5 locations and the City is
currently in the design and/or environmental phase for 6 other
locations. In 2015, the City Council approved service level options
to budget for improvements at the remaining low water crossings.
Action. Continue to implement low water crossing replacement
projects identified in the City’s capital improvement program and
authorizing ordinance.
5. Flood Management Projects
Yucaipa’s Master Plan of Drainage is the blueprint for how the City
will protect the community from flooding through the construction
of infrastructure. The City’s Master Plan of Drainage (MPD) provides
an assessment of drainage and infrastructure needs and a plan for
the construction of detention basins and facilities to protect from
flooding hazards. Yucaipa’s Master Plan of Drainage is periodically
updated, most recently in 2011 and 2008. Needed improvements
to the City’s drainage system are included in the City’s capital
improvement program and funded through the annual budget.
Action. Continue the financing and construction of drainage
improvements noted in the capital improvements program that are
recommended in the Master Plan of Drainage.
6. Flood Infrastructure Maintenance
Yucaipa’s extensive network of drainage courses, detention basins,
and storm drains requires periodic maintenance to minimize the
potential for riverine and urban flooding. The San Bernardino Flood
Control District is responsible for maintaining, cleaning, and
repairing regional facilities, while the City is responsible for
maintaining, cleaning, and repairing all local facilities. The
California Department of Water Resources and County Flood
Control are responsible for maintaining reservoirs in Yucaipa. To
facilitate this maintenance effort, the County operates a master
stormwater system maintenance program for regional facilities.
Action.    Maintain agreements to ensure proper clearing,
maintenance, and repair of stormwater facilities, detention basins,
and channels to protect against flooding.
                                                                      CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 7-47

7. PUBLIC SAFETY
                                         7. Fire Code Amendments
                                         The City has adopted the latest edition of the California Fire Code,
                                         with all appendices. The City has also amended the code to address
                                         roadway and project access, fuel modification, brush clearance and
                                         vegetation management, building signage, and other features.
                                         Additional structural requirements have been added for projects in
                                         the fire review overlay district. These codes are generally consistent
                                         with regulations in the National Fire Protection Association, Board
                                         of Forestry and Fire Protection, Wildland-Urban Interface Code, etc.
                                         However, as conditions in Yucaipa and best practices change over
                                         time, a periodic review of City codes is warranted.
                                         Action. Review and revise, if necessary, City fire codes to
                                         accommodate applicable regulations of the Board of Forestry and
                                         Fire Protection, state law, and best practices.
                                         8. Fire Safety Overlay Districts
                                         When Yucaipa incorporated in 1989, City leaders adopted portions
                                         of the County’s Development Code, including fire safety overlay
                                         district requirements that are more stringent than most fire codes.
                                         Since then, the FR1 and FR2 overlay district requirements have been
                                         amended, but not in a comprehensive manner. Under state law, a
                                         city may adopt ordinances, rules, or regulations to provide fire
                                         prevention restrictions or regulations that are necessary or more
                                         stringent than state law to meet local fire conditions and needs. To
                                         implement the updated Safety Element, a comprehensive review of
                                         fire safety overlay district regulations is warranted.
                                         Action. Review and revise, if necessary, local fire overlay district
                                         regulations to accommodate applicable regulations of the Board of
                                         Forestry and Fire Protection, state law, and best practices.
                                         9. Water Supply for Wildland Areas
                                         The City, CAL FIRE, and Yucaipa Valley Water District require that
                                         adequate water supplies be made available to address the water
                                         supply and fire flow needs for new development. However,
                                         citywide water supply standards have not been adopted for
                                         wildland areas. In wildland areas, CAL FIRE has access to
                                         emergency land use agreements, water tenders, and other
                                         provisions to supply water where needed. While CAL FIRE has the
                                         capability to address fire suppression needs in very high fire severity
                                         zones, the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection recommends that
                                         the City review standards (such as water supply standards for
                                         wildland areas) for consideration and incorporation.
                                         Action. Review and revise, if necessary, local municipal codes to
                                         address water supply standards recommended by the Board of
                                         Forestry and Fire Protection.

10. Subdivision Map Requirements
As a condition of subdivision map approval, the City requires that:
1) subdivision design shall provide for safe and ready access for fire
and other emergency equipment and evacuation routes; 2) the
subdivision shall be served by water supplies for fire protection in
accordance with designated standards; and 3) in hazardous fire
areas, all flammable or combustible vegetation shall be removed
from around all structures in accordance with the Fire Code.
However, recently adopted codes (Government 66474.02) require
additional findings to be made for the approval of a tentative or
parcel map in very high fire severity zones.
Action. Review and, if necessary, revise Yucaipa Municipal Code to
incorporate criteria for tentative and parcel map approvals specified
in Government Code 66474.02.
11. Upgrade and Retrofit Program
Yucaipa’s structures, streets, water infrastructure, and other
features were built in accordance with fire, seismic, flooding, and
other safety codes required at that time. The City strives to ensure
that public buildings, roads, water infrastructure, and other
features are built or retrofitted to meet required safety standards.
However, there may be a need to retrofit older structures, buildings
and infrastructure outside the purview of City responsibility, such
as privately owned mobile homes, buildings, water facilities, and
other infrastructure. The City will continue to explore options for
grants, loans, and/or other funding mechanisms to address
buildings, structures, and facilities needing upgrade.
Action. Continue to upgrade public facilities in compliance with
state and federal law. Explore grants, loans, and other mechanisms
to encourage the retrofit of privately owned structures, buildings,
infrastructure, and other features to meet current safety codes.
12. Hazard Mitigation/Emergency Operations Plan Update
Yucaipa prepares and implements a Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP)
and Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) to protect the community
from disasters. Both plans are updated regularly in accordance with
state and federal law. The Safety Element identified potential
evacuation routes, depending on the hazard. To address other
changing requirements, future updates of the EOP, HMP, and
Safety Element will ensure that policies, procedures, and protocols
will be mutually supportive and consistent with one another.
Action. Review and, if necessary, revise the HMP and EOP to
address protocols, procedures, and mapping for evacuation routes
and overlay districts. Update the safety element as required to
incorporate climate change and resiliency strategies from the HMP
and revisions to the EOP that are made in subsequent updates.
                                                                       CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 7-49

INTRODUCTION
When Yucaipans talk about quality of life, they often mean the
quality of community services for residents, business, and visitors.    In This Element:
These include a variety of services that enrich community life—
schools and libraries, arts and cultural events, health and human         + Educational Resources
services, and parks and recreation, to name a few. These public           + Human Services
services and associated facilities are the result of careful planning     + Cultural Arts
and coordination between the City and community organizations,
                                                                          + Community Safety
in addition to informed decisions and funding.
                                                                          + Water Management
Although less visible than public services, a reliable infrastructure     + Wastewater Management
system is also vital to Yucaipa’s livability and economic well‐being.
                                                                          + Infrastructure Planning
This includes a variety of physical facilities for the conveyance of
vital services and functions, such as water storage and distribution,     + Energy and Communications
wastewater collection and treatment, storm drainage and flood             + Waste Management
control, energy, communications, and solid waste disposal. While
physical infrastructure systems are often taken for granted, they are
an essential part of the community’s quality of life.
State general plan law does not require the preparation of this
general plan element. However, proactive planning for public
services, facilities, and infrastructure is essential. Public services,
facilities, and infrastructure are also vital to the implementation of
other general plan elements, such as land use and safety. This
element implements the General Plan vision for quality public
facilities, schools, community services, and excellent infrastructure,
community services, and public facilities for all Yucaipans.
                                                                             CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 8-1

benefit children and their families living or working in the City,
particularly those working outside the home. To meet this need,
Yucaipa has a range of private, public, and faith-based
organizations that provide early child care and education services.
Seven local agencies, including one on the Crafton Hills College
campus, provide childcare services for 425 students.

                                        Empire Family Resource Center Coalition also focuses on improving
                                        quality of life for families.
                                        Seniors
                                        Many seniors choose Yucaipa for its peaceful environment and
                                        active lifestyle. The Scherer Senior Center provides an array of
                                        programs, including aerobics, dance, arts and crafts, special
                                        activities, trips, and events. In addition to social and fitness
                                        programs, the center acts as a referral agency for legal, medical,
                                        and financial issues and hosts the Senior Nutrition Program.
                                        Yucaipa’s “Kaleidoscope” newsletter provides a year-round

Community Participation
Nonprofit organizations, service clubs, volunteer organizations,
faith-based organizations, businesses, and residents serve the
Yucaipa community in many ways.
Volunteerism
More than 100 registered organizations are active in educating
youth and adults, providing social and human services, and             Yucaipa’s more than 100
meeting the needs of the Yucaipa community. Yucaipa City Hall                nonprofit- and faith-

   + Healthy Yucaipa Committee
   + Mobile home Rent Review Commission
   + Parks and Recreation Commission
   + Trails and Open Space Committee
   + Economic Development Advisory Committee
   + Youth Advisory Committee
Partnerships
As with recreational programs, expanding partnerships is essential
to providing a range of human services for Yucaipans. The City of
Yucaipa, like most communities, has neither the funding nor state
mandate to provide human service programs. Moreover, Yucaipa
recognizes that nonprofit, private, and faith-based organizations
are well suited to meeting the needs of residents. The City
therefore seeks to support and empower community organizations
through shared facility use agreements, grant applications, and a
coherent plan to leverage volunteerism.
Yucaipa continues to support efforts of local nonprofit 501(c)(3)
agencies and organizations that provide valuable services,
programs, and/or events for residents. Annually, the City supports
organizations through the Yucaipa Community Activity Grant
Program. Local nonprofit agencies/organizations may request
matching funds for eligible activities—including ongoing programs
and services, new programs and services, and small- to large-scale
special events that meet established guidelines.
The following goal and policies illustrate how the City supports the
provision of human services in Yucaipa.
                                                                     CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 8-7

CULTURAL ARTS
Cultural arts involve a broad range of expressions found through
performing arts, visual arts, and fine arts. While people participate
in cultural arts in different ways and at various skill levels, cultural
arts can improve the quality of community life. Cultural arts provide
a way to preserve, celebrate, and create community identity;
engage participation in civic life; inform and learn from diverse
audiences; and communicate shared values and experiences.
Performing Arts
Yucaipa supports the community’s growing performing arts efforts.
The City is home to two community theaters: Yucaipa Little Theatre
and Heartland Players. Open since 1947, Yucaipa Little Theater
produces a variety of performances—from classics to original                   Local theater production
productions. Heartland Players Theater features adaptations of
popular performances as well as original material. Stars of
Tomorrow Theater, a youth fine arts program in Redlands, partners
with Heartland Players Theater to hold theater camps for children.
Crafton Hills College also plays a key role in supporting performing
arts by offering two-year degrees in arts, theater, and music. The
fine arts program hosts exhibitions at the Crafton Hills College Art
Gallery. Live theatrical and musical performances are held at its
campus theater. The campus is also home to a range of special
events, like “Celebration at Crafton Hills/Waa't.” In addition, the
Yucaipa Performing Arts Council is active in supporting a new
performing arts center in the community.
Visual and Other Creative Arts
Yucaipa is becoming known for its visual and creative arts. The
Yucaipa Valley Arts Association is a nonprofit organization
established to promote fine art and photography. Vision Quest
fosters public interest in creative thinking and enhancement of
quality of life through art and other creative activities. The Yucaipa
Valley Gem and Mineral Society promotes the lapidary arts through
education, field trips, and public exhibitions. Yucaipa is also home
to organizations supporting music and other creative arts.
Yucaipa remains committed to creating a civic environment where
artistic expression flourishes, where arts benefit the economy, and
where City leaders can incorporate arts into local decision making.
Yucaipa’s investment in a performing arts center and cultural arts
center will attract visitors, strengthen the economy, and provide an
opportunity for local creative arts to flourish. The City’s emphasis
on creative arts also allows greater synergy with professional
degrees offered by Crafton Hills College in music, art, and theatre.
                                                                         CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 8-9

                                             History and Culture
                                             Yucaipa’s more recent history dates back a century or more, to
                                             ranchers, prospectors, developers, railroad workers, and others
                                             who came to the valley. By the time Yucaipa incorporated in 1989,
                                             many of the community’s original buildings, structures, and
                                             landscapes had changed. However, remnants of Yucaipa’s past
                                             remain in the built environment and the memories of residents.
                                             Historic resources include:

                                                + Cherry Croft School, the first school in Yucaipa
     Uptown Yucaipa hosts a variety of
   seasonal events for families and youth.      + Yucaipa Adobe, the oldest structure in the county
                                                + Mousley Museum, built in the 1920s

                                             The Yucaipa Valley Historical Society is committed to preserving the
                                             history of Yucaipa Valley and serves as a repository for collections,
                                             artifacts, records, pictures, and writings that depict the valley’s
                                             history. Museums in Yucaipa and Oak Glen document local history:
                                             Mousley Museum of Natural History, Yucaipa Adobe Museum, Old
                                             Fire Station Museum, and Oak Glen School Museum.
                                             Community Events
                                             Yucaipans have always enjoyed gathering for parades, picnics, and
                                             community events—from the early Apple Shows of 1911 through
                                             the 1940s, to the Peach Festivals and Yucaipa Valley Days of the
                                             1950s, to the events of recent years. These events are opportunities
                                             for Yucaipa residents to spend time with family and friends, stroll
                                             through downtown, or celebrate important seasons or events.
                                             Yucaipa’s events continue to evolve with changing times.
Yucaipa’s Music & Arts Festival is a popular
community event for residents and visitors.
                                             Yucaipa maintains a year-round calendar of events for residents,
                                             visitors, and businesses. Traditional community events include the

                                             festivals held in Oak Glen. The City celebrates art, music, and
                                             culture in various venues. The Yucaipa Music & Arts Festival has
                                             become a premiere family event in the community, supporting the
                                             City’s growing arts culture, economy, and tourism.

Traffic Safety
The Yucaipa Police Department responds to several hundred
vehicular accidents each year in and around the community.
Recognizing the importance of public safety, Yucaipa police
implement many programs to improve traffic safety. In addition to
regular traffic enforcement, the City holds saturation patrols that
focus on enforcement in problem areas and at DUI checkpoints,        Public safety is a highly
and educates off-road recreational drivers.                          valued service in Yucaipa.

organizations sponsor the event and have provided thousands of
bicycle helmets at no cost to youth. In addition, traffic Safety
meetings are held monthly with other departments to coordinate
traffic safety measures and enhanced patrols in areas of concern.
Safe Neighborhoods
The Yucaipa Police Department also implements a wide variety of
programs to improve and maintain the safety of neighborhoods. It
implements a Neighborhood Watch initiative in many
neighborhoods, crime-free multiple-family housing program for
apartment complexes, school resource officer at Yucaipa High
School, park patrols through its volunteer corps, and neighborhood
sweeps, among other efforts.
Code enforcement is another means to improve and maintain the
safety of neighborhoods. The code enforcement team works with
the police department to enforce codes that protect residents,
visitors, and businesses. Programs address:
   + Abandoned vehicle abatement
   + Building, land use, and animal raising violations
   + Comprehensive inspection of mobile home parks
   + Enforcement of the business license ordinance
   + Graffiti abatement and public nuisances
Volunteer and Community Service
Although it is the responsibility of the police department to ensure
a safe living and working environment in Yucaipa, public safety is
also a community-wide effort. Police department staff is
supplemented by hundreds of volunteers who donate over 30,000
hours of services annually. Volunteers provide staffing for line
reserves, citizen patrol, search and rescue teams, mounted posses,
a chaplain corps, and Explorer Scouts. Volunteers enable Yucaipa
Police Department to provide a much higher level of service.

WATER MANAGEMENT
Ensuring the long-term supply of water is one of the most critical
issues facing Yucaipa and communities throughout California.
Desert climates, declining groundwater resources, and state and
federal laws have made it increasingly challenging to maintain
reliable sources of water. The City of Yucaipa and its water
providers recognize that the long-term solution to this challenge
must include an integrated water management approach.
Water Supplies
Yucaipa’s water service is provided by four water purveyors—
Yucaipa Valley Water District (YVWD), South Mesa Mutual Water
Company, Western Heights Water Company, and Redlands
Municipal Utilities and Engineering Department. Yucaipa’s water
infrastructure is extensive, and its value likely exceeds $300 million.
It includes more than 200 miles of water mains, 22 pressure zones,
15 booster stations, water reservoirs, treatment plants, and more
than 26 million gallons of water storage capacity.
Of the four water agencies, the YVWD is the largest municipal
provider of water, supplying approximately 50,000 residents and
many businesses via 12,000 connections in the community. Smaller
water agencies serve distinct neighborhoods in Yucaipa. Western
Heights Water Company serves the Dunlap Acres planning area.
                                                                              Oak Glen Creek Basin Project
South Mesa Water Company provides water to areas south of
Wildwood Canyon Road between Interstate 10 and Holmes Street.
Redlands Municipal provides limited services as well.
The City of Yucaipa’s water supply is derived from three primary
resources–groundwater, imported water, and recycled water. A
small fraction of the City’s overall water supply is derived from the
Oak Glen, Birch, and Back Canyon creeks and tributaries. The two
private utilities and Redlands continue to derive the majority of
water resources from groundwater. YVWD’s reliance on
groundwater has significantly declined in recent years due to the
prolonged drought, requiring water to be imported from outside
the basin in order to meet the needs of the community.
The Yucaipa General Plan projects considerable future growth and
demand for water that will require additional water supply.
Although local water providers indicate sufficient water supplies for
a 20-year planning horizon, the severity and uncertain duration of
California’s long-standing drought makes water supply unreliable.
Therefore, water supply impacts are considered a significant impact
of the proposed General Plan. The following sections, in
conjunction with discussion under wastewater management,
describe measures undertaken to ensure a reliable supply of water.
                                                                        CITY OF YUCAIPA GENERAL PLAN | 8-15

                                         Watershed Management
                                         The Yucaipa Valley is underlain by three primary water basins—the
                                         Yucaipa, San Timoteo, and Beaumont groundwater basins, with
                                         the first providing the vast majority of water to the community.
                                         Although water levels are the highest in years, the Department of
                                         Water Resources has classified the Yucaipa basin as a “medium
                                         priority basin.” YVWD’s “Strategic Plan for a Sustainable Future”
                                         are intended to guarantee adequate water supplies for Yucaipa
                                         without exceeding the long-term, safe yield of the basin.
                                         Yucaipa employs conjunctive use projects to recharge the Yucaipa
                                         basin, manage groundwater resources, and ensure its
                                         sustainability. The Oak Glen Creek Basin Project is an award-wining
                                         model of integrated watershed management practices. This project
                                         not only helps to control flooding, but also improves water quality,
                                         recharges groundwater supplies, and provides trails and green
                                         spaces for the community. The district is building other conjunctive
                                         use projects (e.g., Three Basins) to replenish groundwater supplies.
                                         The City of Yucaipa actively works with its many partners on
                                         watershed management issues. One such group is the Inland
                                         Empire Resource Conservation District (IERCD). The District has

                                         travel to schools, environmental education centers, libraries, and
                                         other community facilities in order to present environmental
                                         education programs to students in local school districts.
                                         Water Conservation
                                         Conserving water is essential to a long-term reliable water supply.
                                         The local urban water management plan that covers Yucaipa
                                         contains a drought contingency plan for these purposes. During a
                                         drought, YVWD’s water shortage contingency plan has four stages
                                         of response based on the severity of drought—advisory, voluntary,
                                         mandatory, and emergency curtailment. Besides mandated
                                         reductions during drought, Yucaipa also requires a range of best
                                         practices to control the use of potable water where feasible.
                                         Strategies include the use of water-efficient landscaping in new
                                         development and tiered water rates that encourage conservation.
                                         In 2015, the State Water Resources Control Board adopted
                                         emergency regulations to achieve a statewide reduction in potable
                                         urban water use. These emergency water conservation regulations
                                         require the YVWD to achieve a 36 percent reduction based on the
                                         amount of potable water produced in 2013. In response to the
                                         state’s emergency regulations, the YVWD adopted resolution No.
                                         2014-14 to implement the Mandatory Storage of the Phased
                                         Curtailment Plan in the Water Shortage Contingency Plan,
                                         declaring the YVWD in a Stage 3 drought. Until lifted, the YVWD is
                                         in process of implementing water conservation measures.

Water Quality
The Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and other laws
require public agencies to achieve water quality standards to
protect public health and the beneficial uses of California’s
waterways. South Mesa Mutual Water Company and Western
Heights Water Company treat water at individual wells and booster
stations before it enters the distribution system. YVWD processes
its drinking water at the Yucaipa Valley Regional Water Filtration
Facility using macro- and molecular filtration processes.
The YVWD implements a range of other methods to meet state
and federal water quality standards. Among others, these measures
include: 1) state-of-the-art technology at its treatment facilities; 2)
transporting salts out of the watershed through the regional brine
line; 3) diverting flood water to large open space areas where it

WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT
Yucaipa’s history with wastewater management dates back before
incorporation to the 1960s, when the community was identified
for sanitation improvements to address groundwater quality. With
significant investments in infrastructure, Yucaipa now has one of
the most advanced wastewater programs in California. Yucaipa’s
integrated approach addresses the full cycle of generation,
collection, treatment, and disposal or reuse of wastewater.
Collection, Treatment, and Disposal
The Yucaipa Valley Water District is responsible for managing all
public wastewater treatment infrastructure in the community.
Yucaipa’s waste management collection and treatment system
consists of more than 200 miles of gravity sewer main lines and six
lift stations. Treatment is provided at the Wochholz Regional Water
Filtration Facility (WRWRF), a state-of-the-art treatment facility.
Other major infrastructure includes a 15-mile brine line.
Wastewater assets exceed more than $100 million.                         Henry Wochholz Regional Water
                                                                      Recycling Facility serves Yucaipa Valley.
The WRWRF provides primary, advanced biological secondary, and
tertiary treatment with advanced total nitrogen removal. The
advanced tertiary filtration process consists of microfiltration to
remove particles followed by ultraviolet disinfection. This advanced
tertiary treatment readily meets the coliform bacteria removal and
turbidity requirements of Title 22 for reclaimed water. With respect
to capacity, the WRWRF currently treats over 4.5 million gallons per
day of wastewater, with available expansion capacity to 8.0 mgd.
Recycled Water Use
During the production of recycled water, excessive salts and
minerals are removed. These excessive salts and minerals must be
disposed before depositing water into the groundwater basin. The
Yucaipa Valley Regional Brineline allows for safe disposal of salts
produced by the WRWRF as it recycles water for nonpotable uses.
The Yucaipa Valley Water District operates a 15-mile extension of
the Santa Ana Regional Interceptor (“Brine Line”) that allows for
safe disposal of salts produced out of the Santa Ana Watershed.
YWVD and the City recognize that the current local surface water
and groundwater supplies are not sufficient to meet the estimated
water demands of the City. Since 2002, YVWD has been building a
dual-plumbed water system that allows the use of recycled water
for building plumbing or landscape irrigation. Since 2002, YVWD
has provided 1.5 billion gallons of nonpotable water, reducing
groundwater use by an estimated 1 million gallons daily. The City is
installing a backbone infrastructure system for increasing recycled
water deliveries to one-quarter of total agency water demands.

                                         Stormwater Management
                                         Stormwater/urban runoff is water that runs off roadways, concrete
                                         surfaces, agricultural fields, and other surfaces during or after
                                         rainfall. This water picks up pollutants, such as cigarettes, animal
                                         wastes, trash, oil and grease, pesticides and fertilizers, and other
                                         chemicals. Unlike sewage, which goes to treatment plants to
                                         remove toxins, urban runoff flows untreated through the storm
                                         drain system to channels, rivers, and eventually to the ocean. These
                                         pollutants can pollute groundwater, streams, and habitat.
                                         The San Bernardino County Flood Control District regulates runoff
                                         and water quality as required under state law. Yucaipa is a co-
                                         permittee under a General MS4 Permit and is responsible for
                                         making rules to manage and reduce runoff. The City regulates
                                         discharges to the storm drain system. For new projects, the City
                                         requires developers to submit a stormwater quality management
                                         plan that describes best management practices that will be
                                         implemented to minimize site runoff.

 winning example of conjunctive use.     Septic System Conversion
                                         As early as the 1960s, the Yucaipa Valley Water District began
                                         planning a public sewer system to eliminate the water quality
                                         impacts from 10,000 privately owned septic tanks and leaching
                                         pits. Thirty years later, the majority of lots in Yucaipa have access to
                                         sewer mains. However, three remaining areas still have limited or
                                         intermittent sewer infrastructure—Dunlap Acres, northeast
                                         Yucaipa, and the southeast corner of Yucaipa along Wildwood
                                         Drive. YVWD enforces regulations to ensure compliance with future
                                         regulations from the regional water quality control board.
                                         YVWD requires projects of five or more units and within 1,000 feet
                                         of any existing or agreed-upon sewage collection facility to extend
                                         the public sewer line to serve the project. If active sewer collection
                                         facilities are not available, the project can install a dry sewer
                                         collection system. Smaller projects are exempt unless located within
                                         500 feet of the sewer system that could serve the parcel. Any new
                                         development not connected to an active sewer collection system
                                         must participate in a Sewer Septic System Offset Program to
                                         mitigate pollution created by the addition of a new septic system.
                                         As these areas develop, plans exist to expand sewer services. This
                                         transition will allow the YVWD to comply with future regulations
                                         from the State of California Regional Water Quality Control Board.
                                         The following goal and policies implement a strategic and
                                         sustainable plan for wastewater resource planning.

GOAL PSF-6: WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT
Infrastructure that is available and able to
sustainably collect, treat, store, reuse, and safely
dispose of wastewater for existing and future needs.
Policies
PSF-6.1    Infrastructure. Work with service providers to assess
           the adequacy of utilities in existing developed areas,
           and implement needed improvements to address
           existing and future wastewater treatment needs.
PSF-6.2    Brine Line. Continue to support the Yucaipa Valley

           new infrastructure investments that support advanced
           water treatment methods.
PSF-6.3    Septic Systems. Protect groundwater quality by
           supporting water district efforts to phase out existing
           septic systems, extend main lines, and establish
           connections to sewer infrastructure where feasible.
PSF-6.4    Recycled Water. Work with YVWD and end users to
           ensure the highest possible quality of wastewater
           treatment; increase and maximize the use of recycled
           water for existing and future needs.
PSF-6.5    Service Levels. Work with wastewater service providers
           in Yucaipa to maintain adopted service standards for
           sewer service systems and fee structures that are
           equitable and efficient.
PSF-6.6    Reduced System Demand. Reduce wastewater system
           demand by: requiring water-conserving designs and
           equipment; encouraging water-conserving devices;
           and designing wastewater systems to minimize inflow
           and infiltration.
PSF-6.7    Groundwater Quality. Continue to treat wastewater in
           accordance with regional water quality control board
           requirements and state and federal standards prior to
           discharge into San Timoteo Creek.
PSF-6.8    Sanitary Sewer Overflows. Continue to proactively
           work with and educate businesses, residents, schools,
           and other institutions in Yucaipa to prevent and
           mitigate sanitary sewer overflows.
PSF-6.9    Stormwater Runoff. Require new developments that
           add substantial impervious surfaces to integrate low
           impact development best management practices (e.g.,
           permeable pavements) to reduce stormwater runoff.

                                         INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING
                                         The City of Yucaipa and other agencies and organizations provide
                                         an array of public facilities and services for the community. As part
                                         of this charge, the City actively plans for the provision and
                                         financing of infrastructure and services to maintain quality of life.
                                         These goals are achieved through rigorous infrastructure planning
                                         and the prudent use of financial and other resources.
                                         Infrastructure Levels of Service
                                         Different land uses require different infrastructure and services. The
                                         needs of high-density/intensity development areas can be
                                         significantly higher than those of lower-density/intensity areas.
                                         Thus, the City has set improvement standards for different
                                         planning areas. This system of matching development intensity and
                                         improvements is called the "Improvement Level System" (ILS). The
                                         ILS is determined by the General Plan land uses and the intended
                                         density and intensity of development planned for the area.
                                         The four ILS categories are described here and in Table PSF-1.
                                            + Level 4: This level applies to areas where only a limited amount
                                              of low-density development is planned or anticipated due to

                                              and focus primarily on safe access and the availability of water.
                                              Typical ultimate lot sizes range from five to ten acres.
                                            + Level 3: This level applies to areas that may be considered
                                              "transitional," such as a low-density area that is near an urban
                                              or urbanizing area. Such an area might have a significant
                                              amount of low- to moderate-density development or acreage
                                              that is expected to convert to a higher density in the future.
                                              Typical ultimate lot sizes range from one to five acres.
                                            + Level 2: This level applies to areas where the planned density of
                                              development in the short term is relatively high and to areas
                                              that are partially developed and/or subdivided at one acre or
                                              less in size and where existing infrastructure facilities and
                                              distribution systems are largely in place. Typical ultimate lot
                                              sizes range from one-half to one acre.
                                            + Level 1: This level applies to areas planned for the highest
                                              intensity/density of development. This may include large areas
                                              designated for commercial, industrial, or multi-family uses and
                                              higher density, single-family residential uses. In most cases,
                                              ILS 1 is suited for core areas of established urban or urbanizing
                                              cities. Typical final lot sizes are less than one-half acre.

The City of Yucaipa manages and operates many public facilities,
infrastructure, and community services throughout the City. Like all
municipalities, the City faces increased pressure to deliver the same
level of municipal services with fewer resources. At the same time,
the City also faces higher expectations to operate and manage
facilities in a sustainable manner by reducing energy and water
consumption and the generation of waste. Policies in this section
provide for high-quality and efficient services throughout the City.
The City of Yucaipa strives to raise funds and wisely use resources
to maximize the provision of municipal services. Funding may be
raised through a combination of impact fees, grants, fair share cost
arrangements, and service fees where appropriate. Meanwhile, the
City makes prudent decisions on spending funds through both
City-provided and contract services. And at all times, the City
maintains strong reserve/contingency funds to buffer economic
downturns. This commitment continues to be a model of success.
Goals and policies to address infrastructure planning follow.

ENERGY AND COMMUNICATIONS
Yucaipa has hundreds of miles of utility lines that extend under or
above every street, sidewalk, and public right-of-way. These include
electricity and gas lines, cable and telephone lines, and water and
sewer lines. These lines are responsible for powering homes and
businesses and facilitating routine and advanced methods of
communication. In fact, this infrastructure is often taken for
granted until an outage occurs. The efficient and reliable
management of these services is a key objective.
Electrical and Gas Service
Southern California Edison (SCE) is responsible for providing
electrical service to Yucaipa residents and businesses. SCE obtains
its electricity from a variety of generating sources, including fossil  SCE displays services at an emergency
fuel, wind, nuclear, and even geothermal. Energy generated from                  preparedness event.
these sources is transmitted through the grid, a complex network
of high-voltage transmission lines, switching facilities, and
substations. These electric utility lines are routed along city streets
or other publicly owned rights-of-way.
Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas) supplies natural gas
services to Yucaipa. Natural gas is conveyed through a network of
pipelines from gas fields hundreds of miles away. High-pressure
transmission lines transport natural gas from the Mojave Valley
down the Cajon Pass along the I-15 to transmission lines along I-10
to Yucaipa. High-pressure distribution lines extend from I-10
northward along Sand Canyon Road and portions of 5th Street,
and eastward along Avenue E and Avenue H.
Communications and Information
Effective communication is essential to the efficient operation of
business and government and for individual convenience. The past
decade has seen unprecedented and rapid improvements in
communications and information technologies. Satellites, the
Internet, and widespread use of personal computers and cellular
telephones have dramatically changed society. Today, telephone
lines, television cables, fiber-optic cables, and wireless technology
connect us and provide access to a wealth of information.
As part of the El Casco System Project, SCE’s new fiber-optic
telecommunications system has been installed and is available to
fully serve the needs of the Yucaipa community. The backbone line
generally bisects the community along Bryant Avenue, extending
north to the Zanja substation near Mill Creek and southward to the
Yucaipa substation along Wildwood Canyon Road to Interstate 10.
The Yucaipa-Calimesa Joint Unified School District, Crafton Hills
College, Yucaipa Valley Water District, and city hall are just a few of
the public entities that benefit from fiber-optic technology.

                                           Renewable Energy and Conservation
                                           Climate change is an increasingly acknowledged concern. The
                                           problem is caused by greenhouse gases being released into the air
                                           faster than the earth’s natural systems can reabsorb them. The
                                           predominant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in most
                                           cities is energy use in buildings, automobiles, and large-scale public
                                           utilities such as water transmission. The long-term solution to GHG
                                           reduction must include decreasing/conserving energy use and
                                           increasing production of renewable energy (solar or wind power).
                                           State law already requires SCE to diversify its sources of energy to
                                           include renewable sources like wind and solar. Yucaipa is helping
                                           to promote solar as an alternative energy source. The City’s
                                           photovoltaic solar carport canopy at Community Park powers the
                                           City’s Community Center. Solar generation technology is also used

                                           Aesthetics and Visual Blight
                                           Energy and communication infrastructure also presents challenges.
                                           Overhead utility lines and poles are often a source of visual blight.
                                           City codes require that utility lines (e.g., electric, telephone, cable)
                                           installed as part of new development projects be placed
                                           underground. The City also has the authority to establish
                                           underground utility districts and associated assessments when
                                           conditions warrant to avoid over-concentration of overhead
                                           utilities, visual blight, and safety concerns.
                                           Poorly sited telephone antennas, wireless towers, overhead lines,
                                           radio towers, cable boxes, and other facilities are visual blight.
                                           Efforts must be made to reduce or eliminate adverse visual impacts.
                                           This may require relocating obtrusive facilities or camouflaging
                                           equipment and facilities to the extent feasible. In addition to visual
                                           impacts, these installations can also emit low levels of noise from
                                           the control equipment that create potential noise and/or safety
                                           concerns in residential neighborhoods and mixed‐use areas.
                                           Energy Safety
                                           Yucaipa, like many communities in southern California, is crossed
                                           by high pressure distribution gas lines, overhead electrical lines, cell
                                           phone towers, and infrastructure that power homes and businesses
                                           and allow communication in a wide variety of modes. These
                                           sources of energy transmission and their proximity to homes can
                                           cause residents concern about potential health and safety impacts.
                                           The City works closely with Southern California Edison, Southern
                                           California Gas, the water districts, and other utility service providers
                                           to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of Yucaipa residents.

                                         WASTE MANAGEMENT
                                         The State of California has required communities to be more
                                         proactive in addressing waste management. The reasons have been
                                         many—the shortage of landfill space, the cost of natural resources
                                         to manufacture goods, and the air pollution resulting from
                                         manufacturing. In 1989, the state legislature passed Assembly Bill
                                         939, the landmark bill requiring recycling in California.
                                         Although state legislation has increased waste management costs,
                                         Yucaipa understands that proactive waste management practices
                                         are important to protect the environment. Yucaipa has adopted an
                                         integrated waste management approach that includes waste
                                         prevention (or “source reduction”), recycling and composting, and
                                         the combustion or disposal of waste into landfills.
                                                                    Mulch recycling
                                         The City of Yucaipa, General Services/City Clerk’s Department,
                                         provides waste management services through a contractor.
                                         Yucaipa has established the following programs:
                                           + Mandatory residential recycling program
                                           + Mandatory commercial and multifamily recycling program
                                           + Household hazardous waste and electronic waste program
                                           + Mulch, compost, and Christmas tree recycling program
                                           + Waste oil/filter program
                                           + Construction and demolition recycling
                                           + Frail/handicap household pull-out service
                                         The following goal and policies advance the City’s efforts in
                                         implementing its integrated waste management programs.

GOAL PSF-9: WASTE MANAGEMENT
A cost-effective, integrated waste management
system that meets or exceeds recycling and waste
diversion mandates and community expectations.                         Yucaipa has been successful
                                                                       in diverting more than 50
Policies                                                               percent of its solid waste
PSF-9.1   Diversion. Continue implementing waste reduction,            from disposal in the landfill
          reuse, and recycling programs to divert recyclable           through a range of source
          materials from landfills; expand programs as needed in       reduction, recycling, and
          response to state mandates and local priorities.             related programs for
                                                                       residents and businesses.
PSF-9.2   Organic Wastes. Continue to encourage and diversify
          the organic waste program, including landscaping,
          Christmas trees, composting and mulch, and other
          sources of organic waste that are deemed appropriate.
PSF-9.3   Hazardous Waste. Protect the community from the
          dangers of hazardous waste and materials (oil,
          household cleaners, pesticides, e-waste, etc.) through
          education, monitoring, and enforcement of proper
          use, storage, handling, and disposal.
PSF-9.4   Construction/Demolition. Require developers to recycle
          construction debris for residential, multifamily and
          commercial construction, and demolition projects that
          meet certain thresholds.
PSF-9.5   Agricultural Waste. Work with residents and
          businesses to implement agricultural waste programs
          that are cost-effective and sanitary, and that minimize
          adverse impacts on the community and environment.
PSF-9.6   Fees and Funding. Periodically adjust collection,
          recycling, and disposal fees to achieve state and
          federal mandates, meet community expectations, and
          reflect cost efficiencies or increases for service delivery.
PSF-9.7   Public Education. Collaborate with the solid waste
          collection service provider to educate the public on
          how to help divert recyclable materials from landfills
          and safely dispose of household hazardous wastes.

1. Introduction
A.        BACKGROUND
The State of California recognizes that an adequate supply of affordable
housing for all income levels is a fundamental need for all communities. To
achieve that goal, it is critical that all local governments share in the
responsibility of implementing solutions to address local and regional
housing needs. To that end, all California local governments are required to
prepare a housing element (or housing chapter of the general plan) that
specifies how the community will plan for its housing needs.
The detailed statutory requirements for preparing a housing element are
codified in the California Government Code (sections 65580–65589). As stated
therein, the housing element must contain an identification and analysis of its
existing and projected housing needs; an analysis of the various
governmental and nongovernmental constraints to meeting that need; and a
series of goals, policies, and scheduled programs to further the development,
improvement, and preservation of housing.
The Yucaipa Housing Element has six sections:
    Chapter 1, Introduction, provides an introduction to the statutory
     authority and requirements for the housing element, related planning
     efforts, and a description of the public outreach process;
    Chapter 2, Community Profile, provides an analysis of demographic,
     social, and housing characteristics; current and future housing needs due
     to population growth and change; and other housing issues and needs;
    Chapter 3, Constraint Analysis, provides an analysis of the governmental
     and nongovernmental constraints that affect the development,
     maintenance, and improvement of housing for all income groups;
    Chapter 4, Housing Resources, provides an analysis of the available land
     for housing, as well as the financial resources and administrative capacity
     to manage housing programs.
    Chapter 5, Program Evaluation, provides a review of accomplishments
     from the prior housing element, including the relevance of current goals,
     policies, and programs.
    Chapter 6, Housing Plan, contains specific goals, policies, and
     implementation programs to address the development, improvement,
     and conservation of housing that will address housing needs in Yucaipa.
                                                                        CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT 1

Introduction
                                  B.        RELATED PLANS
                                  Yucaipa’s 2014–2021 Housing Element is related to many other local planning
                                  efforts, some of which are mandated by the State of California and the federal
                                  government. The housing element is required to maintain consistency with
                                  each of them. The following list describes these documents and how the City
                                  will maintain consistency with each of them.
                                      General Plan Consistency. The 2014–2021 Housing Element is
                                       consistent with the other general plan elements. The sites designated for
                                       housing are capable of accommodating the City’s entire regional housing
                                       needs allocation. The identified housing sites are also consistent with the
                                       land use plan in the general plan and the growth projections analyzed in
                                       the environmental impact report. The City will maintain consistency
                                       between general plan elements by ensuring that proposed changes in
                                       one element, including the housing element, are reflected in other
                                       elements when such amendments of the general plan are needed.
                                      Water and Sewer Services. Yucaipa is served by the Yucaipa Valley
                                       Water District and several smaller private water companies, which are
                                       responsible for providing water services to Yucaipa residents and
                                       businesses. In accordance with state law, the City transmitted its 2014–

                                       section 65302 of the Government Code, cities must amend the safety and
                                       open space and conservation elements of their general plan to include
                                       analysis and policies for flood hazard and management information. The
                                       City of Yucaipa is completing its third general plan update, including its
                                       housing element, and will comply with these requirements. For example,
                                       the general plan contains policies and programs to address future
                                       drainage and flood hazards for housing sites. Future updates of the
                                       housing element will incorporate any changes in flood hazard and
                                       management information.
                                      Federal Consolidated Plan. Yucaipa is a member of the San Bernardino
                                       County Urban County Consortium and participates in countywide efforts
                                       to receive housing and community development funds. Yucaipa had the
                                       opportunity to participate in the county effort for the consolidated plan.
                                       The housing, community development, and economic needs identified
                                       during that planning effort and the program commitments made in the
                                       housing element are consistent with one another. Where differences are
                                       identified, the differences are in the magnitude of special needs and
                                       lower-moderate income concentrations, which are greater in the county.

C.        PUBLIC OUTREACH
California law requires that local governments include public participation as
part of the housing element. Specifically, Government Code section
65583(c)(7) states “that the local government shall make a diligent effort to
achieve public participation of all economic segments of the community in
the development of the housing element, and the program shall describe this
effort.” State law does not specify the means and methods for participation;
however, it is generally recognized that the participation must be inclusive.
As part of the general plan update, the City of Yucaipa conducted an
extensive public engagement program to solicit views from the community.
Described below, these forums offered input for the housing element:
    Workshop(s) with the general plan advisory committee
    2 public hearings prior to release of draft
    2 public hearings for adoption of the housing element
General Plan Advisory Committee
A GPAC meeting was held on September 27, 2012, to discuss housing needs.
Prior to the meeting, the City invited 28 different organizations to participate.
These included the Yucaipa Valley Water District and two water companies,
several nonprofit housing organizations (CORE, Habitat for Humanity,
Southern California Association of Nonprofit Housing, Neighborhood Housing
Services for the Inland Empire, etc.), Chamber of Commerce, 12 realtor offices,
the Housing Authority of San Bernardino County, and others.
Issues raised at the meeting included:
    Expand housing types. Need moderately priced townhomes and
     apartments suitable for seniors, students at Crafton College, and families.
    Preserve community character. Need to preserve character of
     community and established neighborhoods that define Yucaipa.
    Create neighborhoods. Create unique neighborhood in uptown district,
     improve infrastructure in Dunlap acres, and improve other areas.
    Property maintenance. Focus on code enforcement efforts to address
     the storage of materials in certain neighborhoods.
    Incentives. Provide lot consolidation or density incentives to encourage
     recycling of parcels, particularly homes in significant disrepair.
    Special needs. Continue to address the special housing needs of people
     of all ages in the community, such as seniors, students, and families.
                                                                        CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT       3

2. Housing Needs
To provide a context for housing planning, this chapter provides an overview
of Yucaipa and discusses a variety of demographic, economic, housing, and
special needs characteristics and trends to identify issues that affect the City’s
existing and future housing needs.
A.       DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS
POPULATION GROWTH
Today, the City of Yucaipa is the 16th most populous city in San Bernardino
County, with a population of 51,376 as of the 2010 Census. In recent decades,
San Bernardino County has been one of the fastest growing counties in the
region. Between 1990 and 2000, the City’s population increased 25% as new
single-family housing tracts, like Chapman Heights and other developments,
were built. This rate of growth continued in the early 2000s, fueled by a
regional housing construction boom that peaked in 2006.
Development has significantly slowed in the last few years, largely in part due
to the national recession and downturn of the housing market. The recession
is expected to have a slowing effect on growth over the next few years.
Yucaipa is projected to grow in population by 9% between 2010 and 2020.
Buildout of the community is anticipated to be about 75,000 residents.
                                                                         CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT 5

Housing Needs
                                   AGE CHARACTERISTICS
                                   Yucaipa’s population characteristics have a key influence on housing need.
                                   One of these characteristics is the age of the population. Some differences in
                                   housing preferences are affected by wealth and income, while others are
                                   affected by household type and age. Both household formation and housing
                                   choice are linked to life cycle events such as leaving home, getting married,
                                   having children, changing jobs, retirement, and death of spouse. These break
                                   points define increasingly lengthy stays in the same housing unit.
                                   Different age groups have different housing needs based on lifestyles, family
                                   types, income levels, and housing preference. Typically, younger households
                                   seek affordable rental housing opportunities as they begin their careers. As
                                   adults spend more time in the workforce and form families they may seek
                                   larger homes and opportunities to build equity through home ownership.
                                   Seniors may eventually choose to trade down larger homes that once
                                   accommodated children to smaller and more affordable homes.
                                   Yucaipa has an older population than San Bernardino County as a whole
                                   (Figure 1), with a higher percentage of middle age and senior adults. Table 2-
                                   1 show changes in the age of Yucaipa residents from 2000 to 2010. Over the
                                   past decade, the largest increase in Yucaipa residents was among middle-
  Figure 2-1: Age Characteristics  aged adults, ages 45-64 years, who are presumably attracted to Yucaipa’s
                                   single-family detached housing with large homes and yards. Seniors did not
                                   increase much in number, and actually declined as a share of residents.
                                   However, seniors still comprise a much larger share of Yucaipa’s population
                                   than seniors living in San Bernardino County as a whole.

                                   to 66% by 2010, while Hispanics have increased in share to 27%. There has
                                   also been a marked increase in Asian/Pacific Islander residents.

HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Household type also influences housing need. For instance, single-person
households often occupy smaller apartments or condominiums, such as one-
bedroom units. Couples often prefer larger single-family homes, particularly if
they have children. As the baby boom generation continues to age, there has
been an increased demand from empty nesters and retirees to downsize to
more affordable units that are easier to maintain. These patterns underscore
the need for housing opportunities for people of all ages and income.
Figure 2-3 compares the household composition of San Bernardino County
and Yucaipa residents. In 2010, married family households with children
comprised 25% of Yucaipa’s households, lower than in San Bernardino
County. Yucaipa also has a larger share of seniors. As a result, Yucaipa has a
smaller average household size (2.8 versus 3.3) than San Bernardino County.
As shown in Table 2-2, several key trends occurred in Yucaipa since 2000.
Over the decade, 80% of household growth was attributable to families that
moved to Yucaipa. All other households groups also increased in number, but
collectively contributed to only 20% of the City’s entire growth in households.

Changes in household composition and size will continue to influence the
demand for specific housing types and numbers of bedrooms. Looking
forward to the future, the household composition of Yucaipa should trend
toward younger and middle-aged adults and families. Although the southern
California region as a whole is trending toward older adults, the vast majority
of land in Yucaipa is slated for lower density residential development. The
larger housing types suitable for these residential sites will tend to attract
middle-aged adults and larger families to the community.
                                                                               CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT            7

Housing Needs
                                 ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS
                                 Economic characteristics, such as the employment rate, also affect housing
                                 needs of residents. In 2010, approximately 25,156 Yucaipa residents older
                                 than 16 years were in the labor force (Census, 2010). Yucaipa’s labor force
                                 participation rate of 63% is identical to that of San Bernardino County. This is
                                 an interesting fact given that seniors make up a higher share of the residents
                                 in Yucaipa than the county. This is likely due to lower unemployment
                                 figures—8.9% for Yucaipa versus 11.1% in the County (EDD 2012).
                                 As shown in Table 3, Yucaipa residents work in three key business sectors—
                                 health and education; retail, services and entertainment; and goods
                                 production. These three sectors account for 62% of jobs held by Yucaipa
                                 residents while 74% of all jobs in Yucaipa are in these three sectors. However,
                                 it is important to note that employers in Yucaipa’s job base offer only one-
                                 third of all jobs needed to support Yucaipa residents, meaning that many
                                 residents must commute to surrounding communities.
                                 The local number of jobs-to-employees ratio is an important measure of
                                 whether the City provides the types of jobs that match the skills of its
                                 workforce. The City has three residents in the labor force for every job offered.
                                 While the City offers one retail job for every resident working in that industry,
                                 the ratio increases to only one job for every three residents working in
                                 education and health, and to one job per every five residents working in
                                 public administration or utilities and distribution.
                                 Table 2-3 below summarizes the jobs held by Yucaipa residents (regardless of
                                 the location of the job) versus the jobs offered in Yucaipa.

HOUSEHOLD INCOME
Household income is a fundamental factor affecting housing opportunity. In
2010, the City’s median household income was approximately $57,000, or
approximately 109% of the $52,000 in the county. This is a significant increase
in the past decade—the median income in Yucaipa was $39,000 or only 93%
of the median county household income in 2000. It also reflects the type of
housing growth during that period.
The State of California Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD) surveys households in each county on an annual basis to determine the
median income. The median income is also adjusted for households of
different sizes. Households are then grouped into four income groups for
purposes of determining the need for assistance. Based on 2010 categories,
these income groups and thresholds are:
     Extremely low: households earning up to 30% of the county median
      family income (CMFI), or a maximum income of $20,100 for a household
      of four.
     Very low: households earning 31 to 50% of CMFI, or a maximum income
      of $33,500 for a household of four.
     Other low: households earning 51 to 80% of CMFI, or a maximum of
      $53,600 for a four-person household.
     Moderate: households earning 81 to 120% of CMFI, or a maximum
      income of $75,950 for a household of four.
     Above moderate: households earning above 120% of CMFI, which is
      more than $75,950 for a household of four.
Table 2-4 details the income distribution of households in Yucaipa. Shown
below, the percentage of Yucaipa residents who are low income (40%) is
generally equal to that of San Bernardino County and the region. The
difference is the above moderate income category, in which 44% of Yucaipa
households are included. This is a remarkably high percentage given the
higher percentage of retired seniors living in the community.

Housing Needs
                                    HOUSEHOLD TENURE
                                    Tenure refers to whether a household owns or rents a home. Ample
                                    homeownership and rental opportunities allow people of all incomes and
                                    household sizes to choose the type of housing and location best suited to
                                    their needs and preferences. Vacancy rates, in combination with housing
                                    tenure, also affect the prices and rents charged for housing.
                                    Homeownership
                                    The American dream is intertwined with homeownership, which is often
                                    associated with independence, economic success, safety, and family.
                                    Ownership commits the owner to a long-term economic relationship with the
                                    home, typically resulting in increased investment into the property, which in
                                    turn increases property values within a neighborhood. Home investment and
                                    the physical presence of homeowners are thought to also improve the quality
                                    and stability of residential neighborhoods. The City of Yucaipa has made it a
                                    priority to encourage homeownership opportunities.
                                    In the City of Yucaipa, 74% (13,503) of households own a home and 26%
                                    (4,728) rent a home (Census, 2010). In the surrounding county, the
   Figure 2-4: Homeownership Rate   homeownership rate is lower—63% of the units are owner occupied and 37%
                                    are renter occupied (see Figure 2-4). Yucaipa’s homeownership rate is
                                    significantly higher than the regional average due to: 1) the higher proportion
                                    of single-family units built compared to apartments in recent years; and 2) the
                                    majority of residential land is general planned for single-family homes. This
                                    ratio between home owners and renters will likely not change much through
                                    the buildout of the general plan.
                                    Vacancy Rates
                                    Housing vacancies are a measure of how well the supply of housing matches
                                    the demand for specific types of housing. Typically, housing vacancy rates of
                                    5% to 6% for apartments and 1% to 2% for homes are considered optimal.
                                    This amount of housing vacancies assures that consumers have sufficient
                                    choices for different types of housing products, that prices are generally
                                    moderated, and that developers have a financial incentive to continue
                                    building housing. Higher vacancy rates lead to price depreciation. Lower
                                    vacancy rates are also not desirable; they indicate a tight market and cause
                                    housing rents and prices to increase.
                                    According to the 2010 Census, the City of Yucaipa’s housing vacancy rate is
                                    estimated at 7.2%, which is below the vacancy rate of 12.6% countywide and
                                    8.7% for incorporated communities in the County of San Bernardino.
                                    Yucaipa’s vacancy rate is 3.0% among owner-occupied units and 9.0% among
                                    renter-occupied units. Although high in terms of optimal market equilibrium,
                                    Yucaipa has a relatively lower vacancy rate due in part to the quality housing
                                    opportunities offered in the community and high homeownership rates. With
                                    recent improvements in the economy, REALFACTS reports that apartment
                                    occupancy rates have stabilized and apartment vacancy rates are declining.

B.         HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
This section describes and analyzes various housing characteristics and trends
to provide a basis for assessing the match between the demand and supply of
available housing for the community. These include housing growth trends,
housing characteristics, age and condition of housing, housing prices and
rents, and homeownership rates.
HOUSING COMPOSITION
A range in housing types and prices allows residents of all ages and incomes
the opportunity to find adequate housing in Yucaipa. As shown in Table 2-5,
single-family housing constitutes 69% of all housing units in Yucaipa.
Yucaipa’s high proportion of single-family homes relative to the region is also
responsible in part for the higher homeownership rate. Small attached
products (duplexes, triplexes, and quads) make up 3%.
Yucaipa’s multiple-family units (e.g., townhomes, apartments, and similar
attached housing products) make up a smaller share than the region’s. Of the
multiple-family projects in Yucaipa, five are deed restricted as affordable. The
remaining apartments are market rate. Apartment projects range in size from
5 or 6 units to 100 or more units. In contrast, Yucaipa has five major
condominium projects that offer about 350 units (see also Figure 2-5).

Yucaipa is unique for its larger mobile home park communities. In fact, with
42 mobile home park communities comprising 4,347 units, Yucaipa has the
largest number of mobile homes of any city in San Bernardino County. Of that
total, 21 parks provide 2,105 units of senior-restricted housing; the remaining
21 parks provide housing for families. The mobile home parks are a mixture of
types, with approximately 15% of the units owned (and rented) by the park.
As of 2012, Yucaipa does not have any recreational vehicle parks, emergency
shelters, or other nontraditional types of housing accommodations.

                                 NEIGHBORHOOD QUALITY
                                 Framed by the unique topography of the area, Yucaipa has a wide variety of
                                 residential neighborhoods offering a mix of rural to suburban lifestyles.
                                 Whether it is the rural ambience of Dunlap Acres, the more remote uplands of
                                 North Bench and Upper Yucaipa, the proximity of central Yucaipa, or
                                 Wildwood Canyon, each area has a unique residential lifestyle. Respecting
                                 and preserving the quality of established neighborhoods while balancing the
                                 need for new housing is an important goal of the general plan.
                                 The City of Yucaipa General Plan has historically established four general
                                 neighborhood planning areas that correspond to capital improvement
                                 planning. Within these general neighborhoods are smaller neighborhoods—
                                 subdivisions or enclaves that have a distinct form and character. The four
                                 primary residential planning areas are described below.
                                     North Bench. This planning area includes the smaller neighborhoods of
                                      Stanley Ranch, Rolling Hills, and areas north of Oak Glen Road.
                                     Central Yucaipa. This planning area includes the smaller neighborhoods
                                      of Sun Park, the Uptown Business District, and surrounding properties.
                                     Wildwood Canyon. This planning area includes Whisper Ranch, Hidden
                                      Meadows, and other properties on the southeastern portion of Yucaipa.
                                     Dunlap Acres. This planning area includes The Reserve, areas west of Oak
                                      Glen Road, and the larger Chapman Heights.
                                     Freeway Corridor. The specific plan for this region will establish a master
                                      planned neighborhood of 2,200 homes in the rolling hills south of I-10
                                      and adjacent to planned regionally significant commercial uses.
                                 In maintaining the quality of neighborhoods, no single approach applies. In
                                 some neighborhoods, maintaining streets, parks, open space, and trees are
                                 important goals. In other, less developed areas, neighborhood residents value
                                 fewer suburban amenities (lighting, sidewalks, curb and gutter, etc.), opting
                                 for a more undeveloped state. Water and sewer infrastructure upgrades may
                                 be needed. Improving housing conditions or property maintenance is needed
                                 in certain neighborhoods.
                                 Regardless of neighborhood setting, the City of Yucaipa recognizes the
                                 importance of quality housing. Whether the housing is mobile home parks,
                                 single-family developments, apartments, or attached housing, a quality
                                 housing stock improves property values and the health of residents. This
                                 requires code compliance and periodic housing repair and rehabilitation. The
                                 age and condition of housing in Yucaipa are discussed in the next section.

HOUSING AGE AND CONDITION
Well-maintained housing is important to residents who take pride in the
quality of life offered in Yucaipa. Well-maintained housing stabilizes property
values, attracts residents to a community, and contributes to neighborhood
quality. The City’s housing stock has a large number of new homes built
during the last several decades. Relatively few of the single-family residences
in the City, except in the city center, were built prior to 1940. Nonetheless,
housing age and condition remain a concern in Yucaipa.
Housing Age
The age of a housing structure is often an indicator of housing conditions.
Homes generally begin to show age after 30 years and require some level of
maintenance. This typically includes roof repair, painting, landscaping, and
exterior finishes. Homes between 30 and 50 years typically require more
significant maintenance and even renovation. Generally, homes built 50 or
more years ago (unless well maintained) are more likely to require substantial
repairs or need renovation to meet current building codes.
Another concern related to the age of housing is lead-based paint hazards.
Homes built prior to 1978 typically contain lead-based paint. Lead-based
paint can cause a number of hazardous health conditions for children
(specifically developmental delays). Health hazards occur when the paint
chips and is inhaled by residents, particularly children. Since 1978, the federal
government has banned the use of lead-based paint. Still, older homes may
need to paint over lead-based paint or remove peeling paint.
Table 2-6 shows the year when housing was built in Yucaipa. Generally
speaking, Yucaipa’s housing stock is relatively newer, with two thirds built
since the 1970s. The City of Yucaipa also has relatively few apartment
buildings, although the current ones are generally older. Given that at least
half of all units were built before lead-based paint was banned in 1978, there
may be some health hazards if lead-based paint is exposed.

Housing Needs
                                 Housing Conditions
                                 Yucaipa’s housing stock is relatively new and in good to excellent condition.
                                 The U.S. Census reports that a small percentage of housing units in the
                                 community lack complete kitchens or bathrooms, heating, and telephones.
                                 Without a housing conditions survey, little data is available. The vast majority
                                 of housing (99%) has complete plumbing and kitchen facilities, and only 1%
                                 to 2% of the homes are considered substandard. The quality of housing
                                 distinguishes Yucaipa from many older communities in the region.
                                 Although Yucaipa is recognized for its quality living environment, different
                                 neighborhoods or housing types in the city have some unique needs.
                                     Central Yucaipa. Central Yucaipa is one of the oldest neighborhoods in
                                      the City. Many of the homes in this area could benefit from increased
                                      repairs and rehabilitation. Infrastructure, such as sidewalks and sewer
                                      lines, are also incomplete in certain locations and could benefit from
                                      repairs and improvements. The City currently has master plans for
                                      infrastructure that are designed to address these issues.
                                     Mobile homes. The City has a vast stock of mobile home parks. The City
                                      currently conducts inspections every year in compliance with Title 25
                                      standards. Title 25 has a standard list of items that need to be reviewed.
                                      Structural deficiencies and other documented health and safety issues
                                      are required to be brought up to code. Many of the parks are aging. In
                                      some cases, mobile home units could benefit from targeted repairs.
                                     Lead-based paint. Many homes in Yucaipa were built before 1978, when
                                      lead-based paint was still used. Lead-based paint in homes built before
                                      1978 and lead-contaminated dust and soil are the main sources of lead
                                      exposure for children. Countywide, there were nearly 1,000 cases
                                      reported of lead-based paint poisoning. The county offers programs for
                                      testing and treating children and remedying property concerns.
                                     Rural areas. Yucaipa has several rural residential areas, primarily in the
                                      northern, western, and eastern parts of the community. The housing
                                      stock is in relatively good condition in these areas. However, at times the
                                      maintenance of larger residential lots can be challenging and require
                                      proactive efforts to address issues other than housing, such as the
                                      removal of debris, vegetation, and other property maintenance concerns.
                                 The City of Yucaipa participates as part of the San Bernardino County
                                 Consortium and has access to community development block grants that can
                                 be used to repair and rehabilitate housing. The funds have not been used
                                 extensively in Yucaipa. Prior to the demise of redevelopment, the City used its
                                 RDA funds for rehabilitation loans and grants as well. Finally, the County of
                                 San Bernardino Economic Development Department has a viable HOME
                                 rental rehabilitation program. The county currently dedicates millions to
                                 apartment projects in an effort to rehabilitate them and deed restrict the
                                 units as affordable to lower income individuals and families.

HOUSING PRICES
San Bernardino County and the Inland Empire has experienced
unprecedented changes in the prices of new and existing homes. From 2000
to 2006, the median price for a single-family home increased by nearly 200%,
from $150,000 to an all-time high exceeding $400,000. However, as the
recession has impacted the region, housing prices plummeted 50% in just a
few years. Housing prices appear to have stabilized since 2010.
Table 2-7 and the text below describe the average prices and rents for single-
family housing, condominiums, mobile homes, and apartments in Yucaipa.
    Townhomes/Condominiums. Yucaipa has a dozen townhome projects.
     According to a sample of 250 homes, the average sales price is
     approximately $181,000. Recent planned unit developments built in
     Chapman Heights are recorded under single-family homes. The price for
     condominiums is roughly equal to single-family homes.
    Mobile homes. According to Zillow.com, mobile homes and
     manufactured housing prices range from as low as $30,000 to $100,000,
     depending on the location, type of unit, and size of parcel. Mobile homes
     and manufactured housing are located primarily in mobile home parks,
     and therefore the price averages approximately $50,000.
    Single-Family. Single-family homes are the most expensive and vary by
     area of the city. City-wide, the average home price is about $223,000.
     Newer homes sell for an average price ranging from $300,000 to
     $350,000. Certain areas, like the easternmost portion (Wildwood Estates)
     or Upper Yucaipa with larger lots can sell for significantly higher levels.
    Apartments. Apartment projects rent for an average of $775 for a one-
     bedroom unit, $950 for a two-bedroom unit, and $1,225 for a three-
     bedroom unit. For newer apartments, like the Chapman Heights
     Bungalows, the rent is $1,150 for a one-bedroom unit, $1,350 for a two-
     bedroom unit, and $1,500 for a three-bedroom unit.

Housing Needs
                                 HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
                                 Housing affordability refers to how much a household can afford to pay each
                                 month for an apartment, townhome, or single-family home. Typically,
                                 housing affordability is defined as the ratio of housing expenses to income,
                                 referred to as a “cost burden.” It is assumed that households should not spend
                                 more than a certain proportion of income toward housing expenses;
                                 otherwise, they are deemed to be overpaying.
                                 The housing industry typically assumes that the “affordable” payment for a
                                 homeowner should range from 30% to 40% of gross monthly income, with
                                 the latter figure being used in the California Association of Realtors’ first-time
                                 homebuyers’ index. For renters, the appropriate cost burden also varies from
                                 30% to 40%, with the latter being used under the federal housing choice
                                 voucher program. The Health and Safety Code uses 35% as the appropriate
                                 cost burden. This housing element uses a midpoint of 35% for ownership (as
                                 many expenses are tax deductible) and 30% for renters as the threshold.
                                 A mortgage payment typically includes several components—loan principal,
                                 interest, taxes, and insurance. For purposes of calculating affordability, we
                                 assume a conventional 30-year, FHA-insured loan at 5% interest in the
                                 housing affordability calculation. Other costs come into the equation on a
                                 case-by-case basis, such as HOA fees. Table 2-8 shows the amount that a
                                 household of different sizes and income levels can afford to pay for a single-
                                 family home or apartment unit.

                                                                                                       Housing Needs
Housing Affordability by Income Level
In contrast to more built-out communities, the City of Yucaipa is noted for its
relatively larger supply of affordable market rate housing. The following
summarizes the general affordability of rental and ownership housing to
different income groups based on the assumptions in Tables 8 and 9. This
analysis will be used later in this housing element to determine how the City
will meet its regional housing needs assessment requirement.
Housing affordability for specific income groups are summarized below.
    Extremely Low Income. Extremely low income households can afford a
     home priced from $58,000 to $85,000, depending on household size. The
     only new homes affordable to this income group are mobile homes that           This condominium unit in Chapman
     sell for less than $50,000, many of which are under rent stabilization.          Height sold for $200,000 in 2011.
     Apartments are not affordable to extremely low income households,
     except for senior or family projects subsidized by the Housing Authority.
     Condominiums are also not affordable to extremely low income people.
    Very Low Income. Very low income households can afford a home
     priced in Yucaipa from $109,000 to $153,000, depending on the
     household’s size. According to Redfin, a four-person family could afford
     the median single-family home (average in the $230,000s), but could not
     afford the most recent products being built. A very low income
     household could afford $633 to $854 in rent, which is generally below the
     rent being charged by market rate apartments in the community.
    Low Income. Low income households can afford a single-family home
     priced up to $230,000. This income group can afford all existing mobile
     homes, condominiums, and many new single-family homes. However,
     newer single-family and condo units are priced above that level and are
     unaffordable to lower income households. Lower income renters can
     afford $1,013 to $1,367 per unit in rent, which is generally over the
     median rent charged in Yucaipa for suitable units. Luxury apartments
     built to condominium specifications are priced higher.
    Moderate Income. Moderate income households have the greatest
     housing opportunities; they can afford a home from $284,000 to
     $390,000 and a rent ranging from $1,520 to $2,051. Compared to market
     prices, a moderate income household can afford any apartment project
     in Yucaipa, even the newest luxury projects built to condominium
     specifications. With respect to single-family residences, the majority of
     existing or new single-family and condominiums residences sell for prices
     affordable to moderate income households.
    Above Moderate Income. Above moderate income households can
     afford any housing option in Yucaipa. It appears that the majority live in
     single-family homes in Upper Yucaipa or in the Wildwood Canyon area.
     Both areas are located in the custom home overlay district of Yucaipa
     that typically has larger lots and homes than other areas of the city.
                                                                         CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT            17

Housing Needs
                                 HOUSEHOLD OVERPAYMENT AND OVERCROWDING
                                 Housing overpayment and overcrowding are a concern for communities.
                                 Housing overpayment and overcrowding most often occur when a household
                                 cannot afford suitably sized and priced rental and ownership housing. In
                                 other cases, life changes (retirement, children moving back home, loss of job,
                                 etc.) can also cause overpayment and/or overcrowding. In these situations, a
                                 household can choose to either overpay for housing or double up with others
                                 into too small a unit to afford housing, which can result in overcrowding.
                                 Table 2-9 and the following show the prevalence of housing problems in
                                 Yucaipa according to the 2006–2010 American Community Survey.
                                     Overcrowding. Overcrowding can be either moderate or severe.
                                      Moderate overcrowding is 1 to 1.5 persons per room and severe
                                      overcrowding is anything higher. Approximately 3% of homeowners and
                                      7% of renters in Yucaipa live in overcrowded situations—substantially
                                      below county averages of 5% and 14%, respectively.
                                     Overpayment. Overpayment can be either moderate or severe.
                                      Moderate overpayment refers to paying 30–49% of income toward
                                      housing, and severe overpayment is anything higher. Approximately 38%
                                      of owners and 55% of renters in Yucaipa overpay for housing—slightly
                                      below the county averages of 43% and 57%, respectively.
                                 Although data is not available, the prevalence and severity of overpayment is
                                 more significant for seniors, large families, and low income renters.
                                 Overcrowding occurs at greater severity for low income, renter, large families.

                                                                    Overpayment              Overcrowding

                                 4,340 lower income owner households in Yucaipa, 2,065 households (47%)
                                 overpay for housing. Of the 3,850 lower income renter households in Yucaipa,
                                 an estimated 2,400 households or 77% overpay for housing. These high rates
                                 of overpayment are due to the many retired individuals and families living in
                                 Yucaipa, which are nearly double the countywide average.

C.        SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
This section contains a discussion of the housing needs of special needs
groups, as defined in state law, who reside in the City of Yucaipa. Special
needs households include seniors, large families, single-parent households,
people who are homeless, and people with disabilities. Also included are
major programs available to address their unique needs.
SENIOR CITIZENS
Seniors are typically defined as persons 65 years or older, although for
housing purposes the age may be as low as 55 years. Yucaipa has an
estimated 4,339 senior households (U.S. Census, 2010). Reflecting the
increasing health and longevity of seniors, approximately 15% of senior
households are headed by a member who is 85 years or older. Among this
population, the majority of Yucaipa’s senior households (3,696 or 85%) own
their own homes, while 643 senior households (15%) rent housing.
Overall, some of the more pressing senior issues are:
    Disabilities. Seniors have a higher prevalence than other age groups of
     disabilities that make can make it increasingly difficult to go outside or
     take care of personal needs. This underscores a need for housing that is
     accessible to those with disabilities.
    Limited Income. Seniors tend to have lower incomes due to fixed
     retirements. This makes seniors, especially renters, more susceptible to
     increases in rental housing costs and housing overpayment, which leaves
     less disposal income for other expenses.
    Overpayment. Senior renters have the highest rates of overpayment,
     while many senior homeowners find it difficult to trade down to smaller
     units or make repairs to housing. This underscores the need for
     affordable housing options and repair programs.
Providing appropriate housing for seniors has become an increasingly
important issue for many communities. In past years, the baby boomer
generation provided the impetus and majority of demand for single-family
housing. However, as this group ages and approaches retirement or elderly
years, many communities will see an increased demand for all types of senior
housing, from smaller condominiums to independent age-restricted housing
to assisted residential settings for those requiring more supportive services.
In addition to housing, an appropriate mix of affordable support services
provided locally can benefit seniors living in Yucaipa. Support services are
essential in facilitating the ability of seniors (and any household) to live as
independently as possible without having to change their residences.
Services can include transportation, health care, home maintenance
assistance, and low cost loans or grants to rehabilitate homes. Many of the
faith-based institutions in Yucaipa provide these types of services.
                                                                       CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT     19

Housing Needs
                                    Housing Accommodations
                                    Many Yucaipa seniors reside in conventional single-family homes. The City
                                    Council recognizes the importance of helping seniors “age in place,” that is,
                                    maintain their current residences for as long as possible. Historically, the City
                                    has provided grants and loans for seniors to repair housing through its
                                    participation in county community development block grant (CDBG)
                                    programs or through allocation of redevelopment funds. These funding
                                    sources are no longer available.
                                    Beyond conventional housing, however, Yucaipa also provides for a variety of
                                    housing options that are age-restricted for seniors, shown in Table 2-10.
                                        Age-restricted apartments. According to City records, Yucaipa has a
                                         total of four deed-restricted affordable apartment projects that provide
                                         about 217 units of housing that is affordable to lower income seniors.
                                         Several additional projects for seniors are in the planning stage.
Green Valley Village Senior Project     Age-restricted mobile homes. Yucaipa is unique among its peers in San
                                         Bernardino for its large stock of mobile homes. The City has 21 age-
                                         restricted mobile home parks that provide 2,105 units. These units are
                                         protected as senior housing within the City’s Senior Overlay District.
                                        Retirement facilities. These facilities provide a variety of living
                                         arrangements, from independent to more supportive settings for
                                         residents who require care on an extended basis. Yucaipa has the upscale
                                         Golden Oaks facility that provides 118 senior apartment units.

                                    The City also provides different support services to assist seniors in living
                                    independent lives. During the week, the Yucaipa Senior Center offers classes,
                                    activities and special events; it also acts as a referral agency to assist seniors
                                    with legal, medical, and financial issues. The center is host to the Senior
                                    Nutrition program, which serves low cost hot meals Monday through Friday.
                                    For seniors needing transportation, lower cost transit service is available
                                    through Dial-A-Ride or through countywide ACCESS vanpool services.

DISABLED PEOPLE
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities are impairments that
substantially limit life activities and make it difficult to care for oneself.
Because of that, disabled persons have special needs for accessible housing.
Many disabled persons live on fixed incomes, thus limiting their ability to
afford housing. Persons with a disability may also have limited housing
choices (e.g., single-story homes or projects with elevators). Someone with a
visual impairment may require a home that allows service animals.
In 2010, the Census Bureau defined a disability as a long-lasting physical,
mental, or emotional condition that can make it difficult for a person to do
activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or
remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being able to
leave the home alone or to work at a job or business. According to the latest
sources, Yucaipa has 6,572 individuals with a disability—about 13% of
residents (ACS 2008–2010).
Yucaipa residents living in residential settings (i.e., not an institution) have the
following disabilities. It should be noted that many people may have multiple
disabilities:
    Sensory: Blindness, deafness, severe vision or hearing–1,613 people
    Physical disability: Substantially limited movement–3,877
    Mental disability: Impaired learning, memory, or concentrating–2,210
    Self-care disability: Restricted ability to care for oneself–1,029
    Restricted ability to leave home–2,998
Passed in 2009, Senate Bill 812 (Government Code section 65583(e)) requires
that all local governments include in the special needs analysis of the housing
element an assessment of the housing needs of residents with developmental
disabilities. A developmental disability is a severe and chronic disability to
which is attributable a mental or physical impairment that begins before
adulthood. These disabilities include mental retardation, cerebral palsy,
epilepsy, autism, and disabling conditions closely related to mental
retardation or requiring similar treatment.
The Census Bureau does not include a survey of people with developmental
disabilities, so estimates are derived from other sources. According to the
California Department of Developmental Services, 1.8% of all people have a
developmental disability. This equates to 924 people in Yucaipa. A smaller
percentage of developmentally disabled people are served by the Inland
Regional Center (IRC). According to state records, the IRC serves
approximately 301 residents with a developmental disability in Yucaipa, of
which 50% are adults and 50% are children. The vast majority (212 residents)
live at home in an independent or semi-independent arrangement.

Housing Needs
                                 Housing Accommodations
                                 Providing a sufficient quantity and quality of housing for disabled people is a
                                 significant challenge. Most single-family homes are inaccessible to people
                                 with mobility and sensory limitations. Housing units may need to have wider
                                 doorways and hallways, access ramps, larger bathrooms with grab bars,
                                 lowered countertops, and other features common to “barrier-free” housing.
                                 Location is also important for disabled people because they often rely on
                                 public transit to travel to services, like grocers or medical offices.
                                 In some cases, more severely disabled individuals require a group living
                                 environment where supervision and assistance with activities of daily living is
                                 provided. Summarized in Table 2-11, the following are the major housing
                                 options available for people requiring semi-independent housing:
                                     Youth facilities. These facilities provide 24-hour nonmedical care for
                                      youth and children who are physically handicapped, developmentally
                                      disabled, and/or mentally disabled. Six facilities serve 75 residents.
                                     Adult facilities. These facilities serve persons 18–59 who may be
                                      physically handicapped, developmentally disabled, and/or mentally
                                      disabled. Yucaipa’s 5 facilities serve 95 residents.
                                     Elderly facilities. These facilities serve persons 60 years of age and over
                                      who may have a disability (physical, mental, or developmental) or need
                                      extended care services. The City’s 25 facilities serve 674 residents.

                                 the needs of disabled people. The Inland Regional Center provides advocacy
                                 for and assistance to the developmentally disabled population. The County
                                 Department of Aging Adults provides a broad list of programs and services.
                                 The City participates in the County Consortium to obtain CDBG funds for
                                 home repairs. With respect to fair housing, the City (through the County
                                 Consortium) contracts with the Inland Fair Housing Mediation to ensure that
                                 people with disabilities are treated fairly in the sale and rental of housing.

FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS
Providing decent and affordable family housing is an important goal for
Yucaipa given the demographic makeup of the community. State law
identifies three types of families as having special needs—large families with
five or more members, female-headed, and single-parent households. The
reasons for their special need status differs, but generally includes lower
incomes, the presence of children and need for financial assistance for
housing, and the lack of adequately sized rental and ownership housing.
Large families with five or more persons have special housing needs. The
reasons for classification as a special need are generally due to a lower per
capita income, the need for affordable childcare, or the need for affordable
larger units. Yucaipa has an estimated 2,575 large family households (Census,
2010). Among this group, 1,780 of large families or 69% of this group own a
home and 795 large households or 31% rent housing. The Census Bureau has
not published data on the percentage of Yucaipa large households that
overpay for housing or live in overcrowded conditions.
Single-parent households also have greater housing needs than other
households due to their limited income and higher expenses. The City of
Yucaipa currently has 1,716 single-parent families with children, of which 547
are male-headed households and 1,169 are female-headed households. The
Census Bureau has not published data on the percentage of Yucaipa single-
parent families that are low income or have housing problems. However, as is
common, lower income single parents, particularly renters, experience the
highest prevalence and severity of overpayment and overcrowding.
Based on patterns common to many communities, the key needs of families
in Yucaipa include:
    Income Support. Public assistance includes health care, food assistance,
     and cash assistance offered to lower income residents or those who meet
     eligibility thresholds. Since the economic downturn in 2006, the
     percentage of Yucaipa residents on public assistance has risen from 9.6%
     to 16.2% in 2012. Of this total, 1 in 10 individuals receives food stamps.
    Childcare. For working parents, child care is essential to maintain a job.
     The City has 21 licensed child care centers and large family day care
     homes that serve 623 children. Numerous other smaller homes serving 8
     or fewer children operate in Yucaipa. Yet even if childcare is available, the
     high cost of childcare subsumes a significant share of income.
    Housing Problems. It is a well-known fact that lower income families,
     particularly single parents and large families, experience the highest
     prevalence and severity of housing problems. For single-parent families,
     the usual issue is overpayment. For larger families who rent housing,
     overpayment and overcrowding are the most prevalent issues.
                                                                          CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT     23

Housing Needs
                                 Housing Accommodations
                                 Providing housing opportunities for families in Yucaipa is a challenging task.
                                 Family households, particularly those with dependent children, are the future
                                 of any community, and resources should be targeted to assist where possible.
                                 Certainly, the majority of families earn higher incomes and live in housing and
                                 neighborhoods of their choice. For others, though, the housing downturn has
                                 left them with high mortgages and, in some cases, foreclosures.
                                 Yucaipa has historically provided residents with a range of housing
                                 opportunities that are relatively affordable compared to urban communities.
                                 In addition, the City provides affordable housing opportunities listed below:
                                      Family mobile homes. Yucaipa is unique among its peers in San
                                       Bernardino for its large stock of mobile homes. As listed below, the City
                                       has 21 mobile home parks that provide 2,167 units for families. More than
                                       half are rent stabilized, and 2 are required to provide lower income units.
                                      Family-restricted apartments. According to City records, Yucaipa has a
                                       total of four deed-restricted affordable apartment projects that provide
                                       about 70 units of housing affordable to lower income families. A limited
                                       number of additional renters receive housing vouchers.
                                      Market rate housing. The City’s present housing stock presumably offers
                                       a number of affordable homes for families. These units are typically in
                                       older parts of Yucaipa and are generally not in as good condition as other
                                       units. The Census does not provide information on these types of units.

                                 children ages 3 to 5 and their families. Through its office in Yucaipa, this
                                 program provides specific services such as: health and social services,
                                 developmental and behavioral screenings, school readiness, and nutritional
                                 services and education. The Yucaipa Valley Family Assistance also provides

HOMELESS PEOPLE
Homeless persons are defined as those who lack a fixed and adequate
residence. Homelessness is a pressing issue for many communities, and the
varied dimensions involved have implications for housing programs. People
who are homeless may be chronically homeless (perhaps due to substance
abuse) or situationally homeless resulting from job loss, family strife,
incarceration, or violence. Homeless people face critical housing challenges
due to their very low incomes and lack of appropriate housing. Thus, state law
requires cities to plan to help meet the needs of their homeless population.
Counting the homeless population is problematic due to their transient
nature, different definitions of homelessness, and political and funding issues.
The 2007 San Bernardino County Homeless Census identified 7,331 persons
living on the streets or in facilities that serve homeless persons—a nearly 40%
increase since the 2003 Homeless Census. Despite the fray of discussions that
arise about the cause of homelessness, the problem is real and of great
concern, particularly for children, foster youth, and victims of violence who
often have no “choice” other than homelessness. This count identified 135
individuals as homeless and living or reporting the last address in Yucaipa.
The County Board of Supervisors established the San Bernardino County
Homeless Partnership (SBCHP) to provide a focused, coordinated, and
cohesive approach to addressing homelessness. The partnership consists of
community and faith-based organizations; educational institutions; non-profit
organizations; private industry; and federal, state, and local governments.
SBCHP was developed to facilitate collaboration between agencies to direct
the planning, development, and implementation of the county’s 10-year
Strategy to End Chronic Homelessness. The Community Action Partnership of
San Bernardino County (CAPSBC) and others continue to play a strong role.
These agencies work toward providing an integrated continuum of care—a
comprehensive and coordinated housing and service delivery system that
responds to the full needs of a community’s homeless people and families.
The goal of a continuum of care is to prevent homelessness and to help those
already homeless achieve self-sufficiency. Components of the continuum of
care system include homeless prevention programs, outreach and
assessment, emergency shelters, transitional housing, support services,
permanent supportive housing, and permanent housing. Sixteen agencies
funded by HUD provide homeless supportive services in the county.
Additionally, the San Bernardino County Homeless Coalition (SBCHC) formed
to develop a countywide system that nurtures and strengthens the services
available for homeless persons. The SBCHC comprises community-based
organizations, elected officials, city representatives, business sector
representatives, veterans service organizations, public entities, churches,
hospitals, health care facilities, law enforcement, local high schools,
community colleges, state universities, and concerned individuals. The
coalition is divided into local coordinating groups in various regions to
address homeless needs locally as well as on a countywide basis.
                                                                       CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT     25

Housing Needs
                                 In 2011, San Bernardino County Office of Homeless Services performed a
                                 point-in-time survey and identified approximately 2,800 homeless residents,
                                 up from 1,700 in 2009. The survey, however, was intended to produce a
                                 conservative count of only homeless people who could be visually seen. The
                                 majority of homeless people were adults without children (1,901), followed by
                                 persons in homeless families (909 people). The most common form of
                                 residence was outdoor encampment (44%), vehicle (16%), and abandoned
                                 building (12%). Factors that contribute to homelessness in San Bernardino
                                 County include difficulties in obtaining employment, mental and physical
                                 illness, domestic violence, substance abuse, and economic hardship. In San
                                 Bernardino County, 16% of the homeless people surveyed were veterans.
                                 Table 2-13 summarizes the shelter resources available in the county based on
                                 the most recent 2011 survey effort. Shown below, there is a need for

AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYEES
Unlike most areas of the Southern California metropolitan region, agriculture
is still a significant component of the economy in San Bernardino County,
with a total value of over $384 million per year. According to the 2007
Agricultural Census, the entire county has 1,405 farms totaling 514,234 acres,
and the average farm size is 366 acres. The market value of products sold is
$148 million for crops, including nursery and greenhouse (20% of total), of
which more than half of the value of sales ($90 million) is for nursery,
greenhouse, floriculture, and sod. The primary agricultural business ($595
million) is livestock, poultry, and their products (80% of total).
The 2007 Census of Agriculture reports a total 4,968 hired farm workers in the
county as a whole, with about half of the workforce working less than 150
days per year. With respect to migrant farmworkers, the Census of Agriculture
reports that of the 513 farms with hired labor, 10% hire migrant workers.
However, there is no data regarding the number of migrant farm laborers.
According to the Southern California Association of Governments Regional
Housing Needs Allocation methodology, an estimated 97 Yucaipa residents
work in the farming industry–2% of the 5,718 farmworkers countywide.
Agricultural operations in Yucaipa consist of two chicken ranches (both non-
conforming uses), a small Christmas tree farm, and a seasonal pumpkin patch.
Grazing is permitted in open space areas but the cattle are brought in from
outside the City boundaries. The chicken ranches employ 100 workers total.
Other than these nonconforming uses, the City no longer has agricultural
base zones that would permit active row crops, ranching, or farming. The
existing Agricultural Preservation (AP) Overlay zone was originally applied to
protect two properties covered by Williamson Act contracts. However, those
contracts expired and the land was redesignated for residential use.
Although there are two poultry ranches in Yucaipa, the need for designated
farmworker housing is minimal. Livestock operations, including poultry, are
also year-round enterprises that do not require migrant or seasonal labor.
Should farmworker housing be needed, Yucaipa provides opportunities for
caretaker and labor quarters as an accessory use to a primary agricultural,
commercial, industrial, or institutional use. Caretaker housing refers to the
occupancy of a unit by the owners, operators, or caretaker employed to guard
or operate part or all of the property on which the caretaker dwelling is
located and or behind a primary commercial use. Given Yucaipa’s nominal
farm worker population, the special housing needs of this group can be
addressed through the City’s affordable housing programs.
                                                                     CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT     27

                                 Affordable housing that has received public subsidies in return for covenants
                                 is a large part of Yucaipa’s affordable housing stock. Pursuant to section
                                 65583(a)(9) of the Government Code, the housing element must include an
                                 analysis of multiple-family projects built with public subsidies and show
                                 whether the housing is at risk of converting to non–low income uses due to
                                 the expiration of use restrictions, prepayment of mortgage, or other reasons.

                                                                                                   Housing Needs
Assessment of At-Risk Status
State law requires the housing element to include an assessment of the
likelihood that the publicly assisted affordable projects will be at risk of
conversion to non–low income uses. This determination of “at-risk” status
depends on: 1) whether the original deed restrictions that accompany public
assistance are expiring; 2) the desire of the property owner to convert the
project to market rates; and 3) current housing market conditions.
The projects fall into several categories:
     HACSB Housing Partners. Four housing projects are owned by the
      HACSB. Recently, several projects were transferred to its affiliate
      nonprofit, Housing Partners, to access funding sources not otherwise
      available to HACSB that can be leveraged to ensure the long-term
      preservation of affordable housing units. For these projects, the HACSB
      allocates project-based housing vouchers to each project. Recently, the
      HACSB also authorized a contract to continue the rehabilitation and
      improvement of these three projects.
     Non–Housing Authority Projects. Yucaipa also has two recently built
      and approved affordable housing projects—Green Valley Village senior
      apartment project and the upcoming Horizon-Yucaipa senior apartment
      project. Both of these are funded by federal low income housing tax
      credits, which typically have deed restrictions of up to 55 years. Because
      of the recent construction date, these projects will not become eligible
      for conversion to market rates until well after 2050, and the affordability
      terms will extend past the useful life of the structures itself.
     HUD Section 232. Yucaipa also has one residential care facility funded by
      the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is the
      Wildwood Canyon Villa, an 84-unit assisted living and memory care
      facility. This residential care facility project was funded under HUD’s
      Section 232/223(a)(7) LEAN program. The Section 232 program provides
      low interest mortgage insurance for assisted living facilities, nursing
      homes, intermediate care facilities, and board and care homes. Unlike
      other HUD-projects, the program does not require deed restrictions.
     Nonprofit Projects. All four publicly affordable mobile home parks are
      located in a Mobile Home Overlay District designed to preserve the parks.
      The City used its redevelopment funds to secure a mortgage revenue
      bond to allow nonprofits to purchase the units. In 2012, the City worked
      with the Independent Cities Finance Authority to refinance existing
      bonds, allowing park owners to obtain a better interest rate and generate
      funds to finance capital improvements at the mobile home parks.
In summary, none of the publicly subsidized affordable housing projects
listed are at risk of converting to non–low income uses during the 10 years
following adoption of the housing element
                                                                        CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT     29

3. Constraint Analysis
This chapter of the housing technical report contains an analysis of potential
and actual market, governmental, and environmental constraints to the
production, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons of all
income levels, including persons with disabilities.
A.        MARKET CONSTRAINTS
In recent years, communities have seen a dramatic decline in the number of
new housing units built. This decline in housing construction is due to a
convergence of factors—including tighter lending policies, declining home
values, foreclosures, cost of materials, and even local government policy. This
section analyzes the impact of these “market” factors on the development of
new and affordable housing regionally and in Yucaipa.
DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Development costs, in tandem with projected rents and sale prices of
housing, affect the feasibility of building housing. Land costs include the costs
of raw land and site improvements (e.g., grading, cut and fill, and cleanup). If
an existing use is on the parcel, the developer must also factor in the price of
an existing structure that must be demolished. Other factors affecting land
prices include: availability, environmental site conditions, public service and
infrastructure availability, aesthetic considerations, and parcel size.
Land prices vary throughout the Yucaipa community; prices for land are
typically higher nearer to downtown, but expensive in hillside areas where
parcels with views command a much higher price than other parcels. Based
on 65 properties sold over the past three years, the majority of parcels ranged
from $1.10–$5.80 per square foot, with a median of $2.64 per square foot or
$115,000 per acre. The median per square foot price was $1.64 in the RL zone,
2.96 in the RM zone, and up to $3.29 in the RS zone. RS-zoned sites were more
expensive than RM-zoned sites, but this could be due to location.
Housing construction constitutes a substantial portion of construction costs.
The cost of new housing averages approximately $100 to $175 per square
foot for a single-family detached unit. For a standard 2,000-square-foot home,
the construction costs range from $250,000 for a standard home to upwards
of $375,000 for luxury homes. Apartments can achieve some economy of
scale. According to the R.S. Means cost estimator, apartments range from
$125 to $175 per square foot, which translates into a price of $125,000 to
$175,000 for a 1,000-square-foot unit. Mobile homes are significantly less
expensive, as are precision or factory-built housing products.

Constraint Analysis
                                  ACCESS TO FINANCING
                                  Changes in construction lending practices for housing projects have had a
                                  significant impact on the financial feasibility of new construction. In past
                                  decades, housing developers could receive construction loans for 100% or
                                  more of a project's estimated future value. Following the housing market
                                  crash of the early 1990s, financial institutions tightened regulations for
                                  approving construction loans. After the boom period of the early to mid-
                                  2000s, this cycle repeated itself during the late 2000s. Loan underwriting has
                                  grown more conservative, with maximum leveraging topping out at 75% and
                                  equity requirements increasing from 10% in past years to 30% in 2009.
                                  The feasibility of building is also affected by the required equity contribution.
                                  Although there is no hard threshold for how much up-front cash equity is too
                                  much before a project would be deemed infeasible (or at least unattractive
                                  compared to other investment opportunities), the higher the proportion of
                                  equity required, the more unlikely a developer will proceed with the project.
                                  Not only would it require more up-front cash, but higher equity contribution
                                  means a project must be able to achieve an even higher value at completion
                                  in order to generate the cash flow needed to meet acceptable cash-on-cash
                                  returns. These trends are anticipated to continue through at least 2014.
                                  FORECLOSURES
                                  The housing recession has created the most challenging market for selling
                                  homes in generations. Following the peak of the housing market in 2006,
                                  rising numbers of foreclosures swept southern California, significantly
                                  dampening demand for housing. The foreclosure crisis is attributed to an
                                  overproduction of single-family housing, declines in the national economy,
                                  and increases in questionable lending practices (such as adjustable rate
                                  mortgages). As the rates adjusted, thousands of households in San
                                  Bernardino County found themselves unable to afford their mortgage.
                                  Initially banks were unwilling to adjust the loan terms to enable owners to
                                  stay in their homes, creating a huge increase in foreclosures in 2008 and 2009.
                                  Few realize the impact of the foreclosure crisis on housing prices. From
                                  January 2006 through 2012, upwards of 100,000 homes were foreclosed
                                  upon, nearly one of every seven homes in San Bernardino County. This data
                                  may somewhat overestimate the foreclosure rate since it does not account for
                                  situations where the same home could have been foreclosed upon twice. But
                                  it does show clearly the depth of the housing recession. The federal
                                  government helped local governments stem the tide through the
                                  Neighborhood Stabilization Program, tax rebates, and other programs. But
                                  with high unemployment rates and overleveraged homeowners, many
                                  buyers are unable to sell their homes and purchase another.
                                  The lasting effects of the recession and housing market downturn are
                                  anticipated to remain through 2014, although there has been an increased
                                  demand for senior housing, publicly subsidized apartments, and other niches.

VACANCY RATES AND HOUSING PRICES
Housing demand has a profound effect on the overall affordability of housing.
During the mid-2000s, housing prices in Yucaipa were at all-time highs. Like in
most communities, the median priced home was twice the value as in 2012.
Since the market crash, however, condominiums and single-family homes,
long thought to be affordable only to above moderate income households,
are now affordable to moderate and even lower income residents. Even with
foreclosures now at pre-housing market crash levels, housing prices have
significantly moderated and should increase over time.
According to the 2012 UCLA Anderson Forecast, the region is beginning to
show significant signs of recovery. This includes the Inland Empire region.
Predictions are for a robust and steady increase in the demand for multiple-
family housing, particularly for apartments and secondly for attached units.
This is due to increased household formation, income levels of residents, and
the resulting increased demand for housing. The point being that these types
of market dynamics play into the affordability of housing, and whether an
otherwise benign land use regulation or presumption of “density levels” is a
an accurate constraint or incentive to the production of housing,
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE
The economic downturn also impacted the financing for affordable housing.
One example is the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. LIHTCs provide
affordable housing developers an allocation of tax credits, which are sold to
investors to raise equity for projects. Investors that purchase tax credits are
able to reduce their federal tax liability dollar for dollar, so that the purchase
of $1,000 in tax credits reduces tax liability by $1,000. As a result of the equity
made available through the sale of tax credits, a developer can complete
projects with less debt and pass on cost savings in the form of lower rent.
The LIHTC equity market has been volatile for the past few years. Following
the market bust in 2006/2007, LIHTC prices collapsed in 2008 and 2009.
Historically, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provided 40 percent of LIHTC
investments, and banks motivated by the Community Reinvestment Act
(CRA) provided 40 percent. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (now in receivership)
no longer make new investments. In addition, the substantial losses that
many financial institutions continue to incur eliminated or reduced the ability
to use tax credits. In 2010, the LIHTC market began a recovery, investment
increased to an estimated $8 billion, and this is anticipated to increase.
Finally, Governor Brown appropriated the last major funding source of
affordable housing—redevelopment tax increment and housing set-aside
funds—to temporarily ameliorate the state budget shortfall. This act and its
long-term deleterious impact on the economy and long-term revitalization of
California cities cannot be overstated. The Governor’s actions effectively
wiped clean billions of dollars, locally approved over decades that were raised
and earmarked to eliminate blight, stimulate economic development, finance
the construction and improvement of affordable housing, and otherwise
improve the lives of residents living in underserved areas.

Constraint Analysis
                                  DEVELOPMENT FEES
                                  The City of Yucaipa, like other communities in the region, charges a range of
                                  service fees to cover the cost of processing development applications. More
                                  importantly, the City also charges development impact fees to finance the
                                  construction of adequate public facilities, water and sanitation treatment, and
                                  other “hard” infrastructure needed to support new residential developments.
                                  These fees are almost always assessed through a pro-rata share system, based
                                  on the magnitude of the project’s impact or extent of benefits to be derived.
                                  Residential developers in Yucaipa typically pay two types of fees to different
                                  entities. City planning and environmental fees are paid for processing permits
                                  and applications, and otherwise requesting public hearings for projects.
                                  Regional development impact fees are paid to various local and regional
                                  governmental agencies for the construction of transportation improvements,
                                  new school infrastructure, and the extension of water and sanitation services.

Analysis of Fees
To determine the impact of fees on the cost of developing housing, the City
developed two prototypical examples for single- and multiple-family projects:
1) a standard, 2,000-square-foot, single-family home on a 7,200-square-foot
lot and 2) an eight-unit apartment project consisting of 900-square-foot units.
The City then calculated all of the applicable development fees, including fees
charged by outside agencies (e.g., water, sewer, school, etc.).
As shown in Table 3-2, total residential development fees range from $47,000
to $50,000 per unit. Based on standard development costs, the total fee
burden is 20% of the per unit development cost for a single-family home and
33% of the per unit development cost for an apartment unit. For affordable
density bonus projects, the City exempts the fees for the affordable units.

  1. Planning, building, and environmental fees are based on City estimate.
  2. City fees include drainage, road, public, fire, and park impact fees.
Although fees are a necessary part of the development process, the City has
several programs to lessen the impact. The City allows developers to defer
payment on fees until occupancy, which lowers the upfront loan needed to
finance a project. For affordable housing, the developer can request
incentives (such as increased density, reductions in standards or waivers of
development impact fees for bonus units) that can be monetized and help to
reduce the overall costs of development. Finally, for density bonus units that
comply with the Housing Incentives Program, the City waives its
development impact fees for the bonus units. With these tools in place, fees
are not considered an actual constraint to development.

                                  This section introduces the City’s Municipal Code regulations that affect the
                                  location, density, and types of permitted residential land uses in Yucaipa and
                                  the general impact on the types and prices of housing. This section also sets
                                  the foundation for the land inventory.
                                  GENERAL PLAN LAND USE
                                  Each city in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General Plan
                                  to guide its future. The Land Use Element of the General Plan establishes the
                                  basic land uses and density of development within the various areas of the
                                  city. Under state law, the General Plan elements must be internally consistent
                                  and the City’s zoning must be consistent with the General Plan. Thus, the land
                                  use plan must provide suitable locations and densities to implement the
                                  policies of the housing element. Yucaipa’s comprehensive General Plan
                                  provides five residential land use designations, shown in Table 3-3.

Overlay Districts
The City utilizes overlay districts to apply special development standards
and/or permit processing requirements to sites with identifiable hazard
constraints, environmental resource amenities, or community concerns.
Discussed in Table 3-4, the overlay districts identified in the Yucaipa Zoning
Ordinance are categorized into three principal groups:
  Table 3-4: Overlay Districts In Yucaipa
             Overlay District                                Purpose and Intent
  Hazard Protection
  FR: Fire Safety Overlay                 Hazard protection overlays help to identify the
                                          physical and environmental constraints for residential
  FP: Floodplain Safety Overlay           development within the city. The hazard protection
                                          districts, which address fire safety, floodplains,
  GH: Geologic Hazard Overlay             geologic hazards, noise hazards and hazardous waste,
                                          define areas that may be inappropriate for residential
  NH: Noise Hazard Overlay                development or require defined safety measures or
                                          mitigation.
  HW: Hazardous Waste Overlay
  Resource Preservation
                                          Resource protection overlay districts address
  AP: Agricultural Preserve Overlay       agricultural resources, biotic resources, cultural
                                          resources, mineral resources, paleontological
  BR: Biotic Resources Overlay
                                          resources and scenic resources. These districts define
  CP: Cultural Resources Preserve.        areas that contain known resources and thus trigger
                                          the need for site-specific technical studies in
  MR: Mineral Resources Overlay           conjunction with environmental review under CEQA.
                                          Districts do not establish additional requirements for
  SR: Scenic Resources Overlay            discretionary review.
  Land Use Modification
                                          The MHP District preserves the viability of mobile
  AA: Additional Agriculture Overlay      home parks and limits their conversion to other uses
                                          by requiring a General Plan Amendment to convert
  AH: Alternate Housing Standards         mobile home parks to another use.
  MHP: Mobile Home Park Overlay           The SP District defines areas subject to requirements
                                          of an adopted specific plan.
  SP: Specific Plan Overlay               The CH Overlay applies design standards to certain
                                          large-lot single-family residential neighborhoods (in
  CH: Custom Home Overlay                 the RL and RS Districts) to preserve rural character.

Compliance with overlay district requirements may impact housing
development costs to varying degrees depending on project location.
However, the additional requirements in these areas are reasonably necessary
to protect the public health, safety, and welfare and maintain a quality living
environment, and they are not considered to be unreasonable impediments
to the construction of housing. Moreover, none of the higher density sites
designated to address the lower income RHNA is within an overlay district.
Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, none of the overlay districts are
viewed as a constraint to the provision of affordable housing.
                                                                                          CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT      37
Constraint Analysis
                                  RESIDENTIAL USES BY ZONE
                                  Housing element law requires cities to facilitate and encourage a range of
                                  housing types for all economic segments of the community. This includes the
                                  production of housing to meet various special needs of seniors, people with
                                  disabilities, farmworkers, homeless, and others. Yucaipa’s Development Code
                                  provides for the housing types required by state law. The primary land use
                                  designations allowing residential uses are below and in Table 3-5.

                                                                                                   Constraint Analysis
Community Care Facilities
Community care or residential care facilities refer to any family home, group
home, or rehabilitation facility that provides nonmedical care to persons in
need of personal services, protection, supervision, assistance, guidance, or
training essential for daily living. State law preempts local regulations
imposed by any local government and requires that such uses that serve six
or fewer persons be (1) treated the same as a residential use, (2) allowed by
right in all residential zones, and (3) subjected to the same fees, taxes, and
permits as other residential uses in the same zone.
Yucaipa’s Municipal Code refers to residential care facilities as “social care
facilities.” Social care facilities that serve six or fewer persons are permitted by
right in all residential districts. Facilities serving more than six persons are
conditionally permitted in the RL, RS, RM, PD, GC, CS, CN, IS, and IN districts.
These requirements are consistent with state law and do not pose a
constraint on the establishment of such facilities. Although the City complies
with current state law, the definition of “social care facilities” should be
updated to reflect the current terminology uses in state law.
Mobile Homes and Mobile Home Parks
Mobile homes can provide a considerable source of affordable housing for
families and seniors. Unique in San Bernardino County, the City of Yucaipa has
the largest stock of mobile home units (42 mobile home parks), which provide
more than 4,000 units of affordable housing for seniors and families. Mobile
homes are permitted in all residential zones (RL, RS, RM, and PD) as a by-right
use. Mobile home parks are also permitted conditionally in the RL, RS, RM, and
PD residential land use districts pursuant to a conditional use permit. These
mobile home parks are protected through a MHP Overlay District.
In compliance with Government Code 65852.3, the installation of
manufactured homes is allowed as a by-right use, subject to design
standards, on lots zoned for single-family dwellings. Homes constructed in a
controlled factory environment and that adhere to federal construction codes
are known as manufactured homes. Following construction, these single-
family structures are moved to the home site and set up. The degree of
assembly to be completed on the home site depends on the manufacturer,
but manufactured homes are typically delivered as panels or sections.
Accessory Uses
The Yucaipa Municipal Code allows for accessory uses, which are incidental
and supported by the primary use. Subject to administrative Land Use
Compliance Review, the Municipal Code allows for two residential accessory
uses to a primary agricultural, commercial, industrial, or institutional use
where such use demonstrates the need for on-site residency of one or more
people to maintain, operate, and/or secure the primary land use. These
include caretaker housing and labor quarters, which refer to single or multiple
dwelling units with individual, shared, or no kitchen facilities to provide
housing for the employees and their families of agricultural, mining, logging,
major construction, scientific exploration, or other remote land uses.
                                                                            CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT      39

Constraint Analysis
                                  Second Units and Guest Units
                                  Second units, guest houses, and dependent housing offer opportunities to
                                  provide housing that is affordable to residents in the community. The City of
                                  Yucaipa allows for the development second dwelling units by right (i.e., no
                                  discretionary approval required) in both the RL and RS zones pursuant to a
                                  Land Use Compliance Review. The applicant must be an owner-occupant of
                                  an existing single-family dwelling on the lot, and the lot proposed for a
                                  second unit must be at least twice the minimum size. The City allows guest
                                  housing, defined as residential occupancy of a living unit, with bathroom
                                  plumbing only, located on the same parcel as the primary dwelling unit, but
                                  separated from it by at least ten feet. This housing is used by the occupants or
                                  temporary guests of the occupants of the premises and is not to be rented or
                                  otherwise used as a separate dwelling. Approximately 2 to 3 second units,
                                  guest houses, or dependent housing are built annually.
                                  Employee Housing
                                  Yucaipa provides opportunities for caretaker and labor quarters as an
                                  accessory use to a primary agricultural, commercial, industrial, or institutional
                                  use where such use demonstrates the need for onsite residency of one or
                                  more people to maintain, operate, and/or secure the primary nonresidential
                                  land use on the property. Caretaker housing refers to the occupancy of a unit
                                  by the owners, operators, or caretaker employed to guard or operate part or
                                  all of the property on which the caretaker dwelling is located and or behind a
                                  primary commercial use. Labor quarters refers to the occupancy of single or
                                  multiple dwelling units with individual, shared, or no kitchen facilities to
                                  provide housing for employees and their families of agricultural, mining,
                                  logging, major construction, scientific exploration, or other remote land uses.
                                  Although the City of Yucaipa complies with state law, the current
                                  Development Code provisions for employee housing should be updated to
                                  comply with Section 17021 of the Health and Safety Code.
                                  Senior Housing
                                  The proportion of seniors in Yucaipa is greater than that of San Bernardino
                                  County as a whole; therefore, the provision of adequate housing for seniors is
                                  a critical issue in the city. Although the City provides a substantial inventory of
                                  age-restricted mobile homes (2,105 senior-restricted mobile home units),
                                  there are only 217 deed-restricted senior apartments. Demographic
                                  projections point toward an increasingly aging community, and the senior
                                  population will likely continue to increase.
                                  As part of the 2008–2014 Housing Element, the City adopted a policy and
                                  program to offer a 100% density bonus of up to 16 units per acre to facilitate
                                  the development of multifamily senior housing. Senior housing projects (five
                                  or more units) are permitted by conditional use permit in the RM district and
                                  by planned development permit in the PD and CG districts. These districts
                                  allow a maximum of eight units per acre. To facilitate projects, a parking
                                  reduction of 50% can be granted for senior projects through a variance.

Homeless Facilities
Senate Bill 2 requires cities to facilitate and encourage the production of
housing suitable for homeless people, including emergency shelters,
transitional, and permanent supportive housing. In 2009 and 2010, the City
made the following updates to its Development Code to facilitate, encourage,
and regulate the development and operation of these land uses.
    Emergency shelter. In 2009, the City amended the Development Code
     to allow emergency shelter as a by-right use in the CS district. The City
     also requires a shelter to have: 1) adequate security measures (e.g.,
     external lighting, parking and outdoor facilities, and security staff), one
     parking space for each 250 square feet of gross floor area, and a waiting
     and intake area of at least 500 square feet. The entity operating the
     shelter shall also: 1) make shelter available to residents for no more than
     180 consecutive days; 2) provide staff and services to assist residents to
     obtain permanent shelter and income; 3) prepare and file a management
     plan; and 4) avoid locating within 300 feet of a shelter.
    Transitional and supportive housing. The City also conditionally
     permits transitional housing and supportive housing in the RM district.
     Transitional housing is defined as buildings that provide short-term
     rental housing for no less than six months with the goal of transitioning
     occupants to permanent housing. Supportive housing with no limit on
     length of stay may be used by people with low incomes having one or
     more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse,
     or other chronic health conditions. The goal is to assist residents in
     retaining the housing, improving their health status, and maximizing the
     ability to live and work in the community. The required findings to locate
     these projects are the same as any conditionally permitted use.
    Single-room occupancy. The City amended the Development Code to
     allow single-room occupancy (SRO) units that provide opportunities for
     the development of permanent, affordable housing for college students,
     small households, and special needs groups in proximity to services. Such
     users are a by-right use in the RM district. To facilitate development, a
     SRO is not required to meet density standards of the General Plan. A SRO
     unit can be built at smaller sizes (150–400 square feet) than typical rental
     units, is not required but may contain a full or partial kitchen or bathroom
     facilities, shall comply with applicable accessibility requirements, and
     shall provide onsite management if the project has 10 or more units. A
     management and operations plan for the project is also required.
Pursuant to changes in state law, the City of Yucaipa will process a municipal
code amendment to allow transitional housing and permanent supportive
housing as a by right use in any zoning district that allows residential uses.
Transitional housing and permanent supportive housing will also be
(permitted) in the same manner as other similar uses (which according to
state law refer to residential uses) permitted in the same zone. Please refer to
Program 20 of this Housing Element for the program specifics.

Constraint Analysis
                                  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
                                  The Municipal Code and Development Code provide more specific residential
                                  development standards that determine building height, density, setbacks,
                                  parking, etc. Residential development standards are designed to promote a
                                  more livable environment, with adequate yards for children, height
                                  restrictions and setbacks to ensure privacy from adjacent homes, and
                                  minimum unit sizes to ensure adequate living areas for families.
                                  Building Standards
                                  Table 3-6 lists residential development standards for housing in Yucaipa. The
                                  Development Code allows for semirural and suburban development at a
                                  density of up to 24 units per acre, except for higher densities within certain
                                  specific plans. As described in the Housing Plan, the City recently adopted
                                  new general plan designations (RM-24 and R-24) that allow for 20 to 24
                                  dwelling units per acre for the construction of multiple-family housing.

                                      Standards for the Planned Development District may be modified by the Planning Department.
                                  The Planned Development (PD) District is the most flexible zone. This district
                                  allows for innovative approaches in residential design and identifies areas
                                  suitable for large-scale planned development and the use of specific plans.
                                  The Planning Commission, in reviewing Planned Developments, can modify
                                  development standards, including building setbacks, height, lot size, and
                                  parking requirements. Using the PD District and Planned Development Permit
                                  process, the City is able to reduce or modify residential development
                                  standards to improve housing affordability, aesthetics, and feasibility.

Parking Standards
Adequate parking is an important component of well-designed development,
contributing to the value of a project, the safety of residents, its appearance,
and livability. To that end, Yucaipa’s parking regulations, shown in Table 3-7,
are intended to promote efficient land use, reduce street congestion and
traffic hazards, promote vehicular and pedestrian safety, and improve the
ability to secure financing for a new residential project.

Constraint Analysis
                                  Multiple-Family Development Standards
                                  When the RM-24 High Density Multiple Residential District was passed, it was
                                  intended to facilitate the implementation of General Plan policies that allow
                                  for the development of high quality multiple-family housing that also may be
                                  affordable to lower income households. The RM-24 district provides for
                                  alternative review procedures and development standards to the existing
                                  multiple-residential requirements and standards. Some of the more pertinent
                                  requirements are:
                                      Unit size. The minimum apartment size shall be 550 square feet for a
                                       studio, 650 square feet for a one-bedroom unit; 800 square feet for a two-
                                       bedroom unit, and 900 square feet for a 3-bedroom unit. To assure that
                                       smaller units are not overly concentrated, no more than 10% of the units
                                       shall be studios and no more than 35% shall be one-bedroom units.
                                      Open space. Open space helps to improve the livability of a unit. To that
                                       end, each dwelling unit shall have a minimum of private open space of
                                       150 square feet, in the form of a patio or private yard, with a minimum
                                       dimension of 10 feet. For units above the ground floor, one or two
                                       balconies with a combined area of 100 square feet are required.
                                      Unit amenities. Each unit must have at least three amenity items, but
                                       only one item marked with an asterisk can be counted toward that
                                       requirement. These amenities include:
                                       -    Fireplace                            - Decorative doors
                                       -    Skylights                            - Enclosed garage
                                       -    Oversized closets                    - Air conditioner
                                       -    Refrigerator*                        - Security alarm
                                       -    Automatic dishwasher*                - Automatic garage door opener
                                       -    Washer/dryer units*                  - Bay windows
                                       -    Entry courtyard or arbor             - Other comparable features
                                      Site amenities. Projects consisting of 100 to 200 units shall provide at
                                       least five of the following recreational amenities:
                                       -    Open lawn area of at least 100 feet
                                       -    Multiple enclosed tot lots with play equipment
                                       -    Pool and spa
                                       -    Barbeque facility
                                       -    Community multipurpose room with kitchen
                                       -    Sport court facilities
                                       -    Jogging and walking trails with exercise station
                                  These design standards are consistent with other communities in San
                                  Bernardino County where affordable multiple family housing is built, such as
                                  Fontana and Rancho Cucamonga. Therefore, the design standards are not
                                  considered a constraint to the production of new apartments or townhomes.

                                                                                                  Constraint Analysis
AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVES
A key goal of the 2008–2014 housing element is to assist in the development
of affordable housing for persons of all income levels. Given the California
court’s ruling that redevelopment authority is abolished, cities are left with
few financial tools to assist in meeting this goal. In lieu of financial means, the
City of Yucaipa implements several key housing programs:
    Density bonus. The City Council adopted Ordinance 297, creating a local
     density bonus ordinance that offers the same types of development
     incentives as required under state law. Because seniors makeup a large
     percentage of residents, Ordinance 297 included a special 100% density
     bonus for senior housing. Since its adoption, the City has successfully
     implemented the density bonus provision to facilitate the Green Valley
     Village senior project, located in Uptown Yucaipa (shown to the right).
    Planned development. The Planned Development (PD) district is
     intended to allow for innovative approaches in residential design. The PD
     allows for a 100% density transfer provided all other performance criteria
                                                                                      Green Valley Village Senior Project
     are met, and an additional 10% density bonus above the general plan
     land use district for the area for projects that meet additional criteria. The
     planning commission can modify and reduce development standards,
     including building setbacks, height, lot size, and parking requirements.
     This tool was used to facilitate the 74-unit Chapman Heights Bungalows
     and an approved project with 198 multifamily units.
    Minor variance. The Municipal Code contains a minor variance program
     to ensure that any property, because of special circumstances, such as
     size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, be accorded
     privileges common to properties in the same vicinity. The community
     development director may approve requests for minor variances to
     modify the following requirements of the code. General items allowed for
     consideration include:
       Up to 30% of parking requirements, not to exceed two spaces
       30–40% of front, side, and rear yard setbacks subject to conditions
       Up to 30% of area requirements, excluding lot area requirements
       Up to 30% of height limitations
       Up to 30% of standards set forth in overlay districts
       Up to 50% of maximum gross floor area requirements
       Up to 20% of minimum floor width of single residential design
    Fee waivers. The City has several programs to reduce the impact of fees.
     The City allows development fees to be deferred until occupancy.
     Moreover, for affordable housing, the developer can request incentives
     (such as increased density, reductions in standards or waivers of
     development impact fees for bonus units) that can be monetized and
     help to reduce the overall costs of development. Density bonus units are
     also exempted from all City development impact fees.
                                                                          CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT            45

Constraint Analysis
                                  BUILDING CODES AND ENFORCEMENT
                                  Building and property maintenance codes in Yucaipa are required to ensure
                                  that structures, including housing, are built in a safe manner, that individual
                                  properties and neighborhoods are well maintained, that owners see a
                                  financial benefit in improving properties, and that Yucaipa attracts and
                                  retains development that benefits its economy. To maintain quality
                                  residential development and property values, the City Council has recently
                                  enacted new building and property maintenance codes.
                                  With respect to building and structures, the Yucaipa City Council has adopted
                                  all the building codes contained in the Building, Mechanical, Plumbing,
                                  Electrical, and Uniform Housing Code. The Health and Safety Code, section
                                  18938, establishes standards for all types of buildings and occupancies and
                                  requires these standards be adopted by all jurisdictions. The California
                                  Building Code allows communities to adopt modifications or additions to
                                  their local building codes that address specific local conditions. The City of
                                  Yucaipa has adopted the 2010 CBC with only minor modifications.
                                  The City of Yucaipa has adopted property maintenance codes. First, the City
                                  abides by the International Property Maintenance Code, which dovetails with
                                  the California Building Code. For mobile home units, the City has assumed the
                                  responsibility of inspecting mobile home units. Every seven years, the City
                                  inspects all the units to ensure compliance with Title 25. The Code
                                  Enforcement Division is responsible for enforcing state and local laws relating
                                  to health and safety, property maintenance standards, and land use
                                  regulations. Major efforts related to housing include:
                                      Building, Land Use, and Animal Raising Violations
                                      Enforcement of the Business License Ordinance
                                      Enforcement of the Mobilehome Parks and Special Occupancy Parks Acts
                                       and Title 25 of the California Code of Regulations
                                      Enforcement of the Solid Waste Ordinance
                                      Enforcement of the Yard Sale Ordinance
                                      Graffiti Abatement - Report Graffiti!
                                      Public Nuisance and Abandoned Vehicle Abatement
                                      Enforcement of Foreclosed Home Maintenance
                                      Enforcement of Crime-Free Multi-Housing Standards
                                  Building codes and their enforcement add an incremental cost to the
                                  construction and maintenance of housing, but the programs implemented by
                                  Yucaipa are similar to other jurisdictions. Moreover, the City Council has
                                  determined that by proactively addressing potential issues up front, Yucaipa
                                  can avoid the high cost of rehabilitation needs due to deferred maintenance.
                                  Therefore, the codes are not deemed to be an undue constraint.

ENERGY CONSERVATION
In 2006, the State Legislature adopted the Global Warming Solutions Act,
which created the first comprehensive, state regulatory program to reduce
GHG emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Through both SB375 and
AB32, promoting energy conservation has become a consistent theme in
regulations, green building practices, and business operations. Yucaipa has
implemented several programs to encourage energy conservation.
   Neighborhood design. The Subdivision Map Act references the need for
    passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities. Strategies to reduce
    energy demand begin with efficient site planning. Sizing and configuring
    lots to maximize a building’s solar orientation (east–west alignment for
    southern exposure) facilitates optimal use of passive heating and cooling
    techniques. Placing housing near jobs, services, and other amenities
    reduces energy consumption for transportation. Other design strategies
    with beneficial energy implications include installing broad-canopied
    trees for shade and clustering development to reduce auto use.
   Building design. In January 2010, the California Building Standards
    adopted a final version of the new building code, CALGreen, parts of
    which became mandatory on January 1, 2011. CALGreen exists alongside
    the latest edition of the historic Title 24, which took effect on January 1,
    2010. CALGreen includes provisions to ensure the reduction of water use
    by 20%, improve indoor air quality, divert 50% of new construction waste
    from landfills, and inspect energy systems (i.e., heat furnace, air
    conditioner, mechanical equipment) for nonresidential buildings over
    10,000 square feet to make sure that they're working according to design.
   Green standards. The building industry has different green building
    programs designed to improve the energy efficiency and sustainability of
    housing. The BIA sponsors a voluntary program called Green Builder. The
    U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) sponsors another building
    certification program called Leadership in Energy and Environmental
    Design (LEED)—a national rating system for green buildings that focuses
    on commercial and multiple-family residential projects. The USGBC
    reviews projects for conformance based on various efficiency,
    sustainability, materials quality, and design factors, and then issues
    certifications based on points achieved.
A number of green projects are underway in Yucaipa. The Green Valley Village
Senior project achieved LEED certification. In July 2010, Southern California
Edison (SCE) awarded the Housing Authority with $1.8 million as part of SCE’s
Multi-family Affordable Solar Housing Program. HACSB has been aggressively
implementing energy efficiency programs, upgrades, and practices at its
housing complexes. HACSB is developing a comprehensive strategy for the
gradual transition of its assets to renewable energy sources that respond to
the physical characteristics of each asset. HACSB has also implemented an
Energy Performance Contract for its public housing portfolio, which primarily
consists of water savings, lighting upgrades, and xeriscaping.
                                                                        CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT      47

Constraint Analysis
                                  PERMITTING PROCESSES
                                  The City of Yucaipa maintains various permit processing and review tools to
                                  ensure the appropriate level of staff and public review so that the final
                                  housing product is of appropriate quality and consistent with city regulations.
                                  The City is sensitive to time pressures faced by the development community
                                  and balances the need for a timely review with the public responsibility to
                                  approve only high quality residential projects that minimize negative impacts
                                  and promote a healthful environment for residents and the community. The
                                  typical development process is described below.
                                  Step 1: Land Use Compliance Review
                                  Residential development undergoes a land use compliance review (LUCR) for
                                  zoning, building, and fire codes prior to the issuance of any building permits.
                                  This procedure is administrative in nature. The LUCR is conducted by City staff
                                  (planning, fire, building, etc.) who review the project to check for compliance
                                  with all City code. The Community Development Director is the reviewing
                                  authority. Single-family homes are not required to secure a LUCR. The
                                  timeframe is typically 30 to 60 days to complete the entire LUCR process.
                                  Step 2: Discretionary Conditional Use Permit
                                  Single-family residential projects and multiple-family development projects in
                                  the RM-24 zone do not require a conditional use permit. Only small multiple-
                                  family residential projects in the RM district require a conditional use permit.
                                  The Planning Commission is responsible for approving the conditional use
                                  permit at a regularly scheduled public hearing if six findings are made.
                                      the site is adequate in size and shape to accommodate the proposed use
                                       and all required yards, open spaces, setbacks, walls and fences, parking
                                       areas, loading areas, landscaping, and other features
                                      the site for the proposed use has adequate access, meaning that the site
                                       design incorporates street and highway limitations
                                      the proposed use will not have a substantial adverse effect on abutting
                                       property or the permitted use, meaning the use will not generate
                                       excessive noise, vibration, traffic, or other disturbance nor substantially
                                       interfere with the present or future ability to use solar energy systems
                                      the proposed use is consistent with the goals, policies, standards, and
                                       maps of the General Plan and any applicable plan
                                      the lawful conditions stated in the approval are deemed necessary to
                                       protect the public health, safety, and general welfare
                                      the design of the site has considered the potential for the use of solar
                                       energy systems and passive or natural heating and cooling opportunities.
                                  Completing a conditional use permit requires 90 to 120 days. The conditional
                                  use permit is not a constraint to development. Two recent senior projects
                                  built in the City have completed design review in 90 to 120 day timeframe.

Step 3: Design Review
Design review is required for multiple-family residential projects only. The
Yucaipa Municipal Code sets forth design guidelines to assist the developer in
understanding and complying with the City’s standards for building and site
design. The multiple-family design guidelines are based upon community
design goals as expressed in the General Plan, and are intended to encourage
the orderly and harmonious appearance of structures and property, along
with associated facilities, such as signs, landscaping, parking areas, and
streets. The guidelines establish a high standard for design but are flexible to
allow individual expression and imaginative solutions.
Issues covered under design regulations include:
  Site Design–placement and orientation of buildings
  Parking–parking spaces for residents, guests, and disabled
  Unit Amenities–size of unit and open space
  Architecture–massing, form, rooflines, etc.
  Landscaping–provision of landscaping
For multiple-family residential projects located in the RM-24 district,
architectural plans are reviewed by the City Planner and are not subject to a
formal architectural review committee or additional processes or public
hearing. Once approved by City staff, the developer can simply transit plans
to Building and Safety to secure a building permit without public hearing.
These expedited procedures were created to facilitate and encourage the
production of multiple-family residential projects to address the RHNA.
For smaller projects in the RM district, a higher level of review is needed. The
RM district is typically reserved for infill projects where adjacent uses (such as
single-family residential neighborhoods) are involved. For these projects, the
Planning Commission completes architectural review based upon City staff
review of the individual projects. For these smaller projects, there is no special
noticing of neighbors nor special hearing other than a standard public
hearing ten days before a regularly scheduled public hearing.
Multiple-family design standards and design review are not considered to
constrain the approval or production of market rate or affordable housing.
Since the adoption of the new RM-24 district, developers have not proposed
apartment projects that have been denied due to design considerations. And
prior to those standards, the Bungalows at Chapman Heights successfully
incorporated many of these same design considerations as currently required.
When completed, the project was well-designed and nearly affordable to
lower income households. Senior projects have also been built.
                                                                         CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT      49

Constraint Analysis
                                  Step 4: Environmental Review
                                  Environmental review is typically accomplished with an Initial Study and
                                  Negative Declaration if the project is consistent with the general plan. In
                                  some cases, larger projects will require a Specific Plan and Environmental
                                  Impact Report. Larger projects will require additional time due to mandated
                                  public review and the complexity involved with complying with CEQA.
                                  Developers may also wish to apply for a Planned Development District
                                  designation, which offers flexibility in residential development standards.
                                  Though typically, environmental review can be completed within 30 days.
                                  Time Requirements
                                  Processing times depend on project size and complexity, and to a large
                                  extent on the applicant responding to revisions during the review process.
                                  Table 3-8 outlines typical steps and time required to process a residential
                                  project, from initial project submittal to building permit. Taken together,
                                  single-family home projects can be reviewed and approved within 2 months,
                                  while apartments take 3 to 6 months from project submittal to approval.

                                  The City strives to facilitate a timely review of projects. The City provides
                                  permit processing guidelines to assist builders in applying for development
                                  permits for residential uses. Developers are provided an “early consultation”
                                  preapplication process to identify issues upfront and reduce processing time.
                                  Expedited processing for affordable projects is also offered. Because of the
                                  relatively quick turnaround of applications for residential development, the
                                  City’s permit process is not considered a constraint to housing production.

                                                                                               Constraint Analysis
HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
Pursuant to Section 65008 of the Government Code, this section analyzes
potential and actual constraints to the development, improvement, and
maintenance of housing serving people with disabilities in Yucaipa. Where
actual constraints are found, this section describes specific programs that will
be implemented as part of the 2014–2021 Housing Element to remove
government constraints to housing people with disabilities.
Zoning Code Definitions
General Plan and Municipal Code definitions can create fair housing concerns
if the definition could be used to limit housing opportunities or fair housing
choice by individuals or families. Although cities rarely discriminate in this
manner, the code definition in itself could discourage a developer from
proposing a use that would otherwise be deemed allowed. By example, fair
housing law prohibits defining a family (and by extension living quarters) in
terms of the relationship of members (e.g., marital status), number of
occupants (e.g., family size), or other characteristics beyond a housekeeping
unit. Other definitions should also be consistent with fair housing law.
The Yucaipa Municipal Code defines a “family” as a person or persons living
together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit. This definition is
consistent with fair housing law. A dwelling unit, single, is defined as a
detached dwelling unit designed and/or used to house not more than one
family, including all domestic employees of such family. A multiple dwelling
unit is intended for two or more families living separately. Although the
definition of family is in compliance with fair housing, the Municipal Code
should be amended to remove the distinction of number of families as these
distinctions could be construed to unduly limit housing opportunities.
Permitted Land Use
The prior 2008–2014 Housing Element identified several constraints to the
provision of housing that raised several fair housing implications. This
included providing housing opportunities for lower income families,
homeless people, and persons with a disability. The City addressed this
impediment by amending the Development Code to permit additional types
of housing units in the community. The City now allows for emergency
shelter, transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, and single-room
occupancy units. The City also created a new land use district to permit
multiple-family apartments by right at densities of 20 to 24 units per acre.
In reviewing Yucaipa’s Development Code, two areas are of concern. The
definitions of social care facilities and employee housing are not consistent
with the definitions in the Health and Safety Code. The city currently permits
social care facilities serving 6 or few residents in all residential zones as
required, and larger facilities are conditionally permitted. To remove any
confusion in the definition and permitting of these facilities, the City could
make code amendments to ensure consistency with state law. In addition, the
provisions for farm worker housing could be similarly updated.
                                                                        CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT      51

Constraint Analysis
                                  Development Standards and Permitting Processes
                                  The City of Yucaipa thoroughly examined its residential development
                                  standards and permitting process to identify potential constraints on the
                                  construction or improvement of housing occupied by people with a disability.
                                  Parking standards for group homes are equal to any single-family or multiple-
                                  family residence. No additional construction standards or development
                                  standards are required for housing for people with a disability. Housing is
                                  treated in a similar manner regardless of the occupancy. The City does not
                                  have distance requirements for residential care facilities. In fact, the City has
                                  been proactive in approving senior projects.
                                  Should a potential fair housing impediment exist not identified to date, the
                                  City of Yucaipa has created a process to provide individuals with disabilities
                                  reasonable accommodation in the application of the City’s rules, policies,
                                  practices, and procedures (including land use and zoning regulations), as
                                  necessary to allow disabled persons to use and enjoy a dwelling. Reasonable
                                  accommodation is defined in two ways:
                                      Minor reasonable accommodation. Any deviation requested and/or
                                       granted from strict application of the City’s laws, rules, policies, practices,
                                       and/or procedures of the City, including land use and zoning regulations,
                                       and which can be removed or terminated in 90 days or less after the need
                                       for the reasonable accommodation ends.
                                      Major reasonable accommodation. Any deviation requested and/or
                                       granted from strict application of the City’s laws, rules, policies, practices,
                                       and/or procedures, including land use and zoning regulations, resulting
                                       in a physical modification to the property that cannot be restored or
                                       terminated within 90 days after the accommodation ends.
                                  To secure an approval, the following findings must be made:
                                  (1) The requested accommodation is requested by or on behalf of one or
                                  more individuals with a disability protected by the Fair Housing Laws.
                                  (2) The request for reasonable accommodation is necessary to provide one or
                                  more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the

                                  (3) The requested reasonable accommodation will not impose an undue
                                  financial or administrative burden on the City.
                                  (4) The requested accommodation will not require a fundamental alteration

C.        ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
Yucaipa is defined by its topography and natural features. The community is
crossed with various natural features, including hillsides, canyons and
drainage areas. Moreover, the City also has several Alquist-Priolo zones. The
following briefly analyzes how environmental and infrastructure concerns are
addressed to continue meeting housing element goals and objectives.
OVERLAY DISTRICTS
Environmental conditions that could pose constraints to housing
development include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones,
floodplains, sensitive biological habitat, and agricultural lands. In many cases,
development of these areas is constrained by state and federal laws (e.g.,
FEMA floodplain regulations, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species
Act, the state Fish and Game Code, and the Alquist-Priolo Act). The general
plan has established five hazard protection overlays and six resource
protection overlays. While these policies constrain residential development to
some extent, they are also necessary to support other public policies. None of
the sites in the land inventory (Appendix B) are known to have environmental
constraints that would preclude the assumed level of development.
The overlay districts for hazard protection and resource preservation help to
identify the physical and environmental constraints for residential
development within the City. The hazard protection districts, which address
fire safety, floodplains, geologic hazards, noise hazards, and hazardous waste,
define areas that may be inappropriate for residential development or require
defined safety measures or mitigation such as brush clearing, flood proofing,
geologic mitigation, and noise mitigation. The resource protection districts,
which address agricultural resources, biotic resources, cultural resources,
mineral resources, paleontological resources, and scenic resources, are used
to define areas that contain known resources. These overlay zones trigger the
need for site-specific technical studies in conjunction with environmental
review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
Overlay zones are not anticipated to preclude the development of residential
development commensurate with the regional housing needs assessment,
including requirements for affordable housing. None of the current overlay
districts establish new requirements for discretionary review. Rather, the
overlay districts are designed to ensure adequate analysis of environmental
impacts, should they exist, in order to identify and mitigate them. Although
compliance with the requirements of these districts may impact the cost of
housing development to varying degrees depending on the location of the
project, many are required under state law. Additional requirements in these
areas are reasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare and maintain a quality living environment, and are not considered to
be unreasonable impediments to the construction of housing.
                                                                        CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT      53
Constraint Analysis
                                   INFRASTRUCTURE
                                   The City requires developers to provide on- and offsite improvements
                                   necessary to serve their projects. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be
                                   required of a project for rights-of-way, transit facilities, recreational facilities,
                                   and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision Map Act. The City’s capital
                                   improvement program (CIP) contains a schedule of public improvements,
                                   including streets, bridges, overpasses and other public works projects, to
                                   facilitate the continued buildout of the City’s general plan. The CIP helps to
                                   ensure that construction of public improvements is coordinated with private
                                   residential development. As a result of these policies, any infrastructure
                                   constraints must be fully mitigated and financed as growth occurs.
                                   Sewage collection and treatment in Yucaipa is provided by the Yucaipa Valley
                                   Water District. The district’s sewage treatment plant has a design capacity of
                                   4.5 million gallons per day (mgd) and was recently upgraded to 8 mgd.
                                   Current demand is estimated at 3.8 mgd—less than half the design capacity.
                                   A second 3 mgd treatment plant is being considered for the upper San
                                   Timoteo Canyon area. The treatment plants are intended to meet the
Wastewater Treatment Plant         wastewater needs of the projected population assumed in the City’s general
                                   plan. Although the availability of sewage treatment capacity does not
                                   constrain development, sewer line extensions and upgrades may be required
                                   to provide service, particularly for planned developments in outlying areas.
                                   Water for the city’s residents is supplied by the water district and two private
                                   water companies. The largest district, Yucaipa Valley Water District satisfies
                                   92% of its service area demands from groundwater. The balance of potable
                                   water is provided by filtered surface water from the Oak Glen Surface Water
                                   Filtration Facility. In addition, the district has built a new water filtration
                                   facility that produces up to 36 mgd of potable drinking water. The YVWD also
                                   operates a recycled water distribution system to offset a large portion of the
                                   City’s water demand. The use of recycled and nonpotable water significantly
                                   reduces demands for potable water. Because of these efforts, it is anticipated
                                   that adequate water supplies will be available to serve all of the new housing
                                   anticipated in Yucaipa for the 2014–2021 planning period.
                                   Natural drainage channels that flow through Yucaipa are not adequate to
                                   meet the flow that would be generated in a 100-year flood. In order for new
                                   development to take place, the City’s Master Drainage Plan includes extensive
                                   expansions of the storm drain system, including the extension of existing
                                   improved channels to the base of the hills, the addition of improved channels
                                   or underground drains along the county line, Yucaipa Creek northeast of the
                                   freeway, Chicken Springs Wash, Gateway Wash, and the Mill Creek tributary,
                                   as well as other branches and tributaries. As a result of the 100-year flood
                                   potential, all new residential developments must be coordinated with
                                   planned drainage improvements and mitigation provided where appropriate.
                                   None of the land inventory sites in Chapter 4, particularly those required to
                                   address the lower income housing need, have limitations in water, sewer, or
                                   storm drainage that would preclude development of those sites.

IMPROVEMENT REQUIREMENTS
After the passage of Proposition 13 and its limitation on local governments’
property tax revenues, cities have faced difficulty in providing public services
and facilities to serve residents. One of the main consequences of Proposition
13 has been the shift in funding of new infrastructure from general tax
revenues to development impact fees and improvement requirements on
land developers. In order to ensure public health and safety, the City of
Yucaipa, like other jurisdictions across the county, require developers to
provide onsite and offsite improvements necessary to serve their projects.
Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility extensions;
street construction; and traffic control reasonably related to the project.
Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-
of-way, transit facilities, recreational facilities, and school sites, consistent with
the Subdivision Map Act. The City regulates the design, installation, and
maintenance of improvements needed for new development. The City’s
Standard Design Guidelines provides specifications and standard drawings
for use in the construction of public works improvements and site grading.
This is accessible online at ww.yucaipa.org/citydepartments/publicworks.
Developers are typically required to construct or install the following:
    Grading and filling to approved grade, and construction of all necessary
     grade crossings, culverts, bridges and other related works;
    Drains, facilities, channel improvements, and other works required to
     provide adequate drainage and protection from storm or floodwaters;
    Concrete curbs/gutters and sidewalks on both sides of every street and
     the proximate side of each existing or dedicated street bordering a
     subdivision;
    Sewer mains, including dry sewers when required by the Water District,
     and all laterals required to serve each lot;
    Utilities, utility lines, and appurtenances, including water mains, fire
     hydrants, gas mains, telephone and electric lines, and all laterals and
     appurtenant equipment required to serve each lot;
    Utility lines, including but not limited to electrical, telephone, cable
     television, and street light, providing service to all new properties;
    Asphalt concrete pavement, base material, and seal coat in all existing or
     dedicated streets and alleys or portions thereof;
    Planting of trees of the variety, size, and condition in accordance with the
     approved plans and specifications;
    Street lights of approved design and illumination intensity, street signs,
     warning signs, and regulatory signs where required.

Constraint Analysis
                                  IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
                                  Yucaipa requires a standard set of improvements to serve new development
                                  and these improvements are funded by impact fees or project requirements.
                                  The range and type of improvements required vary by different planning area
                                  of the community, the intensity or density of development, and existing
                                  deficiency of infrastructure noted below and in Table 3-9.
                                            Level 4: This applies to areas where only a limited amount of low
                                             density development is planned and where lots are 5 to 10 acres.
                                             Required improvements are intended to be those needed to protect
                                             public health and focus on water, sewer, safe access, etc.
                                            Level 3: This applies to areas considered transitional, that are not
                                             labeled as either rural or urban. The area might have a moderate
                                             level of residential development expected to convert to higher
                                             density over the next 5 or 10 years. Typical lot sizes are 1 to 5 acres.
                                            Level 2: This applies to areas where planned density of development
                                             is relatively higher and where existing infrastructure, facilities, and
                                             distribution systems are largely in place. Typically lot sizes range
                                             from one-half to one acre in size. .
                                            Level 1: This applies to the areas planned for the most dense and
                                             highest intensity level of commercial, industrial, or multiple-family
                                             residential uses. In most cases, Level 1 is reserved for core areas of
                                             established areas where lot sizes are less than one-half acre in size.

4. Housing Resources
This chapter describes the land, financial, and administrative resources
available to Yucaipa to address its existing and future housing needs,
including its share of the regional housing needs allocation (RHNA).
A.          REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
California law requires all local governments to plan to facilitate and
encourage the production of housing to accommodate population and
employment growth. To assist in that effort, SCAG prepares housing
construction need goals for each city in southern California as part of the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (often referred to as the RHNA) process,
which is authorized by the California Government Code.
The Southern California Association of Governments projects the share of the
region’s future housing need for each city as part of the RHNA process. The
determination is based on three primary planning factors:
1.    the number of housing units needed to accommodate future population
      and employment growth;
2.    the number of units needed to allow for a desired level of vacancies and
      the replacement of housing units normally demolished;
3.    the number of very low, low, moderate, and above moderate income
      households needed in the community; and
4.    other factors related to a subregional jobs to housing balance, tenure,
      and other factors unique to each community
Table 4-1 below summarizes the City of Yucaipa’s 2014–2021 RHNA. The City
is required to make available a sufficient number of housing sites that are
general planned and zoned for housing to accommodate its need.

                                 How Yucaipa Can Address the RHNA
                                 The City of Yucaipa recognizes that housing needs in the community differ for
                                 families, young and working-age individuals, and seniors. Some differences in
                                 housing preferences are affected by wealth and income, while others are
                                 affected by household type and age. Both household formation and housing
                                 choice are linked to life cycle events such as leaving home, getting married,
                                 having children, changing jobs, retirement, and death of spouse. These break
                                 points define increasingly lengthy stays in the same housing unit.
                                 In addressing the RHNA, housing element law does not require a city to build
                                 affordable housing nor impose deed restrictions that make housing
                                 affordable. Rather, state law requires cities to designate or zone housing at
                                 different density levels that can accommodate a range of housing types and
                                 prices. The housing products at different densities and prices include single-
                                 family units, townhomes or condominiums, and then apartments. Each
                                 product has a different affordability category, shown below.
                                     Above moderate income. The average price of single-family homes on
                                      RS and RL-zoned parcels (up to 4 units per acre) is $300,000 and higher.
                                      This is affordable to the higher range of moderate income to above
                                      moderate income households. Certainly there are exceptions to this rule
                                      (infill homes in central Yucaipa), but the relationship between density
                                      and affordability remains. Once the economy recovers, single-family
                                      home prices will be sought by above moderate income households.
                                     Moderate income. The middle of the housing market is condominiums
                                      and townhomes, of which new projects sell at prices affordable to
                                      moderate income households. A typical example is the 110-unit
                                      condominium project built by KB Homes. Built at a density of eight units
                                      on RM-zoned land, this project offered three-bedroom units ranging from
                                      1,500 to 2,500 square feet. The homes sold at an average price in the mid
                                      $200,000s, which is affordable to moderate income households.
                                     Lower income. State law establishes that a zoning district with a density
                                      of 30 units per acre allows for a density that is sufficient for affordable
                                      housing for lower income households in urban counties. For the 2008–
                                      2014 Housing Element, the City Council created a general plan land use
                                      designation allowing 20 to 24 units per acre, and HCD correctly accepted
                                      that density as adequate for affordable housing. As was the case in 2008,
                                      this assumption remains true for housing built in Yucaipa, and several
                                      built projects demonstrate the accuracy of the above assumption.
                                   The City recently approved two senior projects, one at 31 units per acre and
                                   one at 16 units per acre that are affordable to very low income households.
                                   However, even if family housing on RM-24 or R-24 sites was built and
                                   limited public subsidies were available, the developer would immediately
                                   be entitled to receive a 35% density increase should affordable units be
                                   created per the City’s density bonus ordinance. This should result in
                                   housing affordable to lower income households.

B.        LAND INVENTORY
Though state law does not require cities to build the housing, it does require
communities to facilitate new housing production. State housing element law
allows local governments to obtain credits toward meeting its RHNA goal in
four primary ways: 1) preserve publicly assisted housing that is at risk of
converting to non–low income or market rates; 2) rehabilitate housing
projects and place deed restrictions on those projects; 3) construct housing
during the planning period; and 4) set aside land at appropriate densities.
For the first option, the City does not have any affordable projects at risk of
conversion (see Table 10). For the second option, there are minimal units that
would qualify under state guidelines for rehabilitation and preservation.
Unlike the previous housing element, the City can only credit residential
projects built after January 1, 2014, so the third option is not available.
Therefore the City’s strategy for meeting its RHNA relies solely on ensuring
that sufficient vacant land is available to accommodate projected growth.
To accomplish this task, state law requires that an adequate site inventory
contain four components. If the sites are underutilized (as opposed to vacant
sites), additional analysis is required.
1.   Identify vacant or underutilized parcels. An adequate land inventory
     consists of a listing and map of properties proposed to accommodate the
     regional housing needs by parcel number, size, general plan designation,
     and zoning of each property.
2.   Analyze site constraints. The site analysis should demonstrate that
     proposed sites to count toward the RHNA should not have significant
     environmental or infrastructure constraints that might affect the timing
     or feasibility of development by the end of the planning period.
3.   Calculate development capacity. The development capacity of sites in
     the housing element should be calculated based on minimum density
     range or realistic development capacity based on historic records of
     similar projects built in recent years in the City or region.
4.   Demonstrate that zoning is adequate. Finally, the analysis must
     demonstrate that the identified zones and densities will facilitate the
     development of housing for all income levels. In other words, the price
     and affordability of housing should be correlated to specific zones.
The land inventory that follows discusses the housing sites inventory
according to these criteria. The environmental clearance (typically an initial
study and negative declaration) associated with the housing element and the
project-specific environmental documentation for individual projects analyze
the precise environmental impacts of proposed projects.
                                                                       CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT     59

                                 IDENTIFICATION OF SITES
                                 As part of the 2014–2021 Housing Element, the City of Yucaipa requested a
                                 complete inventory of vacant parcels from the County Assessor’s land use
                                 database. This was used as the starting point for the land inventory. That
                                 inventory was refined further with the following steps:
                                 1.      Extracted 1,800 vacant parcels in the City of Yucaipa. All underutilized
                                         parcels, whether or not the uses could feasibly recycle to higher densities,
                                         were excluded from the analysis.
                                 2.      Discounted 400 parcels zoned for nonresidential uses (commercial,
                                         industrial, etc.) as well as theoretical residential development capacity for
                                         second units and single-room-occupancy units.
                                 3.      Discounted 500 parcels zoned for residential uses that are owned by
                                         public utilities, governmental entities, churches, and other entities that
                                         are not anticipated to be developed into residential uses.
                                 Table 4-2 summarizes the realistic residential development capacity
                                 remaining in Yucaipa based on vacant parcels and density assumptions. The
                                 following section discusses key sites to address the City’s lower income RHNA.

Single-Family Residential
Yucaipa offers significant opportunities for new single-family housing,
particularly at lower densities. As shown in Table 23, more than 2,600 housing
units could be developed in lower density single-family residential
neighborhoods. These sites are in either the RS or RL districts. Many of the
sites are in the North Bench area, north of Oak Glen Road. The majority of the
City’s residential acreage is located in the RL or RS district.
The municipal code has established a custom home overlay on much of the
residential area where vacant sites are available for new single-family homes.
The density ranges from 0.1 units per acre to approximately 4 units per acre.
The custom home overlay requires homes to be at least 2,200 square feet on
lots larger than 20,000 square feet. These homes sell for higher sales prices
due to the lot size, home size, and area of the community.
Multiple-Family Residential
Opportunities for multiple-family housing are provided through two RM
general plan land use designations, which allow for residential development
at densities up to 8 units per acre. Under the general plan, the City offers
opportunities to build up to 750 new housing units on RM-designated land.
This generally includes apartments, townhomes, and other similar uses. A PD
zone is also used to encourage multiple-family housing in the downtown.
The Uptown Business District Specific Plan encompasses approximately 16
city blocks along Yucaipa Boulevard that were formerly in the redevelopment
project area. One of the key objectives of the specific plan is to provide for a
mix of viable commercial and residential land uses in the Uptown District. To
promote a “downtown” mixed-use character, the specific plan encourages
senior housing, mixed-use development, and increased commercial uses.
Specific Plans
The City of Yucaipa has designated several areas for more intensive planning.
These areas include the Freeway Corridor Specific Plan and Uptown Business
District. In 2009, the City Council approved the 1,242‐acre Freeway Corridor
Specific Plan in the southern portion of Yucaipa along Interstate 10. This
project will provide regionally significant commercial centers along one of the
busiest freeways in southern California. A specific plan and EIR have been
prepared for the entire site, which is anticipated to provide up to 2,400
residential units, 550 acres of open space, schools, and other amenities. The
specific plan and final EIR were adopted and certified in 2009/2010.
Because state law focuses predominantly on making available sites that could
accommodate affordable and higher density residential units, the following
describes the higher density residential sites in greater detail.

                                 Freeway Corridor Specific Plan
                                 The first site for higher density, multiple-family housing is in the Freeway
                                 Corridor Specific Plan. To address the regional housing needs goals and meet
                                 the housing element requirements, the City Council adopted an R-24 zone for
                                 40 acres in the specific plan area, which could accommodate construction of
                                 up to 800 new residential units. The suitability of this site is described below.
                                    Environmental issues. The proposed multiple-family housing sites were
                                     chosen for feasibility. The specific plan has slopes of 0–50% grade, but
                                     the portion slated for multiple-family housing is less than 10% grade. The
                                     sites are not in the 100-year flood plain nor Alquist-Priolo Zone. The
                                     certified EIR contains a phasing plan for water, sewer, and drainage
                                     infrastructure consistent with the City’s and YVWD’s master plans.
                                    Development capacity. Development capacity is noted in the Freeway
                                     Corridor Specific Plan and addressed through the EIR. For the multiple-
                                     family housing component, the plan allows a density of 20 to 24 units per
                                     acre, which translates into a development capacity of 800. This assumes
                                     that a minimum density of 20 units is achieved, although the eventual
                                     density could easily be 60% higher under existing regulations.
                                    Adequacy of zoning: The land use and zoning designation analyzed in
                                     the EIR is adequate for affordable housing. Pursuant to commitments
                                     made in the 2008–2014 Housing Element as a precondition for HCD
                                     certification of the site inventory, the City Council approved the land use
                                     and zoning district and density range because it was a prerequisite for
                                     meeting the City’s lower income RHNA requirements.

Oak Glen and Colorado Street Site
The second site for higher density housing is located at the northeast corner
of Oak Glen and Colorado. Land Advisors Organization is marketing the site
and has created a hypothetical site plan to attract a buyer. No concept plans
have been considered, submitted, or approved for the site. To address the
regional housing needs goals, the City Council adopted an RM-24 zone for 20
acres of this site, which could accommodate a minimum of 400 new multiple-
family residential units. The suitability of this site is described below.
   Environmental issues. The RM-24 zoned site consists of generally flat,
    undeveloped terrain and is vacant. The site is not in the 100-year flood
    plain but it is partially located in an Alquist-Priolo Zone. The
    environmental clearance prepared in 2010 to redesignate this site for
    housing determined that no environmental issues required mitigation.
   Development capacity. The general plan and zoning district for this site
    allow 20 to 24 units per acre. At 20 acres, this site could accommodate a
    minimum of 400 new housing units as a by-right use. This assumes that a
    minimum density of 20 units is achieved, although the eventual
    residential density could be 20% higher under existing zoning.
   Adequacy of zoning: Pursuant to the 2008–2014 Housing Element as a
    precondition for HCD approval of the lower income portion of the site
    inventory, the City Council approved an RM-24 designation for the sites.
    The adequacy of zoning is confirmed by recent 100% affordable projects
    in the City that were approved and built at a density of 16 units per acre.
                                                                           CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT     63

                                 SUITABILITY OF ZONING
                                 The suitability of zoning for facilitating affordable housing is based upon prior
                                 history and comparison of: 1) price of land and other cost inputs; 2) market
                                 rents for the area; 3) level of financial subsidy; and 4) incentives offered
                                 (density bonus, fee waivers, reduction in standards) that can be monetized.
                                 The City has facilitated the construction of two affordable senior housing
                                 projects (Green Valley and Horizons) targeted to extremely low income and
                                 very low income households. The latter project was built at a residential
                                 density of only 16 units per acre with local, state, and federal monies.
                                 No “deed-restricted” affordable family projects have been built in Yucaipa,
                                 but one market rate family project was recently built in Chapman Heights.
                                 Chapman Heights is the one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Yucaipa
                                 adjacent to a golf course with mountain views. The apartment project was
                                 built at a density of just under 18 units per acre and no subsidies were
                                 provided. When built during the height of the housing boom, the project
                                 offered starting rents that were $100 above the maximum affordable rent for
                                 a low income household. The land was valued at $2.28 per square foot.
                                 The City has four RM-24 vacant sites totaling 60 acres. One site is located
                                 along Oak Glen Road. The land offers several advantages–the site is valued at
                                 70% less per square foot than the Bungalow site, the zoning allows a 25%
                                 increase in unit density, and environmental clearance has been completed.
                                 As the Bungalows were nearly affordable to low income households, it is
                                 reasonable to expect that the substantially lower land costs and 25% increase
                                 in base density on the Oak Glen site could support apartments with rents
                                 affordable to low income households. Therefore, the base zone is deemed
                                 suitable to facilitate housing affordable to lower income households.

Other Site Suitability Issues
As noted, many affordable housing projects are typically built with 50 to 150
units on a site. The RM-24 zone requires a minimum lot size of 5.0 acres to
allow for multiple-family residential uses. At an estimated 20–24 dwelling
units per acre, the minimum project size would range from 100 to 120 units.
For projects proposed for affordable housing, the density bonus provisions in
City regulations would allow 25% to 35% more units on a parcel. The size of
the final project built would likely be in the sweet zone of 100 to 150 units.
In developing the City’s existing RM-24 residentially designated sites, the
parcels are generally larger than common in more built-out urban areas. How
such parcels are developed often depends on the size and type of developer.
For large landowners who own the land and do not need to borrow funds, the
project would be built in phases based on market demand for the project. For
a 20-acre site, the developer would submit plans in progressive 5- acre
increments (as required by the development code) until the site is developed.
If a single landowner or developer who purchased the property needed
financing for a construction loan, they could likely split the lot to a minimum
parcel size of 5 acres. This is because a landowner would wish only to put up
the specific parcel proposed for development as collateral, rather than tie up
the entire 20 acre parcel as collateral. This minimizes risk for the developer. By
splitting the lot, the developer would tie up only the minimum collateral
needed (the 5-acre lot) to build a smaller project (around 100–150 units).
To complete the lot splitting process is a perfunctory administrative process
which can be done for a minimal cost. The landowner would hire an engineer
to review the site and create a parcel map with proposed lot lines. The
landowner would file a tentative parcel map at a cost of $3,000 to the City.
City staff would review the application for compliance with municipal codes,
Then the landowner and/developer would file a final map with the County.
No public hearing or other administrative process is required.

                                 Summary of RHNA Credits
                                 Table 4-3 and the following text summarize how the City’s land inventory
                                 satisfies the 2014–2021 RHNA. As of January 2013, the City has identified
                                 adequate sites at appropriate densities that can satisfy the regional housing
                                 needs requirement. This is summarized below.
                                     Above moderate income. Parcels that are designated RL and RS are
                                      anticipated to be affordable to above moderate income households.
                                      These sites accommodate typically larger homes at a density of less than
                                      four units per acre. New homes being built are in the mid to high
                                      $300,000s. This affordability level was confirmed in an earlier section.
                                     Moderate income. Parcels designated PD and RM are anticipated to be
                                      affordable to moderate income households. These sites accommodate
                                      condominiums or townhomes at six to eight units per acre. The types of
                                      new homes built in this district generally sell in the mid to high
                                      $200,000s. This affordability level was confirmed in an earlier section.
                                     Lower income. Parcels designated RM-24 or R-24 are anticipated to fulfill
                                      the lower income housing requirement. Although below the default
                                      density, this density of 20 to 24 units is suitable for affordable housing in
                                      the eastern San Bernardino County. Two recent projects built at 16 units
                                      per acre in Yucaipa are affordable to low income households.

C.       IMPLEMENTATION RESOURCES
Yucaipa has access to local, state, and federal financial administrative
resources to fund the construction, improvement, and maintenance of
housing or the administration of programs. These are described below.
FINANCIAL RESOURCES
   Low income housing tax credits. A nonprofit housing corporation could
    purchase an at-risk project, rehabilitate it using tax credits, and extend
    affordability controls. The California Tax Credit Allocation Committee
    oversees the application and allocation process for all LIHTC projects.
    Applicants compete for the funds, which are prioritized based on
    location, affordability, local housing needs, and public housing wait lists.
    The City used this source for the Yucaipa Terrace senior housing project.
   HOME funds. The HOME Partnership Program is granted to participating
    jurisdictions in the San Bernardino County Consortium to create and
    rehabilitate affordable housing for lower income households. HOME
    funds can also provide direct rental or home purchase assistance to lower
    income households. The county has used this program to fund the
    development and/or rehabilitation of 36 projects throughout the county,
    including three affordable housing projects currently funded in Yucaipa.
   Multifamily mortgage revenue bond (MRB). This funding source
    provides below-market interest rate loans for development, acquisition,
    or rehabilitation of existing multifamily rental units within the county and
    its cooperating cities. Although the economy is not conducive to issuing
    bonds, the county currently administers contracts for more than 1,000
    units of bond-funded affordable housing in incorporated cities. The City
    of Yucaipa may wish to seek greater participation in this program.
   Housing voucher program. This program provides rent subsidies to
    extremely low- and very low-income households with a housing cost
    burden, or who are at risk of becoming homeless or being displaced.
    Voucher recipients rent housing from private landlords and pay a portion
    of their income toward rent (usually up to 30% of their income). The
    County Housing Authority subsidizes the difference in monthly payments
    to the owner. The housing authority receives funding for more than 8,000
    housing vouchers on an annual basis, including in Yucaipa.
   Community development block grants. The CDBG program is a federal
    program awarded to fund housing and community development
    activities. Projects must benefit low and moderate income persons, aid in
    the prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or meet other urgent
    needs. Eligible activities include property acquisition, rehabilitation,
    preservation, economic development, code enforcement, and public
    facilities and services. Yucaipa participates in the CDBG program through
    the county, which applies to HUD on behalf of nonentitlement cities.
                                                                        CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT     67

                                 ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
                                    Housing Authority of the County of San Bernardino. The Housing
                                     Authority (HACSB) is a financial and administrative resource for
                                     preserving affordable housing. The HACSB collaborates with nonprofit
                                     organizations to build, rehabilitate, and fund affordable housing, and
                                     provides vouchers to maintain affordability after original covenants have
                                     expired. In the event a project’s affordability may expire, the Housing
                                     Authority could preserve affordability through vouchers or facilitate
                                     transfer of the units to a nonprofit organization.
                                    Housing Partners I, Inc. Housing Partners is a nonprofit organization,
                                     affiliated with the HACSB, that develops, rehabilitates, and preserves
                                     lower and moderate income housing. The Housing Authority facilitated
                                     development of this nonprofit arm, Housing Partners, to allow the
                                     nonprofit organization to seek and secure funding beyond the traditional
                                     funding sources available to the Housing Authority. As described earlier,
                                     the Housing Authority has transferred six lower income projects in
                                     Yucaipa to Housing Partners as a strategy to preserve the units.
                                    Independent Cities Finance Authority. This entity is a joint powers
                                     authority, of which Yucaipa is a member, established for the purpose of
                                     assisting local communities in raising capital to finance improvements,
                                     provide home mortgage financing, and provide financing in connection
                                     with the improvement, construction, acquisition, creation, rehabilitation
                                     and preservation of affordable housing, including mobile home parks.
                                     The City of Yucaipa has used the ICFA to refinance bonds on two mobile
                                     home parks in order to finance additional capital improvements to the
                                     projects and continue to secure long-term covenants on both projects.
                                    Qualified Entities. Qualified entities are nonprofits that have been
                                     approved by the Department of Housing and Community Development.
                                     Some of these entities are active in San Bernardino County, including
                                     Century Housing Corporation, Jamboree Housing Corporation, and
                                     Neighborhood Housing Services of the Inland Empire, Inc. To qualify, an
                                     entity must be able to manage the project, maintain affordability for at
                                     least 30 years or the remaining term of assistance, preserve the existing
                                     occupancy profile, maintain rents at a predetermined level of
                                     affordability, and agree to renew subsidies if available.
                                    Habitat for Humanity. Habitat runs several home rehabilitation and
                                     repair programs out of its San Bernardino office. Habitat has launched “A
                                     Brush with Kindness” program, which offers low cost home repairs to low
                                     income families. Sample projects include house/trim painting, weed
                                     abatement, address numbers, fence repair, and garage door painting.
                                     Funds are provided through its organization and donations. Through its
                                     partnership with Grid Alternative, low income homeowners may also be
                                     eligible to receive free solar panels as part of the program. Grid
                                     Alternative also trains volunteers in its apprentice program.

5. Program Evaluation
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate
the effectiveness of the existing housing element; the appropriateness of
goals, objectives, and policies; and the progress in implementing programs
for the previous planning period. This chapter addresses each component.
A.        PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS
The 2008–2014 Housing Element goals were drafted to implement the
required statutes in California Housing Element law and follow priorities
expressed by the Yucaipa community. To that end, the housing element
contained five primary goals, along with 15 supporting policies and
approximately 24 implementation programs.
The five housing goals were:
    Goal 1. Maintain and enhance the quality of existing housing and
     residential neighborhoods in Yucaipa.
    Goal 2. Assist in the provision of a variety of housing to meet the needs
     of the community.
    Goal 3. Provide adequate residential sites through appropriate land use,
     zoning, and specific plan designations to accommodate the City’s share
     of regional housing needs.
    Goal 4. Mitigate governmental constraints which may hinder or
     discourage housing development in Yucaipa.
    Goal 5. Promote equal opportunity for all residents to reside in the
     housing of their choice.
The 2008–2014 Housing Element also included 24 distinct policies and
programs. Because of the commitments made in that housing element, the
Department of Housing and Community Development determined that the
housing element was in full compliance with state law. This was a significant
success and represented the City’s first certified housing element. Following
adoption in 2009, the City was tasked with following through on the
commitments made in the more than two dozen housing programs.
The following is a summary of progress in meeting the quantified objectives
for the 2008–2014 Yucaipa Housing Element.
                                                                      CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT 69

                                    Housing Construction
                                    The 2008–2014 Housing Element new construction goal was 2,048 units. The
                                    City fulfilled its obligation by adopting a new general plan land use
                                    designation that would allow multiple-family apartments as a by-right use at
                                    24 units per acre. In addition to making land available, the City adopted
                                    several housing incentive programs, such as the density bonus ordinance and
                                    the fee deferral program. Specific successes were as follows:
                                        Horizons. The Horizons at Yucaipa is a new project that, when built, will
                                         provide 77 senior apartments on 4.9 acres at a density of 16 units per
                                         acre. The project will contain 61 one-bedroom units and 16 two-bedroom
                                         units. Affordability will range from 30–60% of MFI. Ten units are reserved
                                         for use by qualifying residents participating in the MHSA program. The
                                         project is funded by $1.1 million from the City, $1.1 million from CalHFA
                                         MHSA, a rental subsidy of $3.1 million from the Housing Authority, funds
                                         from Urban Housing Communities, and other private funding sources.
                                        Green Valley Village. Green Valley Village is a new project in the Uptown
The Enclave, Beazer Homes                Business District Specific Plan Area. This 45-unit senior apartment project,
                                         built at a density of 32 units per acre, consists of 36 one-bedroom units
                                         and 9 two-bedroom units. Amenities include: community area, computer
                                         room, a ¼-acre community garden, trellised picnic area with barbeques,
                                         and well-landscaped areas. Funding was provided from Yucaipa RDA,
                                         $1.5 million in County HOME funds, and $6.5 million in low income
                                         housing tax credits.
                                        Enclave Project. Yucaipa approved the construction of the Enclave
                                         project at Crafton Hills, a 109-unit residential development by Beazer
                                         Homes. Of the original units approved as part of Tract 12222, about 20 of
                                         the housing units remain to be built. Homes specifications range from 3
                                         to 5 bedrooms and 2,300 to 2,900 square feet. Typically, single-family
                                         home projects sell for prices in the mid $200,000s. However, because of
                                         the significant amenities in this project, the Enclave project sells in the
                                         mid-$350,000s and is affordable to above moderate income households.
                                        Fidelity Homes. The City approved the construction of the 110-unit KB
                                         Homes condominium project. This project involved the redesignation of
                                         a former vacant poultry farm, single-family residences, and other uses to
                                         a planned development. The project was approved at 8 units per acre.
                                         The project consisted of 110-unit three-bedroom condominium units of
                                         approximately 1,500 to 2,500 square feet in size. The project included a
                                         community center and pool. The majority of the units sold in the mid
                                         $200,000s, which is affordable to moderate income households.
                                    Taken together, 33% of the original construction goal was met. The shortfall is
                                    due to the worst housing recession in generations and demise of
                                    redevelopment, which was a key means to subsidize affordable housing. The
                                    foreclosure crisis that ensued also stopped any new residential construction.
                                    These trends continue to preclude the city from making more progress
                                    toward the new construction objectives in the 2008-2014 housing element.

Housing Rehabilitation and Preservation
The City’s 2008–2014 Housing Element goal was to see the rehabilitation of
approximately 75 housing units. This was to be accomplished by funding
from the RDA tax increment funds and through CDBG funds issued by the
county as part of its allocation from the federal government. Several other
smaller programs were proposed to rehabilitate housing units. Given that the
Redevelopment Agency is now defunct and the county has had its HOME and
CDBG allocation cut by upwards of 50%, these goals were not achievable.
Housing preservation goals were met; the county continued to provide 72
Section 8 housing choice vouchers, and the City RDA continued to provide 50
rental subsidies to mobile home park tenants. In fact, as shown earlier, the
City has a large number of affordable deed-restricted projects, and all of them
are preserved for the long term and presumably in perpetuity either through
HACSB, its affiliates, or through deed restrictions that were required as a
condition for receiving public assistance.
The City also assisted in the continued preservation of the Rancho Del Sol and
Grandview East mobile home parks, which provide 124 units deed restricted
as affordable to 42 very low income and 82 low income households. In 2001,
the City RDA issued mobile park revenue bonds to finance the acquisition and
renovation of these projects. In 2012, the City worked with the Independent
Cities Finance Authority to refinance the existing bonds, allowing the park
owner to obtain a better interest rate and generate funds to finance the
continuation of capital improvements at the mobile home parks.

6. Housing Plan
This chapter describes the goals, policies, and implementation programs the
City will implement to address its housing needs, including its share of the
regional housing needs allocation (RHNA). The Housing Plan serves as a guide
for all housing planning activities for the 2014-2021 planning period.
A.        BACKGROUND
The City of Yucaipa recognizes that meeting housing needs in the community
requires a comprehensive strategy. Housing needs differ for families, young
and working-age individuals, and seniors in Yucaipa. A key reason for
Yucaipa’s continued attractiveness is the ability to provide a wide range of
housing and neighborhood settings suited to people with different needs
and the diligent efforts undertaken to ensure properties are well maintained.
The Housing Plan is a statement of the community’s goals, objectives, and
policies relative to housing production, rehabilitation, conservation, and
assistance for residents in Yucaipa. The Housing Plan outlines the City’s
approach to pursuing four objectives that are consistent with the direction
set forth the City’s land use element of the general plan.
The three goals around which this plan is organized are:
    Housing and Neighborhoods. Quality neighborhoods evidenced by
     well-maintained housing, ample public services, open space, and
     infrastructure that provide a quality place to live.
    Housing Opportunities. Adequate residential sites through land use,
     zoning, and specific plan designations that allow a diversity of housing
     types for the City’s varied needs for housing.
    Housing Assistance. Improved opportunities for moderate and low
     income residents and those with special needs to rent, purchase, or
     maintain adequate housing.
As described herein, the Housing Plan therefore sets forth a comprehensive
menu of housing programs to implement the above overarching direction.
The programs consist of existing programs, programs that have been
modified based on what has been learned over the past few years, and new
programs designed to address new priorities or needs of the community.
Quantified and qualitative targets are also indicated for each program.
                                                                       CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT 75

                                 B.       ISSUES, GOALS, AND POLICIES
                                 The City of Yucaipa faces several challenges in meeting the existing and
                                 future housing needs of its residents and its workforce. These issues, goals
                                 and policies directed at addressing these challenges are below.
                                 ISSUE #1: HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS
                                 Yucaipa’s residents are drawn to the community for its quality housing and
                                 diversity of neighborhoods. Framed in part by topography and also by lot size
                                 and history, Yucaipa offers a mix of rural to suburban lifestyles for residents.
                                 Whether it is the rural ambience of Dunlap Acres, the more remote uplands of
                                 North Bench, proximity of Central Yucaipa, or Wildwood Canyon, each area
                                 offers a unique lifestyle, framed by the topography and assets of the area.
                                 Preserving these neighborhoods is a priority for Yucaipa residents.
                                 In addition to neighborhood setting, the City of Yucaipa recognizes the
                                 importance of quality housing. Whether the housing is mobile home parks,
                                 single-family developments, apartments or attached housing, a quality
                                 housing stock improves property values and the health of residents. This
                                 requires code compliance and periodic housing repair and rehabilitation. To
                                 these ends, the following goals and policies are designed to preserve and,
                                 where needed, improve the livability of Yucaipa’s neighborhoods.
                                 Goal HE-1         Quality neighborhoods evidenced by well-maintained
                                                   housing, ample public services, open space, and
                                                   infrastructure that provide a quality place to live.
                                 Policy HE-1.1     Code Enforcement. Maintain and improve the quality of
                                                   single and multiple family housing and mobile homes
                                                   through the adoption and enforcement of housing and
                                                   property maintenance standards and public education.
                                 Policy HE-1.2     Housing Quality. Promote the repair, improvement, and
                                                   rehabilitation of single-family housing, multiple-family
                                                   housing, and mobile home parks to enhance quality of life
                                                   and improve and maintain property values.
                                 Policy HE-1.3     Public Services and Infrastructure. Provide quality
                                                   community facilities, infrastructure, traffic management,
                                                   public safety, and other services to maintain the livability,
                                                   safety, and vitality of residential neighborhoods.

                                                   that are physically and economically sound through
                                                   regulatory tools, acquisition by non-profit organizations,
                                                   and rent stabilization.

ISSUE #2: HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
The City of Yucaipa recognizes that meeting housing needs in the community
is not a one-size fits all strategy. In these changing times, a comprehensive
housing strategy is needed. Housing needs differ for families, young and
working-age individuals, and seniors in Yucaipa. Therefore, the City’s housing
strategy must be predicated on facilitating a wide range of quality housing
products–including single-family homes, mobilehomes, townhomes,
apartments, and mixed use residential developments where appropriate.
Yucaipa’s regional housing needs goal is to accommodate 1,605 units for the
2014-2021 planning period. This includes units affordable to 637 lower
income households, 299 moderate income households, and 669 above
moderate income households. The City’s strategy is to direct higher density
housing to areas that can support economic development and that are
located near major transportation corridors. With the exception of select infill
sites, established residential neighborhoods will be preserved.
The following goal and policies further these objectives.
Goal HE-2          Adequate residential sites through land use, zoning, and
                   specific plan designations that allow a diversity of
                   housing types for the City’s varied needs for housing.
Policy HE-2.1      Focus Areas. Direct the development of multiple-family
                   housing to major transportation corridors, in uptown, and
                   other appropriate locations consistent with specific plans
                   and land use designations.

                                 ISSUE #3: HOUSING ASSISTANCE
                                 Yucaipa is home to people with a variety of housing needs. This includes
                                 special needs (seniors, families with children, people with disabilities, etc.),
                                 families and individuals seeking first time rental or homeownership
                                 opportunities, people without housing, and many other groups. At some
                                 point, each Yucaipa resident will consider the type of neighborhood, location,
                                 size of home, and housing affordability level that best meets our needs. The
                                 answers to these housing questions have significant implications for Yucaipa.
                                 Yucaipa also recognizes the increasingly varied housing needs of its residents
                                 and seeks to assist, where feasible, to assist in the provision of housing
                                 opportunities that can address the needs of its residents and workforce. One
                                 size housing or approach does not fit the needs of the Yucaipa community. To
                                 some, that assistance will be renter or homeowner assistance, whereas to
                                 others it will be special needs housing. To that end, the following goals and
                                 policies are intended to guide in providing housing assistance.
                                 The following goal and policies further these objectives.
                                 Goal HE-3          Improved opportunities for moderate and low income
                                                    residents and those with special needs to rent, purchase,

                                                    families earning lower incomes in Yucaipa, particularly for
                                                    special needs groups in the community.
                                 Policy HE-3.2      Homebuyer assistance. Increase opportunities for
                                                    residents and employees to obtain homeownership
                                                    opportunities through the provision of financial or
                                                    regulatory assistance where feasible.

                                                    to reside in the housing best suited to their individual needs.

                                                                                                   Housing Plan
C.        HOUSING PROGRAMS
As part of its General Plan program, the City of Yucaipa will implement the
following housing programs to achieve the goals, policies and objectives set
forth in the 2014–2021 Housing Element.
1. Code Enforcement Program
The City implements a code enforcement program for its residential and
commercial areas. The program is responsible for enforcing municipal codes
that are intended to maintain the value and safety of property and structures.
The program addresses hazardous vegetation, substandard buildings,
accumulation of debris and vehicles, yard sales, graffiti, stormwater drainage,
green pools, construction without a permit, land use violations, and various
other health and safety codes. The City’s code enforcement officers work with
residents and the business community to remedy code violations in a timely
manner. Code enforcement officers are also involved in coordinated cleanup
days. This program is viewed as essential to maintaining and improving the
safety, livability, and value of properties in the City of Yucaipa.
Implementation:
    Objective: Continue to implement code enforcement activities to ensure
     compliance with City ordinances.
    Time frame: Ongoing
    Responsibility: Yucaipa CDD
    Funding Source: General Funds
2. Building Inspection Program
The City’s building officials are responsible for inspecting housing structures
to ensure health and safety of occupants. For a nominal fee, a City building
inspector will conduct a field investigation to determine the physical
condition of multiple family properties at the request of interested buyers. In
2008, the City assumed responsibility for mobile home inspections previously
administered by the County of San Bernardino. The City now inspects each
mobile home park at least once every seven years (required under the
Mobilehome Parks Act and Special Occupancy Parks Act in the Health and
Safety Code and Title 25 of California Code of Regulations). In accordance
with the Department of Housing and Community Development direction,
these inspections focus primarily on identifying serious code violations.
Implementation:
    Objective: Continue to inspect mobile home parks every seven years and
     inspect other multiple-family projects upon request of potential buyers.
    Time frame: Ongoing
    Responsibility: Yucaipa CDD
    Funding Source: General Funds and Fees
                                                                       CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT     79

                                 3. Single-Family Home Repair
                                 Maintaining the quality of single-family residences is a City priority to provide
                                 high quality of life, prevent blight, and maintain property values. As a
                                 member of the County CDBG Consortium, the City has historically offered
                                 funds to assist in the repair of single-family homes; however, funding has
                                 been cut back in recent years. The county offered eligible homeowners HOME
                                 rehabilitation loans at or below market interest rates. In addition, the City
                                 received up to $50,000 in CDBG-funded grants to help eligible senior
                                 homeowners correct code violations and/or health and safety problems. In
                                 2012, both programs were significantly curtailed due to CDBG cutbacks,
                                 effectively eliminating this program. Until funding is restored or an alternative
                                 to redevelopment financing is developed, the City will seek funding
                                 opportunities. This may include working with Habitat for Humanity or other
                                 nonprofit organizations to secure funding for single-family home programs.
                                 Implementation:
                                     Objective: Seek funding sources to restore program to fund the repair,
                                      maintenance, and rehabilitation of single-family homes.
                                     Time frame: When applicable NOFAs are available
                                     Responsibility: Yucaipa CDD
                                     Funding Source: General Funds
                                 4. Multiple Family Housing Repair
                                 Equally important are the many apartments and townhomes. Historically, the
                                 City has participated in the county’s Multifamily Residential Rental Housing
                                 Revenue Bond Program that assists developers to increase the supply of
                                 affordable rental units available to qualified households. This program can be
                                 used for new construction, acquisition, and/or rehabilitation of multifamily
                                 housing developments. To qualify for funding, a specified number of units are
                                 required to remain affordable to eligible, low-income households for a
                                 specified number of years after the initial financing is provided. The proceeds
                                 from bond sales provide financing for affordable rental units/complexes
                                 across the county. In past years, the grant focused on existing projects. The
                                 county is now concentrating its efforts on the construction of new projects or
                                 rehabilitation and deed restriction of existing projects. This program has not
                                 been widely used in Yucaipa for its public housing stock.
                                 Implementation:
                                     Objective: Seek funding sources to restore program to fund the repair,
                                      maintenance, and rehabilitation of multifamily homes.
                                     Time frame: When applicable NOFAs are available
                                     Responsibility: Yucaipa CDD
                                     Funding Source: General Funds

                                                                                                   Housing Plan
5. Crime Free Multifamily Housing
The City of Yucaipa recognizes that providing housing safe from crime and
blight is critical to preserving the public health, safety, and welfare of all
residents. Pursuant to Ordinance 312, the City enacted a Crime Free Multiple-
Family Rental Housing Program (CFMFRHP) as a key crime prevention
program to reduce criminal activity on subject rental properties. All applicable
businesses are required to participate as a condition of a business license to
operate in Yucaipa. The program includes training seminars for the property
managers and a requirement that each new lease or rental agreement
contain a “crime free” addendum that enables the property owner/manager
to evict people engaged in criminal activity. These provisions are enforced as
part of the City’s business license regulations. This program continues to be a
successful way to maintain and improve the quality of life in the community.
Implementation:
    Objective: Continue implementation of program as a precondition for
     receiving a business license to operate in the city.
    Timeframe: Ongoing
    Responsible Party: Yucaipa CDD
    Funding: General Funds
6. Mobile Home Rent Stabilization and Preservation
The City recognizes the importance of its mobile home stock as affordable
housing for seniors and families. Therefore, the City adopted its Mobile Home
Rent Stabilization Ordinance in 1991 as a means to establish a comprehensive
strategy for the regulation of space rents in mobile home parks in Yucaipa.
Under the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, mobile home park spaces are rent
restricted, and rent increases are limited after a vacancy. Some spaces are
under long-term leases and exempt from rent control. The lease limits annual
rent increases to 80% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). To further the goal of
maintaining affordable mobile homes, the City also established an overlay
district that establishes mobile home parks as the primary permitted land use
in order to limit the conversion of existing affordable housing to other uses. A
general plan amendment is required to remove the overlay.
Implementation:
    Objectives: Continue to regulate mobile home rents as permitted under
     state law and administer the Mobile Home Overlay District.
    Time frame: Ongoing
    Responsibility: Yucaipa CDD
    Funding Source: General Fund
                                                                       CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT     81

                                 7. Nonprofit Acquisition of Mobile Home Parks
                                 Mobile home parks represent over one-quarter of the City’s entire housing
                                 stock, and proper management of the parks is critical to the well-being of the
                                 residents. In past years, the City has used redevelopment funds to issue
                                 mortgage revenue bonds, which assisted nonprofit organizations in acquiring
                                 mobile home parks and preserving the units as affordable for the long term.
                                 This tool has been successfully used to deed restrict 100 very low income
                                 units and 209 lower income units for seniors. The City of Yucaipa has also
                                 used the Independent Cities Finance Authority to refinance bonds on two
                                 mobile home parks to finance additional capital improvements to the
                                 projects and continue to secure long-term covenants on both projects. As
                                 additional opportunities arise, the City will continue to facilitate and
                                 encourage nonprofit acquisition of mobile home parks and other
                                 opportunities to assist the finance of needed park repairs.
                                 Implementation:
                                     Objective: Seek opportunities and funds to help nonprofit organizations
                                      acquire, improve, and deed restrict mobile home parks.
                                     Timeframe: Ongoing
                                     Responsibility: Yucaipa CDD, ICFA
                                     Funding Source: Mortgage Revenue Bonds
                                 8. Rental Housing Assistance
                                 The Housing Authority of the County of San Bernardino (HACSB) coordinates
                                 Section 8 rental assistance on behalf of Yucaipa. Under this program, the
                                 HACSB extends rental subsidies to very-low-income households who spend
                                 more than 30% of their gross income on housing. Rental assistance not only
                                 addresses housing affordability but overcrowding, by allowing families that
                                 “double up” to afford their own housing. Unlike traditional approaches, the
                                 HACSB implements the Move-to-Work national demonstration program. In
                                 conjunction with temporary housing voucher assistance, the HASB requires
                                 voucher holders to participate in employment training, life skills, and other
                                 programs designed to improve the ability of participants to become more
                                 self-sufficient and transition off rental assistance within five years. For housing
                                 authority–owned units, the HACSB also provides permanent project-based
                                 vouchers to keep certain senior and family units affordable in perpetuity.
                                 Implementation:
                                     Objective: Promote the program by providing brochures at the public
                                      counter, senior center, library, and the East Valley Association of Realtors.
                                     Timeframe: Ongoing
                                     Responsibility: Yucaipa CDD, HACSB
                                     Funding Source: Federal Housing Vouchers

9. Homeownership Assistance
The City had historically provided several homeownership assistance
programs through its participation in the County of San Bernardino. The first
activity, funded by HOME funds, provided interest-free deferred (“silent
second”) loans to eligible households for the purchase of a home.
Homeownership assistance was provided through the single-family home
mortgage revenue bond program. This program offered below-market 30-
year fixed-rate loans to assist first-time homebuyers in purchasing homes. In
recent years, however, both of these programs were defunded by the County
of San Bernardino due to funding cutbacks in HOME and CDBG. Until CDBG
and HOME funding is restored or an alternative to redevelopment financing is
developed, the City will seek funding opportunities, such as grants or
nonprofit organizations, to assist in restarting these programs.
Implementation:
    Objective: Seek additional funding sources to restore program to fund
      the repair, maintenance, and rehabilitation of single-family homes.
    Time frame: When applicable NOFAs are available
    Responsibility: Yucaipa CDD
    Funding Source: Grants
10. Uptown Specific Plan
The Uptown Business District Specific Plan encompasses 16 city blocks
containing predominantly small, neighborhood-serving commercial business
and older, small single-family dwelling units on substandard lots.
Approximately 90% of the specific plan was formerly in the redevelopment
project area, an area that could benefit from housing rehabilitation and
economic development. One of the key objectives of the specific plan is to
provide for a mix of viable commercial and residential land uses. To promote
a “downtown” mixed-use character, the plan strongly encourages senior
housing development and mixed-use developments, and it offers by-right
100% density bonus to 16 units per acre as a means to facilitate revitalization.
The City has been successful in attracting a new senior project in recent years,
completing street improvements, and installing pedestrian amenities to
facilitate a more compact, vibrant, and economically viable uptown.
Implementation:
    Objective: Provide opportunities for infill housing development and
      facilitate the development of 50 new units during the planning period.
    Timeframe: Amend Specific Plan in 2013
    Responsibility: Yucaipa CDD
    Funding Source: General Funds

                                 11. Freeway Corridor Specific Plan
                                 In 2009, the City Council approved the 1,242‐acre Freeway Corridor Specific
                                 Plan in the southern portion of Yucaipa along Interstate 10. This project will
                                 provide a regionally significant commercial center, 2,400 residential units,
                                 550+ acres of open space, schools, and other amenities. To address the
                                 regional housing needs requirement for affordable housing, the City Council
                                 adopted the R-24 zone, allowing multiple-family housing as a by-right use.
                                 The specific plan designated 40 acres of vacant land within the R-24 district.
                                 For the multiple-family housing component, the plan allows a density of 20 to
                                 24 units per acre, which translates into a development capacity of 800 units.
                                 This assumes that a minimum density of 20 units is achieved, although the
                                 eventual density could easily be 20% higher under existing regulations and
                                 even higher if the developer produced units under state density bonus law.
                                 Implementation:
                                     Objective: Continue to implement specific plan and work with property
                                       owners to encourage the development of the property.
                                     Timeframe: Ongoing

                                 12. Housing Incentives Program
                                 The Yucaipa City Council adopted Ordinance 297, creating a housing density
                                 bonus program as required under California law. Ordinance 297 allows
                                 developers to receive a density bonus for qualified affordable housing
                                 projects and request concessions such as parking, development standards,
                                 and financial incentives normally available under state density bonus law. The
                                 City waives developer fees for all the deed-restricted affordable bonus units.
                                 To support these efforts in other neighborhoods in Yucaipa, the City adopted
                                 two other density incentive programs. As mentioned earlier, senior housing
                                 and multiple-family housing projects in Uptown can receive a 100% density
                                 bonus (an increase from 8 to 16 units per acre) to help provide needed
                                 housing that addresses senior needs or revitalizes the downtown. Since its
                                 adoption, the City has successfully implemented the density bonus law to
                                 facilitate the Green Valley Village Apartments in the Uptown Business District.
                                 Implementation:
                                     Objective: Continue to implement housing incentives program.

13. Minor Variance Program
The Yucaipa Municipal Code contains a minor variance program to ensure
that any property, because of special circumstances, such as size, shape,
topography, location, or surroundings, be accorded privileges common to
other properties in the same vicinity. To administer this process, the
community development director may approve requests for minor variances
to modify a wide number of code requirements. In the past planning period,
about 20 variances were approved for projects. General items allowed for
consideration of a minor variance include: 1) up to 20% of minimum floor
width of single residential design; 2) up to 30% of parking requirements, not
to exceed two spaces, area requirements (excluding lot area requirements,
height limitations); 3) 30–40% of front, side, and rear yard setbacks subject to
conditions; and 4) up to 50% of maximum gross floor area requirements.
Implementation:
    Objective: Continue to implement program and seek for opportunities.
    Timeframe: Ongoing
    Responsibility: Yucaipa CDD
    Funding Source: General Funds
14. Government Constraints
Yucaipa allows a broad range of housing opportunities in its municipal code.
These include community care or residential care facilities, housing for
employees, and other uses. State law preempts local regulations imposed by
local government and requires that such uses that serve six or fewer persons
be: (1) defined consistently with state law; 2) treated the same as a residential
use, (3) allowed by right in all residential zones, and (4) subjected to the same
fees, taxes, and permits as other residential uses in the same zone. In review
of the municipal code, both of the land use classifications and definitions
were inherited from the former County of San Bernardino Development Code.
The social care facilities land use should be updated to reflect the definition of
residential care facilities in the Lanterman-Petris Act. Similarly, the municipal
code definitions for caretaker and labor quarters should be updated to be
consistent with Section 17021 of the Health and Safety Code.
Implementation:
    Objective: Revise definitions and permitting processes for social care
     facilities, farm labor quarters, and other uses consistent with state law.
    Timeframe: Amend Municipal Code by 2014.
    Responsibility: Yucaipa CDD

                                 15. Assistance to Lower Income Housing
                                 Yucaipa offers a range of incentives to accommodate affordable housing.
                                 Housing Program 12 offers a standard density bonus program that allows
                                 progressively higher densities for projects providing lower income units. The
                                 City seeks for grant funding, such as the MHSA program used for senior
                                 housing in the uptown, to support deed restricted affordable housing to
                                 extremely low and very low income seniors. Developers also have the ability
                                 to request minor variances (Program 13) to modify most development
                                 standards to accommodate housing projects. Finally, the City allows fees to
                                 be deferred until occupancy, making it more financially feasible for
                                 developers to obtain loans for affordable housing. These tools, individually or
                                 collectively, help facilitate and encourage the construction of housing
                                 affordable to extremely low, very low, and lower income households.
                                 Implementation:
                                     Objective: Offer density bonus incentives, grant funding, fee deferrals,
                                      development standard modifications, and other incentive programs to
                                      assist in the development of affordable housing. Provide expedited
                                      permit processing for projects with extremely low income units.
                                     Timeframe: Ongoing

                                 16. Housing at Risk of Conversion
                                 Yucaipa has 300 units of senior and family affordable apartments and 310
                                 mobile home units that received public assistance in return for long-term
                                 affordability covenants. Presently, none are at risk of conversion for the entire
                                 housing element planning period (through 2021) because: 1) the projects are
                                 owned by nonprofit organizations or the housing authority, who have not
                                 expressed an intent to convert the projects, and 2) the residential projects still
                                 have long-term deed restrictions that guarantee affordability. Although none
                                 of the projects are at risk, the City will continue to monitor the projects to
                                 determine whether other assistance can be provided. One example is where
                                 the City worked with ICFA to issue a mortgage revenue bond to allow the
                                 mobile home parks to secure funding for capital improvements.
                                 Implementation:
                                     Objective: Monitor the affordable housing stock and work with owners to
                                      facilitate and encourage continued maintenance and rehabilitation.
                                     Timeframe: Ongoing

17. Fair Housing
The housing element is required to promote fair housing opportunities for all
persons, regardless of race, religion, sex, family size, marital status, ancestry,
national origin, color, age, or disability. The City is a member of the San
Bernardino County CDBG Consortium, which contracts with the Inland
Mediation Board to provide landlord-tenant mediation and fair housing
counseling services. Yucaipa’s Community Development Department refers
fair housing complaints to the Inland Mediation Board and provides
information brochures at City Hall and other locations. The City’s Municipal
Code appears to be in compliance with fair housing in most cases; however,
the definitions of single dwelling and multiple dwelling unit should be
revised to eliminate the references to number of families in a unit.
Implementation:
    Objectives: Continue to provide referrals and informational brochures
     regarding fair housing at the public counter, senior center, library, and
     Board of Realtors. Amend Municipal Code definition of “dwelling units”
     by removing number of families to eliminate potential restriction of
     housing opportunities due to housing occupancy.
    Responsible Agency: Yucaipa CDD, Inland Mediation Board
    Timeframe: Ongoing Amend Municipal Code by 2014.
    Funding source: CDBG
18. Reasonable Accommodation
In 2010, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 297, a reasonable
accommodation ordinance, to facilitate, improve, and expand housing
opportunities for people with a disability. The reasonable accommodation
ordinance was designed to give individuals with disabilities reasonable
accommodation in the application of the City’s rules, policies, practices, and
procedures (including land use and zoning regulations), as necessary to allow
disabled persons to use and enjoy a dwelling. Reasonable accommodation is
provided through two means: a minor accommodation (an action which can
be removed or terminated in 90 days or less after the need for the reasonable
accommodation ends) and a major reasonable accommodation (an action or
physical modification to a property that cannot be restored or terminated
within 90 days after the accommodation ends).
Implementation:
    Objective: Process reasonable accommodations as requests arise.

                                 19. Emergency Shelters
                                 In 2010, the City adopted Ordinance No. 296 to allow emergency shelters as a
                                 by-right use in the CS district pursuant to management and operational
                                 standards allowed for in state law. The same ordinance also allows the
                                 conditional permitting of transitional housing and supportive housing in the
                                 RM district. The required findings to locate a transitional or supportive
                                 housing project are the same as any conditionally permitted use. Finally,
                                 single room occupancy uses are allowed by right in the RM district pursuant
                                 to requirements in state law. With respect to services, CDBG funds are
                                 allocated to Yucaipa Valley Family Welfare to serve the poor and homeless
                                 through the Family Service Association. The City also participates in the MHSA
                                 program that allocates vouchers to residents with mental disabilities. To date,
                                 the City has not received applications to build housing for homeless people,
                                 but should an application be submitted, adequate provisions are in place.
                                 Implementation:
                                     Objective: Continue to support homeless services through participation
                                      in the County’s Consolidated Plan program and allocation of CDBG funds,
                                      the County’s Continuum of Care program, and other planning efforts.

                                 20. Transitional and Permanent Supportive Housing
                                 In 2010, the City of Yucaipa adopted Ordinance No. 296 to allow transitional
                                 and permanent supportive housing in the community in designated zones.
                                 However, such uses were only allowed conditionally in the RM zone. Pursuant
                                 to State law, transitional and permanent supportive housing must be treated
                                 like any other residential uses that are allowed in the same zone. So, both
                                 uses should be allowed as a by-right use in the RL, RS, RM. and PD zones if
                                 configured like a single-family residential unit and allowed by-right in the RM,
                                 RM-24, and PD zones if configured as a multiple-family project. The key is to
                                 treat the use like any other residential use in the same zone. Development
                                 standards should also be equal to a single-family or multiple-family unit.
                                 Implementation:
                                     Objective: Amend the Municipal Code to allow transitional housing and
                                      permanent supportive housing consistent with Senate Bill 2.
                                     Responsible Agency: Yucaipa CDD

21. Energy Conservation
The City of Yucaipa recognizes the importance of addressing statewide goals
for energy conservation and climate change reduction by taking reasonable
actions to encourage the conservation of energy, reduction of greenhouse
gas emissions, and other feasible practices in residential construction. To that
end, the City requires residential developers to meet the 2010 Green Building
Code with 20% reductions in indoor water use, 50% reduction in diversion of
construction waste generated at the site, achievement of California Energy
Standards, and other standards per City specifications. All of these standards
are enforced through the permitting process for new housing. As the General
Plan EIR is approved, mitigation measures will be evaluated for suitability for
implementation to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions.
Implementation:
    Objective: Continue to require adherence to the 2010 Green Building
     Code and other practices deemed feasible to reduce greenhouse gas
     emissions and conserve resources in a manner that does not unduly
     constrain the development, improvement, and affordability of housing.

environmental resources from residential development. The municipal code
sets forth various overlays—agricultural preserve, biotic resources, cultural
resources, mineral resources, and scenic resources. In addition, the hillside
preservation ordinance regulates the amount of open space on hillsides.
These overlays and regulations do not extend to areas where higher density
residential sites are proposed for multiple-family housing; therefore, these
regulations do not preclude achieving the regional housing needs goals.
Rather, these overlays (in combination with density transfer provisions) allow
for more creative solutions than would otherwise be possible.
Implementation:
    Objective: Continue to implement overlay designations and hillside
     preservation ordinance.
    Timeframe: Ongoing
    Responsible Party: Yucaipa CDD
    Funding: General Funds
                                                                       CITY OF YUCAIPA | HOUSING ELEMENT     89
