CITY OF YUBA CITY
HOUSING ELEMENT
     Adopted June 2003
       Prepared by
1 Introduction
The Housing Element of Yuba City’s General Plan presents a comprehensive set of housing
policies and actions for the years 2002–2007. It builds on an assessment of the City’s housing
needs, an evaluation of housing programs, available land, and constraints on housing production.
It also includes new initiatives to address shortages of affordable and market-rate housing and
meet the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) “fair share” allocation of regional
housing needs to the City.
The Housing Element addresses all of the topics required by State law, including:
•    population and employment trends,
•    households characteristics,
•    governmental and non-governmental constraints,
•    special housing needs,
•    opportunities for energy conservation,
•    existing assisted housing developments,
•    goals, policies, and quantified housing objectives, and
•    a five-year housing program (Government Code Section 65583).
This Element has been prepared to be consistent with other elements in the Yuba City General
Plan. Yuba City is currently undertaking an update of its General Plan. The Community
Development Department will maintain internal consistency between other General Plan
elements and the Housing Element by reviewing the goals, policies and actions of other elements
for their consistency with the Guiding Policies and Implementing Actions contained in the
Housing Element. General Plan land use policies will either maintain the housing opportunity
sites identified in this Element, or will ensure that equivalent sites are provided in the amended
Land Use Diagram of the General Plan.

2 Public Outreach
This chapter identifies techniques used by the City to solicit input and participation from local
residents. Public outreach conducted as part of this Housing Element update included:
•   General Plan Advisory Committee. The City’s General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC),
    formed in 2001, met once to discuss housing issues and programs. GPAC representatives
    included City and County planning officials, City Councilmembers, County Supervisors, and
    City residents.
•   Newsletter. A newsletter was distributed to City residents informing them of the General Plan
    update and the ways in which they could participate in the update process.
•   Newspaper Advertisements. Paid advertisements, in addition to public notices, were placed
    in the Yuba-Sutter Appeal-Democrat to inform the public of the General Plan update status
    and solicit further public involvement.
•   Homeless Consortium Meeting. Housing Department staff met with the Yuba-Sutter
    Homeless Consortium, composed of approximately eight local agencies and representatives
    from Sutter County, to discuss the General Plan update and the need for nonprofit and other
    agency involvement.
•   Consultation with Non-Profits. Staff communicated with local area non-profit housing
    providers, including the California Human Development Corporation, Sutter County
    Affordable Housing, and Mercy Housing, to discuss issues relevant to new affordable housing
    construction.
•   Consultation with For-Profit Housing Developers. Input and information was solicited from
    local for-profit housing developers operating in Yuba City and Sutter County.

3 Housing Needs Assessment
This chapter provides demographic and housing market information to evaluate existing and
future housing needs. The main purposes of this assessment are to evaluate the effectiveness of
existing housing policies and programs and to provide a general direction and focus for future
housing initiatives.
3.1            POPULATION
                                                                                              th
Yuba City’s population growth has been strong but variable throughout the 20 Century, more
than doubling in the 1920s and growing most quickly thereafter in the post-World War II era
(until 1960) and the 1980s. As shown in Table 3.1-1, the City’s population has grown from 27,437
in 1990 to 36,758 in the year 2000. This represents an average annual increase of 3.0 percent over
the last 10 years. SACOG projects that Yuba City’s population will grow annually by 2.5 percent
between the years 2000 and 2020. In comparison, Sutter County grew by a somewhat smaller
amount between 1990 and 2000—2.1 percent annually—and is anticipated to continue to grow
by approximately 2.2 percent annually through year 2020.
Recent spurts in population growth are attributable to continued annexations of land from the
Sphere of Influence (SOI). Growth will be concentrated in the west of the City, where the most
undeveloped land is available.

Age and Race
Table 3.1-2 shows the estimated distribution of residents by age group within Yuba City.
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 31 percent of Yuba City residents were under the age of 20.
The majority of residents (56 percent; 20,551 people) were between the ages of 20 and 64, and
constitute the City’s workforce-age population. Elderly residents (age 65 or greater) comprised 12
percent of the population. The 2000 age distribution in Sutter County was similar to that in Yuba
City; the median age for County residents is approximately two years older than for Yuba City.
There has been little change in both Yuba City’s and Sutter County’s age distributions between
1990 and 2000; both populations have aged slightly.
The racial diversity of Yuba City’s population is similar to the wider Sutter County population.
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 67 percent of Yuba City residents were White, 3 percent were
African American, 6 percent were Asian Indian, and 3 percent were other Asian. 25 percent of all

residents were of Latino or Hispanic origin. Over the last 10 years, the racial composition of both
the City and County populations have changed – all groups grew in absolute number, but there
was a smaller proportion of White residents and greater proportions of all other groups among
residents in the year 2000.

3.2            HOUSEHOLDS
The number of households in Yuba City increased at a slower rate than the City’s population
during the last decade due to a rise in average household size, a trend that will probably not
continue over the coming 20 years. Table 3.2-1 illustrates household growth trends through the
year 2020. The number of households within Yuba City increased from 10,583 in 1990 to 13,290
in the year 2000, or about 2.3 percent annually. Both annual population growth and housing unit
construction are anticipated to maintain average annual growth rates of 2.5 percent through year
2020. SACOG projects that the average Yuba City household will fall slightly to about 2.67
persons per household by the year 2020.

  Latino or Hispanic was not a separate race category in the 2000 U.S. Census. All persons who were reported as
   Latino or Hispanic were also reported as belonging to another racial category.

Housing Tenure
Table 3.2-2 shows the number of vacant and occupied housing units in Yuba City, as well as the
rate of home ownership. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 47 percent of households owned
their homes and 53 percent rented. This was much lower than the 62 percent homeowners and 38
percent renters estimated for Sutter County.
Vacancy rates in the City indicate a shortage of owner-occupied housing. The 2000 U.S. Census
reported that the overall housing vacancy rate in Yuba City was 4.5 percent: 1.4 percent for
owner-occupied units and 4.7 percent for rental units. This reflects a similar housing market to
what existed during the 1990 U.S. Census. A vacancy rate of three percent generally is considered
normal for owner-occupied housing, as is a vacancy rate of five percent for rental housing. At
normal vacancy rates, housing and rent prices tend to be more stable due to a more balanced
supply and demand for housing.

In 2000, the greatest portion of Yuba City’s households were married couple families. As seen in
Table 3.2-3, 48 percent of Yuba City households were married couples either with or without
children. Single-person family households made up 19 percent of the City’s households, and 33
percent of Yuba City households were non-family households. Thirty-seven percent of
households were families with children, a majority of which were married couple families with
children. The average family size was 3.28 persons per family, which was larger than the average
household size of 2.70 persons per household.

There was a notable difference between household types and sizes in the City of Yuba City versus
Sutter County. According to the year 2000 U.S. Census, about 74 percent of households in Sutter
County were families, with most of those being married couples. Thirty-eight percent of
households were families with children, and 26 percent were non-family households. Average
household size was 2.87 persons; families averaged 3.35 persons.
3.3           EMPLOYMENT
Yuba City is in the interesting position of being both an employment center for the Yuba-Sutter
region and a bedroom community to Sacramento, the California state capital. Employment
growth has increased at a faster rate than population growth over the last 10 years and the City
now contains more jobs than employed residents, the reverse of the situation in 1990. Table 3.3-1
shows employment growth trends for the City and Sutter County.
Yuba City’s job base grew by an average of 4.4 percent annually between 1990 and 2000, whereas
the City’s employed residents increased by approximately 1.2 percent annually. SACOG projects a
significant decrease to 2.3 percent annual employment growth within Yuba City to the year 2020.
Sutter County has seen more modest annual employment growth in the last 10 years (2.1
percent), and its job creation is expected to remain constant in the coming years.
Despite being a regional employment center, many residents of Yuba City are employed in
Sacramento, the region’s strongest importer of workers. According to SACOG, the City and
County of Sacramento were home to 259,501 and 541,489 jobs, respectively, in the year 1999.
Residential commute patterns further demonstrate that Yuba City is a bedroom community for
neighboring job centers; the 1990 U.S. Census estimated that 51 percent of Yuba City’s employed
residents worked outside the City, and 41 percent worked outside Sutter County.

Jobs/Employed Residents and Jobs/Housing Ratios
The jobs/employed residents’ ratio is a comparison of total jobs in the City to the number of
employed residents who live in the City (but could be working either in the City or in
surrounding jurisdictions). A jobs/employed residents’ ratio of greater than one suggests a net in-
commute of workers into the City; a ratio of less than one suggests a net out-commute. Yuba
City’s jobs/employed residents’ ratio of 1.26 in year 2000 suggests that despite the public
perception of Yuba City as a bedroom community to Sacramento, it is an employment center for
other communities in the Yuba-Sutter region.
Since the number of jobs in Yuba City increased at an average annual rate of 4.4 percent over the
last decade, compared with a 3.0 percent average annual growth rate for the City’s population, the
City had a job surplus in the year 2000 – 16,914 jobs compared with 13,410 employed residents.
The jobs/employed residents’ ratio for Sutter County was 0.91 in year 2000. Historic and
projected Jobs/Housing Unit Ratios provided by SACOG demonstrate this trend continuing,
albeit more slowly, until the year 2020.
3.4           INCOME AND HOUSING COSTS
The approximate median household income for Yuba City was $23,491 according to the 1990
U.S. Census. This was lower than the median household for Sutter County, which was reported to
be $27,096. It is also substantially lower than the Sacramento median household income of
$32,297. The Center for Economic Development at CSU Chico reports that for 1997, the year for
which data was most recently available, the Sutter County median household income was
$33,775. Though the exact numbers for household income have not been reported from the 2000
census, the trend of median household income being lower-than-average for Sutter County and
lower still for Yuba City should be noted.

Housing Affordability
Both household incomes and housing costs in the City have risen very slowly over the last 10
years. According to the Sutter-Yuba Association of Realtors, housing prices in Yuba City rose 16
                                                                  2
percent between 1991 and the third quarter of 2001. Federal regulations and guidelines define the
maximum annual amount that each household can feasibly spend on housing costs (e.g.,
mortgage, rent, utilities) as 30 percent of gross household annual income. Income categories, as
                                                                                                                      3
defined by the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), include:
•     Very Low: Households with income less than 50 percent of the County’s area median income.
•     Low: Households with income between 50 and 80 percent of the County’s area median
      income.
•     Moderate: Households with income between 80 and 120 percent of the County’s area median
      income.
•     Above Moderate: Households with income over 120 percent of the County’s area median
      income.
HCD bases its income categories on those defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD). Both Sutter and Yuba Counties are in the lowest income tier of California
counties. Table 3.4-2 shows housing costs distributed by income categories for Sutter County,
reflecting the income categories described above. A Moderate income household in Sutter
County, earning between $30,900 and $46,300 in 2001, can expect to pay between $770 and
$1,160 in monthly housing costs.

Housing Costs
According to the Sutter-Yuba Association of Realtors’ third-quarter 2001 average home sale
prices, the average home price in Yuba City was $148,300, about 14 percent less than the median
                                                                 4

Assuming a 10 percent down payment, a 30-year mortgage, and an interest rate of 6.5 percent,
monthly mortgage payments on a $148,300 home would be about $850. The gross annual income
required to afford such a home (assuming no more than 30 percent of gross income is spent on
housing) is at least $34,000. Additional homeowner costs (taxes, insurance, closing costs and
maintenance) may require an even greater income, as would any additional debt. A four-person
household in Yuba City would need to be within the Moderate or Above Moderate income
categories in order to afford a median-priced home in Yuba City with the preceding mortgage
scenario. Such a household would also need $14,830 in cash to make the 10 percent down
payment.
Based on the annual income ranges for each category and the aforementioned assumptions, very
low income (VLI) families would be able to afford homes selling for $85,000 or less, low income
(LI) families would be able to afford homes selling for $125,000 or less, and moderate income
(MI) families would be able to afford homes selling for $200,000 or less. According to the Sutter-
Yuba Association of Realtors, 12 percent of the 837 homes sold in 2001 were affordable to VLI
families, an additional 32 percent were also affordable to LI families, and another 47 percent were
affordable to MI families; in total, 90 percent of homes sold in Yuba City were affordable to some
degree.
Information is not available on how many of these units were built recently; nonetheless, it
appears likely that the private market and existing programs will be able to satisfy Yuba City’s
regional housing needs determination for moderate income-affordable units and much of the
need for low income-affordable units.
The most recent governmental figures on apartment rents come from the Yuba City
Administration Department’s Apartment Survey in January 2000, which reported a median one-
bedroom apartment rental rate of $358 and a two-bedroom apartment rental rate of $427 in Yuba
City, both showing a decline in rates since 1995. A review of rental housing advertisements in the
Yuba-Sutter Appeal-Democrat (December 2001) suggests an average monthly one-bedroom
                                                                                            5
apartment rental rate of $410 and a two-bedroom apartment rental rate of $540. While this does
represent a much more affordable rental climate than the California average, a four-person
household within the Very Low Income category would probably not be able to afford the average
two-bedroom apartment in Yuba City.
Overpayment
The 1990 U.S. Census estimated that approximately 70 percent of Very Low and Low-income
households were overpaying for rental housing, and that 39 percent were overpaying mortgage
costs (see Table 3.4-3). Furthermore, 15 percent of Moderate and Above Moderate-income
households were overpaying for rental housing, and 7 percent were overpaying mortgage costs. A
total of 3,416 households (or 35 percent of all households) in Yuba City were paying housing
costs that exceeded 30 percent of their incomes in 1990.

  While there were few advertisements than would probably make a representative sample, these numbers
correspond very well with the HUD-established fair market rents in Section 5.1: Section 8 Housing.

3.5            LOCAL HOUSING SUPPLY
According to U.S. Census data, Yuba City’s housing supply increased by 26 percent from 11,068
to 13,912 between 1990 and 2000. SACOG projects the City to have 22,807 housing units in the
year 2020.
New housing unit construction in Yuba City since 1991 has been predominantly, if not
exclusively, composed of single-family homes. The City’s Housing and Redevelopment
Department states that no market rate apartment complexes and no mobile home parks have
been constructed in the past ten years and no new spaces were added to existing mobile home
parks. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the reason so little (if any) multi-family housing has been
constructed is due to its marginal profitability and an increasing demand for single-family
detached homes.
Table 3.5-1 shows that approximately 46 percent of total housing units are sale (owner-occupied)
units and 53 percent are rental units. Of the 6,383 sale units, approximately 1.4 percent are
currently vacant; whereas approximately 4.7 percent of the rental units are vacant. An additional
123 housing units (0.9 percent of total) are vacant for seasonal, recreational, and other uses.

Unfortunately, 2000 U.S. Census data regarding housing supply characteristics will not be
released until mid-2002. Therefore, a majority of the housing supply information detailed below
is based on 1990 U.S. Census data.
Age and Condition
According to the 1990 U.S. Census, 58 percent of Yuba City’s housing units were built between
1950 and 1979. Of the remainder, the majority (25 percent of all housing units) were built from
1980 to 1990. The remaining 17 percent were built before 1950. The median year built for
residential structures was 1971 in Yuba City and 1967 in California overall; accounting for
current and programmed growth, Yuba City will continue to have a younger-than-average
housing stock.
The most recent inventory of housing conditions in Yuba City was published in 1989. Dwellings
were evaluated visually in terms of the condition of the foundation, roofing, siding, windows, and
doors. In that report, 26 percent of all housing units were identified as substandard to some
degree: half of those were in need of minor rehabilitation (structurally sound, but showing
deferred maintenance) and one percent of substandard units were dilapidated (all rated systems
need repair, compliance with Uniform Building Code not cost effective).
Within the redevelopment area, the proportion of substandard housing was more than twice as
high as in the overall City (58 percent). Units in need of at least moderate rehabilitation
(involving repair in more than one rated system) made up 33 percent of redevelopment-area
units, 2.5 times the citywide proportion. Relative proportions of substandard housing units in the
City and redevelopment area are shown in Table 3.5-2.

Many of the City’s older homes—any home built before 1978, but particularly those built before
1950—are at risk of containing lead-based paint. Lead can cause brain and nervous system
damage in young children who can ingest deteriorated interior or exterior lead-based paint either
intentionally or inadvertently through normal play activities. The Sutter County Health

Unit Size
Table 3.5-3 shows the distribution of Yuba City’s housing units by size of structure, according to
the 1990 U.S. Census. A majority of all housing units were single-family structures (51 percent) –
46 percent of all units were single family detached structures, while six percent were attached
single family homes (for example, duplexes or townhouses). Forty-four percent of all housing

3.6            SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
To ensure provision of adequate housing for all people, the City must consider the housing
available for those residents with special needs – disabled, female-headed households, large
families, seniors, and the homeless. Local shelter requirements for these special groups may point
to the need for “accessible”, larger or smaller, secure, and/or affordable housing.
Overcrowding
Overcrowding reflects the inability of families to afford larger homes. It is defined as more than
one person per room in a housing unit. The U.S. Census includes living rooms, dining rooms,
bedrooms, kitchens, finished attics and basements, recreation and family rooms, permanently
enclosed porches, and rooms used for offices in the definition of "room."

According to the 1990 U.S. Census, Yuba City had 905 housing units with more than one person
per room. This represented seven percent of all occupied units within the City. Overcrowded
units represented a much greater proportion of rental versus owner-occupied units, with 12
percent of all occupied rental units overcrowded compared with three percent of all owner-
occupied units. This disparity suggests that lower-income families who were unable to afford
larger homes were also more likely to rent housing.
Persons with Disabilities
The 1990 U.S. Census found that 16 percent (3,107 persons) of the City’s working age (16 years
and older) population had a work disability, over two-thirds of whom were prevented from
working by their disability. The 1990 U.S. Census also indicated that an additional 2.4 percent of
the City’s working age population had some kind of mobility limitation. Applying these
proportions to SACOG’s year 2020 population projections results in a disabled population of
approximately 9,500, as well as 1,450 people with mobility limitations, in the year 2020.
The special housing needs of disabled persons include accessible housing units in close proximity
to public services and commercial centers, with special design features that alleviate the disability.
State law requires that all rental apartments containing five or more dwelling units are made
accessible and adaptable to disabled persons. The City applies standard conditions of approval to
residential development projects that reflect this mandate. The FREED Center for Independent
Living in Marysville is a non-profit organization that promotes independent living for people
with disabilities. Its mission is to eliminate barriers to full equality for people with disabilities
through programs which promote independent living and effective systems changes, while
honoring dignity and self determination. In order to accomplish this mission they offer a variety
of services in Yuba and Sutter Counties, as well as Nevada County. The services range from
providing in-home assistance to providing free internet and computer access to providing used
wheelchairs and medical supplies to the disabled. The services available in Yuba and Sutter
counties include information and referral on products, services, equipment, training, legislation,
and civil rights; personal assistance services; advocacy services; peer support services; and
independent living skills training.
Because many disabled people are unable to work as a result of their disability, the availability of
housing affordable to Very Low, Low and Moderate income households is an important factor.
Within the City, there are approximately 70 beds in group homes and other facilities for the
disabled and mentally ill. The majority (55 beds) are located at Sierra Vista, a state-run skilled
nursing facility for the mentally disabled; the remainder (15 beds) are provided by Chestnut
Commons, a board and care facility for the physically disabled. Approximately nine percent of all
households on County’s Section 8 Housing Choices Voucher Program waiting list are disabled
households. FREED staff note that despite this concentrated need, existing low-income housing is
                                                                                               7
infrequently disabled-accessible and has little likelihood of being renovated and retrofitted.
Female-Headed Households
2000 U.S. Census data showed that ten percent of all households (1,285 households) in Yuba City
were headed by women with children under the age of 18. Female-headed households are
considered a special needs group because of the higher incidence of poverty in these households

                                               Yuba City Housing Element
as compared with all families. The U.S. Census Bureau uses a set of household income thresholds
that vary by family size and composition to determine who is poor. If a family’s total income is
less than that family’s threshold, then every member of that family is considered poor. In the year
2000, the estimated poverty threshold for a family of four was $17,760.
Of the estimated 1,480 female-headed families in 1990, 40 percent had household incomes below
the poverty level and nearly all of those had children under the age of 18. Comparatively, only 15
percent of all families in Yuba City had household incomes below the poverty level. Female-
headed households need housing affordable to Very Low and Low income families, in areas
suitable for child-rearing, and with access to transit networks, schools and parks, and daily
services.
Large Families-
In the year 2000, 13 percent of the total number of households in Yuba City contained five or
more people. Of these large households, approximately 47 percent were owner-occupied and 53
percent were renters (see Table 3.6-1). Applying the year 2000 proportion of large households to
SACOG’s year 2020 housing unit projection for Yuba City results in a total of approximately
7,800 large households in the year 2020.

Finding rental housing with higher than average bedroom counts is a typical problem for large
families, especially those with lower income levels. In Yuba City, only two percent of rental units
(126 units) had four or more bedrooms in 1990, and 13 percent (824 units) had three bedrooms.
According to year 2000 U.S. Census data, 936 renter households (13 percent) had five or more
people, indicating that overcrowding may be a problem for large households that rent. Of the 447
households that were on the County’s Section 8 Housing Choices Voucher Program waiting list
in January 2002, 13 percent (59 households) were large families.
Seniors
In 2000, seniors (persons age 65 or older) constituted 12 percent of Yuba City’s population, and
headed 20 percent of the City’s households. As shown in Table 3.6-2, the 2000 U.S. Census
estimated that approximately 68 percent of senior households lived in owner-occupied housing
units, and 32 percent lived in rentals. In comparison, a much greater proportion of the City’s
non-senior households (58 percent) rented their homes. Additionally, the 2000 U.S. Census
reported that most senior households in Yuba City are married-couple families (40 percent),
followed by female householders living alone (37 percent).

Seniors who own their own homes often have limited incomes, but substantial amounts of home
equity. While the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (the oldest and most popular government-
insured reverse mortgage) is available to homeowners 62 or older, there are no federally-certified
housing counseling agencies (HCAs) in Sutter County. The nearest HCAs are in Chico and
Sacramento, forty miles away to the north and south, respectively.
Seniors often have difficulty finding housing because of fixed incomes, limited mobility, and the
need for relatively easy access to health and convenience services. The Yuba City Senior Center
provides classes, programs, workshops, a library, general assistance and meal services to Yuba
City’s elderly population. More than 100 adults use the facility on a daily basis.
For those seniors who are no longer able to live independently for financial or physical reasons,
there are several shared or assisted living options available in Sutter County. Approximately 31
percent of Section 8 households are senior citizen households.
There currently are no subsidized senior board and care facilities in the City. Table 3.6-3 lists all
senior housing facilities located in Yuba City in 2001. These include three unsubsidized board and
care and three unsubsidized skilled nursing facilities, as well as six independent living facilities
ranging from unsubsidized to extremely low income-eligible. A total of 657 beds were available
within Yuba City in all senior housing facilities. Seventy-six of these units have been built since
1992: 28 at Town Center Senior Manor and 48 at The Courtyard.

Homeless
The causes of homelessness are diverse, but primary contributors include lack of affordable
housing, jobs with inadequate wages, substance abuse, mental or physical illness, and domestic
violence. There is no official count of homeless people in Yuba City. Specific resources and
facilities in Yuba City and Marysville attract persons with different kinds of needs.
The City facilitates the Yuba Sutter Homeless Consortium, a group of representatives from area
homeless service providers whose goal is to identify homeless needs in effort to provide
comprehensive services throughout the community. In August and September 2002 the
Consortium completed it’s first trial homeless data collection project that indicated nearly 450
persons who were homeless or at-risk of losing their housing in Yuba and Sutter Counties. The
Consortium will resume it’s homeless data collection in April 2003 and will use the data to plan
for adequate services and apply for additional funds that would be distributed amongst the
participants of the Consortium.
Shelters and transitional housing are the two types of housing programs for the homeless in Yuba
City. Shelters are available for local residents in need of emergency or long-term housing.
Transitional housing programs provide shelter to transients who typically only require emergency
or short-term housing (see Table 3.6-4).

The Consolidated Area Housing Authority of Sutter County provides long-term housing for
county residents, with a required preference to families or individuals meeting certain financial
requirements who suddenly become homeless due to disaster or eviction. However, this
requirement is not always able to be met. The Housing Authority’s units are nearly always
occupied, leaving little or no room for those who suddenly become homeless. Also the Housing
Authority mainly provides long-term housing as opposed to the short-term housing required by
disaster or eviction victims. Those seeking short-term assistance must go to one of the several
private, nonprofit organizations. The primary organizations providing such assistance locally are
the Christian Assistance Network, the Twin Cities Rescue Mission, the Salvation Army Depot
Family Crisis Center, Casa de Esperanza, and the Veteran’s Assistance Program.
The Sutter County Welfare Department also provides up to 28 days of housing for the homeless.
Yuba City has contracts with local motels in order to provide housing. The Sutter County Social
Services Department provides homeless shelter and assistance for up to 16 nights in local hotels.
They serve approximately 12 to 16 persons in Yuba City per month in the winter, fewer in the
summer.
The Christian Assistance Network (CAN) provides shelter and financial assistance to needy
families and individuals via referrals from area Christian churches on a one-time only basis. They
provide local motel rooms and rentals for a maximum stay of two weeks or financial assistance
equal to that of one month’s rent for victims of fire or eviction. CAN also provides temporary
shelter for transients for up to three days in area motels. Due to limited funds CAN often refers
requests for assistance to the Salvation Army.
The Twin Cities Rescue Mission provides shelter and meals for up to 5 days. They have a total of
44 beds but are reported to need more. In the cold months the shelter houses 45 to 50 people a

night and feeds an additional 50 to 55 people each day. The Mission is located in Marysville and is
supported by private donations.
Casa de Esperanza provides shelter for battered women and children. The shelter also provides a
crisis hotline for battered women. The shelter opened in 1977 and is the only shelter located in
Yuba City. They provide moderate-term housing extending to 60 days, with an average stay of 30
days. The shelter has 45 beds but admits anyone who is in need of help. Those who stay at the
shelter are typically considered to be low-income persons, however no one is turned away because
of financial status. The shelter is handicapped accessible and is partially funded through private
donations.
The Salvation Army Depot Family Crisis Center provides priority shelter for families and single
women for a maximum of six months. The capacity includes 12 rooms with a total of 58 beds for
low-income persons. The Center provides meals and is usually full. The Salvation Army Depot
Family Crisis Center also provides transitional housing for up to two years. The Center provides
one three-bedroom unit owned by the Housing Authority and managed by the Salvation Army.
The family receives both services and a Section 8 voucher.
Sutter Community Affordable Housing (SCAH), a local non-profit, provides five units of
transitional housing at the Yolo/Heiken Apartments. Occupants must be low-income and are
placed in transitional housing by referral; there is no waiting list. Occupants receive services and a
Section 8 certificate.
The House of Hope is a shelter for homeless men operated by Praise Chapel Church in Yuba City.
Occupants are allowed a maximum of four moths stay. The shelter has a total capacity of six
shelter beds.
The most recent developments in transitional housing include: The House of Ruth, developed by
Glad Tidings Church, to provide homeless women and children up to eighteen months stay in an
apartment complex managed by an on-site case worker; and Cooper Commons, a transitional
housing facility owned and operated by Community Resources & QuESt for use by homeless
persons with developmental disabilities for up to eighteen months.
Farm Workers
Sutter County’s economy has historically been based on agriculture and there is a great need to
provide housing to agricultural workers, who are often from low-income families that cannot
afford other rental housing. Despite trends toward farm mechanization over the past few decades,
the Housing Authority states that demand for farmworker housing has remained constant since
1990, with fluctuations mainly following changes in crops and poor growing years. Separate
housing projects have been developed for seasonal farmworker families, who reside permanently
in the Yuba City area (though individual workers may travel to other areas to work in the off-
season), and migrant workers, who only stay in the Yuba City area for part of the year.
According to the SACOG Regional Housing Needs Plan 2001, data from 1995-1996 indicates that
there are an estimated 6,564 migrant farmworkers and 7,613 seasonal farmworkers in Sutter
                                                 -20-

                                          Yuba City Housing Element
County, totaling 14,177 workers. Farmworker households (workers and nonworkers) comprise
                                 8
an estimated total of 25,228 people.
Providing housing for farmworkers in an urban environment raises unique concerns. Logistically,
workers might not have access to their own means of transportation and a balance must be found
between access to their worksites (outside the city) and access to services (most frequently within
the city). Politically, neighborhoods are often reticent to accommodate a large influx of assisted-
housing residents. The County and City are jointly responsible for providing housing to
farmworkers, and as both government and nonprofit sources state, a specific quantification of the
City’s allocation is impossible. The City and County will work in concert with each other, the
Housing Authority, nonprofits, and the farm industry to find and acquire suitable sites for
development.
The Consolidated Area Housing Authority of Sutter County maintains 180 Farmers Home rental
units of two-, three-, and four-bedroom farmworker housing in the City. Vacancy rates are
usually around two percent; the waiting list as of October 31, 2001, had 19 families. On July 17,
                                                            9
2002, the waiting list was estimated at four families. There is also a migrant farm labor project of
79 units in the SOI, owned by the State of California and operated by the Housing Authority for
up to six months a year. The Housing Authority does not officially keep track of vacancy for
migrant worker housing, but expects all units to be filled in 2002.
Mahal Plaza, within the city limits, was built by the nonprofit California Human Development
Corporation (CHDC) and includes 98 two-, three-, and four-bedroom units of rental housing
with high priority given to farmworker families. Ten units are accessible to persons with
disabilities. Mahal Plaza was completed in two phases, with 52 units opening in 1990 and the
remaining 46 units opening in 1997. Project funding is provided by USDA Rural Development
(which replaced the now-defunct Farmers Home Administration), the California Department of
Housing and Community Development, and the Housing Assistance Council. Waitlists are
organized by unit size, with smaller units generating more demand. On July 24, 2002, there were
20 families waiting for two-bedroom units, three families waiting for three-bedroom units, and
one family waiting for a four-bedroom unit. There is currently one four-bedroom unit vacant.
Non-farmworker families are also accepted, but at a lower priority; five non-farmworker families
                                       10
are currently in Mahal Plaza units.
All public- and nonprofit-owned farmworker housing in the Yuba City area is targeted to
farmworker families; the needs of single farmers are not explicitly addressed. While single
farmworkers have less opportunity to benefit from public and nonprofit housing, they do have
the advantage of higher mobility and are more likely to secure on-site housing.
Privately owned migrant quarters are maintained on individual farms in rural areas of the
County. The Sutter County Zoning Code allows on-site farm housing for workers employed on
the premises to be established without formal approval requirements by the Planning
Commission or the Board of Supervisors in agricultural areas. These units generally provide

housing for long-term farm employees. The number of these units is unknown, but may be
decreasing.
3.7            AT-RISK UNITS
As of 1991, five subsidized projects were at risk of conversion to market-rate. Since then, no new
projects have been added to the at-risk list. Table 3.7-1 lists the number of units and status of
each of these projects.
The owners of both the Peach Tree Terrace and Spencer Arms apartment complexes have chosen
to opt-out of renewing Section 8 project contracts to become market-rate housing. Peach Tree
Terrace (a 31-unit apartment complex) opted-out in November 2001; Spencer Arms (64 units)
will do so in September 2002. Current residents at Peach Tree Terrace have been given conversion
vouchers good through November 2002. At that time, eligible residents can receive an “enhanced
voucher,” which will cover the difference between the previous, affordable rent and the new fair
market rent (FMR), provided that the tenant family continues to contribute at least the amount it
                                                 12
was paying prior to the conversion. Once the local Housing Assistance program executes a
contract with the affected tenants, this action effectively conserves the units as affordable for those
tenants who decide to stay.
Live Oak and Sutter Village have renewed their Section 8 contracts for the next year and do not
indicate any probability of converting within the next five years. Consolidated Area Housing
Authority records show that only one unit at Live Oak is occupied by Section 8 tenants, and
                                                                13
Sutter Village currently has no Section 8 tenants.

3.8         ENERGY CONSERVATION
Conservation of energy has become an important issue in housing policy because of the rise in
energy costs over the last few decades. Energy bills may comprise a substantial portion of monthly
housing costs for both owners and renters. California’s most recent energy crisis has further
emphasized the need for conservation. The residential sector offers an opportunity to achieve
energy savings through conservation measures, awareness, and the application of appropriate
technology.
The City’s Building Division enforces California’s Energy Building Code (Title 24) through its
plan-checking process. These regulations establish minimum levels of wall, ceiling, and floor
insulation, maximum glazing area, minimum glazing U-values, and air conditioner and water
heating system efficiencies. The Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Yuba City’s primary energy
provider, also has a number of monetary incentive programs for energy conservation as well as
energy efficient home improvements. Information about these programs is distributed in
monthly billing statements from PG&E.
Energy conservation is also addressed through the City’s environmental review process. The
Negative Declaration or Environmental Impact Report for a development project identifies
energy impacts and, if necessary, requires mitigation measures to reduce energy consumption.

4 Land Inventory
This chapter describes existing residential development within the City, and analyzes the amount
of vacant land available for future housing development.
4.1             EXISTING LAND USES
The City of Yuba City contains approximately 2,243 acres of residential land. Comprising 40
percent of the City’s land area, residential areas consist primarily of single-family neighborhoods.
Yuba City also contains 3,350 acres of non-residential uses, representing 60 percent of the City’s
land area. Fourteen percent of the City’s land area consists of commercial and industrial uses,
while 13 percent is agricultural land. Table 4.1-1 summarizes existing land uses and their total
acreage.

Assisted Housing Supply
A Year 2000 Yuba City inventory of assisted rental and owner housing for Low and Moderate
income households reported that Yuba City contained 702 units of assisted rental housing (see
Table 4.1-2). These units are either owned by the Consolidated Area Housing Authority of Sutter
County (Housing Authority), owned by a nonprofit corporation and managed by the Housing
Authority, or are privately owned. The Housing Authority does not plan to build any more public
housing in the next five years—focusing instead on rehabilitation—but contingent on funding,
may propose around 100 moderate, low-income, and senior units for the latter half of the next
ten years.

4.2          OPPORTUNITY SITES
Table 4.2-1 shows the number of housing units in proposed projects and other vacant residential
sites greater than one acre in the City and its service area, arranged from north to south. Figure
4.2-1 shows their locations.
There were 13,912 housing units counted within Yuba City in the 2000 U.S. Census, a majority of
which are located in the northwest and south-central portions of the City. Since then, the Walton
Annexation has added a population of approximately 7,500 people to the southwestern City.
There are approximately 445 acres of vacant residential land at various planned densities within
the city limits. Much of this land is in parcels of less than one acre scattered throughout the City
and many of these parcels are likely to represent a single housing unit or duplex. There are also
158 vacant residential acres in the remainder of the Sphere of Influence.
An additional 920 housing units in eight residential development projects and 347 units in the
Harter Specific Plan are currently in the pipeline or under construction. The projects include 292
units projected for River Oaks East on the north side of Shanghai Bend Road, west of Garden
Highway, and 157 units at Masera Ranch on the north side of Lincoln Road, east of Sanborn
Road. While Town Center is currently an area undergoing development and a housing project
was recently built there, it is not zoned for residential development and no further residential
projects are proposed for the area.
While potential housing sites 4, 8, 9, 21, 22, and 23 are not within the current City limits, all
except #4 are connected to City infrastructure. Sites 8 and 9 are planned to be annexed soon and
the rest are likely to be annexed with the next five to ten years.
Using density assumptions based on current development, 4,175 housing units could be built on
the remaining major opportunity sites in and near the City. Combined with the Harter Plan and
proposed projects, this totals 5,382 potential new housing units in and around the City. Based on
the projects in the pipeline, present low density residential projects tend to cluster around 5
dwelling units per acre. This figure was used as an average for computing the potential for units
on sites not defined by projects approved. The average of 20 units per acre for medium-density
development is based on the Harter Specific Plan. High-density development is uncommon in
Yuba City; only one housing opportunity site (#11) is designated high-density and no projects
have yet been proposed for that site. Thirty units per acre was determined as a reasonable average
density with regard to surrounding development. This approach recognizes that development in
Yuba City has never occurred at maximum allowable densities, but allows for that possibility.
Low-income and assisted housing exists in many parts of Yuba City, with the majority being east
of Highway 99 and concentrated around the city center. New low-income units are most likely to
be located in the multiple-family opportunity sites (2b, 3b, 7, 9, 10b, 11, 13b, 15, 16, 19, 23b, 24,
and 25b), though some single-family sites without pipeline projects (such as 8, 14, 21, 22, 23a,
25a, 25c, 26, 27, and 30) can accommodate low-income single-family homes. The construction of
new moderate-income housing in current projects is also likely to free up older, less expensive
housing units for lower-income households as higher-income households move into newer
residences.
Medium- and high-density projects are pending or approved on sites 9, 10b, 25, and 25b. Site 9 is
a developed multifamily site that has recently been annexed that includes 66 units. Site 10b is part
                                                  -27-

of the Harter Specific Plan and is discussed below. Development applications have been
submitted for sites 24 and 25b. Site 24, “Graystone Manor”, proposes 20 age-restricted homes on
3 acres (6.66 units/acre). Site 25b, “River Oaks”, proposes a development intensity of 18
units/acre on it’s 9.8 acres. Developers remark that development will not occur for this site until
                                                                                              15
prevailing rental rates reach 90 cents/square foot; the break even point for development. A more
detailed discussion of rental rates in Yuba City is provided in Chapter 5, Housing Constraints and
Resources.
Specific Plans
Three current Specific Plans – the Buttes Vista Specific Plan , the Harter Specific Plan, and the
Central City Specific Plan – include proposals for the development of housing in Yuba City. Sites
1, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, and 3c are located in the Buttes Vista Specific Plan area; sites 10a and 10b are
located in the Harter Specific Plan area, and site 11 is located in the Central City Specific Plan site.
Buttes Vista Specific Plan
Housing sites in the Buttes Vista Specific Plan are predominately single family, low density. Sites
2b and 3b are medium density sites. No development applications have been submitted for these
two portions of the Specific Plan area, and the Plan contains no information with respect to
timing and phasing.
Several goals and policies are detailed in the plan that address multi-family housing development.
Goal 2, Objective A of the Specific Plan states “Promote a variety of housing types within the
neighborhood.” Goal 2, Objective A states “Encourage the design of multi-family housing that is
appropriately scaled, aesthetically pleasing and functional for a wide range of occupants.”
If applications for development in Buttes Vista are to be approved, consistency with the Specific
Plan must be shown and medium density housing will therefore be required. Medium-high
density housing, as defined in the Land Use section of the Yuba City General Plan, has a
development range of 12-36 units per gross acre. Requiring consistency with the Specific Plan and
with the Land Use and Housing Elements of the General Plan will insure a density of
approximately 20 units/acre on the areas designated as medium density.
Harter Specific Plan
The Harter Specific Plan site includes both single family, low density residential areas and multi-
family, medium density areas. 147 single family units are planned on 32.8 acres. 180 multi family
units are planned on nine acres. Timing and phasing will be based on market conditions and
demand. As private developers carry out the Harter Specific Plan, consistency with the Specific
Plan document and the Yuba City General Plan will be required, thereby insuring the
development of both single- and multi- family housing at the densities described in the plan.

Central City Specific Plan
The Central City Specific Plan site includes seven “Revitalization Action Areas” that have been
identified in central Yuba City. Area 4 “Residential Improvement Zone”, includes housing
opportunity Site 11. The strategy for this area, as described in the Specific Plan, is to “allow higher
residential densities” as “Proximity to Plumas Street, growth in Central City employment, and the
need for additional investment in the area make it logical for upzoning to a multi-unit or
townhouse density level. Additional population would support Downtown and address some of
the demand for residential development that would otherwise be supported on the City’s
perimeter.” The “Residential Areas” diagram included in the Specific Plan illustrates a 12
unit/acre minimum density requirement for portions of Site 11 and a 20 unit/acre minimum
density requirement for other portions of the site. A 45 unit/acre maximum permitted density
applies to the entire 6.7 acre site. As private developers continue to carry out the Central City
Plan, consistency with the Specific Plan document and the Yuba City General Plan will be
required, thereby insuring the development of both single- and multi- family housing at the
densities described in the plan. Design guidelines provided in the Specific Plan will help
encourage the development of the site at the higher end of the density range. Also, conditions
attached to Redevelopment Area funding incentives could also require the development of
densities in the 30 unit/acre range.
Farmworker Housing
The City encourages the development of farmworker housing in all residential zoning districts,
single family or multi-family. Processing procedures and development standards apply as they
would in any other residential development without any restrictions on the development of
farmworker housing. In addition, processing procedures are streamlined in effort to facilitate the
development process.

1 Net acreage is based on the allocation of land for new parks and the likelihood of development in outlying (southern) areas.
2 Average density is based on dividing number of planned units by project acreage for planned residential projects; for other sites, assumed densities are 5 units per acre in
  low-density areas, 20 units per acre in medium-density areas, and 30 units per acre in high-density areas, based on considerations in the text preceding the table.
3 Zoning Categories are as follows: R-1 = one-family, R-3 = multiple family, A-H = agricultural holding, M-1 = light industrial, C-1 = neighborhood convenience commercial,
  C-2 = community commercial, PF = public facilities; SP indicates a special plan area.
4 103.3 acres (98 net) out of total are multi-family residential.

5 Housing Constraints and Resources
This chapter describes the potential constraints applied by local, State, and federal governments,
the private market, and the natural environment to the expansion of the City’s housing supply.
Additionally, potential resources available through local, State, and federal programs are also
discussed.
5.1          GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS AND RESOURCES
Governmental constraints include the regulatory functions that are basic to the role of local
government; however, there is much debate about whether or not these regulations discourage
the availability of housing to people of all income levels. Several local, State, and federal housing
programs provide financial assistance to very low, low and moderate income households for
monthly housing costs, rehabilitation, and downpayment assistance.
Land Use Regulations
The land use categories of the City’s 1989 General Plan, and resultant residential zoning districts,
provide for residential growth at various density levels:
•   Low Density Residential. Single-family, duplex, mobile-home parks, and low-density cluster
    housing at 2-8 dwelling units per acre; intended to provide a spacious, open neighborhood.
•   Medium Density Residential. Residential development at 7-30 units per acre; allows for
    apartments, garden apartments, and condominiums. Intended to encourage a variety of
    multiple-family living environments.
•   High Density Residential. Multifamily residential development at 15-45 units per acre;
    includes uses such as condominiums, apartments, and senior citizen housing.
•   Urban Density Residential. For use in the Central City area, accommodating 12-45 units per
    acre, based on net acreage (discounting street area). Includes single-family developments and
    all forms of multi-family housing.
State of California housing law requires that where affordable housing is included in residential
developments (meaning that 20 percent of total units are designated for Low income households,
or 10 percent of total units designated for Very Low income households, or 50 percent of total
                                                                                         16
units for seniors), an equivalent density bonus of at least 25 percent must be granted.
Zoning requirements for setbacks, lot coverages, and parking are not perceived as a particular
constraint to housing development in Yuba City. A summary of development standards for the
City’s residential zoning districts is shown in Table 5.1-1.

    California Government Code §65915. This law only applies to developments consisting of five or more
    dwelling units.

Fees and Exactions
The City has established fees for building permits, planning, and engineering services for both single-
and multifamily developments. As shown in Table 5.1-2, development fees for a model single family
dwelling total approximately $14,085, and those for a model multifamily unit total approximately
$8,217. These costs are estimates of potential building, planning, and infrastructure fees.
A $30 fee for administrative site plan review is also imposed during the development application
process. The public works department levies the following fees for improvement plans:
      •   plan check and inspection fees (four percent of construction cost);
      •   map check fee ($300 per map);
      •   water connection fees ($2,456 single-family, assuming a one-inch pipe; $15,717 multi-family,
          assuming a two-inch pipe); and
      •
                                                                                        17
          sewer connection fees ($2,508 single-family; $2,257 per unit multi-family).
Infrastructure
The provision of on-site improvements, such as streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, landscaping,
drainage, water, and sewer infrastructure, are standard conditions of development approval. In many
cases, off-site improvements and/or mitigations may also be required, such as street widening and
installation of traffic signals, public utility easements, and flood control improvements. Infrastructure
costs are incorporated into the total residential development project costs discussed under Market
Constraints, below.
With the exception of Housing Opportunity Site #4, all potential housing sites have access to the
City’s water service infrastructure. Sewage can be handled through either the City’s sewer
infrastructure or individual septic tanks.
Development Review Process
Depending on the magnitude and complexity of the development proposal, the time which elapses
from application submittal to project approval may vary considerably. Factors which can affect the
length of development review on a proposed project include a rezoning or General Plan amendment
requirement, public meetings required for Planning Commission or City Council review, or a
required Negative Declaration or Environmental Impact Report (EIR).
All multi-family developments undergo a design review process as part of the permitting process;
developments of more than 25 units are also reviewed for environmental and land use aspects. For
multi-family developments staff has discretionary approval for up to twenty-five (25) units. Single
family projects can also be approved “over the counter” if the lots are already approved and
appropriately zoned. Design review is also discretionary within these parameters. For a typical single
family dwelling, permit processing time averages three weeks. Multi-family residential developments

processing time. These design review requirements simply ensures that projects are well-designed and
do not unduly delay project approval. As such, design review requirements are not perceived as a
barrier to new development. Consultation with the development community has confirmed this
assertion.

    Residential care homes for six or fewer residents (not counting owners, employees, and their families) are
permitted by right in all residential districts; those with seven to 12 residents are permitted by right in R-3 districts
and require only a conditional use permit in R-1 and R-2 districts.
                                                                    -36-

                                         Yuba City Housing Element
Emergency shelters and transitional housing require only a conditional use permit—which
necessitates only a period of 45 days for review and approval by the Planning Commission, regardless
of size—in R-3 districts. To encourage and facilitate the development of emergency shelters and
transitional housing, the City has a streamlined the process of obtaining a conditional use permit that
requires the completion of a use permit application and review by City staff prior to making a
recommendation to the Planning Commission. A public hearing will then be properly noticed and
held before the Planning Commission. At the close of the public hearing, the Planning Commission
has up to thirty (30) days to make a determination regarding the use permit application. Approval or
approval with conditions shall only be granted when it is determined that the proposal meets the
following conditions:
         a) consistent with the General Plan,
         b) the site is of adequate size and shape to accommodate said use,
         c) the streets serving the site can adequately accommodate the quantity of traffic generated
            by the proposed use,
         d) the design compliments neighboring facilities, and
         e) the proposed use will not be detrimental to the health, safety, peace and comfort of the
            persons residing or working in the vicinity of the proposed use.
This process ensures that all uses requiring a conditional use permit (emergency shelters and
transitional housing included) are developed in concert with other surrounding developments.
Yuba City’s zoning regulations do not specify for planned unit developments; rather, they allow for
the establishment of Planned Development (PD) districts, which are written to fit the particular
project. Plans must be submitted to the Planning Commission for review and approval.
 As previously mentioned, design review is discretionary for all multi-family developments to ensure
that the proposed design is consistent with the City’s design guidelines and development standards
for R-3 (Multiple-Family Residence) zoning districts. The design review process for a project runs
concurrently with the project review time frame. As stated above, a ministerial project of 25 or less
units can be approved in six weeks. Projects requiring approval by the Planning Commission or City
Council have additional review periods due to the public hearing process. The ultimate design
approval is given at the time the project is approved whether it be ministerally by staff or by the
Planning Commission or City Council.
The inclusion of design review as part of a project does not add to the overall cost of the project or
negatively affect the affordability of housing. Rather, design review makes for a more aesthetically
pleasing project for both the citizens viewing the project from the outside and for those that reside
within the project itself. For the two projects that have been recently reviewed under the design
guidelines no indication has been received that by adhering to good design the project cost was
adversely affected.

Building Code and Enforcement
The City has adopted the California Building and Fire Codes and the California Energy Efficiency
Standards as the basis of its building standards. The City has also adopted the Uniform Code for the
Abatement of Dangerous Buildings. Permits are required for all electrical and plumbing work, and
other major home improvements and modifications. Yuba City also requires the installation of
sprinklers for multi-family developments (three or more units).
In general, the City’s building codes represent basic construction standards within the State of
California and thus do not place an undue burden on the construction or rehabilitation of affordable
housing.
It may be costly to rehabilitate or remodel older buildings that were constructed under less stringent
building codes. The City’s Redevelopment Agency offers loan programs enabling owners of such
buildings to achieve modern building standards, yet still maintain affordability.
Reasonable Accommodation and Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Per California State Senate Bill 520, this Element must analyze potential and actual government
constraints specifically on the development of housing for persons with disabilities.The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) is supported at the state and local level; the City of Yuba City follows
State codes, which are more restrictive than federal codes.
Pursuant to complaint, housing units built after 1994—when the provisions of ADA were added to
the California Code—can be investigated by the City and required to make improvements meeting
                                                                                                                 19
accessibility standards. The City does not have an official provision for reasonable accommodation,
but staff report an informal policy to “do whatever possible to assist” persons with disabilities to have
access to housing, citing no previous zoning or regulatory problems relating to accommodations for
                             20
persons with disabilities. Retrofit requests require only a permit demonstrating that the plans for
                                                           21
modification are consistent with the zoning code.
The two types of specialized residential uses most tailored to the needs of persons with disabilities are
group residences (multiple detached units on one site) and residential care homes (a residential unit
employing caretakers for multiple residents). Group residences are allowed by right in R-3 zones.
Care homes serving six or fewer residents are permitted by right in all residential districts and in
agricultural holding (AH) districts; care homes serving 7 to 12 residents are permitted by right in R-3
and AH districts and require a use permit in R-1 and R-2 districts. There are no proximity restrictions
on the location of residential care homes.
A use permit for a residential care home is processed in the same manner as any other use permit,
with the same notification process. As previously mentioned, all use permit applications are subject to
a public hearing conducted by the Planning Commission; all owners of property within 300 feet of
the site are notified of the hearing 10 days in advance, pursuant to California Government Code §
19
   “Reasonable accommodation” in this case refers to modifications or exceptions to zoning laws and other land use
regulations which make it easier for persons with disabilities to gain access to housing.

65091(a)(3). The Commission’s decision may be appealed to the City Council. In approving group
residences and residential care homes, the City does not employ a particular set of approval
conditions, regardless of whether on-site services are provided.
Per the building code, 20 percent of units in new elevator-equipped apartment buildings with five or
more beds or units must be built adaptable for potential access for residents with disabilities; for non-
elevator buildings, 20 percent of first-floor units must be adaptable. All apartment buildings must
have an unobstructed path from the front door to a curbside public transit stop. By convention,
accessibility improvements to existing buildings work from the outside inward, beginning with entry
doors. Physical obstacles to building entrances in Yuba City tend to be minimal due to the flat
                           22
topography of the area.
All parking facilities in the City are at full compliance with ADA. Residential parking standards for
new residential uses are based on the type of dwelling unit. The Zoning Ordinance states that
“[h]andicapped parking and accessibility shall be provided in accordance with the standards
                                                                          23
established by the California State Handicapped Access Regulations.”
Yuba City has adopted the 1997 Universal Building Code and the 1998 California Building Code, but
has not adopted universal design elements in the Building Code at this time.
In conformance with the passage of SB 520, the City has evaluated its zoning code, building code, and
permit processing procedures for compliance with ADA guidelines. Using the SB 520 Analysis Tool,
staff found no significant barriers to the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for
persons with disabilities. Answers to the questions contained in the analysis tool are kept on file and
will be periodically updated as required.
Redevelopment Agency
The Yuba City Redevelopment Agency currently has $1,561,456 in its Low and Moderate Income
Housing (LMIH) Fund, with inflows generated largely by the Housing Set-Aside and supplementarily
by investment earnings and other government revenue. Based on current projections, in the next five
years the Agency estimates that an additional $1.0 million will be generated for the LMIH Fund. The
total amount of low and moderate housing set-aside revenues between years 2000 and 2004,
comprised of annual tax increment revenues plus interest earning, is projected at approximately $1.6
          24
million.
During the next five-year planning period, the twenty-percent set-aside funds in the LMIH will be
used for administration and one or more of the following:
•     Single-family rehabilitation, with housing and CDBG funds provided in exchange for deed
      restrictions for occupancy by very low, low, and moderate income households,
•     Multifamily residential rehabilitation; funds in exchange for deed restrictions for very low and
      low income households,

     homebuyer assistance), or
•    A down payment assistance program for low and moderate income households purchasing single
     family homes or condominiums.
State redevelopment law requires that any new or substantially rehabilitated housing which is assisted
                                                                                                           25
by Agency funds must remain affordable for the longest time feasible, but not less than 30 years for
rental housing and 10 years for owner-occupied housing. A shorter affordability duration is
permitted for owner-occupied housing if the Redevelopment Agency recoups its LMIH investment
when an assisted owner-occupied unit is sold at a non-affordable price or to a non-qualifying buyer.
Section 8 Housing Choices Voucher Program
The Section 8 rental voucher and rental certificates programs are intended to assist Very Low income
families in renting safe and sanitary housing. Currently, the federal government is consolidating the
two separate programs into a single Housing Choices Voucher Program. Under the Housing Choices
Voucher Program, the Very Low income household is responsible for finding appropriate housing
within the private market. Families who receive vouchers can select units with rents that are either
below or above market rate. The federal government’s Housing and Urban Development Department
(HUD) mandates that voucher recipients must pay 30 percent of their monthly adjusted gross
income for rent and utilities. HUD, through the local Housing Authority, then pays the remainder of
the rent directly to the landlord. If the household chooses a unit where costs are greater than market
rate, the voucher recipient is expected to pay the additional amount. Fiscal Year 2002 HUD-
established fair market monthly rents for Sutter County are $348 for studios, $407 for one-bedroom
units, $522 for two-bedroom units, $728 for three-bedroom units and $842 for four-bedroom units.
Within Yuba City, there are 35 low-income units at the Live Oak Apartment complex reserved
specifically for households with Section 8 vouchers. The apartment complex manager states that 103
families are on the waitlist for both one- and two-bedroom apartments, and the list has not moved in
                                                                                                26
the past three years due to current residents’ strong preference to stay in the complex. While many
other housing projects have Section 8 contracts, they are not specifically reserved for voucher holders.
As of March 31, 2002, the Consolidated Area Housing Authority reported 205 households on the
                                                                                             27
County’s Section 8 housing waiting list, with an average wait of three to six months. Approximately
739 vouchers are available Countywide, and average yearly turnover is 200 households. The Authority
will continue to apply for more certificates whenever they are available, with an ongoing goal of
adding 25 per year. During 2001, the Housing Authority received 134 new certificates.
Additional Funding Sources for Affordable Housing
Both the State and federal governments provide financial resources to local governments and non-
profit organizations to assist with affordable housing:

Federal Resources
•   Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). Annual direct grants provided to metropolitan
    areas and urban counties to revitalize neighborhoods, expand affordable housing opportunities,
    and/or improve community facilities and services. The grants are aimed to benefit Low and
    Moderate income persons, and are used to partially fund the City’s housing rehabilitation
    program. Yuba City received approximately $540,000 in CDBG funds this fiscal year and expects
    to receive $2.5 million in CDBG funds over the next five years.
•   HOME Investment Partnerships Program. Federally funded program for use by the State for
    housing rehabilitation, tenant-based rental assistance, assistance to homebuyers, housing
    acquisition, and new housing construction. Yuba City received approximately $1,000,000 in
    HOME funds in 1998 and $500,000 in 1999 ($200,000 in HOME program income is available as
    well) and uses these funds for its first-time homebuyer, housing rehabilitation, and multifamily
    development programs. Although the City expects to receive HOME funds over the next five
    years, no dollar estimate has been made.
•   Homeless Assistance Technical Assistance. Aims to provide technical assistance to promote the
    development of housing and supportive services as part of the Continuum of Care approach, and
    to enable homeless persons to live as independently as possible.

    developed Continuum of Care systems to assist homeless persons to move to self-sufficiency and
    permanent housing.
•   USDA Rural Housing Service. Includes the Section 502, 523, 504, and 521 programs which
    provide loans and grants for home purchases as well as repair and rehabilitation. Also included is
    financing assistance for developers of low-income multifamily housing.
State Resources
To ensure that lack of housing for California’s work force does not derail economic activity in the
State, the Davis administration has proposed new State housing programs including:
•   Interregional Partnership State Pilot Project. Provides grants to interregional consortia of two or
    more governments, two or more subregions within a multicounty council of governments, or a
    county working collaboratively with the State or federal government, to develop, evaluate and
    implement policies and incentives to mitigate current or future imbalances of jobs and housing.

                                        Yuba City Housing Element
    Grants may be used for development of implementation plans, to promote jobs in residential
    communities and housing in “job rich” communities.
•   Supportive Housing Initiative Act (SHIA). Administered by the Department of Mental Health,
    this program is state funded and provides for local governments and non-profit organizations. It
    focuses on integrating affordable housing with supportive services for persons with disabilities.
•   Housing Enabled by Local Partnerships (HELP). Administered by the California Housing
    Finance Agency to local governments, HELP aims to provide affordable housing opportunities
    through program partnerships with local governments.

•   California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (TCAC) Program. Offers tax credits which enable
    developers of affordable rental housing to raise project equity through the “sale” of tax benefits to
    investors. Supplements a federal tax credit program administered by the IRS.
5.2          MARKET CONSTRAINTS
Market constraints significantly affect the cost of housing, and can pose barriers to housing
production and affordability.
Vacant/Underdeveloped Land
The availability of vacant land does not appear to be a constraint on future development in Yuba
City. There are 800 acres of vacant land within the city limits and 185 more in the unincorporated
SOI, along with a large amount of agricultural land that may be rezoned for residential development
in the future. One concentration of vacant land in the city limits, on either side of the Garden
Highway south of Bogue Road, surrounds existing single-family development and is likely to be
developed as such.
Residential Land and Site Development Costs
Due to the wide availability of land in the Yuba City area, developers do not compete for new
properties; land is much cheaper on average than in the rest of the State.
                                                    -42-

                                       Yuba City Housing Element
According to Valley Development, land costs for single-family housing are about $60,000 per acre in
the northern City (where much construction is currently taking place); at 4 to 5 units per acre, land
costs average $12,000 to $15,000 per lot. Site work (grading and other infrastructure improvements)
would total approximately $20,000 for a 1,900 square foot house. The cost of a finished site
(including grading, street paving, and other pre-construction improvements) makes up less than 20
percent of total development costs.
Due to the infrequency of multi-unit/apartment construction in the City, there is little data available
regarding multi-unit costs. The California Human Development Corporation, which built the 98-
unit, 7.9-acre Mahal Plaza, reports that their total land cost was $310,000, or about $3,160 per unit,
representing approximately 4 percent of the total development costs.
Construction and Soft Costs
Valley Development states that construction costs average around $50 per square foot for single
family homes. Total construction costs for a 1,900 square foot single-family house average about
$80,000 (see Table 5.2-1). Soft costs (permitting fees, etc.) are somewhat less dependent on the size of
the unit, averaging about $13,000 plus $2 per square foot for school fees.
While there are no exact figures for multifamily construction costs available, the R.S. Means
QuickCost Calculator estimates total project costs for a low-rise 20,000-square foot apartment
complex in the Marysville area to be $1.74 million overall, including $173,000 of site work.
Without subsidies, new single-family residences may be unaffordable to very low and low income
households. However, because of lower land and construction costs, some new rental and for-sale
multifamily units may even be affordable to some low income households. Reductions in amenities
and lower-quality building materials can reduce sales and rental prices, but minimum building and
safety standards must be maintained. In certain cases, greater density can increase the affordability of
residential projects by reducing per-unit costs.
Availability of Financing
Residential developers generally do not encounter difficulty in obtaining financing for projects in the
City. Financing costs currently contribute about $30,000 to $40,000 toward the price of a single-
family home.
Current interest rates for home loans are between six and seven percent, depending on the terms of
down payment. In general, credit-worthy buyers in Yuba City do not have difficulty obtaining loans.
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data for 1997 through 2000 indicate that Yuba City residents have
about the same rates of home purchase loan approval as other Sutter County residents, though the
rate of approvals for home improvement is slightly lower.
It can be difficult for Very Low, Low, and Moderate income first-time homebuyers to acquire
sufficient savings and income to pay for a downpayment, closing costs, monthly mortgage, and tax
and insurance payments. To address this problem, Yuba City administers the First Time Homebuyer
Program (FTHB), a special low-interest, deferred-payment loan program designed to provide “silent”
second mortgages of up to $35,000, funded by the Home Investment Partnerships Program.
Applicants must demonstrate financial need and pre-approval for a first mortgage; the second
mortgage will be financed as a three-percent-interest, 30-year deferred loan payment. The
                                                  -43-

                                           Yuba City Housing Element
Consolidated Area Housing Authority’s Mortgage Credit Certificate program ended in 1997, due to a
decrease in allocations from the state. The Housing Authority could no longer afford to run the
program; by its final year of the program, the Authority was only able to distribute three certificates
per year. Sutter County elected to focus on the FTHB program, which operates through a fund
pooled by several counties in the region.
The City of Yuba City Housing Rehabilitation Program, funded through the Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) and State HOME Funds, distributes loans to low-income owner-
and tenant-occupied households to achieve cost-effective repairs. Priority is accorded to health and
safety needs, followed by energy conservation needs, extension of the unit’s useful life, and converting
to the Uniform Building Code. The maximum loan amount is $40,000 for non-mobile units and
$7,500 for mobile homes. Costs will be financed as a three-percent-interest amortized loan for owner-
occupied properties; owner-investors will be offered five-percent fixed rate loans amortized for 15
years. Units must remain affordable for five years after rehabilitation.
Rental Housing in Yuba City
While the City is currently in the process of conducting its Annual Apartment Survey, preliminary
data estimates a near zero percent vacancy rate with rental rates increasing by as much as 20% since
April 2000. This data validates the need for additional multi-family units in Yuba City. With no new
market rate rental housing built in over eleven years, Yuba City will continue to rely upon rental
housing rehabilitation programs to maintain the condition of its current housing stock. Rental
subsidy programs will also continue to be used locally to assist tenants with rising costs for rent.
Cost Summary for a Typical Single-Family Home
Based on the example of a 1,900 square foot house built on a vacant lot in northern Yuba City, Valley
Development suggested approximate development costs for a $189,000 home, as presented in Table
5.2-1. While much of the City’s development is occurring to the north, land in this part of the City is
generally more costly than in other regions.
According to the Housing and Redevelopment Department, pre-financing costs (land, site
development, construction, and soft costs) average $77 per square foot for single family homes, and
                                                                  28
average $65 per square foot for multi-family developments. Based on the single-family estimates
from Valley Development, these costs average about $70 per square foot in the northern City.

5.3              ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Environmental phenomena such as flooding and seismicity present a minor constant risk to Yuba
City, but are not considered constraints to housing development. Nowhere in the City is development
precluded; environmental constraints can be mitigated through appropriate residential design.
Flooding
Structural flood management methods provide the primary defense against flooding in Sutter
County. Flood management in the County includes a series of reservoirs, levees, and bypasses
                                                       29
completed between the 1920s and 1960s. Levees and earthen embankments are the most commonly
used methods of containing high water levels along the Sacramento and Feather Rivers. A bypass
system running from the Sutter Buttes southeast through Sutter County accommodates additional
                                                                                                              30
flows in times when the capacity of the Sacramento River levee system is exceeded. The Sacramento
River can flow directly into the Sutter Bypass by way of two free-flow weir structures. The Feather
River drains the eastern portion of the Sacramento Valley from Oroville to just south of its
                                           31
confluence with the Bear River.
The most significant risk from flooding in the Yuba City SOI results from the potential for dam or
levee failure. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating the levees along the Sacramento and
                                                                                  32
Feather Rivers to increase the level of flood protection. Improvements associated with this
evaluation are underway, as listed in Table 5.3-1. Approximately 20,000 parcels and upwards of $1
billion in property would be impacted by a failure in the levee system.

Geologic and Seismic Hazards
No active earthquake faults are known to exist in Sutter County, although active faults in the region
could produce ground motion in Yuba City. Earthquakes of M5.0 or greater have occurred on fault
systems in the region, including the San Andreas. Approximately 15 miles west of Sutter County, the
                                                                                                                     33
Central Valley Blind-Thrust Fault is known to have caused an estimated M6.5 earthquake in 1892.
In addition, two earthquakes of M4.0 and M4.9 occurred between 1900 and 1974 with epicenters near
Williams. The Foothills Suture Zone along the western slope of the Sierra Nevada is also considered
active, with a M5.7 earthquake occurring in 1975 in the northern portion of the Zone in Butte
           34
County.
Potentially active faults do exist in Sutter County in the area of the Sutter Buttes. These faults are
                                                                                                                  35
small and have exhibited activity in the last 1.6 million years, but not in recent history (200 years).
Potential hazards related to major earthquakes include ground shaking, surface rupture along the
fault zone, and related secondary ground failures. Typical seismically-induced ground failures include
liquefaction, lateral spreading, and ground lurching. Liquefaction is the temporary loss of cohesion in
saturated, granular soils. Lateral spreading is the horizontal movement of loose, unconsolidated
sedimentary deposits and imported fill material. Lurching is the horizontal movement of soil,
sediments or fill found on steep slopes and embankments. All of these secondary ground failures
could cause major structural damage to existing buildings, including tilting or settlement of
foundations, twisting and breaking of structural building components, debris shedding, and
potentially even collapse of buildings. In the case of seiches, damage to levees and dams could be
significant. However, since the potential for ground shaking in Sutter County is low to moderate, it is
unlikely that subsequent ground failure would occur in Yuba City.
Existing structures in the SOI could be affected by the types of earthquake-induced effects listed
above, but to varying degrees based on length, intensity, and distance of the earthquake from a given
building. New structures are required to adhere to current California Uniform Building Code
(CUBC) standards, providing adequate design, construction and maintenance of structures to
prevent exposure of people and structures to major geologic hazards. In particular, any critical
facilities such as hospitals, fire and police stations, and emergency communications and operations
centers must be adequately designed, constructed and maintained with the goal of remaining

Objective 2F. Develop an energy-efficient housing program.
Policy 2F-1. Yuba City shall encourage the use of energy efficient materials and technology
           in new construction.
2F-1a     Conduct a study and develop recommendations on        Yuba City enforces minimum State energy codes
          energy conservation technologies and programs.        pursuant to Title 24. An energy conservation
                                                                study has not been performed.
The majority of objectives set out by the City in 1991 were met, with notable achievements in
assisting low-income homebuyers (implementation 2D-4a), developing a dedicated housing specialist
position (1B-1a through -1e), constructing and rehabilitating rental housing (1B-1f), and funding
neighborhood improvements (1B-1g). Supporting an increase of 25 units for Section 8 per year (2B-
1b) generated 194 units for the period from 1993 to 2001. A few policies were not implemented as
planned; identifying areas of deterioration (1A-1a) was covered by a 1989 independent report, and
allowing emergency shelters by right (1C-3a) was discarded in favor of conditional use.
Some policy implementations were not acted upon due to lack of interest or necessity. These include
estimating vacant residential land in the City (2A-1a), facilitating elderly homesharing (2A-3a),
supporting Article 34 referendums (2B-1a), and regulating mobile home park conversion (2C-1a).
It is the City’s perception that lessons learned from the 1991 Element inform the structure and
content of the 2002 housing program. Ongoing policies deemed successful or indispensable have
been retained for the new housing program, whereas policies that do not work or clearly are of no use
have been eliminated. Nonetheless, policies that led to no action are not necessarily inappropriate—
support for Article 34 referenda is a constant value, whereas taking action hinges on plans for
development that remain outside the City’s purview. Overall, the City’s 1991 housing program was
well-directed and favorable for advancing the quality of the City’s housing stock.

7 Quantified Objectives
7.1            REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS DETERMINATION
State law establishes that regional councils of government shall identify for each city and county its
“fair share allocation” of the most recent regional housing needs determination. For its most recent
Regional Housing Needs Determination (RHND), which was released in May 2001, SACOG took
into consideration several factors: market demand for housing; type and tenure of housing supply;
employment opportunities; commuting patterns; availability of suitable residential sites and public
facilities; loss of assisted multifamily units; avoiding further concentration of lower income
households; and special housing needs. Needs are assessed for the period from 2000 through 2007. In
turn, cities and counties must address these local shares of regional housing in their General Plan
Housing Elements.
State law also requires that regional housing needs determinations consider the need for housing at all
income levels. SACOG uses Yuba-Sutter bi-county averages to determine the proportion of housing
within each income level. Table 7.1-1 shows the distribution of housing needs by income level for
Yuba City. The income categories used are described in the preceding discussion of Housing
Affordability.

7.2            QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
Due to the abundance of vacant land in and near Yuba City (see Table 4.2-1), site-specific
development is not a concern for meeting housing goals. Yuba City’s strategy for meeting its Regional
Housing Needs Determination is focused on providing the number of units in each income category
though a combination of quantified objectives for the Housing Element Action Program (see Chapter
8) and housing already produced during the Interim Planning period.
As stated in the SACOG Regional Housing Needs Plan, new housing units approved or constructed in
the Interim Planning period (January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2002) can be credited toward a jurisdiction’s
RHND. Table 7.2-1 displays the number of units constructed, rehabilitated, and newly made
affordable via housing assistance programs throughout calendar year 2001.

The quantified objectives in the Yuba City Housing Element Action Program will result in over 800
new affordable housing units, of which 275 will be affordable to Very Low Income Households, and
557 will be affordable to Low Income Households. Another 334 affordable units will be provided
either through housing rehabilitation or housing assistance programs. These objectives will meet
SACOG’s RHNP allocation targets.
Table 7.2-2 summarizes the quantified objectives for the 2002 Housing Element. It includes new and
rehabilitated units, as well as assisted housing units for low income households based on policy and
program objectives contained in the Housing Element Action Program. It also includes the number
of units that can be produced based on the housing opportunity sites identified within the City.

8 Housing Program, 2002-2007
The following policies and actions provide a systematic program for achieving Yuba City’s fair share
of regional housing needs, maintaining the existing housing stock, providing affordable housing,
facilitating the production of a wide range of housing types, and facilitating the incorporation of
energy efficient materials and technology in new and existing housing units. Each implementing
action contains a specific objective and identifies a timeline, responsible agency, and resources for the
accomplishment of that objective.
H-A       Provide incentives and programs to insure the maintenance of safe
          and sanitary housing with adequate public services for existing and
          future residents of the City.

9 Glossary
Accessible: Used to describe housing that has special design features that help to alleviate physical
disabilities. Such features include ramps, hand railings, lifts, special handles and other modifications.
Affordable Housing: Housing capable of being purchased or rented by a household with very- low-,
low-, or moderate-income, based on a household’s ability to make monthly payments necessary to
obtain housing. Housing is considered affordable when a household pays less than 30% of its gross
monthly income for housing, including utilities.
Area Median Family Income: This is defined by federal law and U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) regulations as the higher of (1) the metropolitan area or non-
metropolitan county median family income; or (2) the statewide nonmetropolitan median family
income. The median income calculations are based on a family of four persons. Income categories are
based on the HUD-determined area median family income. (See “Income Categories.”) New area
median family income figures are published yearly by HUD and by the State Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD).
Assisted Housing: Dwelling units for which some type of public financial assistance (to pay for
housing costs) is provided to the occupant.
Assisted Living Facility: Residential facilities designed for persons needing assistance with daily living
activities. Generally, room, board and personal care is provided.
Below-Market-Rate Housing Unit: Any housing unit specifically priced to be sold or rented to low-
or moderate-income households for an amount less than the fair-market value of the unit. The U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development sets standards for determining which households
qualify as “low-income” or “moderate-income”.
Board and Care Home: In California, these are also called Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly
(RCFE). Although skilled nursing staff may be available, these are not medical facilities. Instead, they
provide assistance with daily living for persons age 60 or older who are no longer able to live
independently. A facility can be from one bed to several hundred beds in capacity. Small one- to six-
bed facilities may be located in residentially zoned areas without a special permit and are considered
in all respects to be the same as family dwellings (California Health and Safety Code Section
1568.0831(a)(2)). RCFEs are under the guidance of the California Department of Social Services
Community Care Licensing division.
California Environment Quality Act (CEQA): A State law requiring State and local agencies to
regulate activities with consideration for environmental protection. If a proposed activity has the
potential for a significant adverse environmental impact, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR)
must be prepared and certified as to its adequacy before taking action on the proposed project. (See
“Environmental Impact Report (EIR).”)
California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA): A State agency, established by the Housing and Home
Finance Act of 1975, which is authorized to sell revenue bonds and generate funds for the
development, rehabilitation, and conservation of low- and moderate-income housing.

Department of Housing and Urban Development on a formula basis for entitlement communities,
and by the State Department of Housing and Community Development for non-entitled
jurisdictions.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): A 24-hour energy equivalent level derived from a
variety of single-noise events, with weighting factors of 5 and 10 dBA applied to the evening (7:00
p.m. to 10:00 p.m.) and nighttime (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) periods, respectively, to allow for the
greater sensitivity to noise during these hours.

Density Bonus: The allocation of development rights that allow a parcel to accommodate additional
square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the parcel is zoned,
usually in exchange for the provision or preservation of an amenity at the same site or at another
location. The State regulates the types of development that are entitled to a density bonus. Two
examples are (1) a housing development that provides 20% of its units for lower income households;
and (2) 10% of its units for very low-income households. (See “Developable Rights, Transfer of.”)
Density: The number of residential dwelling units per acre of land. Densities specified in the General

implemented by the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation C. This regulation provides the public with
loan data that can be used to determine whether financial institutions are serving the housing needs
of their communities and to identify possible discriminatory lending patterns. Certain lending
institutions must report loan data, such as the number of loans that applied for, approved, denied or
withdrawn, on a regular basis.

                Implementation and Monitoring
The General Plan provides specific policy guidance for implementation of plan concepts in each of
the Plan elements. This framework establishes a basis for coordinated action by the City, adjacent
jurisdictions, Sutter County and regional agencies. This chapter describes the process in general
terms and the major actions to be undertaken by the City; the implementing policies in each element
of the Plan provide details that will guide program development and program development.
The major implementation process for the land use proposals will be administration of the Zoning
Ordinance through the Zoning Map. The Zoning Ordinance will need to be amended to be
consistent with the General Plan's policies.
The Capital Improvement Program will be the primary means of scheduling and funding
infrastructure improvements of city-wide benefit. Based on the recommendations made in the
General Plan, a new Impact Fee analysis will be required in order to determine the level of impact fees
to be charged to developers. Special assessment districts or other means of financing improvements
benefiting specific areas, such as Mello-Roos Community Facilities Districts or Infrastructure
Financing Districts, may also be used. The Yuba City Redevelopment Agency also will participate in
funding infrastructure improvements needed to carry out the General Plan.
In many areas, General Plan implementation will depend on actions of other public agencies and of
the private sector, which will fund most of the development expected to occur in the Planning Area.
The General Plan will serve a coordinating function for private sector decisions; it also provides a
basis for action on individual development applications, which must be found to be consistent with
the General Plan if they are to be approved.
10.1 RESPONSIBILITIES
Implementing the General Plan will involve the City Council, the Planning Commission, Parks and
Recreation Commission, other City boards and commissions, and City departments. The City also
will need to consult with Sutter County and other public agencies about implementation proposals
that affect their respective areas of jurisdiction. The principal responsibilities that City officials and
staff have for Plan implementation are briefly summarized below; details on their powers and duties
are in the Yuba City Municipal Code.
•    City Council. The City Council is responsible for the overall management of municipal affairs; it
     acts as the legislative body and is responsible for adoption of the General Plan and any
     amendments to the General Plan. The City Council appoints the City Manager who is the chief
     administrator of the City and has overall responsibility for the day-to-day implementation of the
     Plan. The City Council also appoints the Planning Commission and other commissions
     established under the Municipal Code.
     The City Council's role in implementing this General Plan will be to set implementation priorities
     and approve zoning map and text amendments, consistent with the General Plan, and develop a
     Capital Improvement Program and budget to carry out the Plan.
                                                    10-1

                                      Yuba City General Plan Update
•   Planning Commission. The Planning Commission is responsible for preparing and
    recommending adoption or amendment of the General Plan, zoning and subdivision ordinances
    and other regulations, programs and legislation needed to implement the General Plan. The
    Planning Commission also may prepare and recommend adoption of specific plans,
    neighborhood plans or special plans, as needed for Plan implementation. The Planning
    Commission will have the authority to approve many of the private development projects
    proposed subsequent to this General Plan and will assure project consistency with this General
    Plan.
•   Parks and Recreation Department. The parks and recreation department will be responsible for
    the implementation of park policies and the development of new park facilities.
•   Community Development Department. The Community Development Department is
    responsible for the general planning, building inspection and community development functions
    undertaken by the City. The Department is responsible for updating the zoning code and map
    and for developing new impact fees. Specific duties related to General Plan implementation
    include reviewing development applications, conducting investigations and making reports and
    recommendations on planning and land use, zoning, subdivisions, architectural review,
    development plans and environmental controls. The Department also will coordinate activities
    related to school sites and parks in consultation with Yuba City Unified School District (YCUSD),
    Franklin/Sutter School District and the Parks and Recreation Department. Finally, the
    department will have the primary responsibility for preparing the annual report on the General
    Plan and conducting the five-year review. These reporting requirements are described in Chapter
    1.
•   Public Works Department. The Public Works Department is responsible for all public works in
    the City, including streets, water, sewer, and drainage facilities. Specific implementation
    responsibilities are defined in the Transportation, Public Facility, Environmental Conservation,
    and the Safety elements of the General Plan.
•   Fire and Police Departments. Within the City, responsibility for public safety is shared by the Fire
    and Police departments. The Fire Department is responsible for protecting life and property
    from fire hazards and other emergencies, and the Police Department is responsible for preventing
    crime and maintaining law and order. Specific implementing responsibilities under the General
    Plan are established in the Noise & Safety Element of the General Plan.
•   Other Commissions. Other City commissions will also be involved in Plan implementation in
    their respective areas of expertise. The General Plan does not envision any substantive change in
    the responsibilities assigned to existing commissions. They will be administering new or
    amended regulations adopted pursuant to Plan policies, and their actions will need to be
    consistent with the General Plan.
10.2 THE PLAN AND THE REGULATORY SYSTEM
The City will use a variety of regulatory mechanisms and administrative procedures to implement the
General Plan. First and foremost, the City is required to have the Zoning Ordinance consistent with
the General Plan. This consistency requirement is the keystone of Plan implementation. Without a
consistency requirement, there is no assurance that Plan policies will be implemented. Other
regulatory mechanisms, including subdivision approvals, building and housing codes, capital
improvement programs and environmental review procedures, also will be used to implement Plan
policies.
                                                   10-2

                                                Implementation and Monitoring
ZONING REGULATIONS
The City's Zoning Ordinance will translate plan policies into specific use regulations, development
standards and performance criteria that will govern development on individual lots. The General
Plan establishes the policy framework, while the Zoning Ordinance prescribes specific rules and
procedures for development. The Zoning Map also will provide more detail than the General Plan
Diagram.
Table 10-1 shows which zoning districts in the existing ordinance are consistent with land use
classifications on the Plan Diagram, assuming the district regulations are amended to reflect Plan
policies.
This table will be modified as the Zoning Ordinance is revised, consistent with the Plan's
implementation program. The General Plan calls for several new zoning districts, which are listed
separately in the table in boldface font. District names and references also may be changed when the
Zoning Ordinance is revised to avoid confusion with prior designations.
The use regulations and development standards for existing zoning districts will need to be amended
to conform to Plan policies. Density and intensity limits, consistent with the land use classifications,
also need to be updated.

The City should bring zoning into conformance with the General Plan within a reasonable period of
time. When the General Plan is amended, the Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map also may need to
be amended to maintain consistency between the Plan and zoning.
                                                                  10-3

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
No subdivision of land may be approved under California law and the City's subdivision regulations
unless its design and proposed improvements are found to be consistent with the General Plan.
Dedication of land for park facilities is required for subdivisions above a certain size, consistent with
the policies and standards prescribed by the General Plan. The subdivision regulations also should
require dedication of land for riparian habitat and reservation of land for fire stations, libraries,
schools and other public facilities.
After adoption of the General Plan, the City's subdivision regulations should be amended to conform
to Plan policies and explicitly require findings of consistency with the General Plan as a condition of
approving tentative subdivision maps, parcel maps and minor land divisions.
FEES
The City’s fees for development should be updated following Plan adoption. The General Plan also
anticipates that the City will utilize in lieu fees for parkland dedication, consistent with the Quality
Act.
BUILDING AND HOUSING CODES
No building permit may be issued under California law unless the proposed development is
consistent with the City's open space plan and conforms to the policies of the Open Space and
Conservation Element. To provide an administrative mechanism to ensure consistency, it may be
appropriate to require applicants for building permits and grading permits to secure a "zoning
certificate" or other form of zoning clearance before these permits can be issued.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS
The Capital Improvements Program (CIP) includes a list of public works projects that the City
intends to design and construct in coming years. Under California law, the Planning Commission
has responsibility for reviewing the CIP to determine whether it conforms to the General Plan.
Specifically, the Government Code requires the Commission to review the following actions for
conformity with the General Plan:
•   Acquisition of land for public purposes;
•   Disposition of land;
•   Street vacations; and
•   Authorization or construction of public buildings or structures.
The Planning Commission has 40 days to comment on such actions, and under state law, the
Commission's recommendations are advisory only; the City Council may overrule the Commission.
The Planning Commission also has the right to comment on CIPs prepared by the school districts.
These CIPs, and any annual revision proposed to them, are to be forwarded to the Commission at
least 60 days prior to adoption for the Commission's review for consistency with the General Plan.
                                                     10-4

10.3 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE FOR PROJECT REVIEW
The implementation guide presented in this section is intended to ensure that new development has a
"net benefit" to the City and contributes to making Yuba City a sustainable community. Table 10-2
summarizes the policies and standards for project review that are intended to protect resources in the
Planning Area and provide for balanced growth. It shows the checkpoints that should be used in
project review to determine new development complies with the resource-based standards established
in the General Plan. For each environmental resource or constraint, the table lists the applicable
policy or standard, significance thresholds and information to be used to determine compliance with
the standard, and the compliance requirements.
This table will be used in reviewing individual development projects, unless exempt because they are
too small or located on infill sites where they are unlikely to have a significant impact. Application
forms and checklists will need to be prepared to create a streamlined review process. Background
information in the EIR will be used in the initial screening of applications. For many projects, the
compliance requirements will be straight-forward, and no further discretionary review would be
necessary if adequate information is submitted showing that standards are met.

           Growth and Economic Development
Yuba City is committed to maintaining a vibrant and healthy economy, providing land for planned
development, ensuring the fiscal and financial health of the City, and working with the private sector
to help ensure that adequate infrastructure, particularly streets, water and wastewater treatment
capacity, is available to attract and maintain business. How this will be accomplished is addressed in
this element of the General Plan. Details on specific land use proposals are in Chapter 3 and public
utilities are addressed in Chapter 7; the focus in this chapter is on overall economic development and
what the City can do to facilitate it.
2.1        EXISTING AND PROJECTED POPULATION
EXISTING POPULATION
According to the U.S. Census, the population of Yuba City was 36,760 in the year 2000, an increase of
                                           1
8,500 residents or 30 percent since 1990. This represents an average annual growth rate of about 2.7
percent. The U.S. Census estimates that the population of the unincorporated areas within the Yuba
                                                                    2
City Sphere of Influence (SOI) in the year 2000 was 20,270. This adds up to a year 2000 total
population of approximately 57,030, or about 3.8 residents per acre, in the Yuba City SOI. In early
2001, the Walton Annexation further increased the population of Yuba City—and decreased the
population of the unincorporated area within the SOI—by approximately 7,000 residents. The
California Department of Finance (DOF) estimates the City population at 47,200, as of January 2002.
Annexations continue to represent a significant share of the City’s population growth. Since 1989,
the City has annexed approximately 2,370 acres, increasing the City area by 54 percent. A substantial
amount of the annexed land is on the south side of the City, extending south to Bogue Road and
westward from the riverfront.
PACE OF GROWTH
Incorporated in 1908, Yuba City’s population began to grow more rapidly after World War II, as a
result of returning veterans, improved access from highway construction, and the constraints placed
on development in its sister city, Marysville, which is surrounded by flood-control levees. Growth
has continued to be strong, with the population nearly doubling every twenty years since 1940.
Figure 2-1 illustrate the pattern of growth since incorporation.
Table 2-1 compares population growth of the City and Sutter County between 1980 and the year 2000
according to the U.S. Census. Over the past 20 years, the population of Yuba City has nearly doubled,
while the population of Sutter County has grown by half.

PROJECTED POPULATION
The Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) projects that Yuba City’s population could
reach 68,150 in the year 2025, an increase of 85 percent increase over the 2001 estimated population
               3
of 36,760. This represents an average annual growth rate of 2.5 percent. Assuming the population of
the unincorporated areas of the Planning Area will grow at a rate similar to that of the incorporated
city, the Planning Area population will be 105,730 in 2025.

                                                Yuba City General Plan Update
Using the 3.4 percent average annual growth rate reflected in the Census data between 1980 and 2000,
the population of Yuba City Planning Area could reach 131,557 in the year 2025, an increase of 130
                                                               4
percent over the current estimated population. Chart 2-1 shows relative growth within the City and
the Sphere of Influence (SOI) – the urban growth area within the Planning Area, assuming some
annexation mirroring historic trends and also some development within the unincorporated area.
2.2        REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONTEXT
LOCAL ECONOMY CHARACTERISTICS
Yuba City’s early economic growth was related to providing services within a large agricultural area.
In addition to agriculture, which served as the traditional employment base for the region,
employment cores were developed in downtown Yuba City and at the intersection of Highway 20 and
Highway 99. With substantial growth occurring in the past 20 years, Yuba City is now the economic
hub of the surrounding agricultural area, providing services for both city and regional residents. It
also is part of the Sacramento metropolitan area economy and is influenced by trends in this larger
area.
Several key components of the local economy include the
following:
•    Yuba City’s Town Center has emerged as a successful
     employment center specializing in health care and related
     services in the redevelopment zone near downtown.
•    While Yuba City is a net exporter of workers—many of which
     are drawn to the job-rich Sacramento Metropolitan area—
     Yuba City is the shopping and urban services center for Yuba
     and Sutter counties.
•    Annexations have added opportunities for additional
     commercial and industrial development within the City, and
     residential development both in the City and the surrounding
     unincorporated area has expanded the base for retailing within
     the City.
•    Recent publicity as a ‘top small city’ in national print media has
     raised Yuba City’s profile. The City’s location along the Feather
     River and access to recreational resources also is a plus.
•    Yuba City’s employment mix is different from that of the
     region at large; government is a greater force on a regional scale,                    The Yuba City Downtown Business
                                                                                            Association has been successful in
     whereas medical employment is stronger in the City. Also,                              attracting people to shop Downtown.
     agriculture is a much stronger presence in Yuba-Sutter than in
     the Sacramento region’s other counties, and many local jobs are
     low-paying. This needs to be considered when considering
     which industries to target for economic development initiatives.

  This represents an average of the annual growth rates experienced in Yuba City between 1980 and 1990, and between 1990 and 2000,
  according to the U.S. Census.
                                                                  2-4

                                                  Growth and Economic Development
•     Attractive wage scales and competitive land costs, when compared with other locations within the
      Sacramento metropolitan area, and highway access to Sacramento and other California markets
      are strong selling points; the challenge for many industries is to find the right land and building
      space and supporting infrastructure.
EXISTING EMPLOYMENT
Employment is the principal indicator of community economic conditions. Employment in 2000 is
estimated at 16,914 jobs, within the City, which represents a 53.76 percent increase in jobs since
         5
1990. In spite of the recession that affected most of the country in the early 1990s, employment in
Yuba City grew by 27.5 percent, or 3025 jobs, between 1990 and 1995.
Table 2-2 presents SACOG’s 2000 industry breakdown in Yuba City in comparison to Sutter County.
The proportion of total employment for each industry sector is shown in parentheses. City residents
are much more likely to be employed in retail, office, or medical positions, whereas workers in the
County overall show higher concentrations in education, manufacturing, and other sectors. The
biggest employment increases in recent years have been in the manufacturing and medical industries.

PROJECTED EMPLOYMENT
According to SACOG projections, Yuba City is expected to add approximately 11,500 jobs by the year
2020, which represents a 68 percent increase for the City, and approximately two-thirds of the total
                                            6
increase for the entire County.
Table 2-3 presents SACOG’s forecast for 2010 and 2020, by employment sector. The greatest growth
will be in the retail sector with just over 3,770 new jobs, which makes sense given projected
population growth. Strong growth also is expected for the office, medical, and manufacturing
sections, which together will add 4,300 jobs.

2.3        EMPLOYMENT GROWTH PROSPECTS
The City is intent on promoting economic growth, as well as focusing economic development efforts
in areas that will contribute most to making the City a vital, vibrant community. Employment
growth in Yuba City will allow the City’s economic base to expand in tandem with its population.
Employment opportunities are expected to increase due to the new hospital, continued and
potentially expanded food processing operations, and increased demand for retail goods. The Yuba-
Sutter Economic Development Corporation has had many inquiries from specialty food and beverage
processors and believes that this is a niche worth developing in spite of recent plant closings. Much of
the City’s future economic base is already present in the form of developed land and occupied non-
residential space, although there will be opportunities for new jobs in the Highway 20 corridor and
other locations, as depicted on the land use plan (See Chapter 4).
New commercial and retail centers are planned at accessible locations to serve both City residents and
shoppers from other communities. Regionally-oriented commercial areas are planned along Route
20, Route 99 and major arterials, and community commercial uses will be developed within
neighborhoods and communities.                       Future employment centers have been designated for
manufacturing, processing, and warehousing (includes resource-based processing), as well as for
business, technology, and light industry. Together, these sites in the employment centers could
accommodate up to 10 million square feet of new space, or 22,000 jobs at an average of one job per
450 square feet of space.
Even though sufficient land is designated for employment uses, land use planning needs to be
supplemented by other tools – city policies, targeted recruitment, incentives or subsidies – to
encourage a specific type of use. In addition, the City’s population growth will help fuel expected
employment growth by creating demand for additional retail, service (business, professional, medical,
and other), and public sector uses. Diversity in employment will expand job opportunities for local
residents and help to stabilize the local economy.
                                                                 2-6

2.4      DEFINING AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
A coordinated economic development strategy is essential for supporting Yuba City’s community
development objectives, such as increasing the industrial base, continuing to support Downtown
revitalization, enhancing community character, and supporting commercial development along
corridors and in neighborhoods. Such a strategy should include a managed program of fiscal
development, strategic public improvements, and a balanced approach to land use. It could build on
and reinforce initiatives that already have been undertaken by the Yuba-Sutter Economic
Development Corporation and by the City Administrator’s office, and capitalize on technical
assistance and grant funding provided by state and federal agencies. This element envisions the
following central roles for the City:
•   Promoting agriculturally-related processing,
    agricultural equipment manufacturing, sales
    and services, “niche” manufacturing, health
    care facilities and professional offices. The
    County’s agricultural heritage can be a
    cornerstone of its economic development
    efforts, but new initiatives to attract
    agricultural industry clusters and related
    manufacturing       and      services—which
    include food and beverage processing,
    agricultural and farm implements, small-
    scale specialty companies, and business
    services—are projected to benefit from
    significant growth in the Sacramento New office space Downtown serves the health care sector.
    metropolitan area through the planning
    period, and would certainly provide excellent employment- and revenue-generating
    opportunities for Yuba City if the City positioned itself properly to capture a portion of this
    growth. Yuba City also may benefit from support activities and services for Beale Air Force Base
    (AFB). Lastly, Yuba City may be successful in attracting “call center” operations because of the
    community’s large labor pool and competitive land costs.
•   Promoting development that results in fiscal benefits to the City. The relative benefit or burden of
    various land uses on the City’s General Fund is important in considering how future development
    in Yuba City should be prioritized. Promoting the construction of revenue-generating uses (non-
    residential uses that generate sales and property tax monies), as well as ensuring that each new
    residential development pays its fair share of the costs to provide public services, provides the
    City with a more diverse fiscal base.
•   Regional scale retail and consumer service uses need to be located in the Route 99 and Route 20
    corridors where pass-by traffic, good visibility, and image will enhance sales potential. Yuba City has
    a significant advantage with these state highways and should protect the supply of available land
    in commercial locations that make the most sense for retail and service sector uses.
•   Businesses in these clusters have several locational considerations. Good access from major
    highways and proximate amenities for employees are very important factors. Locations must
    project a high-quality image, typically expressed by a high-level of design, landscaping, and
    maintenance. Such an image is generally provided in campus-style office or business park
    developments. In addition, “back office” uses such as call centers will seek space in large-
                                                      2-7

                                        Yuba City General Plan Update
     floorplate buildings, and professional office tenants will pay a premium for space in high-profile
     or high-image buildings, often an architecturally interesting building with visibility from a major
     highway.
•    Enhancing cultural amenities, such as a convention center, performing arts center, or cultural center,
     in downtown Yuba City or elsewhere. This recommendation offers three distinct, yet very
     important advantages. First, if such a facility was located downtown, this would generate
     pedestrian traffic and support retail opportunities into the evening hours. Complementary uses,
     such as restaurants, clubs, and coffee shops, would also tend to locate near where crowds gather.
     Second, such facilities provide a strong image of culture, sophistication, and community pride.
     Such an image is important if Yuba City is to evolve from bedroom community for Sacramento
     workers to important sub-regional job center, particularly in the attraction of R&D and office
     complexes, specialty agricultural industries and support services for Beale AFB. Third, such
     facilities can also result in strong growth in the visitor services sector by catering to those who
     come to enjoy recreational and entertainment opportunities related to the facilities.
•    Attracting a new job training, vocational school, or community college campus. Establishment of a
     higher educational facility within Yuba City would improve the skills and educational attainment
     of the local labor force. Additionally, it would provide local employers with convenient
     opportunities for continuing education and/or job training. The University of Phoenix has a
     satellite campus at Beale Air Force Base and they or another similar institution may be interested
     in another facility in Yuba City itself.
Yuba City’s economic development strategy shifts focus from traditional approaches—such as
provision of tax breaks and other subsidies—to investing in the skills of the workforce, infrastructure
for agricultural processing and technological innovation, and a superb quality of life. The City also
might consider working with Yuba-Sutter Economic Development Corporation on lending programs
for qualified businesses and also protecting opportunities related by Beale AFB by working with the
County, Yuba-Sutter Economic Development Corporation and the community’s elected
representatives to ensure that Beale is not affected by the next round of military base closures, which
could affect up to 20 percent of the bases in California.
Yuba City also has been active in the Sister City Program, with one sister city in Japan. This program
was initiated by President Eisenhower in 1956; today, more than 900 U.S. cities are paired with over
1,300 cities in 92 countries. Sister cities provide opportunities for international business contacts,
increased awareness of other cultures, student exchanges, and development of mutually beneficial
relations in economic development, education, the arts, culture, medicine, government and sports.
Cross-cultural charitable efforts also have been initiated by sister cities, and many American cities
have several partners. Given the strong Sikh community in Yuba City, it may be appropriate to
initiate study of inviting one or more additional sister cities in the Punjab region of India (e.g.
Jullundhur, Patiala, Chandigarh, and Ludhiana).
2.5       GUIDING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
A key initiative of this General Plan is to maintain a balanced land use program that provides
opportunities for commercial and industrial development, dispersed throughout the community and
at appropriate locations within the urban area served by adequate infrastructure.

                                       Growth and Economic Development
The General Plan Land Use Diagram, described in Chapter 3, recognizes that industrial users have a
broad range of needs, and provides for more land than may be needed over the planning period to
allow for a choice of sites. The specific policies that follow focus on those actions the City can take
that will enable the land use and development concepts of this General Plan to be realized.
GUIDING POLICY
2.5-G-1 Foster a climate in which business can prosper and actively promote economic
            development opportunities and knowledge of Yuba City in the region, state and nation.
2.5-G-2 Maintain a positive, small-business climate, and strengthen the City's tax base by
            encouraging environmentally sensitive development with tax generation potential.
2.5-G-3 Build long-term partnerships between the City and businesses, business organizations, and
            the educational, arts and environmental communities.
2.5-G-4 Promote economic development activities that link residents with businesses in the City,
            such as job training and job development, and facilitate a desired jobs/housing balance.
            For further discussion of jobs/housing balance, see Section 4-3 in the Chapter 4, Land Use.
2.5-G-5 Encourage agricultural processing and cooperative distribution and marketing of
            agricultural products.
2.5-G-6 Promote agricultural-related technology and opportunities for “back office” uses and
            specialty manufacturing.
2.5-G-7 Enhance aspects of the community that help economic development and draw residents to
            Yuba City, including small-town ambience, educational, cultural, environmental and
            recreational resources, and affordable housing.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
Overall Organization and Coordination
2.5-I-1    Work with regional economic development organizations to foster the economic health of
           the area and dedicate funding to joint marketing of the City’s economic development
           objectives, including preparation of newsletters, press releases, program summaries, mailing
           lists, client testimonials, economic data, and articles in various industry journals.
            Many issues facing the region affect all communities and can be solved only through
            regional dialogue and cooperation. Economic development can be mutually beneficial for
            each city.
                                                      2-9

                                      Yuba City General Plan Update
2.5-I-2 Work closely with the County and Yuba-
        Sutter        Economic           Development
        Corporation in advocating support for
        Beale Air Force Base and urge the Defense
        Department to keep it open.
        The next round of military base closures
        could affect up to 20 percent of the bases
        in California. While Beale’s mission has
        recently been expanded, it still is subject
        to review. Coordinated local advocacy can
        have an impact on the decision-making
        process, so keeping Beale open should be          Beale AFB is a regional asset that can be leveraged for local
        a high priority for the City.                     job creation.
2.5-I-3 Continue to identify, pursue and capture state, federal and other grants for economic
        development.
        The Yuba-Sutter Economic Development Corporation has been active in pursuing grants,
        and the City should continue to work with them on program funding of mutual benefit.
2.5-I-4 Establish bi-annual priorities between capital projects and economic development projects
        within the context of the City's Capital Improvement Program (CIP); emphasize in the CIP
        Economic Development and Revitalization Programs to be coordinated with the
        Redevelopment Agency's programs.
Programs
2.5-I-5 Support a coordinated approach to working with key industries for the purposes of targeted
        marketing (on a case-by-case basis) to existing firms to be retained and/or expanded and
        new firms to be sought. Identify underrepresented industries that may be attracted to Yuba
        City and actively try to recruit them.
        Candidates include businesses involved with agricultural processing and agricultural
        equipment, health services, tourism, professional service, ”back-office” services, agricultural
        services, computer software and services, organic agriculture and specialty foods. As part of
        this program, the City, working closely with Yuba-Sutter Economic Development
        Corporation could develop a Business Attraction Strategy which secures new business
        activity for Yuba City’s vacant and underutilized sites. The Strategy should include the
        following components:
        •    Identify target sites and solicit cooperation of property-owner;
        •    Identify necessary on- and off-site infrastructure improvements;
        •    Identify target industries (and possibly specific firms);
        •    Prepare marketing materials, in coordination with Yuba-Sutter Economic Development
             Corporation and the Chamber of Commerce;
                                                     2-10

                                    Growth and Economic Development
          •    Conduct outreach through mailings, personal contact, trade shows; and
          •    Coordinate with permit processing.
2.5-I-6  Assist local merchants and business organizations interested in forming business
         improvement districts to promote a definable identity for specific commercial areas through
         coordinated signage, landscaping and entry/identity symbols.
2.5-I-7  Work with the State Employment Development Department, the California Training and
         Education center, Yuba Community College and higher education institutions to establish
         practical job training and vocational education programs on campuses within Yuba City
         that are geared to specific industries and occupational needs.
          Examples may include the visitor industry, specific agricultural commodities, health care,
          agricultural-related high technology manufacturing, and back office uses, such as call
          centers. Business involved in support functions for Beale Air Force Base also may benefit
          from specialized training.
2.5-I-8  Work with the school districts to develop internship, mentoring and workplace learning
         programs for Yuba City high school students.
          This program could help students who are not college-bound into productive adult careers
          in the community.
2.5-I-9  Establish a program, such as "Yuba City Marketplace," to connect local business needs with
         local products and services and encourage all businesses and residents in Yuba City to make
         purchases in the community whenever possible to support local firms.
           Yuba City businesses can “multiply” their profits by purchasing goods and services locally.
2.5-I-10 Continue to support the City’s Downtown Farmer's Market by helping sponsors in
         marketing and related promotional activities.
2.5-I-11 Explore creating an additional Sister City
         relationship     with     one     or     more
         communities in India.
          Sister Cities International, a nonprofit
          organization that certifies Sister City
          affiliations can assist in this process, and
          its Annual Fund for Partnership,
          Innovation and Excellence may provide
          some financial assistance. Beneficial
          exchanges can facilitate community-
          building, which will indirectly have
          economic development effects.                  The Downtown Farmer’s Market has been a success.
                                                   2-11

                                      Yuba City General Plan Update
Cultural Amenities, Image and Business Climate
2.5-I-12 Promote cultural amenities and facilitate special events in the community that will draw
         visitors to the community.
          Potential events include Yuba City Artisans and Crafts Fair, Feather River–oriented
          weekends, sporting events and other seasonal events that will attract visitors to the
          community.
2.5-I-13 Work with local hotels and motels, the
         Chamber of Commerce, Yuba-Sutter
         Economic Development Corporation, and
         recreational organizations and business to
         promote a Yuba City-Feather River
         "weekend package" of emphasizing the
         community's historical and community
         assets, and access to recreational facilities
         and recreational areas.
2.5-I-14 Explore the feasibility of establishing a
         convention center or performing arts
         center, either Downtown or in another           Access to the Feather River and other recreational facilities in
         accessible location.                            the area is a community asset.
          This initiative also should be coordinated with efforts to upgrade hotel facilities and attract
          new hotels and motels to Downtown and the Route 99 and Route 20 corridors.
Commercial and Industrial Development
2.5-I-15 Maintain a generous supply of "ready to go" commercial and industrial land by annexing
         and zoning sites prior to receipt of development applications.
2.5-I-16 Develop guidelines for adaptive reuse of commercial/industrial buildings and "incubator"
         development projects, including "live/work" studios.
2.5-I-17 Work with Sutter County and the Yuba-Sutter Economic Development Corporation on
         developing a resource-based industrial park in the Route 99 corridor north of the City that
         would service the agricultural and processing businesses in the County.
          Also, see policies in Chapter 3: Land Use.
Fees and Development Standards
2.5-I-18 Explore financing plans for existing businesses seeking to expand in Yuba City for whom
         payment of fees "upfront" may represent a major financial burden. Six- or twelve-month
         financing programs could be considered.
          This program should be integrated with assistance provided by the Redevelopment Agency
          and by Yuba-Sutter Economic Development Corporation.
                                                   2-12

                                   Growth and Economic Development
2.5-I-19 Provide incentives to attract and encourage environmentally desirable businesses and
         business activities, including possibly reduced fees for outstanding environmental
         conservation efforts.
          Use of agricultural waste for energy co-generation facilities is one example of such an effort,
          and there are state and federal grant programs and tax credit for such activities.
2.5-I-20 Periodically survey the business community for evaluation of City services and
         improvement suggestions.
          In order to retain the businesses that currently exist and to attract new ones, the City needs
          to “feel the pulse” of the business community. Establishing a regular program to ensure
          dialogue between the community and the City is essential to ensuring that the City’s policies
          encourage and stimulate commercial vitality.
2.5-I-21 Explore the potential for adjustments to development controls that allow for more efficient
         use of sites already developed for employment uses (e.g., through height and/or floor area
         ration (FAR) increases).
2.5-I-22 Promote, consistent with the Traffic and Circulation Element, public transportation
         opportunities, in order to serve business areas and transport workers.
2.5-I-23 Encourage non-motorized means of transportation to business areas.
          See Chapter 5, Traffic and Circulation for details on proposed bike and trail systems.
2.5-I-24 Assure adequate revenue sources to finance City capital and program initiatives that will
         enhance economic development prospects.
          Examples of initiatives potentially requiring capital outlays are new streets and
          infrastructure for development areas, amenities along the Feather River and provision of
          other kinds of community infrastructure. Provision of assisted housing may also involve
          capital costs. Ongoing costs of administering newly established programs (e.g., a job center)
          and/or providing services in conjunction with expanded activity (expansion of water
          service) will require increased operating costs and, potentially, augmentation of existing
          sources of operating revenues. Enlargement of the City’s responsibilities, whether in capital
          or operating realm, should occur only when decision makers are satisfied that a range of
          adequate financing options is available.
2.5-I-25 Assure that ongoing budgets provide for adequate maintenance of the City’s capital
         facilities, and establish fees commensurate with services rendered (e.g. application
         processing fees, planning, building and safety and engineering) to recover costs of these
         services.

                                              Land Use
 This element of the General Plan constitutes the framework for land use planning in Yuba City to the
 year 2025. To provide a context, the evolution of the City is described and existing land use in the
 City is summarized. The guiding principles of the land use framework, the General Plan Diagram, the
 land use classification system, and the buildout of this Plan to the year 2025 are then presented. The
 heart of the chapter is on guiding and implementing policies, which are intended to set the land use
 framework into motion and shape development for the next 20 years. Further guidance on physical
 form is provided in Chapter 4: Community Design.
 This chapter focuses on both development in outlying, developed areas and on infill sites within the
 existing City, and builds upon Downtown Yuba City as the historical and future “heart” of the City.
 3.1          BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
 HISTORICAL LAND USE DEVELOPMENT
 Much of Yuba City’s land use pattern can be traced to its evolution as a primary service center within
 a large agricultural area focused on downtown Yuba City and the intersection of Highway 20 (Colusa
 Avenue) and Highway 99 as employment cores. Much of the residential development in the City is
 low density single family housing and much of the commercial development is retail-related. Chapter
 1 includes a brief historical a description of the growth of Yuba City.
 2002 LAND USE PATTERN
 Lands within the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) for this General Plan, are described in Chapter 1,
 and include 12,954 acres, of which about half had been developed by 2002. Most of the developed
 land is within the existing City limits. Approximately 918 acres of land in the UGB were vacant in
 2002. About 7,079 acres are located in unincorporated Sutter County. Table 3-1 lists existing land
 uses within the UGB.
                                            2002 RECENT DEVELOPMENT
                                            As of 2002, a sizeable inventory of new residential projects was
                                            in the pipeline or under construction within the UGB. Twenty
                                            four new residential development projects were planned to
                                            add some 1851 new units, or approximately 8 years worth of
                                            units using the yearly average of 235 units/year.
                                            Also in the pipeline, 25 non-residential development projects
                                            were likely to add over 1 million square feet of new floor area.
                                            Non-residential development included additional office,
                                            storage and warehousing, retail, restaurant, motel, hospital,
Several new residential projects were under
construction in 2002.

 2002 City limits.

              CLASSIFICATIONS
 LAND USE FRAMEWORK
 General Plan Diagram
 The land use framework of the General Plan is illustrated in the General Plan Diagram, Figure 3-1.
 The diagram is a graphic representation of the themes and policies in the Plan. The General Plan
 Diagram designates the proposed general location, distribution, and extent of land uses through
 buildout, which is expected by about 2025. As required by State law, land use classifications, shown as
 color/graphic patterns, letter designations, or labels on the Diagram, specify a range for housing
 density and building intensity for each type of designated land use. These density/intensity standards
 allow circulation and public facility needs to be determined.

                                      Yuba City General Plan Update
 The Diagram is to be used and interpreted only in conjunction with the text and other figures
contained in the General Plan. The legend of the General Plan Diagram includes the land use
classifications described below, which represent an adopted part of the General Plan. The General
Plan is not parcel-specific, and uses on sites less than one acre in size are generally not depicted on the
Diagram.
The General Plan Diagram is the framework of this General Plan document and is designed to reflect,
through the arrangements of land use, the planning objectives and key initiatives presented in
Chapter 1. An overview of how the Diagram relates to these initiatives is as follows:
•   Clearly Defined Urban Edges. As depicted on the General Plan Diagram, all areas, with some
    exceptions, that are beyond the Urban Growth Boundary roughly defined by Pease, Township,
    Bogue Roads, and the Feather River, are identified as “Agricultural/Rural.”
•   Economic Development & Jobs. A significant amount of land is planned for uses that provide
    jobs. Areas designated “Office & Office Park”, “Business, Technology, and Light Industry”, and
    “Manufacturing, Processing, and Warehousing” accommodate uses that will provide employment
    opportunities for existing and future residents.
•   A Range of Commercial & Retail Opportunities. The General Plan provides for the full range of
    commercial and retail uses needed for the future population and business community, consistent
    with the Economic Development Strategy described in Chapter 2. Regionally-oriented
    establishments are placed on major roadway corridors; community- and neighborhood-oriented
    uses are placed within planned communities and neighborhoods.
•   Large Parks. Two new, large City parks are depicted on the General Plan Diagram. Low-Medium
    and Medium-High residential uses are often situated adjacent to these parks, which provide a
    valuable amenity to nearby residents as well as the overall City population. A further discussion of
    these parks is presented in Chapter 6 of the General Plan.
•   A Network of Open Space. All of the Parks and Open Space uses are linked by a system of
    parkways, bikeways, and roadways. A further discussion of parks is presented in Chapter 6 of the
    General Plan.
•   A Complete Roadway System. The land uses presented on the diagram are structured around the
    proposed roadway network, and the two components are interactive and interrelated. The
    character and design of roadways is presented in Chapter 4: Community Design. The types,
    location, capacity, and use of these roadways is presented in Chapter 5: Transportation.
•   Integrated Neighborhoods & Neighborhood Centers. The General Plan Diagram depicts a
    network of neighborhoods. Neighborhoods are defined as areas including a mix of land uses that
    interrelate and serve one another. Neighborhoods work as part of an overall system of the city, are
    internally accessible by non-motorized means, include community facilities such as parks and
    schools, and have a central focal point. The arrangements of land uses on the Diagram show how
    these neighborhoods are related to each other and to neighborhood center and shopping areas.
•   Enhanced Community Character & Aesthetics. Although Community Character is described in
    full detail in Chapter 4: Community Design, the arrangements of land uses on the General Plan
    Diagram create a framework within which quality community design is possible.
•   A Mix of Housing Types. Three types of residential density ranges are depicted on the Diagram.
    These will accommodate a full range of housing types and prices to provide housing choice.
                                                      3-4

                                                  Land Use
•    Adequate, Flexible School Sites. School sites depicted on the General Plan Diagram are
     recommended by the school districts; they relate well to adjacent uses, such as neighborhood focal
     areas and park sites. A further discussion of schools is presented in Chapter 6 of the General Plan.
DENSITY/INTENSITY STANDARDS
The General Plan establishes density/intensity standards for each land use classification. In the
residential designations, residential density is expressed as housing units per gross acre.
For non-residential uses, a maximum permitted ratio of gross floor area to net site area (FAR) is
specified. FAR is a broad measure of building bulk that controls both visual prominence and traffic
generation, and is calculated inclusive of area devoted to parking and landscaping. It can be clearly
translated to a limit on building bulk in the Zoning Ordinance and is independent of the use
occupying the building. No averaging is permitted such that the maximum FAR would be exceeded
on any individual site. The Zoning Ordinance can provide specific exceptions to the FAR limitations
for uses with low employment densities. In addition to density/intensity standards, some land use
classifications also stipulate allowable building types, such as single-family residential.
The density/intensity standards do not imply that development projects will be approved at the
maximum density or intensity specified for each use. Zoning regulations consistent with General Plan
policies and/or site conditions may reduce development potential within the stated ranges.
LAND USE CLASSIFICATIONS
Total acreages for each Land Use Category are presented in Table 3-2. The categories are as follows:
Residential
Low Density Residential (Single Family). This category applies to residential development of 2-8 units
per gross acre. The majority of planned land has this designation. This density range is typical of
newer single-family residential subdivisions in Yuba City. In addition to single-family houses, this
category also provides for parks, day care, civic and institutional uses, such as churches and places for
religious assembly appropriate in a residential environment. An average density of 4.25 units per acre
is used for buildout projections
Low – Medium Density Residential (Traditional Neighborhoods with Mix of Housing Types). Residential
development of 6-14 units per gross acre. This density range provides for a mix of single-family
housing on lots ranging in size from 2,500 square feet to 6,000 square feet, with duplexes, single-
family homes with second units over a garage, attached single family homes, mobile home parks,
parks, civic and institutional uses appropriate for a residential environment. Existing single-family
homes on smaller lots that exist in Yuba City are examples of the low end of this density range;
existing duplex development is an example of the middle of the density range. An average density of 9
units per acre is used for buildout projections.
Medium – High Density Residential. Residential development at densities ranging from 12 to 36 units
per gross acre. This density range will accommodate attached homes, two- to four-plexes, apartment
buildings, parks, civic and institutional uses appropriate for a residential environment. Developments
with apartment buildings - such as those in small, highly landscaped apartment complexes - are at the
                                                     3-5

                                           Yuba City General Plan Update
higher end of the density range. An average density of 24 units per acre is used for buildout
projections.
Commercial/Office/Industrial
Neighborhood Commercial. Small shopping centers, small retail plazas, and village centers on 1-5 acre
sites, with up to 10 acres in special circumstances where mixed use development is envisioned. Mixed
use development could include residential development (at a density of 12-36 units per gross acre),
such as apartments or offices above ground-floor retail. The development intensity for buildout
                                                                                                        1
projections is assumed at 0.35 FAR; the maximum FAR is 0.5, excluding any housing.
Community Commercial. Shopping centers (typically anchored by a supermarket), retail plazas, etc.
The Feather Downs shopping center on Stabler Lane is an example of this scale of development.
Retail shopping areas could contain a wide variety of businesses, including retail stores, eating and
drinking establishments, as well as medical or professional offices in a retail-type setting. Mixed use
development could include residential development (at a density of 12-36 units per gross acre) that is
secondary to commercial uses. Site sizes are typically 15-20 acres (although this size is not a
minimum requirement), depending on uses. Development intensity for buildout projections is
assumed at 0.25 FAR. The maximum FAR is 0.5, excluding housing.
Regional Commercial. Shopping centers typically anchored by retail outlets with a regional draw,
including “big box” retail establishments, department stores, and regional shopping malls.
Commercial development along Route 20, including Sam’s Club, Home Depot, and the Yuba City
Mall are examples of this type of development. Sites are typically 25 to 50 acres (although this size is
not a minimum requirement). This category also includes auto-and visitor- oriented commercial uses
such as hotels, motels, service stations, restaurants, housing, etc. and sites for automotive sales and
services and other commercial uses not described in other categories. Development intensity for
buildout projections is assumed at 0.25 FAR. The maximum FAR is 0.5, excluding housing.
Office & Office Park. Development containing professional and medical offices. This classification
includes neighborhood, community, and downtown offices as well as office development in a low-
intensity, campus-like setting. Neighborhood & community office sites could include a mix of uses,
such as small-scale support services and residential uses that are secondary to the office development.
An example is housing units or live/work units above office uses. Development intensity for buildout
projections is assumed at 0.30 FAR. The maximum FAR is 1.0.
Business, Technology, and Light Industry. This classification provides for freestanding sites and
campus/complex development accommodating flexible uses of space. Uses include research and
development activities, light industrial uses, office uses, high-tech uses, and small-scale distribution
uses. For build-out calculations, it is assumed that one job exists for every 750 square feet of net
building area. Development intensity for buildout projections is assumed at 0.25 FAR. The
maximum FAR is 0.75.
1
  The FAR assumed for buildout projections reflects the average intensity of development expected during the planning period
based on design standards, zoning development standards, and anticipated real estate market conditions.
                                                             3-6

                                                   Land Use
Manufacturing, Processing, and Warehousing. This category includes manufacturing and industrial
processing, general service, warehouse and distribution uses, agricultural product processing and
warehousing; large equipment & supply and sales. For build-out calculations, it is assumed that one
job exists for every 750 square feet of net building area. Site development is assumed at 0.25 FAR.
The maximum FAR is 1.0.
Public & Open Space
Public & Semipublic. This designation includes schools, government offices, corporation yards,
hospitals, city, and public facilities. Average site development is assumed at 0.15 FAR. The maximum
FAR is 1.0.
Parks, Recreation & Open Space. This classification is for improved and unimproved park facilities,
including neighborhood, community, and regional parks; golf courses; and private recreational
facilities.
Greenway/Bikeway/Pedestrian Link. This classification covers those areas provided as part of a larger
use, in between uses, or along transportation routes that serve to connect parks, recreation, and open
space into a unified network of facilities.
Agricultural/Rural. This classification refers to a range of agricultural, rural and open space uses,
including field and row crops, orchards, and agricultural support services. Residential units do exist,
typically as a secondary use. The category applies to rural areas outside the urban growth boundary;
it is intended to be consistent with the Sutter County General Plan and the City’s policy of
maintaining rural and agricultural land as open space beyond the UGB.
3.3        GENERAL PLAN BUILDOUT
This section describes the implications of General Plan buildout in terms of future new population,
housing units, and jobs. Adequate land is provided by this General Plan to accommodate anticipated
housing and job needs in Yuba City through 2025.
Table 3-2 shows the buildout acreage of undeveloped lands in the General Plan Diagram. A total of
7,200 gross acres would be developed within the Urban Growth Boundary, including infill sites. Most
areas that are planned for new development are residential in use, totaling about 4,655 acres.

* Acreages include vacant and infill lands within the UGB, and exclude developed
lands, as of 2002.
Population Growth and Housing
The Yuba City SOI, including the City of Yuba City and surrounding unincorporated areas,
contained 57,030 people according to the 2000 census. Using a 2.5 percent annual population growth
rate (the rate projected by SACOG) the total SOI population would be 105,730 in 2025. Using a
higher 3 percent population growth (which is below the historic rate of 3.4 percent based on Census
data), the total population in the SOI may grow as large as 119,400 by 2025. The mid-point of these
two 2025 projections is 112,570.
The Land Use plan accommodates a higher population than the SACOG projection to provide for
planning flexibility. Based on average build out densities for new residential land uses, the Plan
accommodates 19,220 new housing units, which would house 51,310 new residents at an average
household size of 2.67 people (Table 3-3). The resultant population would be 108,340. The housing
mix for units added during the planning period is presented in Table 3-4.

Employment
In order to determine the total additional employment accommodated in the Plan, a detailed set of
assumptions was developed. These assumptions, presented in Table 3-5, include FARs for each of the
job producing land uses, the likely mix in percentages of retail and non-retail employees, and the
employment density, explained as the amount of space in square feet needed per employee.

The resulting estimates of additional employment for each land use category are presented in Table 3-
6. Jobs from commercial and retail development compose 35 percent of additional employment for
the plan. Office uses account for 40 percent of employment; light industry, processing, and related
uses account for the remaining 25 percent.

Jobs and Housing Balance
As shown in Table 3-7, the jobs/housing ratio expected at Plan buildout of undeveloped areas will be
1.26 jobs for each housing unit. Many local residents commute to the Sacramento area while jobs in
Yuba City are often filled by residents of outlying communities.

3.4       PATTERN OF DEVELOPMENT, GROWTH & EXPANSION
One of the key initiatives in this plan is the idea that Yuba City retain a compact form, protecting the
surrounding rural areas with a clearly defined Urban Growth Boundary (UGB). The policies
presented in this section are intended to contain development within the UGB and achieve two
purposes – maintain Yuba City’s small town feel and preserve the surrounding agricultural rural
landscape.
The policies in this section focus on how these goals can be achieved through the location and nature
of land uses. A discussion of the character of urban edges and other initiatives to achieve these goals
through design are discussed in Chapter 4: Community Design.
GUIDING POLICIES
3.4-G-1 Maintain a well-defined compact urban form, with a defined urban growth boundary and
           urban development intensities on land designated for urban uses.
3.4-G-2 Promote a balanced land use program that increases the ability of people to live and work in
           the city.
3.4-G-3 Promote development patterns that maximize residents’ accessibility to parks, open space,
           and shopping areas.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
3.4-I-1    Establish zone districts, development standards, and performance standards in the Zoning
           Ordinance consistent with the General Plan, and amend the Zoning Map to be consistent
           with the General Plan Land Use Diagram.
3.4-I-2    Establish standards for urban edges and ensure that designated intensities and uses provide
           an appropriate transition to rural land at these edges.
                                                      3-10

                                               Land Use
3.4-I-3   Require preparation of City initiated Specific Plans or developer master plans for strategic
          new growth areas with complex land use programs.
3.4-I-4   Support the County’s efforts to maintain viable agricultural uses surrounding the City in
          areas outside the proposed Urban Growth Boundary.
3.4-I-5   Provide a variety of housing in all neighborhoods and reserve sites, where appropriate, for
          housing types that ensures that Yuba City remains an inclusive, affordable community.
3.4-I-6   Develop downtown Yuba City as a mixed-use activity center with a range of commercial,
          office, residential, and civic uses.
3.4-I-7   Promote infill development that maintains the scale and character of established
          neighborhoods.
3.4-I-8   Provide for concentrations of activity and mixed-use and pedestrian-oriented development
          in selected areas.
3.5      RESIDENTIAL AREAS
The General Plan promotes residential densities that
provide for more efficient use of available land
resources and maintains a compact form that is less
intrusive on the surrounding countryside. Guiding
principles behind residential development and
neighborhood organizing principles depicted on the
General Plan Diagram include:
•   Mix of Housing Types. The General Plan
    promotes a mix of housing types in all
    neighborhoods and ensures that no one area is
    unduly burdened by higher-density residences.
    As discussed in Section 3.2, three types of
    residential uses are planned: Low Density
    Residential, Low-Medium Density Residential,         Single-family residential land uses have historically been the
    and Medium-High Density Residential. Some            primary land use in Yuba City.
    residential development may also occur as part of
    a larger mixed-use project in office or
    commercial areas.
•   Medium-High Density Residential Development in Strategic Locations. The Diagram locates
    Medium-High Density residences in transportation corridors, next to parks, community facilities,
    and schools, and in mixed-use neighborhood centers. Higher density development is also
    proposed on vacant and underutilized infill sites as well as on suitable sites likely to undergo long-
    term redevelopment.
•   Promotion of Low-Medium Density Small-lot Single-Family Dwellings. Low-Medium Density
    small-lot development is encouraged in neighborhoods, where appropriate. These are likely to
    provide opportunities for many families to participate in the home-ownership market.
                                                  3-11

                                       Yuba City General Plan Update
BUILDING BETTER NEIGHBORHOODS
To foster community identity, the General Plan directs residential expansion in the new growth areas
into neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are planned to contain a mix of uses and housing types
and to provide convenient access to retail and commercial services used on a frequent basis. Policies
in the General Plan strive to promote the integration of new neighborhoods with existing urban
development, and to preserve and enhance neighborhood connectivity with a continuous street
network.
A neighborhood focal point would be a well-defined mixed-use center with neighborhood
commercial uses and publicly-oriented uses and open spaces. On the General Plan Diagram, several
of these centers are represented. Within these neighborhoods, the Plan designates sites for a range of
housing types in close proximity to a neighborhood centerpiece, which may be a commercial
development, a park, a school, or a mix of uses. The idea is that a larger number of residents can be
brought closer to the neighborhood focal point, so they can bike or walk to these areas without
having to rely exclusively on automobiles for local trips. Further discussion of these neighborhood
centers is contained in Chapter 4: Community Design.
GUIDING POLICIES
3.5-G-1 Encourage new residential growth to be in the form of neighborhoods.
          A neighborhood is defined as an area of over forty acres that includes a variety of
          complementary uses in which non-residential uses serve local residential uses.
3.5-G-2 Encourage development of mixed-use (residential, retail, and office) neighborhood centers,
          in both new neighborhoods and in established neighborhoods that lack them.
          Centers are concentrations of activity and uses that serve a neighborhood function. They are
          located within close proximity and easy walking distance from adjacent residences.
3.5-G-3 Allow and encourage low-medium density small-lot single-family housing development in
          new and existing neighborhoods that enable compact development and efficient infill.
          In addition to the benefit of affordability, small-lot housing increases opportunities to conserve
          land and can provide a positive aesthetic quality as characterized by Yuba City's older
          neighborhoods.
3.5-G-4 Improve the “community orientation” of new residential developments.
          A “community orientation” calls for greater attention to the relationship between residences,
          streets and shared spaces ,such as parks and community areas, and does not require sacrifice of
          privacy or amenities.
3.5-G-5 Provide for a transition between higher density and lower density residential areas, and
          require buffers of varying size between residential uses and non-residential uses without
          restricting foot and bicycle access.
                                                     3-12

                                               Land Use
3.5-G-6 Encourage and provide incentives for infill development, including affordable housing for
        low and very low income residents, within existing residential areas at a density not less than
        surrounding development, subject to appropriate standards to ensure compatibility with
        adjacent uses.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
3.5-I-1 Update that the Zoning Ordinance to include:
         •   Lot sizes consistent with the Plan's land use classifications;
         •   Development standards that permit town houses and zero-lot line attached or detached
             single-family dwellings on sites designated for low-medium or medium-high densities;
             and
         •   Development standards that do not result in disincentives for providing more local
             streets and alleys.
        Allowing density credit for dedications for alleys is one possible incentive. Minimizing alley
        setbacks would also encourage more alleys.
3.5-I-2 Require a mix of uses in neighborhood centers.
        In areas with a mix of land-use designations—a
        neighborhood center—planning for neighborhood
        commercial, civic and institutional uses, parks and open
        space, and plazas and squares will be required as a
        condition of subdivision approval, unless any of these
        uses are found infeasible, and alternative locations are
        available and are developed in order to carry out these
        mixed-use policies.
3.5-I-3 As part of the Zoning Ordinance update, establish the
        following density bonuses for residential projects:
                                                                      Neighborhood-oriented retail areas can
         •   25 percent bonus for projects meeting State-             be designed with comfortable, pedestrian-
                                                                      scale amenities.
             criteria for affordable housing.
         •   10 percent bonus, upon Planning Commission approval only, and only for projects
             undertaking elective off-site improvements (such as streetscape improvements) that
             further the City’s community design and/or open space objectives. This bonus can not
             be combined with the affordable housing bonus. Off-site improvements directly
             resulting from a project’s impacts, as specified in the Zoning Ordinance, may still be
             required; the bonus is intended for improvements that go beyond the required
             minimum.
3.5-I-4 Require residential development that employs creative site design and architectural quality
        that blends with the characteristics of each location and its surroundings.
                                                   3-13

                                     Yuba City General Plan Update
3.6        COMMUNITY FACILITIES
Community facilities that are appropriate for a residential environment, including residential care,
day care, elderly care, and alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facilities, will be allowed
within neighborhoods, consistent with state and federal law, because they are considered "protected"
facilities and local zoning can not exclude them as long as specified standards and licensing
requirements are met.
In contrast, large scale community facilities are appropriate in mixed-use neighborhood cores, on
community commercial sites, and in Downtown.
Houses of worship and other places for religious assembly as well as private schools and colleges will
be permitted in residential and commercial areas, subject to appropriate location and development
standards and use-permit requirements to ensure neighborhood compatibility. Public schools and
public colleges are exempt from zoning.
For policies related to community facilities, see Chapter 6, and for law enforcement and fire services,
see Chapter 9.
3.7        PARKS & OPEN SPACE
Parks and open space are a fundamental building
block of the General Plan Diagram and the
organization of land uses in a growing Yuba City, as
most directly evidenced by the two planned large
park facilities.
Policies pertaining to parkland, public open space,
and the greenway network are in Chapter 6: Parks,
Schools, and Community Facilities. Policies
pertaining to non-public open space are in Chapter 8:
Environmental Conservation.
                                                        Community facilities, including parks and schools, are a
                                                        key component of the Land Use plan.
3.8       RETAIL AND COMMERCIAL AREAS
Shopping and use of services are activities that provide for social contact as well as business
transactions. Since Yuba City attracts shoppers from a large region, and stores in one part of the City
are often frequented by residents from other neighborhoods, retail districts are also critical in shaping
the identity and image of the City and the neighborhoods.
To ensure that a diverse range of shopping opportunities are available and easily accessible, the Plan
provides for new neighborhood centers, located closer to where people live and designed with the
pedestrian in mind, and for increased convenience-good opportunities in existing neighborhoods
where suitable sites are available. The plan also builds on the regional accessibility of Routes 20 and
                                                   3-14
                                                Land Use
99 in order to plan for regional, auto-oriented commercial development and attempts to capture out-
of-town retail tax revenue.
Guiding concepts behind retail and commercial development areas depicted on the General Plan
Diagram include:
•   Provision of more neighborhood-oriented shopping facilities. The General Plan provides sites
    for several neighborhood-oriented shopping and commercial uses in both new and existing
    neighborhoods. Implementation of the Plan would bring a substantially increased population
    within a convenient distance of a neighborhood center.
•   Site for a new regional-retail center. While land is available in proximity to the existing
    commercial areas in the Route 20 corridor, there is also an opportunity for another regional-retail
    center. The General Plan provides a site for this on the west side of Route 99 north of Bogue
    Road.
•   Land supply in proportion to anticipated needs. To ensure the viability of the proposed retail
    and commercial centers, as well as Downtown, land designated for commercial uses corresponds
    closely to the anticipated need over the planning period.
GUIDING POLICIES
3.8-G-1 Maintain Yuba City's prominence as the center of retail activity in Sutter County.
3.8-G-2 Promote neighborhood identity and encourage use of alternative modes of transportation
          by providing neighborhood shopping centers that many residents can reach on foot or
          bicycle.
3.8-G-3 Provide specific sites for regionally oriented commercial centers and community-sized
          shopping facilities and allow residential above retail in these areas.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
3.8-I-1   Establish use regulations, development standards, and minimum performance requirements
          in the Zoning Ordinance, consistent with the General Plan, and amend the Zoning Map to
          be consistent with the Land Use Diagram.
3.8-I-2   Evenly distribute neighborhood and community shopping centers in new development
          areas to offer both choice and convenience for shoppers and residents
          The total acreage provided is intended to be sufficient to meet the need for retail space and
          commercial services that can be supported by local residents, businesses and workers.
3.8-I-3   Require pedestrian-oriented design in new shopping areas that are part of neighborhood
          centers.
3.8-I-4   Ensure that neighborhood retail centers and commercial service buildings are compatible
          with the surrounding neighborhood and with adjacent travel corridors.
3.8-I-5   Allow office uses in commercial areas.
                                                    3-15

                                       Yuba City General Plan Update
3.8-I-6   Establish site development and locational standards for neighborhood corner stores in
          residential areas.
          These will be limited in size and only allow at an intersection of a local street and an arterial or
          collector.
3.8-I-7   Encourage the development of community commercial facilities that are accessible to both
          vehicles and pedestrians, and include amenities for both.
3.8-I-8   Establish design standards for mixed use development that will result in a high quality
          pedestrian-scaled environment, with one-to-four story buildings, side or rear parking areas,
          streetfront windows and entries, and public and private open space.
3.8-I-9   As part of larger commercial developments, require amenities for public benefit, such as
          pedestrian-oriented facilities (outdoor seating, plazas, weather protection, transit waiting
          areas), historic preservation, cultural facilities, and public spaces.
3.9       EMPLOYMENT CENTERS
Policies discussed in this section relate to three land uses depicted on the General Plan Diagram:
•   Office & Office Parks;
•   Business, Technology, & Light Industry; and
•   Manufacturing, Processing, and Warehousing.
OFFICE & OFFICE PARK
There will be an increasing need for new office development, both in free-standing office buildings
within existing commercial areas, along arterial streets and in new office parks. Sites that can
accommodate flexible office space facilities will be in demand as the local economy matures and the
City implements the Economic Development strategy described in Chapter 2.
The General Plan Diagram provides acreage for both larger site office parks and smaller, integrated
office uses. Smaller sites are typically expected to be local-serving professional and administrative
office environments, such as medical, real estate, or financial services. Larger sites are envisioned as
office parks that draw employees from a wider area and provide more jobs. Offices are also permitted
in Regional Community and Neighborhood Commercial areas. This can be a very effective use of
land where new office uses are located above the first floor or as a secondary use in multi-tenant
buildings in order to promote retail continuity at the street level.
The recommendations put forth as part of the Central City Specific Plan are also depicted on the land
use diagram, most specifically with respect to the continued development of office uses in the Town
Center area.

                                                 Land Use
INDUSTRY & LIGHT INDUSTRY
Two land uses are depicted on the General Plan Diagram that have been historically described as
“Industrial” or “Research and Development” or “Business Park.” The two new categories – “Business,
Technology, and Light Industry” and “Manufacturing, Processing, and Warehousing” – attempt to
combine uses with similar development characteristics, while at the same time offering flexibility of
use and encouraging the creation of jobs in Yuba City.
Because employment intensity (building space per employee) and site configuration, access and other
requirements for these uses vary dramatically, the General Plan provides significant acreage for these
developments in a variety of settings and locations. Business, Technology, and Light Industry (BT&I)
areas are provided along major transportation corridors and adjacent to existing facilities of the same
type. The most significant of these areas is located on the large undeveloped areas to the northwest of
the intersection of Bogue Road and Route 99 and is envisioned as a master-planned, regionally
oriented development also including an office park and a regional shopping area. BT&I uses are also
planned adjacent to the Sutter County Airport and Harter property.
Manufacturing, Processing, and Warehousing (MP&W) areas are presumed to be more “industrial”
in character and are often presumed to be resource-based processing facilities. These areas are not as
landscaped an environment as the BT&I areas.
Plan policies also seek to increase the supply of prezoned, "ready-to-go" job producing land this will
improve Yuba City’s competitiveness in the regional economy by decreasing start-up time for new
development.
GUIDING POLICIES
3.9-G-1 Provide appropriately located areas for a
          broad range of employment generating
          uses to strengthen the City's economic
          base        and    provide     employment
          opportunities for residents.
3.9-G-2 Encourage employment generating uses
          to locate along major transportation
          facilities.
3.9-G-3 Encourage local serving professional and
          administrative offices to locate as part of
          locally-oriented office uses and in Office development in Yuba City provides jobs and can
          mixed-use community activity centers.          be designed to respect adjacent land uses.
3.9-G-4 Encourage office development in the Town Center development adjacent to downtown
          Yuba City.
3.9-G-5 Protect the supply of land suitable for employment center uses by not allowing incompatible
          uses to locate in these areas.

                                     Yuba City General Plan Update
3.9-G-6 Provide sites for commercial services that complement employment center development or
        that require an industrial environment.
3.9-G-7 Achieve compatibility between employment center development and surrounding
        neighborhoods through buffering requirements and performance standards intended to
        minimize harmful effects of excessive noise, light, glare, and other adverse environmental
        impacts.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
3.9-I-1 Establish use regulations, development standards, and minimum performance requirements
        for Office & Office Park development, Business, Technology, and Light Industrial
        development, and Manufacturing, Processing, and Warehousing development in the Zoning
        Ordinance consistent with the General Plan, and amend the Zoning Map to be consistent
        with the General Plan Diagram.
3.9-I-2 Allow supporting retail and business services and other complementary uses in Office &
        Office Park areas.
3.9-I-3 Allow small office development as a buffering or transitional use between residential areas
        and industrial areas or major roadway corridors.
3.9-I-4 Allow advanced educational uses, such as commuter colleges and technology teaching
        institutes, in Office & Office Park areas.
3.9-I-5 Permit offices as a primary use within Business, Technology, and Light Industrial areas and
        as a secondary use in Manufacturing, Processing, and Warehousing areas, upon finding that
        such a use is compatible with the primary use and will not adversely affect the traffic-
        carrying capacity of adjacent streets.
        Secondary uses (offices) could occupy up to 40% of the floor area.
3.9-I-6 Conditionally allow commercial recreation uses within warehouse space, provided these
        uses do not conflict with adjacent uses.
3.9-I-7 Establish setback, landscaping, and screening requirements for employment center
        development to provide adequate buffering adjacent to residential neighborhoods.
3.9-I-8 In new employment center areas, require master plans and infrastructure financing
        programs as a condition of subdivision approval, so haphazard development, without a
        coordinated plan for land use, circulation, infrastructure, and public services, does not
        occur.
3.9-I-9 Seek cooperative agreements with Sutter County towards the development of agricultural-
        and resource-based employment centers in areas outside the Yuba City Sphere of Influence,
        adjacent to the urban area, and along key transportation corridors.

                                  Community Design
Although a General Plan typically describes needed services and facilities, and appropriate land uses
in order to accommodate anticipated growth, these components are not sufficient to ensure the
quality of life – the livability – that Yuba City residents want. The City’s vision of becoming a premier
community in the Sacramento Valley can and will be achieved through the quality of development,
with attention to neighborhoods, pedestrian-oriented shopping areas, and linkages between these
uses. This Community Design Element establishes policies aimed at insuring the creation of public
and private improvements that will maintain and enhance the image, livability, and aesthetics of Yuba
City in the years to come.
In recent years, Yuba City has become increasingly committed to high-quality community design –
most clearly exemplified by the successful Town Center redevelopment project, by the Harter and
Buttes Vista specific plans, and by the City’s design guidelines. The Community Design Element
builds on the character of Yuba City and design ideas in these plans, and provides policies that will
promote the maintenance and enhancement of Yuba City’s small town feel and rural heritage.
This chapter presents several overarching guiding principles for community design in Yuba City.
These principles provide the framework for the guiding and implementing policies that follow. These
policies focus on the rural/urban edge, the key vehicular gateways into Yuba City, connections and
corridors linking different areas of the City, urban activity centers, commercial and industrial areas,
and neighborhoods.
4.1      GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The following guiding principles capture the essence of community design, as embodied in this
General Plan.
•   Maintain the identity of Yuba City as a small town community, commercial hub, and residential
    community, surrounded by agricultural land and convey, through land uses and design
    amenities, Yuba City’s character and place in the Sacramento Valley.
•   Recognizing the livability and beauty of peer communities with highly designed visual landscapes,
    commit to a focus on the visual landscape of Yuba City.
•   Maintain, develop, and enhance connections between existing and planned neighborhoods.
•   Create and build upon a structured open space and parks network, centered on two large urban
    parks and the Feather River Corridor.
•   Strive for lush, landscaped public areas marked by extensive tree plantings.
•   Design commercial and industrial centers to be visually appealing, to serve both pedestrians and
    automobiles, and to integrate into the adjacent urban fabric.
                                                      4-1

                                       Yuba City General Plan Update
•   Create new communities and new neighborhoods that are interesting in design and unique in
    character.
4.2     URBAN/RURAL EDGE
The roughly rectangular shaped form of the Yuba City Planning Area is surrounded on three sides by
the rural landscape of Sutter County. The fourth, eastern border is shared with the City of Marysville,
just across the Feather River. Yuba City residents strongly identify with Yuba City’s setting in rural
agricultural Sutter County. Views and images of orchards and crop rows are important aesthetics. By
creating strong city boundaries that emphasize the surrounding natural resources, the City is placed
appropriately in the context of the rural Sacramento Valley.
Currently, agricultural land only loosely denotes the urban
development edge in Yuba City. A sharpening of the urban/rural edge
will help redefine Yuba City’s physical form and create a better sense
of place. The striven-for image is of a cohesive small city set in the
context of rural surroundings. Clearly defined edges create this image;
loosely defined edges are perceived as uncontrolled sprawl.
Furthermore, development outside the urban growth boundaries
would adversely affect agricultural land, which is important to both
the County and the City.
Three straight roadways roughly define the Planning Area boundary
on the north, west, and south of the Planning Area. Bogue Road on
the south, Township Road on the west, and Pease Road on the north
offer opportunities for defining clear boundaries between urban Yuba
City and the rural countryside. These edges, which have been
negotiated between the City and County, create a physical separation Orchard rows along the
between Yuba City and the rural County, keeping Yuba City unique roadways help define the
and identifiable. This chapter offers policies for utilizing these urban/rural edge.
roadways as physical edges of the community and visually distinguish
urban from rural. The fourth edge of the community – the Feather
River corridor that defines the City’s eastern border, is described in
Chapter 6 of this Plan.
GUIDING POLICIES
Urban/Rural Edge
4.2-G-1 Establish a clear distinction between the urban growth area and the surrounding rural and
           agricultural land.
4.2-G-2 Establish a clearly defined, compact form for the urban growth area.

                                             Community Design
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
Urban/Rural Edge
4.2-I-1   Establish a distinct design character for new development along Bogue Road, Township
          Road and Pease Road, as illustrated in Figure 4-1, in order to clearly demarcate the urban
          edge. This will be accomplished by:
          •   Enforcing a 60 foot minimum rear setback requirement on new development along
              these roads;
          •   Creating a 40 to 50 foot wide landscaped buffer within the public right of way;
          •   Planting multiple layers of trees closely for visual impermeability; and
          •   Limiting local access (but allowing collector and arterial access and only a minimal
              number of residential streets) from these roads in order to maintain continuous street
              edges.
4.2-I-2   Create a “soft” transition at the
          urban/agricultural edge by appropriate
          landscape, with large canopy ties that are
          visually compatible with schools.
4.2-I-3   Maintain views into the agricultural lands on
          the rural side of the roadways by:
          •   Not planting within the right-of-way, trees
              spaced farther, and
          •   Designating a minimum of 6 feet of space
              in the right of way for a curb and gutter on
              the rural side of the road.                      The surrounding rural landscape is marked by orchard rows
                                                               and views of the Sutter Buttes.
4.2-I-4   Differentiate the landscape treatment of urban
          edges near key intersections.
4.3     GATEWAYS AND ENTRIES
Strong entries are another important element of community design. This section identifies entry
points and assigns unique features to them. These features will help fulfill the goal of enhancing the
image of Yuba City as an urban area markedly differentiated from the surrounding rural landscape.
Route 99 is the primary entry from the north and south. Route 20, the primary entry from the west
and the Feather River bridges are the eastern entries from Marysville. Garden Highway also is an
important entry to Downtown.
The location and proposed design character of Gateways and Entries are illustrated in Figure 4-2.

GUIDING POLICIES
Gateways and Entries
4.3-G-1 Enhance key city entrances on primary vehicular corridors.
4.3-G-2 Demarcate the transition from rural to urban land with distinct entry features.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
Gateways and Entries
4.3-I-1 Designate Route 99 near Pease Road, Route 99 near Bogue Road, Route 20 near Township
        Road, Garden Highway near Drummond Drive, George Washington near Bogue Road, and
        the Feather River bridges as entry gateways into Yuba City, and create distinctive features at
        these locations, as follows:
         •  Route 99 near Bogue Road and Route 20 near Township Road. These entries are on high
            speed state highways and where regional-scale commercial and office uses are planned.
            Continual vehicle-oriented street lights with welcoming signs attached on each side can
            accentuate both the City gateway and the development nearby. Lush trees planted
            closely on each side of the street can provide another transitional element as one enters
            from the rural area where the roads are marked with fewer trees.
         •  Route 99 near Pease Road. Around this planned highway interchange, planned land uses
            are predominantly residential. South of the planned interchange, this portion of Route
            99 is separated from adjacent homes by a frontage road and landscaping, and the
            environment will remain vehicle-oriented. A welcoming sign, consistent with Caltrans
            standards, can be placed in the right-of-way or on the Pease Road overpass to mark the
            entry.
         •  Garden Highway near Drummond Drive. Low density residential development and an
            elementary school are planned around this intersection. Densely landscaped trees and
            welcoming signs on both sides of the street can subtly announce the entry into the city.
         •  George Washington near Bogue Road. Along George Washington, signs directing traffic
            to different neighborhoods and major amenities in western portion of the city such as
            the two major parks, the panhandle, new neighborhood commercial centers, and the
            parkways can be introduced, coupled with differentiated landscaping, at the
            intersection.
         •  Feather River Bridges and Route 20 near Sutter Street. Bridges alone can provide a sense
            of entry which can be enhanced through signage and landscaping. Welcoming signs on
            the Feather River Bridge coupled with a well-designed entry intersection near the
            terminus of the bridge can enhance the processional experience as one enters the city.
            These signs can direct travelers to Downtown and the planned Feather River park areas.
            Street trees and pedestrian-scale lighting should be introduced to enhance this entry.

4.4     CONNECTIONS & CORRIDORS
The manner in which streets will connect new neighborhoods to shopping areas, parks, schools, and
employment centers is a critical design element. This section focuses on the design of these
connections and the character of new streets. More detail on proposed circulation system
improvements, particularly dimensions for street cross-sections and on-street parking policies, is
presented in Chapter 5 of the General Plan.
The key to enhanced connectivity is to ensure that new neighborhoods are integrated in the City’s
street grid; that streets connect to other streets, both within neighborhoods and to adjacent
neighborhoods and commercial districts. Many existing subdivisions are not connected to one-
another and have few outlets onto major arterials. Also, some collector and arterial corridors in the
City are not well-defined and lack pedestrian amenities and street trees. Improving the streetscape
design of these roadways will contribute to the visual and aesthetic perception of the City as a whole.
This section establishes policies and design concepts to strengthen the main corridors by means of
streetscape improvements and elements that will define and enhance each of them. New streetscape
designs should be tailored to announce and accommodate adjacent amenities such as parks and
commercial centers. Well-designed corridors will join different neighborhoods and activity nodes
together.
Neighborhood Connectivity
Fluid connections between new proposed neighborhoods and existing neighborhoods will be
established by extending existing arterials, creating new streets, and ensuring that new streets connect
with existing streets. For example, Bridge Street and Cherry Street are existing east-west streets
planned to be extended westward to serve the newly planned neighborhoods. To alleviate north-
south traffic from Route 99, two new parkways are planned on the west side of Route 99. Also, new
east-west and north-south local streets are planned to connect the new developing areas to the one-
mile grid system. The overall street network is designed to connect each neighborhood to one
another, to connect neighborhoods to local shopping districts and activity centers, and to provide
accessibility to major urban amenities, parks, open space, and Downtown, and to the regional
highway system. The new street system and hierarchy is discussed further and illustrated in Chapter
5: Transportation.
Routes 20 & 99
Running east-west, Route 20 is a four to six-lane state highway. It extends to the City’s river edge and
turns into Feather River Bridge. Large scale regional commercial activities are concentrated along
Route 20 and around the Route 99/Route 20 intersection. The planned development intensity is
lower near the west edge of the City where office and light industrial activities are to be located.
Route 99 will be a four to six lane state highway that is in a below-grade “cut” north of the Queens
Avenue intersection. Large-scale commercial development is located at the Route 99/20 intersection;
low density residential development exists both north and south of the commercial areas. Regional-
scale office and commercial development are planned along the west side of Route 99 between
Lincoln and Bogue roads.

                                        Yuba City General Plan Update
Design concepts for Routes 20 and 99 envision upgrading the
appearance of the corridors as circulation system improvements, as
illustrated in Figures 4-3 and 4-4.
Parkways
Two new parkways are planned to serve new development in the
western portion of the Yuba City Planning Area. They are
envisioned as roads lined with lush trees on both sides of the road as
well as in the median. An “Arc Parkway” is planned near the
western edge of the growth area, and connects a new park and
mixed use area on the northern edge of the growth area, the regional
scale commercial area near Route 20, and two mixed use areas in the
southwestern corner of urban area. Another parkway is planned to
run north and south from the Harter Specific Plan area south to a
new City park at the south and north to the edge of the urban
                                                                        ”B” Street offers access for Downtown
growth area. This parkway offers a direct access to the southern city   and neighborhoods to the riverfront.
park from the area north of Route 20.
The concept of “parkways”– roadways that function as both a visual corridor and a traffic artery – is
new to Yuba City and is intended to bring uniqueness and visual richness to two new important Yuba
City roadways.
Local Streets: Sutter Street / Second Street / Garden Highway / Bridge Street
Sutter Street and Second Street are the easternmost streets in downtown Yuba City and parallel the
Feather River levee. Second Street serves civic buildings in the downtown area and is lined with
luscious trees and on-street parking spaces. As one travels south on Second Street, the roadway splits
and directs one either east to a boat dock on the Feather River or west to Garden Highway. Garden
Highway is more vehicular-oriented and is lined with automobile-related shops. Although Garden
Highway is the closest vehicular road running parallel to the river, it is three-fourths of a mile from
the river and no view corridors toward the river exist due to distance and the existing levee.
Bridge Street is a major four-lane east-west currently running from the existing western city limit to
the riverfront. Bridge Street is a more established east-west corridor than other corridors running
through recently constructed low-density developments. The roadway connects the eastern side of
Route 99 to downtown Yuba City. The Bridge Street corridor has a cluster of large commercial
properties near the Route 99 intersection and smaller retail properties near Plumas Street and 2nd
Street. A short east-west transit connection on Bridge Street exists between Stabler Lane and Gray
Avenue.

GUIDING POLICIES
Connections and Corridors
4.4-G-1 Create a well-connected hierarchy of streets that serve existing and planned neighborhoods,
         and strengthen the visual and aesthetic character of each major corridor.
4.4-G-2 Create a comfortable street environment for motorized and non-motorized users.
4.4-G-3 Allow for flexibility in streetscapes to accommodate various adjacent land uses.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES:
Residential Streets
4.4-I-1  Design new residential streets with sidewalks, planting strips and traffic-calming elements to
         create a pedestrian-friendly environment.
          Additional policies on neighborhood streets and connectivity are in Chapter 5: Transportation.
          These emphasize the importance of interconnectivity and the need to limit loop streets and cul-
          de-sacs.
Routes 20 & 99
4.4-I-2  Ensure that new non-residential development along Route 20 is oriented toward the
         highway as illustrated in Figure 4-3.
4.4-I-3  Require landscaped setbacks from Route 99 and establish standards for streetscape
         improvements, including planting strips and landscape medians, where appropriate, as
         illustrated in Figure 4-4. Ensure that fences are combined with trees and landscaping in
         order to demarcate residential property lines.
4.4-I-4  Plant trees as visual buffers along the existing industrial and commercial development.
          Clustering of vegetation to allow views of outdoor sales areas and retail store fronts should be
          allowed.
4.4-I-5  Install covered bus shelters and pedestrian-scale street lighting near existing and planned
         bus stops.
4.4-I-6  Plant trees along with masonry fences to buffer existing residential development from the
         highway. Require a minimum 10 feet buffer between the front property line and the edge of
         the road.
Parkways
4.4-I-7  Establish a parkway street cross-section as illustrated in Figure 4-5 and 4-6 characterized by
         the following:
                                                   4-11

           •   A landscaped median with a minimum width of 15 feet and trees that will create a
               continuous, formal appearance.
           •   A symmetrical tree layout for sidewalk planting strips abutting residential
               developments.
           •   Separate bike paths on at least one side of the parkway buffered from vehicular traffic by
               planting strips.
           •   On-street parking only adjacent to the south park and the “panhandle”.
           •   Sidewalks on both sides of the parkway. Wider sidewalks are allowed when abutting
               commercial developments.
           •   A landscaped median is not required for the portions of the parkways adjacent to the
               south park and the “panhandle”. Instead, devote 7 to 8 feet of space on the side of the
               parkways away from these areas for on-street parking.
4.4-I-8   Establish vehicular access controls that limit access to developments from the parkways by:
           •   Limiting left-turn intersections to every half a mile.
           •   Limiting driveway access into new development from parkways.
           These are consistent with Chapter 5: Traffic and Circulation.
S utter Street / Second Street
4.4-I-9   Create a pedestrian-friendly environment on Sutter and
          Second Streets, linking Downtown and the waterfront
          within the Feather River corridor, as illustrated in Figure
          4-7.
4.4-I-10 Provide signage, landscaping, lighting, and other visual
          features to emphasize the existing and planned pedestrian
          access to the riverfront.
4.4-I-11 Ensure that the proposed B Street Plaza helps to showcase
          the steps at the end of B street as a gateway to the river
          park areas by:
           •   Prohibiting construction of buildings or tall elements
               on the eastern edge of the plaza.
           •   Maintaining a low plaza height.                           Bicycle access from Bridge Street to the
           •   Enhancing an open feeling for the plaza as a whole.       Riverfront is an important asset that
                                                                         needs to be protected and enhanced.

4.5      URBAN ACTIVITY CENTERS
To make new centers for development (as proposed in the Chapter 3: Land Use) vibrant and livable,
this Chapter proposes that they be planned as integrated “Activity Centers” where a mix of urban uses
will occur in a pedestrian-oriented, landscaped environment. New residential development will be
located with easy access to these centers, as well as to the new large City Parks. Figure 4-9 illustrates
these conceptual relationships. The Activity Centers fall into two categories:
•   Larger scale Regional Activity Centers are proposed along major roadways and are envisioned to
    be regionally focused, including a range of employment opportunities and retail establishments
    serving a regional need. A center northwest the intersection of Route 99 and Bogue Road and a
    center on Route 20 between George Washington and Township Roads complement existing plans
    for the Harter Specific Plan area and downtown Yuba City.
•   Three locally-oriented Community Activity Centers are planned in the western portion of the
    urban area, two in the southwest quadrant of the planning area, and one in the northeast
    quadrant. These activity centers are envisioned as “Village Centers” that attempt to duplicate the
    small town character of Yuba City as it develops by providing areas where community residents
    meet and shop. Through a mix of housing types, a mix of commercial uses, open space, schools,
    and community facilities, a sense of place can be achieved in newly developing areas.
This section focuses on design concepts for urban
activity centers. Additional design guidance on land use
and development standards for commercial and
residential areas are in Section 4.6, Commercial &
Industrial Development, and                  Section 4.7,
Neighborhoods.

         business park and commercial development opportunities; create an efficient circulation
         pattern; and provide a mix of uses as described in the Specific Plan.
4.5-I-3  Using a developer’s master plan or a City-initiated Specific Plan, create two new Regional
         Activity Centers; one center northwest of the intersection of Route 99 and Bogue Road and
         one center on Route 20 between George Washington and Township Roads. These plans are
         to include provisions for the following:
          •   An integrated mix of regionally-oriented uses;
          •   Highly landscaped business parks and office parks;
          •   A unified design theme throughout the development, marked by consistent signage,
              plantings, street lighting, street furniture, roadway markings, and building design
              characteristics;
          •   Pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly environments;
          •   Facilities to ensure access by public transit;
          •   Tree planting programs;
          •   Appropriate internal circulation and adequate connections to arterials and State
              highways;
          •   Landscaped buffers and edges with parkways, marked by berms, trees, and limited curb
              cuts, where applicable;
          •   A mix of residential uses, with over 65 percent in the medium to high density category;
          •   Pathway and local street connections to integrated residential development;
          •   Public open space, plazas, and green space; and
          •   Perimeter buffering to protect existing neighborhoods.
Community Activity Centers
4.5-I-4  Establish minimum standards for public open space and central plazas in at least 5 percent
         of the gross area in each center. Streets leading to the central plazas should provide a
         processional experience by incorporating elements such as continuous signage and street
         lights.
                                                    4-20

                                                Community Design
           Squares and plazas should be at least 20,000 square feet in size and be centrally located, within
           a quarter mile of 90 percent of residents living in a Community Activity Center.
4.5-I-5   Cluster nonresidential uses in Community Activity Centers around public open spaces and
          plazas.
           Secondary plazas and pocket parks can provide additional focal points.
4.5-I-6   Establish minimum standards for pedestrian-oriented circulation:
           •   Require non-residential buildings to be oriented toward the street. The ground-level
               façade facing the street should be transparent and be articulated to human scale to
               create pedestrian-oriented sidewalks.
           •   Allow credit for on-street parking. All streets in a neighborhood commercial core
               should provide on-street parking.
           •   Require parking areas to have centrally located pedestrian access with rows of canopy
               trees to provide shadow walkways.
           •   Divide off-street parking into small areas whenever possible and connect them to
               sidewalks or pedestrian pathways.
           •   Encourage buildings to be located at the street by establishing maximum setback or
               “build-to lines”, with appropriate step-backs for upper stories;
           •   Requiring awnings and canopies for pedestrian comfort, where appropriate; and
4.6     COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
The policies and design concepts in this section are directed toward creating commercial and
industrial developments that are attractive and well-integrated into the community. The recently-
developed large-scale neighborhood and regional commercial centers in Yuba City are vehicle-
oriented and the buildings have large setbacks from the street line for provision of parking lots.
Community commercial centers, located adjacent to residential neighborhoods, provide goods and
services to local residents and are assumed to serve both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Commercial
uses inevitably need to provide parking spaces; however, careful site planning can provide better
connections to neighborhoods and vehicular corridors.
Regional commercial areas will primarily service vehicular traffic. Located along highways, these
areas will have less relationship with the street than community or neighborhood commercial areas.
However, internal pedestrian pathways should provide safe and well-connected walking
environment. The architecture of regional commercial buildings should be articulated to minimize
“boxy” appearance.
                                                      4-21

                                      Yuba City General Plan Update
GUIDING POLICIES
Commercial & Industrial Development
4.6-G-1 Ensure that the new large-scale commercial and industrial development responds to the
        surrounding development in its building scale, form, and buffering of adjacent uses.
4.6-G-2 Ensure that new large-scale commercial development provides pedestrian access to the
        surrounding neighborhoods and within the development itself.
4.6-G-3 Ensure that new large-scale industrial development is
        buffered from residential neighborhoods but allow
        design flexibility within these areas to promote
        economic development.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
Commercial & Industrial Development
4.6-I-1 Establish the following design standards for new
        commercial development:
         •   Orientation requirements so entries face
             streets. Where development is adjacent to an           Amenities, such as the fountain in the Yuba
             arterial or parkway, it also needs to be               City Town Center can enhance office and
             “outward looking” with the perimeter oriented          industrial environments.
             to vehicular traffic.
         •   Prohibitions of blank walls along streets and other public visible building elevations.
         •   Build-to-lines – maximum setback distances along pedestrian-oriented streets.
             Where a pedestrian environment exists or is desired, the City may want to create street
             segments with store fronts closer to the sidewalk. This concept would not apply where large
             format, auto-oriented retail uses are planned.
         •   Architectural articulation to modulate the horizontal and vertical scale of large-
             commercial buildings.
         •   Awnings and canopies on the street-fronting façade along pedestrian-oriented streets to
             provide weather protection for pedestrians.
         •   Pedestrian-scale signs throughout new commercial development.
         •   Landscaped strips to separate parking lot from street sidewalks.
4.6-I-2 Require publicly accessible, open space, such as outdoor eating areas, to be integrated into
        large-scale office and industrial developments.
         This requirement would not apply to locations that are within walking distance of public parks.
                                                   4-22

                                              Community Design
4.6-I-3   Require community and neighborhood commercial development to provide pedestrian
          access to the surrounding neighborhoods and within the development complex.
4.6-I-4   Require landscaped compatibility buffers and screening along the edges of industrial areas
          adjacent to residential areas and parkland.
4.7      NEIGHBORHOODS
While the policies presented previously in this chapter relating to edge conditions and roadway
corridors have implications that apply to the City as a whole, this section addresses design and
character at a more focused scale, within neighborhoods. A neighborhood is defined as an area of at
least 160 acres, with an approximate quarter mile radius from its “center” that includes a mix of uses.
Creating and maintaining quality neighborhoods is a key initiative of this General Plan. Existing
neighborhoods should be maintained and improved, and new neighborhoods in Yuba City should be
developed with a strong sense of identity. Policies and design concepts in this section are intended to
create a “sense of place” in new neighborhoods, by recognizing and strengthening the fundamental
elements of traditional neighborhoods. These building blocks included a mix of housing types (as
illustrated in Figure 4-10), parks, and community facilities; organized around a neighborhood focal
point.
GUIDING POLICIES
Neighborhood Structure
4.7-G-1 Encourage development of diverse and distinctive neighborhoods.
4.7-G-2 Develop a sense of neighborhood identity through design elements and neighborhood focal
          points, such as commercial areas, schools, parks, community centers, or a combination of
          these elements.
4.7-G-3 Ensure that new street networks are coherent and provide multimodal access within and
          between neighborhoods.
4.7-G-4 Maintain and enhance the character of existing neighborhoods by undertaking streetscape
          and signage improvements.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
Neighborhood Structure
4.7-I-1   Require new neighborhoods to include components such as a mix of housing types, open
          spaces, and community facilities, oriented to a neighborhood center.
4.7-I-2   Continue to use the City’s Design Guidelines in development review and prepare a design
          standards “checklist” for new requirements established by this General Plan.
4.7-I-3   Provide a variety of lot sizes within a neighborhood to foster diverse housing types.
                                                    4-23

                                           Yuba City General Plan Update
4.7-I-4   Continue to require on-site common open spaces in multi-family residential development
Street/Building Relationship
4.7-I-5   Require new housing to provide transitions between the street and building, with variable
          front setbacks, building articulation and massing.
           Elements such as porches, bay windows, and landscaping can be designed to create a transition
           between public and private spaces.
4.7-I-6    Minimize the visual dominance of garages by establishing specific standards in the zoning
          ordinance, including:
           •   Limiting the front width of a house that can be occupied with a garage to be no more
               than one-half the building width; or
           •   Requiring garages to be setback from the front façade or located in the rear half of the
               lot; or
           •   Requiring additional setback if more than a two-car garage entrance is provided;
           •   Orienting garage doors 90 degrees from the street; or
           •   Encouraging use of alleys in new development, with garages accessed from the rear; and
           •   Incorporating design elements on the second level above the garages such as accessory
               dwelling units, bay windows or balconies.
           Figure 4-12 shows the housing typology envisioned for this plan, including ideas about how to
           address garage location.
Streets and Blocks
4.7-I-7   Ensure that the Subdivision Regulations encourage a fine-grained and integrated pattern of
          streets that provide continuity between neighborhoods, have a human scale, and enhance
          the character of neighborhoods.
           •   Promote closer spacing between intersections of local streets and limit the maximum
               block length to 660 feet in low density residential areas and 500 feet in medium and
               high density residential areas.
           •   Limit use of cul-de-sacs to no more than ten percent of the length of all streets in a
               subdivision map.
           •   Where cul de sacs are used, require pedestrian and bicycle connections through the end
               to adjacent streets, if a connection is needed to a school, park, retail, or connector street.
4.7-I-8   Design local streets to not only accommodate traffic, but also to serve as comfortable
          pedestrian environments. These should include, but not be limited to:
           •   Street tree planting adjacent to curb and between the street and sidewalk to provide a
               buffer between the pedestrian and the automobile, where appropriate; and
                                                       4-24

                                              Community Design
          •   Sidewalks on both sides of streets, where feasible.
Neighborhood Identity & Boundaries
4.7-I-9  Place design elements that signify neighborhood identities at the neighborhood entrances
         and at neighborhood centers or focal points.
          Elements such as a name plaque at the central open space and street lights with signs attached to
          them running along a main commercial street can instill a sense of neighborhood identity.
4.7-I-10 Create a sense of a neighborhood identity by gradually decreasing densities away from
         neighborhood focal points.
          The focal points include plazas, squares and neighborhood centers.
4.7-I-11 Avoid using walls as a neighborhood boundary. Solid edges prevent fluid access in and out
         of neighborhoods.
Conserving & Enhancing Existing Neighborhoods
4.7-I-12 Work with neighborhood groups on initiatives that would improve or enhance:
          •   Street trees;
          •   Signage;
          •   Street and alley improvements;
          •   Neighborhood parks.
Undergrounding Utilities
4.7-I-13 Require new developments to underground all utilities needed to serve future buildings and
         their occupants and work with PG&E to establish undergrounding of utilities in existing
         residential neighborhoods, where financially feasible.

The Transportation Element is intended to provide guidance and specific actions to ensure the
continued safe and efficient operation of Yuba City’s circulation system. The Element is based on a
fundamental philosophy that traffic conditions in the City can be managed through a comprehensive
program of transportation planning, land use planning, and growth management strategies. This
Element includes provisions for roadway, transit, airport, pedestrian, and bicycle transportation
modes, as well as parking.
The Transportation Element responds directly to the Government Code, which requires "a
circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of existing and proposed major
thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all
correlated with the land use element of the plan.”
State Law recognizes that circulation and land use are closely related and requires that policies in this
Element and the Land Use Element be tied together. Careful integration of the City’s traffic and
circulation policies with its land use policies will ensure that there is sufficient roadway capacity to
accommodate traffic generated by planned future development. The City is committed to designing a
system of regional routes, local roads, public transit, and bicycle and pedestrian pathways that will
enhance the community and protect the environment.
The Land Use Element includes policies related to the physical framework for development that the
circulation system is designed to serve, and includes policies for the Airport environs. The
Community Design Element addresses landscaping along major streets and planning for new
neighborhoods to ensure street connectivity. It also addresses how to create pedestrian-friendly
environments and design for alternate modes. The Noise Element includes policies to alleviate noise
generated by traffic
5.1      GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Yuba City’s Transportation Element incorporates three strategies. First, transportation programs are
based on circulation system planning and land use planning. Second, the City’s traffic circulation
planning efforts are integrated with those of the County and Caltrans in a cooperative, regional
planning effort. Third, state of the art traffic engineering is used to bring planned improvements to
reality. Only through the development and implementation of all these strategies can the City’s
commitment to a balanced, efficient circulation system be achieved.
Another objective of this Plan Element is to create a balanced transportation system that serves
bicyclists and pedestrians as well as motor vehicles. The original street layout provided street
connections linking neighborhoods with work places. As the community has grown, connections
between neighborhoods, shopping areas, and business locations have not always served residents'
transportation needs, so the General Plan provides for new routes in partially developed portions of
the Planning Area, and expansion of capacity and efficiency of the existing system; the Plan also
provides ways to reduce auto-dependence by facilitating use of alternate modes of travel.

5.2        ROADWAY SYSTEM
At the core of Yuba City’s circulation network is the roadway system. All modes of transportation
depend to some degree upon the roadway system. In Yuba City, this system is based on a traditional
grid pattern. Although this pattern has been modified in recent years to include some suburban
curvilinear streets in the southern and western portions of the City, the predominant pattern is grid-
based and defined by major roadways such as Highway 99, State Route 20, Bridge Street, Live Oak
Boulevard and Franklin Road. The roadway system is further defined by the Feather River due to the
constraints it poses.
                                                           STREET SYSTEM
                                                           Yuba City’s roadway system is set up around a
                                                           hierarchy of street types, which are commonly
                                                           referred to as functional classifications. The
                                                           functional classifications for most major streets are as
                                                           follows:
                                                           Freeways. Freeways serve regional and inter-city
                                                           travel and should not become the optimum route for
                                                           intra-city trips. Access is controlled, grade crossings
                                                           are separated, and medians separate lanes moving in
                                                           opposite directions. Typical free flow speeds exceed
 Several Yuba City roadways are planned for upgrades and   55 miles per hour.
 improvements.
                                                           Highways. Highways are designed to carry heavy
traffic volumes at speeds of 40-55 miles per hour. Highways should serve longer distance intra-city
travel as well as linking the City with other nearby urban areas. Access is limited, crossings are
generally signalized at grade, parking is not allowed, and a continuous median separates lanes moving
in opposite directions.
Arterials. Arterials are designed to move large volumes of traffic between freeways/highways and
other arterials in Yuba City and to adjacent jurisdictions. Major arterials are access controlled
roadways emphasizing mobility between major portions of the city and to regional freeways and
highways. Minor arterials provide mobility through the city and access to major residential,
employment, and activity centers. On-street parking should not be provided on major arterials but
may be appropriate for minor arterials that emphasize accessibility over mobility. Minor arterials
should provide two travel lanes. Driveway access should be minimized, consistent with the primary
function of arterials to move through traffic. Bike lanes, landscaped parkstrips, sidewalks, and transit
facilities may also accommodated within the right-of-way of minor arterials, depending on the right-
of-way width.
Parkways. Parkways provide an attractive, limited access link between residential communities and
commercial centers. Parkways should be tree-lined with landscaped medians. Curbs should be
provided but curb cuts should be limited. On-street parking should not be provided. Parkways
should provide four travel lanes and accommodate higher-speed travel.
                                                             5-2

                                                  Transportation
Collectors. Collector streets provide a link between neighborhood streets and arterials. Collectors
provide two travel lanes, in addition to any bike lanes where called for in the bikeway plan. In fact, all
collectors should be designed to include bicycle lanes. On-street parking may be provided if sufficient
width is available. Collectors also provide access to adjacent properties, so driveway access should be
discouraged but need not be restricted (subject to accepted engineering practice). Collector streets are
shown on the General Plan Diagram. Bike lanes, landscaped parkstrips, sidewalks, and transit
facilities may also be accommodated depending on the right-of-way available.
Neighborhood Streets. The primary function of neighborhood streets is to provide direct access to
adjacent properties. Neighborhood streets should provide two travel lanes, landscaped parkstrips,
and sidewalks. On-street parking may be restricted. Bike lanes are usually not needed because
neighborhood streets carry low traffic volumes and all neighborhood streets are considered to be
bicycle friendly. Neighborhood streets are not shown on the General Plan Diagram or Figure 5.1:
Roadway System and Functional Classifications.
LEVEL OF SERVICE
To determine the operating conditions of a roadway segment or intersection, the concept of level of
service (LOS) is commonly used. The LOS grading system is a ratings scale ranging from LOS A to
LOS F, with LOS A representing free-flow conditions and LOS F representing congested conditions
(see Table 5-1). This element establishes LOS policies for use in the development review process. In
addition, the Route Concept Report (RCR) – State Route 20, Caltrans District 3, published in July 1989,
identifies LOS E as the concept criteria for study intersections and roadways on State Route (SR) 20
segments located within the Yuba City limits.
 Table 5-1: Traffic LOS Definitions.
         LOS         Traffic Flow Conditions
           A         Free-flowing; speed is controlled by drivers’ desires, stipulated
                     speed limits, or physical roadway conditions.
           B         Stable flow; operating speeds beginning to be restricted; little or
                     no restrictions on maneuverability from other vehicles.
           C         Stable flow; speeds and maneuverability more closely restricted;
                     occasional backups behind left-turning vehicles at intersections.
          D          Conditions approach unstable flow; tolerable speeds can be
                     maintained but temporary restrictions may cause extensive
                     delays; little freedom to maneuver; comfort and convenience
                     low; at intersections, some motorists, especially those making
                     left turns, may wait through one or more signal changes.
           E         Conditions approach capacity; unstable flow with stoppages of
                     momentary duration; maneuverability severely limited.
           F         Forced flow conditions; stoppages for long periods; low
                     operating speeds. Delays at intersections average 60 seconds or
                     more.
Also, based on the Route Concept Report (RCR) – State Route 99, Caltrans District 3, published in July
1989, SR 99 has a concept LOS of E from Bogue Road north to the junction with SR 20. North of SR
20, SR 99 has a concept LOS of D.

2001 TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
Roadway Segments
Traffic conditions, based on traffic counts conducted in October 2001, for forty road segments in
Yuba City are shown in Table 5-2. Based on the roadway LOS thresholds, all the study roadway
segments included in Table 5-2 operate at acceptable LOS except for the following locations:
•   SR 20, east of Sutter, the Feather River Bridge, is operating at LOS F. The existing four lanes on
    the bridge cannot accommodate the high traffic volume of approximately 42,000 vehicles per day.
    The bridge becomes a “bottleneck” and reduces the transportation mobility between Yuba City
    and the City of Marysville.
•   The Twin Cities Bridge is operating at LOS F. The existing two-lane bridge cannot adequately
    accommodate the high traffic volume of approximately 22,000 vehicles per day.
•   Gray Avenue between Washington Avenue and State Route 20 carries approximately 18,600 daily
    trips and operates at LOS D.
Both of the existing bridges are exempted from the City’s roadway LOS requirements, as noted in
policy 5.2-I-12.
Intersections
Traffic conditions, based on peak hour traffic counts conducted in October 2001, for fourteen
intersections in Yuba City are shown in Table 5-3. Based on the intersection LOS thresholds, all the
study intersections included in Table 5-3 operate at acceptable LOS or better, with the exception of
the following locations:
•   Queens Avenue/Stabler lane operates at LOS E in the a.m. peak hour.
•   Queens Avenue/West Onstott Frontage Road operates at LOS E in both a.m. and p.m. peak
    hours. However, the methodology used to determine LOS for two-way stop-controlled
    intersections refers to the movement with the worst delay. The overall operation of the
    intersection is LOS C or better during both peak hours.

To achieve a balance between existing and future land use and traffic carrying capacity,
improvements to the roadway network are planned. Major street improvements planned or
programmed for Yuba City are listed in Table 5-4 and shown in Figure 5-1. These improvements
include enhancements to Highway 99 and State Route 20. Highway 99 will be widened between
Bogue Road and Lincoln Road to 6 lanes. State Route 20 from Highway 99 to Civic Center Drive is
proposed to be widened from 4 to 6 lanes. Other key improvements include two new north-south
parkways to provide better connections; a new bridge as an extension of Lincoln Road; and numerous
new collector and local streets, as shown in Figure 5-1, to provide a well-connected circulation
system.

CONNECTIVITY
The traditional grid system in Yuba City’s older neighborhoods allows for through movement and
good connections between and within neighborhoods. Short blocks offer a choice of routes and
enable more direct connections. While Yuba City's traditional neighborhoods are based on an
orthogonal grid, variations can also allow for diagonal and curvilinear streets as well as larger or
smaller blocks for maximum flexibility and improved connectivity.
                                                      5-8

                                               Transportation
In contrast, many of the recently-completed neighborhoods are built using many cul-de-sacs. This
type of design promotes circuitous travel and results in traffic being distributed along fewer streets
where heavy traffic walls-in neighborhoods and requires sound walls. More desirable is a grid-based
development that balances sense of proximity and ease of access with the quieter environments of the
newer neighborhoods.
In order to ensure that street layout in future development incorporates the need for neighborhood
connectivity and the comfort and safety of pedestrians and bicyclists consistent with the Community
Design Chapter, it is essential that:
•   New development be more "connected" to the surroundings with an increased number of access
    points and pedestrian and bicycle connections to the neighborhood network;
•   Blocks be short to allow for more direct connections;
•   Neighborhood streets be designed at a human-scale, without excessive cross-sections; and
•   Traffic controls, including speed limits, signage and truck routes, restrict commercial traffic in
    neighborhoods.
GUIDING POLICIES
Circulation and Street System
5.2-G-1 Promote safe and efficient vehicle circulation.
5.2-G-2 Make efficient use of existing transportation facilities, and, through the arrangement of land
          uses, improved alternate transportation modes, and provision of more direct routes for
          pedestrians and bicyclists, strive to reduce the total vehicle-miles traveled per household.
5.2-G-3 Provide fair and equitable means for paying for future street improvements.
5.2-G-4 Coordinate local actions with state and County agencies to ensure consistency.
Traffic Level of Service
5.2-G-5 Maintain acceptable levels of service and ensure that future development and the
           circulation system are in balance.
Arterial Roadways
5.2-G-6 Design arterial roadways to carry high-volume, higher-speed traffic, thereby minimizing
           through traffic residential streets. Develop a system of arterial roadways in the form of a
           grid of four-lane arterials that will distribute traffic evenly and will avoid excessive
           concentrations of traffic in any given area.
5.2-G-7 Maximize the carrying capacity of arterial roadways by controlling the number of
           intersections and driveways, prohibiting residential access, and requiring sufficient off-
           street parking to meet the needs of each project.
                                                    5-9

                                        Yuba City General Plan Update
5.2-G-8 Provide center turn lanes in areas with existing “front-on” development. Planted medians
           are preferred in areas without existing front-on development.
Parkways
5.2-G-9 Design parkways to provide attractive, higher-speed, tree-lined roadways with limited
           access between residential and commercial areas.
Collector and Local Roadways
5.2-G-10 Design and reconfigure collector and local roadways to improve circulation and to connect
           residential and commercial areas of the City.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
Circulation and Street System
5.2-I-1   Locate arterials and collectors according to the general alignments shown in Figure 5-1.
           Minor variations from the depicted alignments will not require a General Plan amendment.
5.2-I-2   Establish precise alignments and cross-sections based on the General Plan Diagram and
           Figure 5-1 in order to identify future right-of-way needs.
          This can be done by adjusting an “official map” that delineates future right-of-way lines.
5.2-I-3   Adopt street standards that provide flexibility in design, especially in residential
           neighborhoods. Revise right of way and pavement standards to reflect adjacent land use
           and/or anticipated traffic, and permit reduced right of way dimensions where necessary to
           maintain neighborhood character.
5.2-I-4   Require all new developments to provide right-of-way and improvements consistent with
           street designations on Figure 5-1 and City street section standards.
5.2-I-5   Continue to require that new development pays a fair share of the costs of street and other
           traffic and transportation improvements based on traffic generated and impacts on service
           levels.
5.2-I-6   Require city-wide traffic impact fees on all new development to ensure that transportation
           improvements keep pace with new development.
          The objective of this policy is to establish a secure funding source to enable timely construction of
          traffic improvements. Citywide impact fees have been an extremely successful way of
          accomplishing infrastructure improvements throughout California. The City intends to ensure
          that no additional development is approved without a concurrent commitment by the City
          and/or the developer to construct commensurate transportation improvements, as needed, or to
          pay appropriate fees in lieu of, to serve the development and maintain acceptable levels of
          service on roadways and intersections.
                                                       5-10

                                               Transportation
5.2-I-7   When constructing or modifying roadways, plan for usage of the roadway space by all users,
          including motor vehicles, transit vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians.
5.2-I-8   Continue to work with Caltrans to achieve timely construction of programmed freeway and
          interchange improvements and state highway improvements.
5.2-I-9   Work with Caltrans and regional authorities to develop a minimum of four additional
          traffic lanes of cross-river capacity by the end of the General Plan period.
          This would be accomplished by a 3rd bridge.
5.2-I-10 Work with SACOG to ensure that General Plan amendments are incorporated in the
          regional traffic model and incorporated into analysis required for Metropolitan
          Transportation Improvement Plan updates.
5.2-I-11 Maintain the street network through a regular maintenance program, repave streets on a
          regular basis, and require that any pavement that has been damaged or dug up be returned
          to its original condition, with no bumps or ruts.
          Street maintenance and repaving programs should be based on current technology and accepted
          practices to maximize available revenues and improvements.
Traffic Level of Service
5.2-I-12 Develop and manage the roadway system to obtain LOS D or better for
          all major roadways and intersections in the City. This policy does not extend to residential
          streets (i.e., streets with direct driveway access to homes) or bridges across the Feather
          River nor does the policy apply to state highways and their intersections, where Caltrans
          policies apply. Exceptions to LOS D policy may be allowed by the City Council in areas,
          such as downtown, where allowing a lower LOS would result in clear public benefits.
          Specific exceptions granted by the Council shall be added to the list of exceptions below:
          •   SR 20 (SR 99 to Feather River Bridge) – LOS F is acceptable;
          •   SR 20 (Feather River Bridge) – LOS F is acceptable;
          •   Bridge Street (Twin Cities Bridge) – LOS F is acceptable; and
          •   Lincoln Road (New Bridge across the Feather River) – LOS F is acceptable.
          No new development will be approved unless it can be shown that required level of service
          can be maintained on the affected roadways.
5.2-I-13 Develop and manage residential streets (i.e., streets with direct driveway access to homes) to
          limit average daily vehicle traffic volumes to 2,500 or less and 85th percentile speeds to 25
          miles per hour or less.
5.2-I-14 Require traffic impact studies for all proposed new developments that will generate
          significant amounts of traffic.
          Specific thresholds will be based on location and project type, and exceptions may be granted
          where traffic studies have been completed for adjacent development.
                                                    5-11

                                       Yuba City General Plan Update
5.2-I-15 Improve intersections as needed to maintain LOS standards and safety on major arterials.
5.2-I-16 Establish and implement additional programs to maintain adequate levels of service at
          intersections and along roadway segments as circumstances warrant, including the
          following actions:
         •    Collect and analyze traffic volume data on a regular basis and monitor current
              intersection and roadway segment levels of service on a regular basis. Use this
              information to update and refine the City's travel forecasting model so that estimates of
              future conditions are more strongly based upon local travel behavior and trends.
         •    Consider, on a case by case basis, how to shift travel demand away from the peak
              period, especially in those situations where peak traffic problems result from a few
              major generators (e.g. outlying employment locations), and how major roadway capital
              investments can be deferred and/or reallocated to more pressing needs.
         •    Perform routine, ongoing evaluation of the efficiency of the urban street traffic control
              system, with emphasis on traffic signal timing, phasing and coordination to optimize
              traffic flow along arterial corridors. Use traffic control systems to balance arterial street
              utilization (e.g., timing and phasing for turn movements, peak period and off-peak
              signal timing plans).
5.2-I-17 Monitor regional/arterial street LOS at
          regular intervals to determine if the LOS
          standard is being met, and provide
          information needed to maintain a
          calibrated citywide traffic model.
Parkways
5.2-I-18 Develop two parkways along the alignments
          shown in Figure 5-1.
         These parkways should have four travel lanes,
         a planted median, turn pockets where
         appropriate, Class I or II bicycle lanes,          Left-turn pockets should be integrated into landscape
         detached sidewalks, and generous planting          medians.
         strips.
5.2-I-19 Prohibit on-street parking along parkways where there is “front-on” development.
5.2-I-20 Require a minimum average distance of one quarter mile between parkway intersections,
          except in commercial areas or other high volume traffic areas.
         See also Chapter 4: Community Design policies on parkways.
Collectors and Neighborhood Streets
5.2-I-21 Implement traffic calming measures to slow traffic on local and collector residential streets
          and prioritize these measures over congestion management. Include roundabouts, traffic
          circles, and other traffic calming devices among these measures.
                                                    5-12

                                               Transportation
5.2-I-22 Provide for greater street connectivity by:
           •   Incorporating in subdivision regulations requirements for a minimum number of
               access points to existing local or collector streets for each development (e.g. at least two
               access points for every 10 acres of development);
           •   Encouraging circles and roundabouts over signals.
           •   Requiring the bicycle and pedestrian connections from cul-de-sacs to nearby public
               areas and main streets.
           •   Requiring new residential communities undeveloped land planned for urban uses to
               provide stubs for future connections to the edge of the property line. Where stubs exist
               on adjacent properties, new streets within the development should connect to these
               stubs.
5.3     TRANSIT
Transit service and facilities in Yuba City are provided by both public and private operators. The
following outlines each service and identifies major facilities.
Public Transit
Yuba-Sutter Transit is the public transit operator for Yuba City, providing many transit options for
residents and visitors. Yuba-Sutter Transit currently operates four fixed routes within the City with
loops connecting major activity centers, residential neighborhoods, Caltrans Park & Ride facilities,
and the City of Marysville. A Dial-A-Ride service is provided for senior citizens, disabled persons, or
residents that live beyond one-quarter mile from a fixed-route. The Yuba-Sutter Transit fixed-routes
are shown on Figure 5-2, as are major transit stops and transfer stations.
Service outside Yuba City includes a weekday commuter express service to and from Sacramento and
Lincoln. A weekday regional service is also provided which includes round trips to and from Live
Oak, Wheatland, and the foothills.
Private Service
Private transit service in Yuba City is provided by taxi and limousine services.
GUIDING POLICIES
5.3-G-1 Continue to expand and improve the existing transit network to provide convenient and
           efficient public transportation to workplaces, shopping, and other destinations.
5.3-G-2 Preserve options for future transit use when designing improvements for roadways.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES

            Require new development to provide transit improvements, where needed. This includes:
           •   Direct pedestrian access to transit stops;
           •   Bus turnouts and shelters; and
           •   Lane width to accommodate buses.
5.3-I-5    Ensure that new development is designed to make transit a viable choice for residents.
            Design options include:
           •   Have Neighborhood focal points with sheltered bus stops;
           •   Locate medium-high density development whenever feasible near streets served by
               transit; and
           •   Link neighborhoods to bus stops by continuous sidewalks or pedestrian paths.
5.3-I-6    Require community care facilities and senior housing projects with more than 25 units to
            provide accessible transportation services for the convenience of residents.
           Provision of transportation services at large facilities will reduce demand on the Dial-A-Ride
           and fixed-route transit systems.
5.4      BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION
Bicycling and walking are important modes of transportation and are inexpensive, energy conserving,
and non-polluting. Yuba City's flat topography and warm climate, make choosing to walk or bicycle a
attractive transportation option.
Although bicycle and pedestrian facilities are provided in Yuba City, some gaps still exist in the
transportation networks for these modes. Some bicycle paths and bicycle lanes exist, but they are not
continuous. As pedestrian and bicycle travel is directly related to perceived safety and convenience,
providing a safe and complete network of pedestrian and bicycle facilities should continue to increase
the use of these modes of travel, especially when crossing heavily traveled roads such as State Route 20
and Highway 99.
BIKEWAYS
There are three types of bikeway classifications, as shown in Table 5-5. A “Class I” bikeway, also
referred to as a bike path, is a right-of-way that is completely separated from any street. A “Class II”
bikeway, or bike lane, is a one-way, striped, and signed lane on a street. A “Class III” bike route shares
the road with pedestrians and motor vehicle traffic and is marked only by signs.
In Yuba City, existing and planned bicycle facilities are identified in the Yuba-Sutter Bikeway Master
Plan. This document also contains the goals and policies for providing bicycle facilities in Yuba City.
Existing bicycle facilities in Yuba City primarily consist of Class II bike lanes on arterials and
collectors.

PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION
Pedestrian flow patterns show similarities to vehicular traffic stream characteristics. Speed, flow rate,
and density are interrelated. Capacity and density for pedestrians are dependent on width of the
walking facility and the type of walking facility (e.g., walkways, crosswalks, and street corners). For
crosswalks, pedestrian capacity and waiting time is affected by turning vehicles, signal timing,
pedestrian/vehicle right-of-way laws, and pedestrian platoons meeting in the middle of the street.
Street corners at signalized intersections are holding areas as well, and can be a critical location in the
sidewalk network.
While sidewalk capacity is not an issue, in general, all areas should be designed to a scale that
accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. Improvements in areas within the City that currently have
undersized or no pedestrian facilities should be made a priority so that the pedestrian system will be
better connected. The new neighborhood centers should also be designed to be "pedestrian friendly."
In these areas, wider sidewalks should be considered to accommodate increased flows and to give
                                                          5-17

preferential treatment to pedestrians. Pedestrian-friendly
facilities should also be provided near transit stops and
adjacent to medium and higher density residential areas.
GUIDING POLICY
5.4-G-1 Develop a system of sidewalks and bikeways
             that promote safe walking and bicycle riding
             for transportation and recreation.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
5.4-I-1     Establish a network of on- and off-roadway            Downtown streetscape improvements have provided
             bicycle routes and encourage their use for           attractive spaces for pedestrians.
             commute, recreational, and other trips. Design
             bike routes with the safety of cyclists as a
             priority.
5.4-I-2     Develop bicycle routes that provide access to schools, parks, and the Feather River Parkway.
5.4-I-3     Require bicycle parking, storage, and other support facilities as part of new office and retail
             developments, and public facilities.
5.4-I-4     Provide bicycle lanes with a minimum width of five feet (six feet along all parkways) on new
             streets and existing streets whenever they are widened to more than two travel lanes.
5.4-I-5     Plan for reuse of abandoned rail rights-of-way, and seek to acquire suitable rights-of-way
             for separate bicycle paths, as they become available.
            State and Federal funding for “rails-to-trails” programs can help the City implement this
            policy. An example of how a bikeway and road can be developed along the abandoned railroad
            is shown in Figure 5-3.
5.4-I-6     Work with Sutter County and other agencies to update the Yuba-Sutter Bikeway Master
             Plan, implement a regional bikeway system and, maintain a regularly updated map of local
             and regional bikeways.
5.4-I-7     Increase bicycle safety by:
            •    Sweeping and repairing bicycle lanes and paths on a regular basis;
            •    Ensuring that bikeways are delineated and signed in accordance with Caltrans' stan-
                 dards, and lighting is provided, where needed;
            •    Providing bicycle paths or lanes on bridges and overpasses;
            •    Ensuring that all new and improved streets have bicycle-safe drainage grates and are
                 free of hazards such as uneven pavement and gravel;

          •   Provide adequate signage and markings warning vehicular traffic of the existence of
              merging or crossing bicycle traffic where bike routes and paths make transitions into or
              across roadways; and
          •   Work with the Yuba City Unified School District to promote classes on bicycle safety in
              the schools.
5.4-I-8   Give bikes equal treatment in terms of provisions for safety and comfort on arterials and
          collectors as motor vehicles.
5.4-I-9   Develop a series of continuous walkways within new office parks, commercial districts, and
          residential neighborhoods so they connect to one another.
5.4-I-10 Provide for pedestrian-friendly zones in conjunction with the development, redevelopment,
          and design of mixed-use neighborhood core areas, the Downtown area, schools, parks, and
          other high use areas by:
          •   Providing intersection "bump outs" to reduce walking distances across streets in the
              Downtown and other high use areas;
          •   Providing pedestrian facilities at all signalized intersections;
          •   Providing landscaping that encourages pedestrian use; and
          •   Constructing adequately lit and safe access through subdivision sites.
5.4-I-11 Establish specific standards for pedestrian facilities to be accessible to physically disabled
          persons, and ensure that roadway improvement projects address mobility or accessibility
          for bicyclists or pedestrians.
5.5     PARKING
It is important to balance the need for enough parking to sustain existing activity and attract new
development with the need to reserve curb space for bus stops and with the City's financial ability to
meet other public needs. Parking decisions affect land use and development patterns, as well as travel
behavior. The placement and type of parking must accommodate the needs of businesses (who view
parking as a marketing tool), pedestrians (who can view parking as a barrier when parking blocks
walking paths), motorists (who want to park as close to their destination as possible), and residents
(who desire both on-street and off-street parking).
GUIDING POLICIES
5.5-G-1 Provide attractive and convenient parking facilities.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
5.5-I-12 Use parking standards to support trip reduction goals by:
          •   Allowing parking reductions for projects that have agreed to implement trip reduction
              methods, such as paid parking, and for mixed-use developments; and
                                                    5-20

                                              Transportation
          •   Requiring projects preferential parking for carpools and vanpools in non-retail projects
              with more than 100 employees.
5.5-I-13 Expand public parking programs for the downtown area to alleviate future shortages.
5.5-I-14 Allow shared parking facilities and/or off-site parking facilities, whenever possible, to
          reduce the number of new parking stalls required.
5.5-I-15 Continue to limit non-residential parking in residential neighborhoods that serves adjacent
          commercial areas by adopting parking control strategies such as zoning restrictions, signs,
          or permit systems, where appropriate.
5.6     GOODS MOVEMENT
In addition to moving people, the roadway system in Yuba City carries a substantial number of trucks
moving goods. Specific truck routes have been designated throughout the City and are shown on
Figure 5.4. These routes are designed to allow truck traffic to pass through the City with minimal
impact on residential neighborhoods as well as local vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
GUIDING POLICY
5.6-G-1 Provide adequate circulation and off-street parking and loading facilities for trucks and
          facilitate intermodal goods delivery.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
5.6-I-1   In consultation with Sutter County and Caltrans, designate
          and provide signed truck routes, ensure that adequate
          pavement depth, lane widths, bridge capacities, loading
          areas, and turn radii are maintained on the designated
          truck routes, and prohibit commercial trucks from non-
          truck routes except for deliveries.
          Require that a truck route be provided for any approved
          development zoned regional commercial, community
          commercial, business technology and light industrial, or
          manufacturing, processing, and warehousing.
5.6-I-2   Maintain design standards for industrial streets that
          incorporate heavier loads associated with truck operations
          and larger turning radii to facilitate truck movements.
5.6-I-3   Continue to ensure adequate truck access to off-street         Truck routes keep trucks out of
          loading areas in commercial areas.                             neighborhoods.
5.6-I-4   Encourage regional freight movement on freeways and other appropriate routes; evaluate
          and implement vehicle weight limits as appropriate on arterial, collector, and local
          roadways to mitigate truck traffic impacts in the community.

5.7      AVIATION
Aviation facilities are provided by the Sutter County Airport, which is located between the Garden
Highway and the Feather River. The airport is owned and operated by Sutter County and currently
includes one runway, Runway 17/35, which is 3,040 feet long and 75 feet wide.
The airport is currently used primarily for agricultural aerial-spraying purposes and private use.
Other uses include flight instruction, aircraft rentals, and aircraft sales. Approximately 110 flights a
day occur at this airport.
5.8      REGIONAL COORDINATION
The Transportation Element identifies future circulation needs for a long-range planning horizon.
These projects will be studied later in greater detail, and funding and implementation sources will be
identified. Many of the projects, in order to be funded, must be part of local and regional programs,
including the City's Capital Improvement Program, the Sutter and Yuba Counties Congestion
Management Program (CMP), and the Regional Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP).
Once a project is in the RTIP, it is available for consideration in the State Transportation
Improvement Program (STIP).
The CMP ensures that an integrated approach to transportation programming decision making is
followed. The CMP is intended to maintain transportation mobility in Sutter and Yuba Counties by
establishing standards that encourage a balance of transportation modes, and by incorporating the
transportation implications of land-use decisions in planning efforts. Cities within the County are
responsible for conformance with the adopted service level standards on the principal arterial system
defined by the CMP, and for transit standards. They are also responsible for the adoption and
implementation of a trip-reduction and travel-demand ordinance and for developing a program to
analyze the impacts of land use decisions. Where deficiencies in the system exist, deficiency plans
must be adopted and methods of correcting the deficiencies identified. If deficiencies go unmitigated,
the City could lose a portion of its gas tax revenues. Projects on the CMP are eligible for the RTIP
and STIP.
Additional funding sources are available through the federal Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991, which revamped the nation's surface transportation programs (e.g.,
highway, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle facilities) to give state and local agencies increased funding,
greater flexibility, and greater responsibility to select the mix of projects best suited to meet local
needs. The ISTEA legislation allows Yuba City greater flexibility in determining federal funding for
various surface transportation modes. This flexibility will help provide a more balanced
transportation system and could impact the current funding structure if funds are shifted from street
projects to transit projects or vice versa. No additional funds are available initially to the City, but
this could change in the future.

                            Community Facilities
This chapter presents Yuba City’s long term program for the development and maintenance of parks,
schools, and community facilities. As described in the key initiatives presented in Chapter 1,
Introduction & Overview, these facilities are viewed as fundamental building blocks of
neighborhoods and communities and comprise the backbone of the General Plan.
6.1      PARKS
This General Plan chapter will serve as a guiding document for any implementation documents
prepared by the City Parks & Recreation Department that plan for and develop parks in Yuba City.
Under this plan, Yuba City will be committed to creating parkland in Yuba City and maintaining a
park system that meets citizens’ recreational needs and contributes to the City’s positive image. The
presence of well-designed parks and community facilities is essential to the health and well-being of
the City.
The City’s new goal for a functional standard for
public parkland is 10 acres per 1,000 residents,
comprised of one acre of neighborhood parks (those
serving residents living within a half mile radius), 1.5
acres each of community parks (those serving residents
within a three-mile radius), and city parks, and six
acres of special use or regional parkland and passive
open space. This standard is achievable under this
General Plan if the City is successful in securing the
proposed public parkland. This proposed public
parkland set forth in this plan seeks to correct the
existing deficiency in parkland and maintain the
proposed standard for new residents.                     Parkland in Yuba City is a prized community asset
2002 FACILITIES
In 2002, the Yuba City park and recreation system comprises 19 City-owned parks and recreational
grounds, including a Senior Center, Town Square, and the Plumas Tower Plaza. Also in the Planning
Area are three County parks and two parks owned by Yuba City Unified School District with which
the City has use and maintenance agreements. Private and/or nonprofit organizations manage two
Little League fields and other recreational facilities.
                                                      1

                                       Yuba City General Plan Update
Yuba City’s parks range in size from the 0.1-acre Clark-Ainsley Mini Park to the 13-acre Blackburn-
Talley Park. The City has a municipal pool, a three-field softball complex, and an older single-field
softball facility. Youth basketball and youth enrichment programs are dependent on the use of school
facilities. The Yuba City Unified School District has four gymnasiums used by Parks and Recreation
Department programs, two located at Yuba City High School and one each at Andros Karperos
Middle School and Gray Avenue Middle School. Many of the schools have multi-purpose rooms for
community use.
For the 57,030 residents living in the Planning Area in 2000, on average, there is currently 1.3 acres of
public and non-profit improved parkland per 1,000 residents, as well as other city and county owned
acreage intended for future park development. This is below the City’s goal of 10 acres per 1,000
persons.
CLASSIFICATION AND STANDARDS
The City provides its residents with several types of parks and facilities. Parks are defined as land
owned or leased by the City and used for public recreational purposes. Park types are classified as
followed.
•    Neighborhood Park: A park or playground at least two acres in size, developed primarily to serve
     the recreational needs of citizens living within a half mile radius of the park. These facilities
     include pocket parks, and neighborhood playgrounds. The standard for this type of park is 1.0
     acre per 1,000 residents of the City.
•    Community Park: A larger park or facility developed to meet the park and recreational needs of
     those living or working within a three-mile radius. Community parks vary from 5 to 20 acres and
     having playing fields and community recreation facilities. The standard for this type of park is 1.5
     acres per 1,000 residents of the City.
•    City Park: A park having a wide range of improvements not usually found in neighborhood and
     community parks and designed to meet the recreational needs of the entire city population. A city
     park must be over 80 acres in size. Recreational facilities might include a nature area, golf course,
     zoo, or lawn and play areas. Structures, such as gymnasiums, community centers, and public or
     private educational institutions may also be permitted. Parks may also be themed, such as a park
     dedicated to the agricultural heritage of the area. The standard for this type of park is 1.5 acres per
     1,000 residents of the City.
•    Specialized Recreation Area: A recreation area or facility devoted to a very specific activity or use.
     A linear park or trail is one example. Other parks with a mix of public and private passive and
     active space, such as parts of the Feather River Park, are also examples. Plazas and green space
     within commercial developments, such as in the Harter Specific Plan, also fall into this category.
     The standard for this type of park is 6.0 acres per 1,000 residents of the City.
The above listed parks generally require primarily flat land (functional acreage) that can be developed
into sports fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, picnic areas and children’s play areas, as well as
grass areas for informal play. 2002 parkland is summarized in Table 6-1.

PARK DEMAND
The process for determining demand of parkland in Yuba City is based on the following components:
•    Implementing the parkland standards for neighborhood parks, community parks, city parks, and
     specialized recreation areas;
•    Making up the existing deficiency in parkland for current residents in Yuba City with new
     parkland; and
•    Providing parkland to meet new demand by new residents in Yuba City.
As of the year 2002, 74 acres of public and private parkland service a population of 57,030 within the
Urban Growth Boundary, resulting in 1.3 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents. In order to meet the
goal of 10 acres per 1,000 residents for the existing population, a total of 570 acres of parkland is
needed. Subtracting out the existing 74 acres, 496 new parkland acres are needed to make up the 2002
deficiency.
As discussed in Chapter 3: Land Use, the buildout of the General Plan Diagram would result in
approximately 51,000 new residents in Yuba City, with a total population of about 108,000. Using the
10 acres per 1,000 residents standard, this new population would require 510 acres of new parkland.
Combined with the acreage needed to meet the needs of current residents, 1,006 acres new parkland
acres are needed. A summary is presented in Table 6-2.

PLANNED PARK SYSTEM & OPEN SPACE NETWORK
The Planned Park System and Open Space Network includes the following components:
•    New Parkland. Existing and new park facilities are depicted on Figure 6-1, including Specialized
     Recreation Areas, City Parks, Community Parks, and approximate locations for Neighborhood
     Parks. Quarter- and half-mile radii are shown around parks. The Feather River parkland areas,
     consistent with the Feather River Parkway Strategic Plan, have been divided into “City Park” and
     “Specialized Recreation Area” categories. Total acreages for newly planned parkland are presented
     in Table 6-3.

CITY PARKS
Two large-scale parks are proposed in the western
portion of the planning area. One park is located
in the southern portion of the City and is
intended to accommodate a range of active
recreational activities. Proposed low/medium
and medium/ high density residential
developments surround the park. A quarter mile
long, 300 foot wide extension of this park is
proposed from it’s northwest corner. This
“panhandle” integrates the park with a proposed
north south vehicular parkway and provides
community-scale recreational uses to adjacent
residential developments. A second city park is
planned near the northwestern edge of urban area                     The California Citrus Park in Riverside is a good example of
and abuts rural agricultural land. This park is                      a heritage park.
intended to be less active in nature than the
southerly park and could include a heritage park
component tying Yuba City to its agricultural
heritage.
FEATHER RIVER PARK PROJECT
The Feather River marks the eastern edge of Yuba City. The Feather River Parkway Strategic Plan
(2002) is a comprehensive strategic plan that was developed to establish a framework for
improvements for lands on the western bank of the Feather River. The waterfront area of the Feather
River has a large amount of undeveloped open space that is part of the flood plain and is visually
                                                               6-5

                                          Yuba City General Plan Update
inaccessible due to the existing levee; the plan presents a framework of uses for these areas. Proposed
uses include a trail system, beaches, river viewing pavilions, boating facilities, and active recreational
facilities, such as a golf course. The plan also addresses issues of waterfront accessibility, park space
creation, and connections between the waterfront and Yuba City. The policies presented in this
General Plan have been developed to ensure that the Feather River Parkway Strategic Plan will be
implemented. A map of the planned facilities as part of the Feather River Parkway Strategic Plan is
presented in Figure 6-2.
GUIDING POLICIES
6.1-G-1 Create a hierarchy of new open spaces that accommodates a diverse range of recreational
            needs.
6.1-G-2 Develop new parkland in order to address existing parkland deficiencies and to meet the
            park acreage standards for new residents.
6.1-G-3 Ensure adequate funding for parks and recreation facilities acquisition, development, and
            maintenance.
6.1-G-4 Provide varied recreational opportunities accessible to all City residents.
             It is the City’s goal to ensure that parks in Yuba City are easily accessible to its citizens,
             including the physically disabled, and to provide recreational equipment that people of all ages
             and abilities can use.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
General
6.1-I-1     Establish and maintain a standard of 10 acres of public parks per 1,000 residents.
             Specific standards are as follows: 1 acre of Neighborhood Parks, 1.5 acres of Community Parks,
             1.5 acres of City Parks, and 6 acres of Specialized Recreation Area per 1,000 residents.
6.1-I-2     Establish minimum sizes of 2 acres for Neighborhood Parks and 10 acres for Community
            Parks in Yuba City.
6.1-I-3     Require residential developers to either build parks or pay in-lieu fees in order to contribute
            to the City’s park system.
6.1-I-4     Create a park dedication standard for new development in order to be consistent with and
            implement the Quimby Act.
                                                        6-6


                                      Yuba City General Plan Update
6.1-I-5  Establish a program for contributions to the City’s park system by non-residential
         developers, based on their proportional share of needs generated and use of facilities.
6.1-I-6  Establish dedication and reservation requirements for the development of landscaped and
         dedicated open spaces, parkways, trail systems, and special community service facilities in
         new residential developments.
6.1-I-7  Cooperate with the Yuba City Unified School District to promote joint development and
         use of school sites located within the City and within the UGB.
6.1-I-8  Under review of the Parks & Recreation Department and Commission, prepare, adopt and
         implement a 10-year Parks and Community Facilities Master Plan, to be reviewed biennially
         and updated quadrennially.
6.1-I-9  Require a high level of maintenance service with respect to all parks and recreational
         facilities.
          The maintenance and upkeep of parks and recreational facilities is necessary for the economic
          health of the community.
6.1-I-10 Implement the Feather River Parkway Strategic Plan in a manner consistent with the plans
         and programs put forth in that document and consistent with policies in the Open Space
         and Conservation Chapter (Chapter 8). Proposed actions include:
          •   Improved pedestrian access to the riverfront;
          •   Provide a mix of active- and non-active recreational and open space in those areas
              delineated in the Feather River Parkway Strategic Plan; and
          •   Ensure that the open spaces proposed in the Feather River Parkway Strategic Plan be
              designed in a manner flexible enough to accommodate a variety of activities.
City Parks
6.1-I-11 As illustrated in Figure 6-1, locate and develop two large City parks in the western portion
         of the planning area to accommodate a variety of activities.
6.1-I-12 Evaluate feasibility and community interest in taking advantage of the north park’s location
         abutting agricultural fields to create an “Agricultural Heritage Park” marked by orchard
         rows and other local agricultural products.
          As successful model for this type of facility is the California Citrus Park located in Riverside,
          California. The park incorporates hands-on exhibits, working citrus farms, preserved orchards,
          a museum, and other cultural amenities.
6.1-I-13 Allocate the southern portion of the south park, adjacent to the proposed high school, for
         active recreational uses, such as sports fields.
6.1-I-14 Allocate the central area of the south park for more passive uses, including walking,
         strolling, picnicking, and unorganized field games.
                                                     6-8

                                   Parks, Schools, & Community Facilities
6.1-I-15 Incorporate the following design characteristics into the creation of the new City parks:
          •   Park edges that provide subtle transitions from residential developments.
          •   Visual permeability, created by leaving 15 feet of space between trees at park edges in
              order to create an open, landscaped, accessible environment.
          •   Multi-purpose bike / pedestrian pathways along the edges and through the parks.
Neighborhood & Community Parks
6.1-I-16 Place neighborhood and community parks at the core of new neighborhoods.
6.1-I-17 As depicted in Figure 6-1, co-locate community parks and school sites where possible.
6.1-I-18 Incorporate the following design characteristics into the creation of community,
         neighborhood, and pocket parks:
          •   Permeability; so interior portions of the park can be viewed form the street;
          •   Lighting, in order to maintain safety;
          •   Pedestrian access, and in Neighborhood Parks, limited parking;
          •   Pathways leading from parks to local neighborhoods; and
          •   Lush landscaping.
Greenways, Pathways, and Trails
6.1-I-19 Develop a unified and consistently signed and marked trail system throughout the City,
         including “rails-to-trails” programs, bikeways, pathways, sidewalks, and other trails.
          This non-motorized transportation network will connect new neighborhoods, existing
          neighborhoods, parks, community activity centers, and community facilities.
6.1-I-20 Establish a linear, usable “panhandle” attached to the south park and integrated as a portion
         of the southern extension of the planned Harter Parkway.
          The panhandle is a block-wide linear green space that runs for about ¼ of a mile. It will exist
          as a portion of Harter Parkway and will provide a transitional link between the parkway and
          the South Park. At 300 feet in width, it is large enough to provide usable open space to residents
          nearby as well as creating a visual amenity for motorists using the Harter Parkway.
6.1-I-21 On non-motorized portions of roadways, create a landscaped, signed environment and safe
         connections to destination points, using crosswalks, planting buffers, and signal pre-
         emption as necessary.
                                                     6-9

6.2      EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES
FACILITIES, 2002
The Yuba City Unified School District (YCUSD) serves most of the areas within the UGB as well as a
large portion of central and southern Sutter County. In 2003 the District operated 12 elementary
schools, two middle schools, one high school, one continuation high school, and an alternative school
(grades K-12).
Within the UGB, the District operates eight elementary schools (grades K-5), two middle schools
(grades 6-8), one K-8 school (Tierra Buena), and one high school. A second high school was under
construction in 2003.
The Franklin Elementary School District and Sutter Union High School District are coterminous in
the region and include a small portion of the western edge of the Yuba City Planning Area south of
State Route 20.
Existing public school facilities are illustrated on Figure 6-3.
Several private and parochial schools also exist in Yuba City, including Adventist Christian, Covenant
Christian, Faith Christian, First Lutheran, Grace Christian Academy, and St. Isidore’s schools. The
Yuba City Charter School, also known as the Whitney Academy, is publicly-funded but not a part of
the Unified School District. Post-secondary educational opportunities in the region include Yuba
College in Marysville, the California State University campuses at Chico and Sacramento, and the
University of California at Davis.
ENROLLMENT AND CAPACITY
Based on peak enrollments for 2001-2002 school year, approximately 11,000 students from within the
UGB attended local schools listed in Table 6-4. Although official capacity numbers are not recorded,
many of the City’s schools are presently at, if not over, capacity.

Buildout of the General Plan will result in the addition of 19,220 housing units, with a total buildout
population of approximately 108,000. Student generation factors and school size assumptions for
households in the planning area are as follows:
•    K-5: 0.28 students per household, 550 students per school.
•    6-8: 0.12 students per household, 880 students per school.
•    9-12: 0.175 students per household, 2,100 students per school.
The number of students added for each school type represents a significant increase over current
levels. School age population and school needs are detailed in Table 6-5.

The student population projection does not take into account the potential for the development of K-
8 schools. The YCUSD has a policy of building new school facilities for grades K-8 at one school site;
however, the YCUSD does not believe that all future schools will be built in this manner or that
existing facilities will be converted. It is therefore difficult to determine or assign a generation factor
or determine need specifically for K-8 facilities. As a result, the YCUSD agreed that the total
combined demand for K-5 and K-8 facilities could be reduced through the development of K-8
facilities.
PLANNED FACILITIES
Figure 6-3 illustrates planned school sites in the Planning Area. Within the YCUSD, two new high
schools are planned (one under construction at the time of Plan preparation) and seven flexible K-5,
6-8, or K-8 sites. Within the Sutter High School/Franklin Elementary School District, three flexible K-
5, 6-8, or K-8 sites are planned. Where possible, schools and community parks are co-located.
GUIDING POLICIES
6.2-G-1 Provide superior educational opportunities for children and all members of the community.
6.2-G-2 Ensure that adequate school sites are made available in conjunction with new growth in the
            planning area.
6.2-G-3 Maintain good communication with area school districts on all matters pertaining to the
            need for and the provision of school sites and facilities. Integrate the land and infrastructure
            planning efforts of the City and the school districts.
6.2-G-4 Encourage the development of institutions of higher learning within Yuba City.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
6.2-I-1     Cooperate with school districts to ensure safe and convenient access for school children.
6.2-I-2     Assist the various school districts in developing school sites and facilities to serve all
            neighborhoods in the City, and to respond to the educational needs of various sectors of the
            population.
6.2-I-3     Cooperate with school districts to ensure that, within the limits of the law, educational
            facilities with sufficient permanent capacity are constructed to meet the needs of current
            and projected enrollment.
6.2-I-4     Require that residential development pay fees to school districts for the acquisition of school
            sites to provide adequate, permanent classroom space or, alternatively, provide land.
6.2-I-5     Work closely with school districts to ensure that all new school facilities are within close
            proximity to the neighborhoods they are intended to serve, as illustrated in Figure 6-3 and
            on the General Plan Diagram.
6.2-I-6     Require subdividers to reserve school sites as shown on the General Plan Diagram for school
            district acquisition for a reasonable period of time.
                                                      6-13
                                         Yuba City General Plan Update
6.2-I-7    Support efforts to locate a community college or commuter campus in Yuba City, either in
           cooperation with the Yuba Community College District or through private academic
           institutions.
6.2-I-8    Support school district efforts to mitigate significant impacts of new projects on school
           facilities, consistent with State law.
            State law limits the fee that can be imposed on residential development to mitigate school
            impacts and prohibits denial of a project on the basis of the inadequacy of school facilities or
            school impact fees.
6.3      COMMUNITY FACILITIES & INSTITUTIONS
Community facilities and institutions are the network of public and private facilities that support the
civic and social needs of the population. New community facilities are not specifically sited on the
General Plan Diagram. Small-scale community facilities are appropriately sited as integral parts of
neighborhoods and communities. Larger-scale community facilities are to be integrated in Urban
Activity Centers.
Community facilities and institutions in Yuba City are categorized as follows:
•   Community Centers. Facilities designed to meet the needs of the population for civic meetings,
    recreational activities, social gatherings, and cultural enrichment, such as the Yuba City Senior
    Center (YCSC). The Senior Center is host to recreational activities, workshops, support groups,
    and a senior meal program and is used by approximately 100 people each day.
•   Cultural Facilities. These facilities house scientific and historical exhibits or offer space for artistic
    performance and presentations. The Community Memorial Museum of Sutter County and the
    Yuba-Sutter Regional Arts Council building in Marysville are examples of these types of facilities.
    Artists studio space and performance spaces can often be coupled with Arts Centers.
•   Civic Buildings. Includes City and County administrative and public buildings.
•   Libraries. Facilities in which literary, artistic, and reference materials are kept for public use and
    circulation. The main branch of the Sutter County Free Library (SCFL) is located at 750 Forbes
    Avenue in Yuba City; four smaller branches are dispersed through the remainder of the County.
    The collection at the main branch includes approximately 100,000 volumes. While the library is
    predominantly used by Yuba City area residents, it is a County service which receives only literacy
    block grants from the City. The main branch is currently at capacity use and will require larger
    facilities to meet the area’s needs through General Plan buildout. There is no room for expansion
    at the current site.
•   Religious Facilities. Includes houses of worship and other related uses.
•   Medical Facilities. Hospitals, clinics, care facilities, and medical offices.

                                                  Public Utilities
This chapter of the General Plan establishes policies and provisions for public utilities, including
water supply, wastewater treatment, and solid waste handling. The provision of adequate public
facilities is a critical component to successful implementation of the General Plan.
7.1         WATER SUPPLY AND CONSERVATION
WATER PROVIDERS
The Yuba City Utilities Department provides water within the City limits, and with the purchase of
the Hillcrest Water Company (HWC) in 2001, now also provides water service beyond the City
limits. In 2002, Yuba City had approximately 9,020 surface water connections; the City obtains its
surface water supply from the Feather River, under four water supply contracts:
•      State Water Resource Control Board (SWRCB) Permit 14045;
•      State Water Resource Control Board Permit 18558;
•      Yuba County Water District (YCWD); and
•      Department of Water Resources, State Water Project.
The City surface water supply also has access to a limited water supply from a back-up water well.
Most residents in the Sphere of Influence outside the City limits obtain their water from either private
wells or the HWC, which had approximately 4,500 water service connections in 2002. Yuba City
purchased HWC in May 2001 and had assumed responsibility for water service, renaming the area
Yuba City Groundwater Service. This water service system consists of three water treatment plants
                   1
and 15 wells. There are several other small private water districts such as Wildwood East, Wildwood
West, and El Margarita Water District. These districts serve over 250 homes. The water service area is
shown in Figure 7-1.
Groundwater supplied to customers is generally hard water, has higher levels of some minerals—such
as iron, manganese, arsenic—and some areas also contain nitrates. Not all of the wells will meet the
arsenic standards approved by the Federal EPA. Yuba City is evaluating options related to converting
these customers from groundwater supply to surface water supply, or treating the groundwater to
                                                          2
meet all primary and secondary standards.

SUPPLY AND PROJECTED DEMAND
Under SWRCB Permits 14045 and 18558 the City can obtain up to 15,500 acre-feet of water per year
(see Table 7-1)—provided there are no curtailments—at no cost; however, SWRCB Permit 14045
does not license diversion during July and August and Permit 18558 does not provide water from July
through September. Permit 14045 provides the basis of the City supply outside summer months and
Permit 18558, though awarded in 1978, was used for the first time in 2000.
Yuba City negotiated a contract for water supply with Yuba County Water District (YCWD) to
provide a base summer water supply, and water supply under this contract has never been curtailed.
This contract will expire in 2010; by then, the City expects to have renegotiated this contract or
replaced this supply by other means. The State Water Project contract is presently used to supplement
YCWD during the months of July and August, though water from this contract can be used in any
month.
The Yuba City surface water system maintains one well that has a capacity of approximately 3 million
gallons per day. In the event of a significant water shortage, this well could be blended with the
available treated surface water to meet demand.

  All current contracts are for set amounts of water. Note that the YCWD contract expires after 2010, at which point the
City expects to have replaced it with water from another source. All contracts may be subject to curtailments, reviewed,
or replaced.

  The Urban Water Management Report incorrectly listed the amount as 9373; the maximum annual usage was reduced to
6500 acre-feet in 1982.
Source: Yuba City Urban Water Management Plan, 2000; Bill Lewis, City of Yuba City 2003.
Despite the fact that 40,100 acre feet of raw water supply is projected for 2020, the City’s Urban Water
Management Plan (UWMP) uses a more conservative estimate of 32,573 acre feet in the analysis of
supply versus demand. This number does not assume as yet undetermined future water rights, nor
does it assume that Yuba County Water District supply is curtailed.
City Water Supply System
The existing surface water supply system includes 9.25 million gallons (MG) of distribution system
storage from the 20 million gallons per day (mgd) Yuba City Water Treatment Plant (WTP), Sam
Brannan, Rowe Avenue, Burns Drive (Garden Highway), Forbes Avenue, and Plumas Street tanks,
though the City normally does not store water in the Forbes or Plumas tanks. Taking emergency
                                                                7-3

                                             Yuba City General Plan Update
storage requirements into account, there is a current storage deficit of 3.4 MG. Future growth will
                                                                                                   3
require an additional 2.9 MG beyond the current deficit, totaling an additional 6.3 MG by 2020.
The above water supply system does not include surface water to groundwater customers. Yuba City
surface water and groundwater pipelines are very near each other along the west City boundary. Some
groundwater customers are literally next door to surface water customers. During the past droughts,
groundwater wells were able to meet the needs of their customers. If surface water supplies were
inadequate to meet the needs of Yuba City, a minimal amount of pipe could be added to interconnect
the two systems. Areas served by surface water and groundwater are illustrated in Figure 7-1.
Historic and Projected Water Demand
As Table 7-2 shows, surface water use has grown 28 percent from 1990 to 2000, and total water use in
the service area is projected to more than double in the next 20 years. This is based on a combination
of natural population increase and expansion of the service area within the City’s planning area.
Yuba City is in the process of converting from a flat rate system to a metered system. It is anticipated
that 100 percent of the accounts will have meters installed by the end of 2003.
Demand peaks in the summer, when temperatures regularly exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and
residential and commercial irrigation demand is at its height. Average demand for 1993-1995 was 273
gallons per capita per day (gpcd); in 1995, average total demand for the City was 9.15 million gallons
                                                                                                 4
a day (mgd) with a maximum-day demand of 17.90 mgd and peak-hour demand of 31.6 mgd. These
figures are expected to rise with overall demand.
Assuming General Plan buildout in 2025, a total of 27,474 acre feet will be required in year 2025.
With an expected annual supply of 32,573 acre feet, average demand will not exceed supply.
However, there are other factors, such as peak summer demand and unexpected supply curtailments
that contribute to supply shortfalls. According to the City’s UWMP, in all cases Yuba City is able to
                                                                                                     5
meet the full needs of its customers without mandatory water conservation through the year 2014. If
the SWP allocation were lower than 50 percent, mandatory water conservation measures would be
required prior to 2014. 2001 SWP allocation was 36 percent of total. Based on increased
environmental water demands, mandatory water rationing may be required earlier than 2014 unless
additional water rights are obtained. Yuba City anticipates acquiring additional water rights to
supplement or replace the YCWD contract that expires in 2010.

Bhatia, using a 3% annual increase in water use. The urban Water Management Plan did not include estimated for future
conversion of existing groundwater customers to surface water.
PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS
The City is in the midst of a 10-year Capital Improvement Program (in two phases, estimated cost of
each phase being $5.6 and $2.3 million) to accommodate projected future needs. Improvements to
the Water Treatment Plant already completed include upgraded filters, new fluoride system, repair to
intake structure, and reliable capacity increased to 20 mgd. Uncompleted improvements include new
                                                                                                                        6
storage reservoirs with booster pumping stations and new 12- and 16-inch distribution grids.
There are no significant improvements planned in the short term until resolution is reached
regarding how to serve current groundwater customers who need to be integrated into the City’s

required at the water treatment plant, and on the distribution system.
CONSERVATION
The City Ordinance allows the City Council to declare an emergency condition and institute
mandatory water conservation programs. Such measures include:
•      Irrigation limitations to two times per week;
•      No use of water on impermeable surfaces;
•      All evaporative coolers must be recirculating type;
•      Shutoff nozzles on all hoses;

•   Restaurant restrictions.
Yuba City normally operates its water distribution system at a pressure of 50 to 60 pounds per square
inch (psi). In the event of significant water shortages, the system pressure could be reduced. System
pressure is maintained using variable speed pumps. There are no elevated water storage tanks still in
use. The pressure reduction would reduce demand and reduce the amount of distribution system
leakage. Water savings from the existing State conservation ordinances, including that attributed to
the replacement of conventional water-using devices with water-saving devices, are estimated to
account for approximately 10 percent over the next 25 years.
GUIDING POLICIES
7.1-G-1 Ensure that an adequate supply of water is available to serve existing and future needs of the
         City.
7.1-G-2 Ensure that necessary water supply infrastructure and storage facilities are in place prior to
         construction of new development.
7.1-G-3 Maintain existing levels of water service by preserving and improving infrastructure,
         replacing water mains as necessary, and improving water transmission facilities.
7.1-G-4 Encourage water conservation with incentives for decreased water use and active public
         education programs.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
7.1-I-1  Evaluate the adequacy of water infrastructure in areas where intensification of land use is
         anticipated to occur, and develop a strategy to implement projects in the Water Supply
         Master Plan to offset deficiencies in capacity.
7.1-I-2  Coordinate capital improvements planning for all municipal water service infrastructure
         with the direction, extent, and timing of growth.
7.1-I-3  Decline requests for extension of water beyond the SOI, except in cases of existing
         documented health hazards and in areas where the City has agreements to provide services.
7.1-I-4  Establish equitable methods for distributing costs associated with providing water service to
         development, including impact mitigation fees where warranted.
7.1-I-5  Explore ways to encourage use of reclaimed water for irrigation and landscaping purposes.
          Utilizing reclaimed water is currently not cost-effective. Should the costs of reclaimed water
          become more attractive, the City should define a program for encouraging reclaimed water use.

7.2        WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT
SEWER SERVICE, 2002
Sanitary sewer service in Yuba City is provided by the City Utilities Department. In the
unincorporated areas of the SOI, with limited exceptions, municipal sewage treatment has not been
available to county residents. As Yuba City incorporates these areas, sewage service will be available if
these residents want to connect. Due to the high connection costs (about $10,000), most residents in
                                                                       8
annexed areas do not connect until their septic systems fail.
The 1997 Yuba City Wastewater System Master Plan (WWSMP) describes the City’s existing sewage
collection system and addresses sewage collection system capacity and operational needs. It also
recommends a long-term capital improvement program to provide the facilities necessary to
accommodate General Plan buildout. The locations of the City’s wastewater facilities are shown in
Figure 7-1.
WASTEWATER DISPOSAL SYSTEM, 2002
The City constructed its first municipal sewage treatment plant and collection system near the State
Route 20 Bridge. In the early 1970s, the original sewage treatment plant was abandoned and the
current Wastewater Treatment Facility (WTF), located farther south, was constructed. The treatment
plant uses a pure oxygen activated sludge secondary treatment process, with disinfection and
                   9
dechlorination. The system includes 13 lift stations throughout the City, built between 1949 and
                                                                    10
2001. Pipe sizes range in diameter from six to 36 inches.
At the City’s WTF, wastewater is sent through a grit remover, primary and secondary clarifiers,
aeration basin, disinfection facility, and chlorine contact basin, and is exposed to anaerobic
             11
digesters. Treated wastewater is discharged to rapid infiltration and evaporation ponds in the feather
River floodplain from May 15 to October 31 and to the Feather River downstream of its confluence
                                                                 12
with the Yuba River during other times of the year. Discharges to the Feather River may change,
depending on the requirements of a new discharge permit, which took effect on August 1, 2003. The
Regional Board adopted Cease and Desist Order No. R5-2003-0086 concurrently with the new
NPDES permit. The order was adopted because the City cannot currently meet all of the new effluent
limitations. This Order contains a schedule for the City to bring the treatment facility into
compliance with discharge requirements.

                                       Yuba City General Plan Update
The current wastewater plant has a rated capacity of seven million gallons per day (mgd) and is
currently treating approximately 6.5 mgd. The City has proposed to expand the capacity to nine mgd,
and an engineering design project is currently underway. According to Finding 45 of the new NPDES
discharge permit (Order No. R5-2003-0085), State Water Resources Control Board policy requires
“that increases in wastewater flows achieve the highest quality of water consistent with the maximum
benefit to the people of the state. It must be demonstrated that the wastewater treatment facility, with
an increased flow rate, provides best practicable treatment, meets waste discharge requirements, and
will not unreasonably affect beneficial uses.”
Wastewater discharge is regulated by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board
(RWQCB). Under RWQCB regulations, the bypass or overflow of wastewater from treatment plants
and collection systems is prohibited.
Wastewater Flow Components
Design flows for wastewater collection systems are based on two major components: base wastewater
flow (BWF) and infiltration/inflow (I/I). BWF is the sanitary and process flow from residential,
commercial, industrial, and institutional uses. BWF rates differ depending on the type of land use and
typically vary throughout the day and between weekdays and weekends. I/I is extraneous
groundwater and stormwater that enter the system through sewer defects and direct storm drainage
connections.
Groundwater enters the collection system through defects in pipes, pipe joints, and other sewer
structures. The amount of infiltration depends on the condition of the system and the elevation of the
groundwater table relative to sewer lines. The rate of groundwater infiltration is generally constant
over short durations, but tends to increase during the wet weather season.
Stormwater flow is directly related to amount of rainfall. It is also sensitive to soil moisture and tends
to be greatest late in the wet weather season when soil is highly saturated. Stormwater can enter the
system through cross-connections between the storm drain and sanitary sewer systems or through
illegal connections.
I/I often represents the dominant component of wastewater flow in older portions of a collection
system, since it is highly dependent on the age of sewers as well as soil and topographic
characteristics. In January 1997, when approximately 90 percent of Yuba City residents were
evacuated due to the potential flooding of the Feather River, the water plant continued to produce
approximately 1.5 mgd while flows entering the City’s WTF totaled approximated 2.5 mgd. As such,
the I/I component of wastewater flow in the City at that time was approximately 1.0 mgd, or 40
percent.
Unit Flow Factors
Base wastewater flow factors represent average flow in gallons per day (gpd). The estimated per capita
wastewater flow for residential and commercial is 110 gallons per day. There is not a convenient way
to separate commercial from residential contribution. Industrial contribution is highly variable. The
                                                    7-8

largest industry, Sunsweet, averages 1.1 mgd Monday through Friday, and a much lower flow on
                13                                                                               14
weekends. Industrial flow contributes an average of 20 percent of the total flow into the WTF.
DEFICIENCIES AND PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS
Yuba City was originally a rural city with sewage treatment provided by individual septic systems.
Since 1950, new development connected to the municipal system, and existing commercial and
residential properties were provided an opportunity to connect. Connection to the sewage system was
never made mandatory for existing customers utilizing septic tanks, though the Sutter County
Department of Health Services can require a customer to connect to the municipal system if their
individual septic tank or leach system fails. This results in customers within the City Limits who have
retained their septic systems and are not connected to the municipal system. It is not known how
                                                                             15
many individual septic tanks are in use, or when they will fail.
Although the UWWMP states that the wastewater plant is already running at 93 percent of capacity
                     16
(6.5 of 7 mgd), the WWSMP states that “the results of the [wastewater system] modeling [performed
                                                                                                      17
in 1997] do not indicate major sewer deficiencies for both current and future flow conditions.”
Yuba City is in the midst of renewing its wastewater treatment discharge permit with the RWQCB,
who controls the type and quantity of treated wastewater discharges. The expansion plans, which are
spelled out in the 1997 WWSMP, include numerous improvements that will allow the city to reliably
treat an average dry weather flow (adwf) of 9 mgd. The Master Plan also identifies Phase III projects,
intended to provide for 12 mgd of adwf by 2020, as well as additional projects that would further
                                                       18
increase capacity to meet future demand.
PROJECTED NEEDS
The City’s Urban Water Management Plan projects wastewater disposal amounts of 12 mgd in the
year 2020, based on population projections of 97,000, average per capita demand of 110 gallons per
day, and relatively steady industrial demand (1.2 mgd). The UWMP does not include projections for
the year 2025, however, projected demand for the buildout population can be made using the same
methodology used to calculate 2020 projections. Assuming a buildout population of 108,000 and
slightly increased industrial use (1.3 mgd), about 13.2 mgd of wastewater treatment capacity will be
needed in year 2025. Although wastewater treatment improvements to meet this demand have not
been funded, projects have been identified in the WSMP. These projects will be developed when the
need arises for increased treatment capacity. Several of the new projects being built as part of
improvements to the wastewater treatment system are being sized to handle future demand levels.

WASTEWATER RECLAMATION
According to recent studies summarized in the UWMP, water reclamation in Yuba City is feasible,
but is not economically desirable. Costs to produce reclaimed water are greater than the cost of fresh
water supplies for both agriculture and urban uses. Until these costs are somehow offset or reduced,
there is no incentive for potential customers to use reclaimed water. If the cost of fresh water supplies
increases substantially over the next 20 years, reclaimed water may become more attractive to
potential users.

Franchised solid waste collection and disposal for Yuba City is provided by Yuba-Sutter Disposal, Inc.
                                                                             19
(YSDI). YSDI also provides recycling services to the City. Yuba City has a 10-year contract to send
its waste to the Ostrom Road Landfill in Wheatland, ten miles to the southeast in Yuba County. No
                                                                                                            20
solid waste management facilities or transfer stations are located within Sutter County. Although the
City’s contract with YSDI expires in 2011, there is no limitation to the number of renewals to this
             21
contract.

Yuba City’s solid waste disposal rose about 22 percent in the past six years, from 45,590 tons in 1996
to 55,085 tons in 2001 (see Table 6-4). Waste diversion rates, the percentages of generated waste not
disposed in landfills, are only calculated for the Regional Waste Management Authority (RWMA) as a
whole, which comprises Yuba and Sutter Counties. The diversion rate in this region rose from 20
percent in 1996 to 27 percent in 2001. There is no documented significance attached to the large
change in disposal tonnage in 1997, however the amount may be due to the flood that caused
widespread damage in January of that year. Flooding resulted in many water-damaged household
items that were disposed as solid waste.

REUSE AND RECYCLING
To guide the waste diversion process, the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989
promotes an integrated solid waste management approach which establishes the following hierarchy
of goals: (1) source reduction; (2) recycling and composting; (3) environmentally safe transformation
and disposal of wastes. The statewide mandated goal for waste diversion was 50 percent by the year
2000; due to the shortfall of the RWMA (27 percent diverted in 2001), the Authority has requested a
                             22
three-year extension.
On October 1, 2001, RWMA implemented one of the most liberal curbside recycling programs in the
state, in order to help reach the 50 percent goal by the end of 2003. Separate bins for greenwaste,
recyclable materials, and nonrecyclable waste were distributed to households through the region. All
paper (including magazines and cereal boxes), glass, plastic (#1 through #7), and aluminum products
and tin cans are accepted by the recycling system in a single stream (combined bin). While recycling
is not mandatory, households are charged for waste disposal based on the volume of nonrecyclable
household waste produced. There is no limit to the volume of greenwaste and recyclable materials
              23
picked up. Several redemption recycling centers are distributed within the City.

FUTURE DEMAND
Assuming a 50 percent diversion rate for buildout year 2025, the estimated solid waste disposal
                                                                    24
demand would be about 78,473 tons per year. The Ostrom Road Landfill has an expected life span
to the year 2030.
GUIDING POLICIES
7.3-G-1 Meet the City’s solid waste disposal needs, while maximizing opportunities for waste
              reduction and recycling.
7.3-G-2 Manage solid waste so that State diversion goals are exceeded and the best possible service is
              provided to the citizens and businesses of Yuba City.
7.3-G-3 Continue public education programs about waste reduction, including recycling, yard
              waste, wood waste, and household hazardous waste.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
7.3-I-1       Continue contracting for garbage and recycling collection services.
7.3-I-2       Expand recycling efforts in multi family residential and commercial projects, and continue
              to encourage recycling by all residents.
7.3-I-3       Require builders to incorporate interior and exterior storage areas for recyclables and
              convenient access to recycle areas into new commercial and residential remodeled buildings,
              and encourage remodeled buildings (both residential and commercial) to make recycling
              activities more convenient for those who use the buildings.
7.3-I-4       Provide and promote opportunities to reduce waste at home and in businesses, through
              public education information.
7.3-I-5       Encourage existing commercial businesses and residential development to install recycling
              receptacles on their premises.
7.3-I-6       Comply with State requirements for proper handling and storage of solid waste and
              recyclables and diversion of solid waste from landfills.
7.3-I-7       Obtain input from the public to ensure that solid waste programs effectively address
              community needs and issues.

   This number is derived by calculating the per capita disposal amount for year 2000, multiplying it by the buildout population, and
   adjusting the total to reflect increased diversion rate to 50 percent.

                   Environmental Conservation
This Environmental Conservation Chapter of the General Plan provides direction regarding the
conservation, development, and use of open space and natural resources. Topics addressed include
open space, agriculture, cultural resources, biological resources, and air quality. Water resources are
addressed in Chapter 7.
Yuba City’s setting – within an agricultural county and on the banks of the Feather River—includes
natural resources that are important, not only for aesthetic value, but also for environmental quality,
habitat protection, recreation, water resources, and agriculture. These many functions of open space
underscore the importance of careful land use planning.
This chapter also encourages rural conservation within the County through compatible development
that preserves natural features, sensitive habitats, and agricultural resources. A goal of the General
Plan is to preserve the viability of agriculture production in surrounding unincorporated areas, while
accommodating projected growth within the urban growth area. Air quality is a key component of
conservation and the quality of life in Yuba City. As such, this element includes policies to preserve
and enhance air quality in the planning area by working closely with responsible regional agencies
and by incorporating these considerations into land use planning decisions. Finally, the preservation
of archaeological, paleontological, and historic resources is also a goal of this General Plan, and
relevant policies are included in this element.
8.1      OPEN SPACE
Open space areas within and around Yuba City are valuable resources. In addition to providing
natural scenic qualities that contribute to the overall perception of the community, open space
preserves wildlife habitats and natural resources. According to Government Code Section 65910,
four types of open space must be considered in the General Plan:
•   Open space for the preservation of natural resources, which includes soil conservation, open
    space conservation, biological resources habitat; and rivers, streams, and watersheds;
•   Open space for the managed production of resources, which, in the case of Yuba City, is focused
    on farmland resources, but could also include areas required for ground water recharge and areas
    with mineral deposits;
•   Open space for outdoor recreation, such as parks and outdoor recreational facilities (addressed in
    Chapter 6), and areas of outstanding scenic, historic, and cultural value; and
•   Open space for public health and safety, including flood hazard areas, fault zones, and other
    hazardous areas (addressed in Chapter 9).
The policies contained in this section focus on the first two categories of open space, as they relate to
environmental conservation, and on scenic and cultural resource open space. Agriculture is
addressed separately in Section 8.2 of this chapter. As the City grows within the Planning Area, open
space protection around the City becomes more important.
                                                     8-1

                                      Yuba City General Plan Update
EXISTING OPEN SPACE AND PLANNED OPEN SPACE AREAS
With the exception of Marysville to the east, Yuba City is surrounded primarily by agricultural open
space and undeveloped lands in the unincorporated areas. Open space areas currently exist within
the Planning Area along the northern and western edges of the city, and a substantial amount of open
space lies within the southwest section of the Planning Area. However, the City lacks large public
open space areas. Although the Feather River provides an open space feature that forms the eastern
boundary of the city and separates it from Marysville, this area is overgrown and underutilized. The
City is currently developing a parkway plan for the Feather River, which will improve the open space
qualities of the adjacent flood plain corridor. The Parkway Plan goals include preserving and
restoring natural areas, as well as creating a safe public place. See Chapter 6 for additional
information on the proposed Feather River Parkway Plan.
Chapter 3: Land Use calls for several open space areas (mainly parkland) within the City. Chapter 3
of this General Plan emphasizes the planning principles of utilizing land within the Planning Area for
urban purposes to ensure a compact urban form, minimize sprawl, and preserve agriculture in
outlying areas. The majority of lands within the Urban Growth area are needed to accommodate
future growth projections. Therefore, the focus of open space land protection is on the perimeter of
the City and in rural unincorporated lands.
CITY BUFFERS/GREEN BELTS
To delineate the urban/rural edge, the Land Use Element calls for an open space or greenway buffer
around the perimeter of the urban growth area. This greenway would provide the interface between
urban and rural land uses. In addition to providing a transition between urban and rural land uses,
the greenway will provide visual relief from the internal urban landscape.
GUIDING POLICIES
The policies of this section reflect general open space provisions to ensure continued preservation of
open space lands in the Planning Area. Specific policies related to agriculture, biological habitats, and
cultural resources are in subsequent sections of this chapter.
8.1-G-1 Preserve open space around the perimeters of the urban growth area, through joint efforts
          with the County and LAFCO.
8.1-G-2 Enhance the open space features of the Feather River.
8.1-G-3 Preserve and enhance the visual and scenic resources of the Planning Area.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
8.1-I-1   Coordinate with Sutter County in the creation of a greenway/open space buffer around the
          perimeter of the City’s urban growth area. Explore regulatory incentives (e.g., Williamson
          Act) and financing mechanisms necessary to ensure preservation of these lands as open
          space.
          Open space lands may be publicly or privately owned. One mechanism to ensure open space is
          to develop a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the County for establishing long

              term agricultural zoning outside the UGB and for reciprocal review of projects along the
              urban/rural edge.
8.1-I-2      Use open space in new development at the edge of the urban growth area to help create
             greenbelts that delineate the edge of urban areas. (See also community design policies in
             Chapter 6.)
8.1-I-3      Work with public and private entities to implement open space features of the Feather River
             Parkway Plan.
             Open space within the parkway will provide visual amenities, as well as habitat protection. The
             Friends of Yuba City Parks and Recreation Foundation may be able to help the City in funding
             site acquisition and development of facilities and programs because its status as a charitable
             organization.
8.1-I-4      Where feasible, encourage restoration of degraded open space areas in the Feather River
             Parkway planning area to an environmentally valuable and sustainable condition.
             The Feather River Parkway Plan calls for maintenance and restoration of natural areas within
             the floodplain areas next to the River.
8.1-I-5      Work with the County to maintain viable agricultural land on the periphery of the urban
             growth area for purposes of resource and view protection and establish design standards
             that protect views of these lands, including orchards and other rural areas.
8.2        AGRICULTURE
Agriculture is the most prominent open space use in
the Yuba City Planning Area. Agriculture also is an
important contributor to the City’s economy.
California State Law requires that a general Plan
address agricultural resources from both a soil
conservation and open space perspective.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Agriculture continues to be a significant component of
the Sutter County economy. In the year 2000, the
County’s gross agricultural production topped $340
           1
million. Yuba City’s location on the Feather and
Sacramento River plains means that soils in the                            Agricultural uses, such as these almond groves, are

Sacramento Rivers provides rich, course soils with abundant water that is ideal for the production of
orchard crops; the areas further from the rivers have more clayey soils that are well suited to the
                        2
production of rice. The ten leading crops in the County by value include:
•     Rice
•     Prunes
•     Peaches
•     Walnuts
•     Tomatoes
•     Melons
•     Nursery products
•     Almonds
•     Cattle and calves, and
•     Alfalfa hay
Orchards are the primary agricultural uses occupying most of the undeveloped land in the western
and northern parts of the City’s Planning Area. Very little agricultural land exists within the current
City limits.
FARMLAND BY TYPE IN PLANNING AREA
About 70 percent of the total area of Sutter County is comprised of prime lands or lands of statewide
significance. In 2002, agricultural lands accounted for approximately 50 percent of the land area
within the Yuba City Planning Area.
This farmland, along with farmland across the state, has been classified by the California Department
of Conservation with respect to its potential for agricultural productivity. The State applies seven
farmland categories:
•     Prime Farmland: Land with the best combination of physical and chemical features for
      production of agricultural crops.
•     Farmland of Statewide Importance: Land with a good combination of physical and chemical
      features for the production of agricultural crops.
•     Unique Farmland: Land of lesser quality soils used for the production of the state’s leading
      agricultural cash crops.
•     Farmland of Local Importance: Non-irrigated land with prime and statewide soil mapping units.
•     Grazing Land: Land on which the existing vegetation is suited to the grazing of livestock.
•     Urban and Built-up Land: Land occupied by structures or infrastructure to accommodate a
      building density of at least one unit to one and one-half acres, or approximately 6 structures to 10
      acres.
•     Other Land: Land which does not meet the criteria of any other category.

As shown in Table 8-1 below, about 75 percent of farmland in Yuba City is classified as farmland of
statewide importance, and another 15 percent is classified as prime farmland. The remaining
farmland area is classified as unique farmland and grazing land; none of the land within the planning
area is classified as farmland of local importance. Figure 8-1 illustrates the distribution of farmland
type within the Planning Area. It should be noted that these classifications do not reflect actual
agricultural use, or agricultural viability due to parcel size.

Sutter County has just created a Williamson Act program, which will help preserve lands not slated
for urban development. Williamson Act lands allow landowners to limit the use of their land to
agricultural uses for at least 10 years in exchange for tax assessment of the land based on agricultural
production rather than market value. In addition, conversion of these lands to urban uses is not
permitted until 10 years following notice of non-renewal given by the owner.
AGRICULTURE PROTECTION ISSUES
As noted in Chapter 3: Land Use, significant agricultural land area within the Planning Area is likely
to be converted to urban uses over the next 20 years, in order to accommodate the growth projected
for the area. Continued conversion of agricultural lands to urban uses and rural residential uses
could erode the County’s agricultural economic base. For that reason, the land use element of the
Yuba City General Plan establishes a fairly compact urban growth area, encouraging infill
development and new growth adjacent to or near existing urban uses, thus minimizing sprawl and
unnecessary conversion of agricultural lands.
As more lands within the Planning Area are developed with urban uses, conflicts between existing
agricultural uses and new development may occur.

GUIDING POLICY
8.2-G-1 Promote preservation of agriculture outside of the urban growth area.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
8.2-I-1   Work with the County to preserve agricultural uses in areas outside the Urban Growth
          Boundary and within greenbelts established around the exterior of the UGB.
           The City should work with Sutter County to encourage the continuation of farming activities
           outside the City’s and Urban Growth Boundary. Programs such as conservation easements and
           Williamson Act contracts should be pursued.
8.2-I-2   Facilitate the continuance of agricultural activities within the City’s urban growth area until
          the land is needed to accommodate population and employment growth. During this
          interim, minimize conflicts between agricultural uses and urban/suburban uses through site
          design techniques (not necessarily structural barriers).
8.2-I-3   Require property developers adjacent to sites where agricultural uses are being conducted to
          inform subsequent buyers of potential continued agricultural production and the lawful use
          of agricultural chemicals, including pesticides and fertilizers.
8.2-I-4   Require anti-vandalism designs (appropriate fencing or other landscape features) to ensure
          that new development has conditions that minimize increased vandalism of adjacent
          agricultural activities.
8.2-I-5   Work with the Economic Development Corporation to assist proponents in continued and
          new agricultural processing uses in the proposed industrial area in order to support
          agricultural activities in the County.
8.2-I-6   Work with government agencies and non-profit land trusts to assist owners of undeveloped
          lands (sufficient in size to allow continued agricultural uses) to remain in agricultural open
          space on the perimeter of the urban growth area.
           Potential programs may include purchase of conservation easements or creation of agricultural
           land trusts.
8.3     HISTORIC AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
The Yuba City Planning Area includes lands that were likely inhabited by various Native American
tribes. Also, there are sites that have historic value.
Several State laws, most notably the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines
§15064.5(f) and Public Resources Code §5020-5029 and 21083.2, protect archaeological and
historical resources. To protect historic resources, the State has formed the State Historical Resources
Committee that conducts the State Historic Resource Inventory and maintains the California Register
of Historic Resources, which identifies historic landmarks and points of interest. The Committee also
provides recommendations for the National Register of Historic Resources.

                                         Yuba City General Plan Update
POTENTIAL RESOURCES
The region within which Yuba City lies is part of a valley that was formerly composed of extensive
wetlands and broad, shallow lakes. Because of this location and availability of resources, it is believed
that different tribes occupied the area on a year-round basis, for about ten thousand years. However,
due to siltation of the area over the years, prehistoric sites have been buried at such depths that very
little, if any, evidence remains at the surface. Original land clearing and a hundred years of farming
have further diminished any likely archaeological sites.
As new development occurs within the Planning Area, there is the potential to uncover archaeological
sites. CEQA requires assessment of the impacts on unique archaeological resources or Native
American culturally significant sites. If a development project is found to cause damage to the
resource, reasonable efforts may be required to preserve the resources or leave them in an
undisturbed state, or undertake additional mitigation measures if avoidance is not possible.
GUIDING POLICY
8.3-G-1 Identify and preserve the archaeological, paleontological, and historic resources that are
            found within the Yuba City Planning Area.
IMPLEMENTING POLICY
8.3-I-1     Encourage the preservation of historic sites, buildings, and structures.
8.3-I-2     Undertake an inventory of historic resources to determine sites or buildings of federal, State,
            or local historic significance.
             The State Office of Historic Preservation has determined that buildings or structures 45 years or
             older have the potential to be historically significant. Sections 5020-5029 of the State Public
             Resources Code addresses historic resource assessment and protection. The inventory conducted
             for the previous General Plan should be updated.
8.3-I-3     Promote the registration of historic sites, buildings, and structures in the National Register
            of Historic Places, and inclusion in the California Inventory of Historic Resources.
8.3-I-4     Consult with the local Native American community in the cases where new development
            may result in disturbance to Native American sites.
8.3-I-5     Require that new development analyze and avoid any potential impacts to archaeological,
            paleontological, and historic resources by:
             •    Requiring a records review for development proposed in areas that are considered
                  archaeologically sensitive;
             •    Studying the potential effects of development and construction (as required by CEQA);
             •    Requiring pre-construction surveys and monitoring during any ground disturbance for
                  all development in areas of historical and archaeological sensitivity; and
             •    Implementing appropriate measures to avoid the identified impacts.

                                              Environmental Conservation
8.3-I-6        In accordance with CEQA and the State Public Resources Code, require the preparation of a
               resource mitigation plan and monitoring program by a qualified archaeologist in the event
               that archaeological resources are discovered.
                In the event that historical or archaeological resources are accidentally discovered during
                construction, grading activity in the immediate area should cease and materials and their
                surroundings shall not be altered or collected. A qualified archaeologist must make an
                immediate evaluation and avoidance measures or appropriate mitigation should be completed,
                according to CEQA Guidelines. The State Office of Historic Preservation has issued
                recommendations for the preparation of Archeological Resource Management Reports that
                should be used as guidelines.
8.4         BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Parts of the City’s Planning Area contain significant biological resources, which are outlined below
and illustrated in Figures 8-2 and 8-3. Additional detailed information is included in the Existing
Conditions and Future Prospects Working Paper, on file at City offices and in the Sutter County
Library.
VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE HABITATS
Flora
As shown in Figure 8-2, almost all of the non-urban land area in the Yuba City Planning Area is
covered by orchards. Although agricultural land uses provide limited habitat for wildlife, nevertheless
these areas provide important habitat, forage, and travel opportunities for some wildife species.
Natural vegetation communities such as riparian corridors and wetlands provide important habitat
for most native California special status species. When a habitat becomes altered, dependent species
that are unable to move elsewhere or adapt to the alterations decline in number. Such dependent
species are designated by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) as “special status”
species, meaning that should a decline in number continue, these species would require listing as
                                  3
threatened or endangered. Such species are protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act
(FESA) and the California Endangered Species Act (CESA) for the purposes of conserving, protecting,
restoring, and enhancing endangered species and their habitats. The California Natural Diversity
Data Base (CNDDB) is then used to track the locations and condition of the state's rarest species and
natural communities. Listed species are generally given greater attention during the land use planning
process by local governments, public agencies, and landowners than are species that have not been
listed.

Fauna
Only about two percent of the non-urban land area in the Planning Area is not under agricultural
production. In general, agricultural lands do not benefit wildlife species as much as natural
communities; however, these lands can provide suitable substitute habitat for some species. Most row
crops and orchards provide low habitat values, and generally such areas are much more useful to bird
species than to mammal, reptile, and amphibian species. Food diversity is also low.
Rivers in Sutter County are the most important habitat for wildlife species. The Feather River, which
forms the eastern boundary of the Yuba CityPlanning Area, provides habitat for several special status
bird species, although none of these species appear to exist within the urban growth area according to
the CDFG. The quality of aquatic habitats is influenced by several factors, including the presence and
duration of standing or flowing water, water quality, bank stability, invasive non-native vegetation,
and the proximity of aquatic habitats to open, undisturbed, adjacent habitats.
SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES & HABITATS
A very small portion of the land area in the Planning Area is considered natural, and therefore
provides little suitable habitat for special status species. The only designated special-status vegetation
species in the SOI is the Hartweg’s Golden Sunburst, a flowering plant that occurs primarily in
nonnative grasslands and is threatened mostly by the conversion of habitat to urban uses4. The
habitat area for this species occurs at the extreme eastern boundary of the Planning Area at the
confluence of the Feather and Yuba Rivers (see Figure 8-3).
One other special-status habitat exists in the immediate vicinity of the Yuba City Planning Area:
Great Valley Cottonwood Riparian Forest. Located just across the Feather River from the northeast
corner of the UGB, this habitat includes such tree species as the Goodding’s black willow, box elder,
                                                                   5
sycamore, walnut, and Fremont’s cottonwood. This habitat supports a lush understory of tree
saplings, shrubs, and vines, and provides a sheltered area for wildlife with an abundant food and
water supply. Although no special status wildlife species exist within the Planning Area, the nearby
Cottonwood Riparian Forest provides habitat for the special status Bank swallow and the Western
yellow-billed cuckoo. About 90 percent of the Western yellow-billed cuckoo’s riparian habitat
                                                         6
throughout the west has been modified. Several other special-status wildlife species are known to
occur or have the potential to occur in such habitats, including the Cooper’s hawk, tricolored
blackbird, great blue heron, great egret, bald eagle, double-crested cormorant, among others.
FEATHER RIVER RIPARIAN HABITAT
Although the CNDDB does not list any riparian-related special status vegetation species in the Yuba
City Planning Area, the Feather River provides important fish and riparian habitat areas7. As such, the
City recently began the preparation of a strategic master plan for the 750 acre Feather River corridor,
the purpose of which is to create a vision for the River, one that would make the most of the River as
a recreational resource, while providing habitat for a variety of wildlife.

                                          Environmental Conservation
The Feather River study area can be divided into three distinct divisions. The northern portion is
typified by orchards and riparian habitat that has overtaken the City’s abandoned sewage lagoons.
The central portion extends through the downtown area to the "Mosquito Beach" boat launch area.
The southern portion includes riparian woodlands and "Shanghai Bend", which is a large sandbar and
offers a beach-like atmosphere.
While the study is in the very early stages, it is assumed that the study area will remain, for the most
part, as natural as possible so that environmental impacts are very limited. The Strategic Plan calls for
preservation and restoration of natural areas and wildlife habitat, as part of the overall plan to
develop the corridor as a public parkway. Passive recreational uses, such as trails for pedestrians and
cyclists, fishing piers, picnic areas, and open space, are likely to be least intrusive on habitats.
However, there is also the potential for commercial uses along the levee in some locations and
potential for a golf course in the northern portion.
The City is working with the CDFG and Sutter County to determine ways to protect the Feather River
bottom while possibly incorporating passive recreational uses. Not only would such area provide
much needed parkland for City residents—see Chapter 6: Parks, Schools and Community Facilities ,
for further information—but also it would help to preserve and enhance the most important natural
feature in the Planning Area.
GUIDING POLICIES
8.4-G-1 Protect special status species, in accordance with State regulatory requirements.
8.4-G-2 Protect and enhance the natural habitat features of the Feather River and new open space
           corridors within and around the urban growth area.
8.4-G-3 Preserve and enhance heritage oaks in the Planning Area.
8.4-G-4 Where appropriate, incorporate natural, wildlife habitat features into public landscapes,
           parks, and other public facilities.
8.4-G-5 Support the preservation and enhancement of fisheries in the Feather River.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
8.4-I-1    Require protection of sensitive habitat areas and special status species in new development
           site designs in the following order: 1) avoidance; 2) onsite mitigation, and 3) offsite
           mitigation. Require assessments of biological resources prior to approval of any
           development within 300 feet of any creeks, sensitive habitat areas, or areas of potential
           sensitive status species.
           These priorities are in accordance with the California Department of Fish and Game guidelines.
           When habitat preservation onsite is not feasible (i.e., preserved parcels would be too small to be
           of any value), then offsite mitigation should occur.

                                                Yuba City General Plan Update
8.4-I-2     Require preservation of oak trees and other native trees that are of a significant size, by
            requiring site designs to incorporate these trees to the maximum extent feasible.
8.4-I-3     Require, to the extent feasible, use of drought tolerant plants in landscaping for new
            development, including private and public projects.
8.4-I-4     Require measures, as part of the Feather River Parkway Plan, to protect and enhance
            riparian zones, natural areas and wildlife habitat qualities; and establish and maintain a
            protection zone along the river where development shall not occur, except as part of the
            parkway enhancement (e.g., trails and bikeways). For park improvements, require a buffer
            zone along the river in which no grading or construction activities will occur, except as
            needed for shoreline uses such as boat docks.
            According to the California Department of Fish and Game, restoration plans should include
            performance standards such as vegetation types and timing of planting, as well as contingency
            plans if re-planting is not successful. Construction materials, spoils, or fill should not be placed
            in the river or located so that they can be washed into the river.
8.4-I-5     Establish wildlife corridors in conjunction with implementation of the Feather River
            Parkway Plan to minimize wildlife-urban conflicts.
            Successful wildlife corridors along the Feather River would provide routes for wildlife movement
            and access to the water, without a physical barrier. Factors such as smell, noise, and terrain also
            influence the success of the wildlife corridor. Wildlife tends to feel most secure in somewhat dark
            corridors with little human activity.
8.4-I-6     Work with California Department of Fish and Game and other agencies to enhance and
            preserve fisheries in the Feather River.
8.5       WATER QUALITY
This section addresses surface and groundwater quality.                         Water supply and conservation are
addressed in Chapter 7: Public Utilities.
SURFACE HYDROLOGY
Sutter County is generally located between the Sacramento River in the west and the Feather River in
                                                                                  8
east and lies entirely within the Sacramento River watershed. The Feather River is the primary
hydrological feature in Yuba City and forms the eastern boundary of the Planning Area (see Figure 8-
2). The river provides for recreational activities, agricultural irrigation, and wildlife habitat; it also
provides a significant component of the Yuba City drinking water supply, as discussed in more detail
in Chapter 7: Public Utilities. The Gilsizer and Live Oak Sloughs, which were constructed for flood
control purposes, are the only other hydrological features in the Planning Area. Drainage and
flooding hazards in Yuba City are addressed in Chapter 9: Noise and Safety.

GROUNDWATER
Sutter County lies within the Sacramento Valley groundwater basin. The major sources of
groundwater in Yuba City include rainfall, infiltration from nearby rivers and streams, and the
percolation of applied irrigation water in agricultural areas. On average, rainfall in Yuba City ranges
between 17 and 21 inches annually; however, there is no estimate of what percentage of rainfall
reaches the groundwater supply. Groundwater in the Planning Area flows from north to south at a
relatively flat gradient, a situation that has not changed significantly since the mid-1940s when
                                                        9
groundwater in the area was first studied in detail . It is likely that, according to early studies, the
majority of groundwater recharge in Yuba City is the result of rainfall and infiltration from the
                      10
Feather River. Yuba City maintains one water well that could supplement the existing supply,
particularly in periods of drought, as well as several wells supplying residents who were served by the
former Hillcrest Water company. A discussion regarding drinking water supply is included in
Chapter 6: Public Facilities and Utilities.
Groundwater Quality
Groundwater quality in Sutter County ranges from poor to very good and includes contaminants in
some areas resulting from both natural conditions and human influence. Countywide mapping of
groundwater quality has been completed for several natural and manmade chemical contaminants.
The maximum contaminant levels (MCL) for potable water mapped are established by the U.S. EPA
                                                          11
and by the California Department of Health Services. Primary MCL reflects a health standard, while
secondary MCL reflects aesthetic and taste standards. The majority of tested wells in the Yuba City
Planning Area reflect a primary MCL for arsenic of between 10 and 50 micrograms per liter (µg/liter),
and two small areas reflect a primary MCL greater than 50 µg/liter. Arsenic occurs naturally in some
                                                                     12
rocks and soil. The majority of tested wells in the Planning Area also reflect a primary MCL greater
than 50 µg/liter for manganese and a secondary MCL greater than 200 µg/liter for iron. Manganese
                                  13                                                       14
                                                                  15
and iron, like arsenic, occur naturally in some rocks and soil. Finally, the majority of tested wells in
the Yuba City Planning Area reflect a primary MCL greater than 45 µg/liter for nitrate, which is
                                                                          16
applied as a fertilizer and is also produced from on-site sewage disposal.
Regulations Protecting Groundwater Quality
The protection of groundwater quality in the Planning Area and countywide is the responsibility of
the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB), which has prepared a Basin
Plan that includes regulations to ensure the highest possible groundwater quality. The CVRWQCB
also enforces the criteria for dischargeable allowances into groundwater in the County as set by the
                                       17
State Water Quality Control Board.

NONPOINT POLLUTION SOURCES
The quality of groundwater and water flowing into the Feather River is most likely to be affected by
nonpoint pollution sources in the City, simply because they are not as rigorously regulated as point
sources. Development can pose a threat to surface and groundwater quality through construction
sediment, materials used on site, and related increases in automobile use.
GUIDING POLICIES
8.5-G-1 Enhance the quality of surface water and groundwater resources and prevent their
         contamination.
8.5-G-2 Enhance the natural condition of the Feather River waterway.
8.5-G-3 Ensure that the City’s drinking water continues to meet or exceed water quality standards.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
8.5-I-1  Establish conservation programs and measures for Yuba City employers, residents, and
         service providers.
8.5-I-2  Comply with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board’s regulations and
         standards to maintain and improve the quality of both surface water and groundwater
         resources.
8.5-I-3  Continue to control stormwater pollution and protect the quality of the City’s waterways, by

8.6        AIR QUALITY
This chapter addresses air quality as it relates to Yuba City, which is located in the Sacramento Valley
Air Basin. While air quality is largely a regional issue, the protection of air quality is vital to the
overall health of the environment and to the attractiveness of the community.
CLIMATE
Atmospheric conditions such as wind speed, wind direction, and air temperature gradients interact
with the physical features of the landscape to determine the movement and dispersal of air pollutants.
In general, the climate of central California is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist
winters. Summer temperatures average approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and 50
degrees Fahrenheit at night. Winter daytime temperatures average in the low 50s and nighttime
temperatures are mainly in the upper 30s. Rainfall occurs generally from late October to early May,
averaging 17.2 inches a year, but varying widely from year to year.
Winds control the rate and dispersion of local pollutant emissions. During the summer, prevailing
winds are from the south. Winds from the south remain predominate during the winter, but
atmospheric conditions cause north winds to be more frequent than during the summer.
In addition to wind direction, Sutter County experiences two kinds of inversions that affect the
vertical depth of the atmosphere through which pollutants can be mixed. In summer, sinking air
forms a ‘lid’ over the region leading to photochemical smog problems by confining pollution to a
shallow layer near the ground. Inversions occur on over 90 percent of summer days; they persist
throughout the day and tend to intensify in the afternoon. The second inversion occurs mostly
during winter nights when air cools near the ground while the air higher in the atmosphere remains
warm. This can lead to localized pollution ‘hot spots’ near emission sources due to poor dispersion.
Winter inversions occur on 70 percent of winter nights and generally are dispersed by daytime
heating. Although these two inversions are present throughout much of the year, they are much less
                                            18
dominant during spring and fall. In the fall both types occur together to produce the heaviest
pollution potential.

REGULATORY CONTEXT
Criteria Air Pollutants
The State of California and the Federal government have established ambient air quality standards for
a number of pollutants, which are referred to as Criteria Pollutants. These standards are categorized
as primary standards, designed to safeguard public health, or as secondary standards, intended to
protect crops and to mitigate such effects as visibility reduction, soiling, nuisance and other forms of
damage. Air quality is also regulated through emissions limits for individual sources of criteria air
pollutants. The State standards are generally more stringent than the federal standards, particularly
for ozone and PM-10 (particulate matter, less than 10 microns in diameter).
The Federal Clean Air Act requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to identify
National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Currently, U.S. EPA has established national standards for
the following pollutants, which together form the criteria air pollutants:
•     Ozone (O3);
•     Carbon monoxide (CO);
•     Nitrogen dioxide (NO2);
•     Sulfur dioxide (SO2);
•     Suspended particulate matter (PM-10 and PM-2.5); and
•     Lead (Pb).
Pursuant to the California Clean Air Act of 1988, California has adopted stricter ambient air quality
standards for the criteria air pollutants and has adopted ambient air quality standards for some
pollutants for which there are no corresponding national standards.
Under the California Clean Air Act and amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act, U.S. EPA and the
State Air Resources Board are required to classify Air Basins, or portions thereof, as either
“attainment” or “nonattainment” for each criteria air pollutant, based on whether or not the national
and state standards have been met. Yuba City is located in the Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin
(NSVAB). The NSVAB consists of the northern half of the Central Valley. Air Quality monitoring has
been conducted in the NSVAB for the last fifteen years and the monitoring results have shown that
the principal pollutants of the NSVAB, including Yuba City, are ozone and particulate matter. The
Feather River Air Quality Management District (FRAQMD) was established in 1991 to administer
local, state, and federal air quality management programs for Yuba and Sutter Counties.
Toxic Air Contaminants
Regulation of toxic air contaminants is achieved through federal and state controls on individual
            19
sources. Toxic air contaminants are air pollutants with short-term (acute) and/or long-term
(chronic or carcinogenic) adverse human health effects, for which no ambient air quality standards
have been established. The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments offer a comprehensive plan for
19
   Federal environmental laws refer to “hazardous air pollutants” and California environmental laws refer to “toxic air contaminants.”
The two terms generally encompass the same constituent toxic compounds.
                                                                   8-18

                                         Environmental Conservation
achieving significant reductions in both mobile and stationary source emissions of certain designated
toxic air contaminants.
The Feather River Air Quality Management District (FRAQMD) administers the state-mandated Air
Toxics “Hot Spots” Program for Yuba and Sutter Counties. This program is intended to reduce
public exposure to toxic air contaminants from stationary sources. FRAQMD is currently working to
control toxic air contaminant impacts from local “hot spots” and to reduce toxic air contaminant
background concentrations. The control strategy involves reviewing new stationary sources to ensure
compliance with required emission controls and limits, maintaining an inventory of existing
stationary sources of toxic air contaminants, and developing new rules and regulations to reduce
toxic air contaminant emissions. The FRAQMD works closely with sources to reduce their toxic
emission inventory.
Regulation of toxic air contaminants from mobile sources has traditionally been implemented
through emissions standards for on-road motor vehicles and through specifications for gasoline and
diesel fuel sold in California, rather than through land use decisions, air quality permits or regulations
addressing how motor vehicles are used by the general public. In 1998, Diesel exhaust particulate
matter from internal combustion engines was designated a toxic air contaminant (TAC) for cancer.
Now land use decisions must include mitigation efforts for heavy duty diesel equipment operated
during construction phases.
Regulatory Agencies
The U.S. EPA sets national ambient air quality standards and oversees implementation of Federal
requirements by State air quality agencies. California’s air quality management agency, the California
Air Resources Board (CARB), regulates most types of mobile emissions sources and oversees the
activities of regional/County air districts. CARB is responsible for establishing emissions standards for
on-road motor vehicles sold in California. Emissions standards for on-road motor vehicles were
developed primarily as a means to reduce emissions of carbon monoxide and ozone precursors (such
as reactive organic gases, ROG), but by reducing such emissions, such standards also serve to reduce
toxic air contaminants.
The FRAQMD is the agency empowered to regulate stationary sources of air pollutant emissions in
Yuba and Sutter Counties. FRAQMD is responsible for implementing emissions standards and other
requirements of federal and state laws; it controls stationary source emissions by issuing air quality
permits that require the implementation of Best Available Control Technology (BACT) if specified
trigger levels are exceeded. Also, for stationary sources, FRAQMD requires Toxics-BACT (T-BACT) if
screening thresholds for toxic air contaminants are exceeded.
The FRAQMD has combined with districts from Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, Butte, and Colusa counties
to form the Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin (NSVAB) and jointly prepare and adopt a uniform
air quality attainment plan. The most recent version of this plan was published in 2000.
The Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) also has a role in regulating air quality
through review of federally-funded transportation plans, programs and individual transportation
projects for air quality effects. SACOG regulates Sacramento-area transportation projects through its
approval, funding and environmental clearance processes.
                                                    8-19

                                                  Yuba City General Plan Update
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that City planners review applicable
projects to determine their environmental impact. The Feather River Air Quality Management
District (FRAQMD) has established thresholds of significance for which the estimated emissions of
any project can be compared to determine the potential impacts on air quality impact. With impacts
identified, it is then possible to incorporate feasible mitigation measures. The FRAQMD is a local
resource for air quality mitigation measures in the Planning Area.
2002 CONDITIONS AND TRENDS
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) operates a regional network of air pollution monitoring
stations that provide information on ambient concentrations of criteria air pollutants and toxic air
contaminants. In Sutter County, CARB measures certain air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide
(CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter less than ten microns in diameter
                                                                                                                                   20
(PM-10). Data is collected at three air quality stations, one of which is located in Yuba City. Data
from the monitoring stations indicate that the air quality in Yuba City is fair, meeting federal
standards, although both ozone and suspended solids continue to exceed State ozone and particulate
standards.
Criteria Air Pollutants
          21
Ozone
Ozone is not emitted directly into the atmosphere, but is a secondary air pollutant produced in the
atmosphere through a complex series of photochemical reactions involving reactive organic gases
(ROG) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). ROG and NOx are known as precursor compounds for ozone.
Significant ozone production generally requires ozone precursor presence for approximately three
hours in a stable atmosphere with strong sunlight. Ozone is a regional air pollutant because its
precursors are transported and diffused by wind concurrently with ozone production. On-road
motor vehicles are a major source of ozone precursors in the NSVAB.
Once formed, ozone acts as a strong irritant that attacks the body’s respiratory system. Symptoms
                                                                                                                          22
include shortness of breath, chest pain when inhaling deeply, wheezing and coughing. Additionally,
ozone causes substantial damage to leaf tissues of crops and natural vegetation and damages many
                                                                        23
materials by acting as a chemical oxidizing agent. As shown in Table 8-2, the State ambient air
quality standard for ozone was violated on an average 4.67 days per year in the Planning Area
between 1995 and 2000. The northern portion of Sutter County, where Yuba City is located, is
designated a moderate nonattainment area for the 1-hour ozone standard by CARB as well as a
transitional nonattainment for the federal 1-hour ozone standard. The northern portion of Sutter
County is in attainment of the federal 8-hour ozone standard. However, the southern portion of the
county has higher levels of ozone.

While ozone concentrations in the NSVAB are expected to decline given existing emission controls
strategies and the additional measures, the State standard for ozone is still not expected to be achieved
at all times in all places in the NSVAB in the immediate future. Much of the ozone within the
northern portion of Sutter County originates in the broader Sacramento area. A 1993 study by the Air
Resources Board revealed that “overwhelming” transport of pollutants from the broader Sacramento
                                                                         24
area into the northern Sacramento Valley occurs. Each air district within the area must include
sufficient measure in its air quality plan to demonstrate expeditious attainment of the state standard
in the northern Sacramento Valley, including Yuba City.
Carbon Monoxide
Carbon monoxide is an odorless, invisible gas usually formed as the result of incomplete combustion
of organic substances. Ambient concentrations normally correspond closely to the spatial and
temporal distributions of vehicular traffic, but are also influenced by wind speed and atmospheric
mixing. Under inversion conditions, concentrations may be distributed more uniformly over an area
out to some distance from vehicular sources. Carbon monoxide’s adverse health effects are related to
its affinity for hemoglobin in the blood. High concentrations of carbon monoxide can impair the
ability of the human body to absorb oxygen into the bloodstream, thereby aggravating cardiovascular
disease and causing fatigue, headaches, and dizziness.
Since the introduction of oxygenated fuels in 1992, background carbon monoxide concentrations no
longer exceed state standards even during stagnant wintertime conditions. However, concentrations
in the vicinity of congested intersections and highway segments would be expected to be higher than
the monitoring data in Table8-3. Future carbon monoxide concentrations are expected to continue
declining due to the natural replacement of older, more heavily polluting automobiles with newer,
cleaner-running models.
24
   ARB has three classifications for the transport of pollutants from one area to another. They are inconsequential, significant, and
overwhelming. Overwhelming transport occurs when ozone violations are caused entirely by the transport of pollutants from upwind
sources.

Suspended Particulate Matter
Suspended particulate matter (PM-10) consists of particulates 10 microns or less in diameter. These
small particles can remain suspended in the air, are transported by winds, and can be inhaled and
cause adverse health effects. Particulates in the atmosphere result from many kinds of dust- and
fume-producing industrial and agricultural operations, construction, fugitive sources (such as
roadway dust), and atmospheric photochemical reactions involving ROG and NOx. Extended
                                                                                        25
exposure to PM-10 can increase the risk of chronic respiratory disease. Total PM-10 emissions are
expected to increase in the future due to an overall increase in vehicle miles traveled within the
region. Sutter County, as with most of the state of California, is in non-attainment for the state
mandated PM-10 standards. Table 8-4 includes the five-year monitoring for PM-10 in Yuba City.
Toxic Air Contaminants
The ambient background of toxic air contaminants is the combined result of many diverse human
activities, including emissions from gasoline stations, automobiles, dry cleaners, industrial
operations, hospital sterilizers, and painting operations. Table 8-5 shows the results of monitoring
since 1990 for toxic air contaminants in Sacramento Valley Air Basin.

                                         Environmental Conservation
In 1987, the California State legislature enacted through Assembly Bill 2588 the Air Toxics Hot Spots
Information and Assessment Act which requires companies in California to provide information to
the public about emissions of toxic air contaminants (TACs) and their possible impact on public
health. FRAQMD implements AB2588 through the local Air Toxics “Hot Spots” Program. Toxic air
contaminants are pollutants that occur at relatively low concentrations and are associated with
carcinogenic and other adverse health effects, but for which no ambient air quality standards have
been established. Impact is measured as “maximum individual cancer risk” which is the likelihood
that a person exposed to concentrations of TACs over a lifetime will develop cancer. There were no
facilities in the Yuba City urban growth area identified as a significant risk.
The Air Resources Board maintains an inventory of toxic air contaminants. Total emissions in the
year 2000 from stationary sources of TACs in Yuba City included: 11,160 lbs. of ammonia; 1,640 lbs.
of propylene; 1,530 lbs. of sulfuric acid; 144.2 tons of CO; 50 lbs. of copper; 910 lbs. of formaldehyde;
100 lbs. of HCl; 100 lbs. of benzene; 1,090 lbs. of ethylene glycol butyl ether (EGBE); 290.9 tons of
NOX; 2.3 tons of ROG; 0.3 tons of SOX; and 17.9 tons of TOG.
FRAQMD regulates toxic air contaminants from stationary sources through their permit process.
Mobile sources of toxic air contaminants are regulated indirectly through vehicle emissions standards
(or ROG) and through fuel specifications. Cities play a role in reducing public exposure to TAC’s by
enforcing zoning ordinances and ensuring proper buffer zones between stationary sources that emit
toxic contaminants and sensitive receptors located down wind.
Sensitive Receptors
Some people are more sensitive than others to air pollutants. Heightened sensitivity may be caused by
health problems, proximity to the emissions source, and duration of exposure to air pollutants.
Sensitive receptors are facilities that house or attract children, the elderly, people with illnesses or
others who are especially sensitive to the effects of air pollution. Hospitals, schools, convalescent
facilities, and residential areas are examples of sensitive receptors. Residential areas are considered
sensitive to poor air quality because people in residential areas are often at home for extended
periods. Sensitive receptors and emissions generators could be considered incompatible land uses,
and should not be located in close proximity to one another.
In addition to the policies listed in this section, transportation policies in Chapter 5, land use policies
in Chapter 3, and community design policies in Chapters 4 promote alternative modes of
transportation and land use designs that are intended to reduce overall vehicle emissions.

        vehicle use and resulting contaminant emissions.
         Reducing the reliance on automobiles will minimize air pollution in the Planning Area.
8.6-I-5 Evaluate new commercial and industrial development for potential handling, storage, and
        transport of hazardous materials to minimize public exposure to toxic air contaminants.
         The City can establish proper buffer zones between stationary sources of TACs and sensitive
         receptors such as residential areas.
8.6-I-6 Require applicants whose development would result in construction-related fugitive dust
        emissions to control such emissions as follows:
         •   During clearing, grading, earth-moving, or excavation operations, fugitive dust
             emissions shall be controlled by regular watering, paving of construction roads, or other
             dust-preventive measures.
         •   All material excavated or graded shall be sufficiently watered to prevent excessive
             amounts of dust. Watering, with complete coverage, shall occur at least twice daily,
             preferably in the late morning and after work is done for the day.
         •    All clearing, grading, earth-moving, or excavation activities shall cease when winds
             exceed 20 mph averaged over 1 hour.
         •   All material transported off-site shall be either sufficiently watered or securely covered
             to prevent excessive amounts of dust.

         Particulate emissions are often the result of construction activities. These provisions should also
         be implemented outside and adjacent to the urban growth area through a Memorandum of
         Understanding with the County.
8.6-I-7 Require applicants whose development would result in construction-related exhaust
        emissions to minimize such emissions by maintaining equipment engines in good condition
        and in proper tune according to manufacturer's specifications and during smog season
        (May through October) by not allowing construction equipment to be left idling for long
        periods.
8.6-I-8 Require applicants whose development would result in potential carbon monoxide (CO)
        "hot spot" impacts to consult with the City to ensure that schools, hospitals, or day care
        facilities are not located near such "hot spots".
8.6-I-9 Require all new wood-burning stoves and fireplaces to comply with EPA standards and
        prepare homeowner information handouts outlining low-emission alternatives to wood-
        burning fireplaces.
         Fireplaces are a growing source of localized air pollution. Wood smoke released from fireplaces
         and wood stoves contains carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds, and
         inhalable particulate matter (PM10). Wood burning should be encouraged only in stoves and
         fireplaces designed to minimize air pollutants. Pollution can be reduced by installing gas
         fireplaces or EPA certified wood heaters, and by operating existing fireplaces and wood stoves
         more efficiently. Pacific Gas & Electric and the Hearth Products Association have offered
         incentives in the past in the form of cash rebates to encourage replacement of old wood-burning
         appliances with more efficient fireplaces and stoves. These incentives are determined annually
         and are not necessarily offered each year.

                                    Noise and Safety
Both Noise and Safety are required elements of the General Plan. The Noise element has a direct
correlation with the land use, circulation, and housing elements. It guides land use and
transportation facilities, since they are common sources of excessive noise levels.
The Safety element provides information “for the protection of the community from unreasonable
risks associated with the effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground
failure, and dam failure; slope instability leading to landslides, subsidence, and other geological
hazards; flooding; hazardous material accidents; and wildland and urban fire” (Government Code
§65302 {g}). Yuba City’s natural setting and physical development patterns create potential risks to
health and safety. The Planning Area is located in an area susceptible to flooding and the effects of
earthquakes. A goal of the City is to provide exceptional public safety; over half of the City budget is
devoted to safety programs to maintain and enhance the quality of life. Other topics addressed in this
chapter include geology and soils, emergency response, and hazardous waste management.
9.1      NOISE
The purpose of the Noise element is to set forth policies that regulate the ambient noise environment
and protect residents from exposure to excessive noise.
NOISE CHARACTERISTICS AND MEASUREMENT
Noises vary widely in their scope, source, and volume, ranging from individual occurrences such as
leaf blowers, to the intermittent disturbances of overhead aircraft, to the fairly constant noise
generated by traffic on freeways. Noise is primarily a concern with regard to noise–sensitive uses such
as residences, schools, churches, and hospitals.
Noise Measurement
Noise is commonly defined as undesirable or unwanted sound. Three aspects of community noise are
used in assessing the noise environment:
•    Level (e.g., magnitude or loudness) of sound. Sound levels are measured and expressed in
     decibels (dB) with 10 dB roughly equal to the threshold of hearing. Figure 9-1 shows the decibel
     levels associated with different common sounds.
•    Frequency composition or spectrum of the sound. Frequency is a measure of the pressure
     fluctuations per second, measured in units of hertz (Hz). The characterization of sound level
     magnitude with respect to frequency is the sound spectrum, often described in octave bands,
     which divide the audible human frequency range (e.g., from 20 to 20,000 Hz) into ten segments.
•    Variation in sound level with time, measured as noise exposure. Most community noise is
     produced by many distant noise sources that change gradually throughout the day and produce a
     relatively steady background noise having no identifiable source. Identifiable events of brief
     duration, such as aircraft flyovers, cause the community noise level to vary from instant to
                                                   9-1

                                      Yuba City General Plan Update
    instant. A single number called the equivalent sound level or Leq describes the average noise
    exposure level over a period of time.
Figure 9-1: Typical Sound Levels
Transient noise events may be described by their maximum A-weighted noise level (dBA) or by their
sound exposure level (SEL). SEL values may be summed on an energy basis to compute Leq values
over any period of time. Hourly Leq values are called Hourly Noise Levels.
Reporting Noise Levels
Measuring and reporting noise levels involves factoring in variations in sensitivity to noise during the
daytime versus nighttime hours. Noise descriptors used for analysis need to account for human
sensitivity to nighttime noise when background noise levels are generally lower than in the daytime
and outside noise intrusions are more noticeable. Common descriptors include the Community
Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and the Day-Night Average Level (DNL, symbol (Ldn). Both reflect
                                                   9-2
                                             Noise and Safety
noise exposure over an average day with weighting to reflect the increased sensitivity to noise during
the evening and night. The two descriptors are roughly equivalent. The CNEL descriptor is used in
relation to major continuous noise sources, such as aircraft or traffic, and is the reference level for the
General Plan Noise Element under State planning law.
Knowledge of the following relationships is helpful in understanding how changes in noise and noise
exposure are perceived:
•    Except under special conditions, a change in sound level of 1 dB cannot be perceived;
•    A 3 dB change is considered a just-noticeable difference;
•    A 5 dB change is required before any noticeable change in community response would be
     expected. A 5 dB increase is often considered a significant impact; and
•    A 10 dB increase is subjectively heard as an approximate doubling in loudness and almost always
     causes an adverse community response.
NOISE GENERATION IN YUBA CITY
The major noise sources in Yuba City are related to vehicular traffic on State Route 20 and Highway
99. Other noise sources include overflights from the Sutter County Airport, railroad activities, and
agricultural operations around the edges of the city. Noise produced by industrial facilities has a
negligible effect on the City’s noise environment. Although the City does not have a Noise
Ordinance, noise issues are handled by the City’s Nuisance Ordinance, which regulates the time of
day that certain noise-generating activities may take place.
Traffic Noise
Traffic noise depends primarily on the speed of traffic and the percentage of truck traffic. Conversely,
traffic volume does not have a major influence on traffic noise levels. The primary source of noise
from automobiles is high frequency tire noise, which increases with speed. In addition, trucks and
older automobiles produce engine and exhaust noise, and trucks also generate wind noise. While tire
noise from autos is generally located at ground level, truck noise sources can be located as high as ten
to fifteen feet above the roadbed due to tall exhaust stacks and higher engines; sound walls are not
effective for mitigating such noise unless they are very tall.
According to common practice, maximum noise levels of 60 dB are considered “normally acceptable”
for unshielded residential development. Noise levels from 60 to 70 dB fall within the “conditionally
unacceptable” range, and those in the 70 to 75 dB range are considered “normally unacceptable.”
Noise exposure contours for Yuba City were modeled by applying the Federal Highway
Administration’s noise modeling procedure. These noise contours are conservative, meaning that the
contours are modeled with minimal noise attenuation by natural barriers, buildings, etc. The noise
level measured at a specific location may be lower than what is shown on the noise contour map.
Traffic Noise Levels
Existing noise conditions in Yuba City were measured at six locations for a 24-hour period between
September 10 and September 11, 2001. These six locations were chosen based upon their proximity to
                                                    9-3

Figure 9-2 illustrates the results of the 2001 noise monitoring in Yuba City. Some of Yuba City’s
existing residential neighborhoods are exposed to moderate noise levels from the City’s main traffic
corridors, particularly along State Route 20 and Highway 99. As shown in Table 9-1, the highest
noise levels were measured by Meter 2 (Colusa Avenue just west of Highway 99) and by Meter 5
(Colusa Avenue between Market and Shasta), both reflecting noise levels above the “normally
unacceptable” range of 70 to 75 dB.

PROJECTED CONDITIONS UNDER GENERAL PLAN BUILDOUT
Future development within the City’s Planning Area will result in new roads and increased traffic
volumes, thus increasing noise levels in some areas. Future noise contours are illustrated in Figure 9-
3. Increases in traffic levels can be counteracted by the implementation of alternate forms of
transportation and land use design that factor in noise concerns. Locating noise-sensitive uses away
from high-noise areas (e.g. major transportation routes) and buffering noise levels through design
and landscaping features will help minimize future noise-related land use conflicts. Policies in this
chapter establish review criteria for certain land uses to ensure that future noise levels will not exceed
acceptable levels near noise-sensitive land uses.

  Traffic volumes provided by Fehr & Peers Associates. Where traffic volumes on segments of State Route 20 and Highway 99 were not
provided by Fehr & Peers Associates, traffic volumes were determined using Caltrans 2000 traffic data. Truck traffic was assumed to
comprise 5 percent of traffic volumes. Traffic speeds were assumed to be 5 mph above the posted limit on all roads, except for State
Route 20 and Highway 99 where traffic speeds were assumed to be at the posted limit.

The policies in this chapter supplement land use, urban design, and transportation policies focused
on creating compatible neighborhoods and minimizing overall vehicle trips.
GUIDING POLICIES
9.1-G-1 Strive to achieve an acceptable noise environment for the present and future residents of
         Yuba City.
9.1-G-2 Incorporate noise considerations into land use planning decisions, and guide the location
         and design of transportation facilities to minimize the effects of noise on adjacent land uses.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
9.1-I-1   Use the "normally acceptable" noise levels for new land uses as established in Figure 9-4
         (Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments) as review criteria.
9.1-I-2   Require a noise study and mitigation for all projects that have noise exposure greater than
         “normally acceptable” levels. Noise mitigation measures include, but are not limited to, the
         following actions:
          •   Screen and control noise sources, such as parking and loading facilities, outdoor
              activities and mechanical equipment,
          •   Increase setbacks for noise sources from adjacent dwellings,
          •   Retain fences, walls, and landscaping that serve as noise buffers,
          •   Use soundproofing materials and double-glazed windows, and
          •   Control hours of operation, including deliveries and trash pickup, to minimize noise
              impacts.
          Proposed development can introduce potential noise sources, even when it is compatible with
          existing adjacent uses. An example is the handling of large trash bins for multi-family housing.
          If noise exposure is greater than levels considered normally acceptable, some form of noise
          mitigation will have to be incorporated, to the extent practicable, unless the impacts are found
          to be less than significant. The mitigation can be conventional insulation features or techniques
          that require more complex building or equipment design and site layout. Site design and/or
          screening techniques can help mitigate the resulting noise. Open space, building orientation and
          design, and landscaping can be used to buffer or mask sound.
9.1-I-3   In making a determination of impact under the California Environmental Quality Act
         (CEQA), consider an increase of four or more DBA to be "significant" if the resulting noise
         level would exceed that described as normally acceptable for the affected land use in Figure
         9-4.
9.1-I-4   Protect especially sensitive uses, including schools, hospitals, and senior care facilities, from
         excessive noise, by enforcing “normally acceptable” noise level standards for these uses.

              activities, such as construction.
               The City’s Nuisance Ordinance restricts the hours of operation for a variety of noise sources,
               and State laws limit the noise levels of motor vehicles and some activities at industrial plants.
9.2         SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
GEOLOGY AND SOILS
Sutter County is part of the Great Valley geomorphic province, otherwise known as the Central Valley
                  2
of California. The Central Valley stretches 500 miles in a generally northwest to southeast direction
and averages about 40 miles in width between the Coast Ranges in the west and the Sierra Nevada in
the east. This area is characterized by flat-lying sedimentary rocks overlain by alluvial soils, which can
                                                              3
be up to 200 feet deep near the Sacramento River.
Geologic and soils hazards discussed here include erosion, subsidence, and expansive soils.
Erosion
The process of erosion involves the breaking down of soils and rocks and the transporting of broken
fragments to another location. Water is the dominant cause of erosion and is also the most likely
means of transporting broken down materials. The rate of erosion depends upon the texture of rock
                                                                                                             4
or soil, the composition, soil permeability, slope, vegetative cover, and precipitation amounts. The
potential erodability of soil in Yuba City is considered slight, since land within the Planning Area is
generally flat (slopes are less than 9 percent), annual precipitation levels are low (between 15 and 21
inches), and wind velocities are low.5 Therefore, erosion is not considered a critical issue in Yuba
City.

Subsidence
Subsidence is the vertical displacement downward of the ground surface, the direct result of
                                            6
groundwater and oil and gas withdrawal. Subsidence is common in California, although mostly in
areas where the subsurface consists of compressible silt and clay, and mostly due to the withdrawal of
groundwater. Although to date subsidence caused by groundwater withdrawal in Sutter County is
                                                                                                   7
very small, groundwater pumping in the Sacramento Valley has increased in recent years. The
damaging effects of subsidence can include gradient changes in transportation, utility, and flood
control facilities. Subsidence hazard overall is low in Yuba City since the Sacramento and Feather
Rivers provide significant groundwater recharge and since most residents do not rely on groundwater
for drinking water supply. In addition, there are no natural gas or oil withdrawals in the Planning
Area.
Expansive Soils
Expansive soils have the potential to significantly shrink or swell with changes in moisture content.
Type and amount of the silt and clay content in the soil will determine the amount of shrink or swell
                                                         8
associated with the various levels of water content. Soils comprised of sand and gravel are not
expansive soils. Expansive soils are most likely to be found in basins and basin rims, and any structure
located on expansive soils can be significantly damaged should the soil suddenly shrink or swell. In
Yuba City, the extreme southwestern corner of the Planning Area is the only area with expansive soils.
  Fault Zones
The California Mining and Geology Board defines active faults as those for which there is evidence of
                                                       9
surface displacement within the last 11,000 years. Faults may also be considered active based on
surface displacements within the last 200 years. However, a fault with no evidence of surface
displacement does not mean that the fault is inactive. Potentially active faults are those for which
there is evidence of surface displacement within the last 1.6 million years, and not within the last
                     10
11,000 years. Such faults are considered potentially active since this period of time is short in
geologic terms. Finally, there may be seismic risk associated with faults that have not yet been
identified. Small and moderately large earthquakes may result from such faults and are considered
background seismicity or floating earthquakes, activity in which the expected sources and locations
                      11
are unknown.
No active earthquake faults are known to exist in Sutter County, although active faults in the region
could produce ground motion in Yuba City. Earthquakes of M5.0 or greater have occurred on fault
systems in the region, including the San Andreas. Approximately 15 miles west of Sutter County, the
                                                                                                     12
Central Valley Blind-Thrust Fault is known to have caused an estimated M6.5 earthquake in 1892. In

addition, two earthquakes of M4.0 and M4.9 occurred between 1900 and 1974 with epicenters near
Williams. The Foothills Suture Zone along the western slope of the Sierra Nevada is also considered
active, with a M5.7 earthquake occurring in 1975 in the northern portion of the Zone in Butte

Potentially active faults do exist in Sutter County in the area of the Sutter Buttes. These faults are
                                                                                                       14
small and have exhibited activity in the last 1.6 million years, but not in recent history (200 years).
Effects Of Earthquakes
Potential hazards related to major earthquakes include ground shaking, surface rupture along the
fault zone, and related secondary ground failures. Typical seismically-induced ground failures include
liquefaction, lateral spreading, ground lurching, seiches, and landslides. Liquefaction is the temporary
loss of cohesion in saturated, granular soils. Lateral spreading is the horizontal movement of loose,
unconsolidated sedimentary deposits and imported fill material. Lurching is the horizontal
movement of soil, sediments or fill found on steep slopes and embankments. A seiche is the periodic
oscillation of a body of water resulting from seismic shaking. All of these secondary ground failures
could cause major structural damage to existing buildings, including tilting or settlement of
foundations, twisting and breaking of structural building components, debris shedding, and
potentially even collapse of buildings. In the case of seiches, damage to levees and dams could be
significant. However, since the potential for ground shaking in Sutter County is low to moderate, it is
unlikely that subsequent ground failure would occur in Yuba City. Furthermore, landslides are
unlikely due to the relatively flat topography within the Planning Area.
Response of Structures To Earthquakes
Existing structures in the Planning Area could be affected by the types of earthquake-induced effects
listed above, but to varying degrees based on length, intensity, and distance of the earthquake from a
given building. New structures are required to adhere to current California Uniform Building Code
(CUBC) standards, providing adequate design, construction and maintenance of structures to
prevent exposure of people and structures to major geologic hazards. In particular, any critical
facilities such as hospitals, fire and police stations, and emergency communications and operations
centers must be adequately designed, constructed and maintained with the goal of remaining
functional after a large seismic event. The use of flexible utility connections, building anchors, and
adequately reinforced concrete can reduce the loss of life and damage to buildings for human
occupancy.
Ground shaking intensities are measured using the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale. This is a 12-
point scale of earthquake intensity based on local effects experienced by people, structures, and earth
materials. Effects range from those that are detectable only by seismicity recording instruments (I) to
total destruction (XII). Most people will feel Intensity IV ground motion indoors and Intensity V
outside. Intensity VI ground shaking will cause some heavy furniture to move, plaster to fall, and
minor chimney damage. Intensity VII will cause considerable damage in poorly designed or
constructed buildings (including some broken chimneys), slight to moderate damage in well-built

ordinary structures, and negligible damage in buildings of good design and construction. Intensity
VIII will cause great damage in poorly designed or constructed buildings (including fall of chimneys,
factory stacks, columns, walls, etc.), considerable damage in ordinarily substantial structures
(including some partial collapse), but slight damage in specially designed structures.
GUIDING POLICY
9.2-G-1 Minimize risks of property damage and personal injury posed by geologic and seismic
          hazards.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
9.2-I-1    Review proposed development sites at the earliest stage of the planning process to locate
          any potential geologic or seismic hazards.
           Following receipt of a development proposal, engineering staff shall review the plans to
           determine whether a geotechnical review is required. If the review is required, then the applicant
           shall be referred to geotechnical experts for further evaluation.
9.2-I-2    Prohibit structures intended for human occupancy within 50 feet of an active fault trace.
           Although no active faults are located within the Planning Area, this policy would apply if a new
           fault was discovered. It is also the City’s intent to discourage homes, offices, hospitals, public
           buildings, and other similar structures over the trace of an inactive fault and to allow uses
           within setback areas that could experience displacement without undue risk to people and
           property.
9.2-I-3    Require comprehensive geologic and engineering studies of critical structures regardless of
          location.
           Critical structures are those most needed following a disaster or those that could pose hazards of
           their own if damaged. They include utility centers and substations, water reservoirs, hospitals,
           fire stations, police and emergency communications facilities, and bridges and overpasses.
9.2-I-4    Require preparation of a soils report as part of the development review and/or building
          permit process for development proposed in the area depicted with expansive soils.
           The southwest corner of the City is underlain by expansive soils that must be taken into account
           during building design if cracking and settling of structures are to be minimized. The report
           would not be necessary when soil characteristics are known, and the City’s Building Official or
           Public Works Director determines it is not needed.
9.2-I-5    Provide information for property owners to rehabilitate existing buildings using
          construction techniques to protect against seismic hazards.
           The City-adopted Uniform Building Code specifies seismic standards for new construction, as
           well as for additions or expansions to buildings. It is in the community’s best interest to do all
           that is necessary to ensure that all structures meet current seismic standards.

                                                         Noise and Safety
9.2-I-6      Control erosion of graded areas with revegetation or other acceptable methods.
             Plant materials for revegetation should not be limited to hydro-seeding and mulching with
             annual grasses. Trees add structure to the soil and take up moisture while adding color and
             diversity.
9.2-I-7      Maintain and update, as appropriate, the City’s emergency preparedness programs, plans,
             and procedures to ensure the health and safety of the community in the event of an
             earthquake or other disaster.
             The City shall inform community and business leaders and residents regarding all aspects of
             disaster preparedness, including plans for evacuation and alternative access routes and
             provisions. The City shall also provide a coordinated emergency response in the event of any
             local or regional, natural or man-made disaster. This shall be supported by ongoing awareness
             and training programs in disaster planning and response.
9.2-I-8      Encourage the purchase of earthquake insurance.
             Earthquake insurance provides a public benefit in that financial aid is often provided swiftly,
             allowing repair and rebuilding to proceed quickly and uniformly across the City.
9.3        DRAINAGE, STORMWATER, AND FLOODING
Drainage and stormwater runoff are related issues, contributing to potential flooding, which is the
most significant risk to life and property in the Yuba City Planning Area. Because of their
relationship, all of these topics are addressed in this section.
DRAINAGE SYSTEM
The Yuba City Planning Area is located on an alluvial terrace that generally drains to the southwest.
The Sacramento River drains the entire county and the Sacramento Valley with the final outlet being
                                             15
the Delta and San Francisco Bay. Drainage facilities in Yuba City include the Gilsizer Slough, Live
Oak Canal, and various City facilities. These facilities are summarized below and illustrated in Figure
9-5.
•     Gilsizer Slough. At one time, this natural drainage channel drained Yuba City and areas to the
      south of the urban area. The Slough discharges to the State Drain, which flows north to State
      Pumping Plant No. 2, and then into the Sutter Bypass. Tributaries to the Gilsizer Slough are
      included in the Gilsizer County Drainage District, except for a small area north of Colusa
      Highway, which is pumped into the Feather River.
•     Live Oak Canal. This facility once drained runoff from areas north of Pease Road including an
      area that is now part of the Tierra Buena County Drainage District. The area north of Pease Road
      is now drained by the State East Interceptor Canal. This canal drains to the Sutter Bypass through
      the Wadsworth Canal.

•     City Facilities. Portions of north and south Yuba City are drained to holding ponds. This water is
      then pumped over the levee into the Feather River. The Garden Highway/Bogue Road area is also
      pumped into the Feather River.
The City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for 2001-2006 includes nine planned drainage
improvements, which are listed in Table 9-2.

EXISTING FLOOD MANAGEMENT FACILITIES AND PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS
Structural flood management methods provide the primary defense against flooding in Sutter
County. Flood management in the County includes a series of reservoirs, levees, and bypasses
                                                       16
completed between the 1920s and 1960s. Levees and earthen embankments are the most commonly
used methods of containing high water levels along the Sacramento and Feather Rivers. A bypass
system running from the Sutter Buttes southeast through Sutter County accommodates additional
                                                                                                    17
flows in times when the capacity of the Sacramento River levee system is exceeded. The Sacramento
River can flow directly into the Sutter Bypass by way of two free-flow weir structures. The Feather
River drains the eastern portion of the Sacramento Valley from Oroville to just south of its
                                         18
confluence with the Bear River.
The most significant risk from flooding in the Yuba City Planning Area results from the potential for
dam or levee failure. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has evaluated the levees along the
Sacramento and Feather Rivers to increase the level of flood protection.19 Improvements associated
with this evaluation are underway, as listed in Table 9-3. Approximately 20,000 parcels and upwards
of $1 billion in property would be impacted by a failure in the levee system. The levee along the
Feather River contain the 100-year flood zone, confining the zone to primarily undeveloped areas and
protecting developed areas from inundation. Figure 9-6 shows the extent of the 100-year and 500-
year floodplains in the Yuba City Planning Area.

DAM SAFETY
There are 10 dams located outside Sutter County that could cause significant flooding should failure
occur. Table 9-4 lists six dams that are located on the Feather River and Yuba Rivers. Failure of any
one of these dams could cause significant flooding in Yuba City. These dams are under the
jurisdiction of the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), Yuba County Water Agency,
Pacific Gas & Electric, and the Corps of Engineers.

            runoff.
9.3-G-2 Collect and dispose of storm water in a safe and efficient manner.
9.3-G-3 Ensure that dams and levees are properly maintained for long-term flood protection.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
9.3-I-1      Implement the drainage improvements identified in the City’s Capital Improvement
            Program.
9.3-I-2      Continue to work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to implement levee
            improvements on the Feather River. Incorporate features in the levee system to ensure
            flood protection and at the same time improve the connection between the city and the
            river.
9.3-I-3      When necessary, require new development to prepare hydrologic studies to assess storm
            runoff impacts on the local and subregional storm drainage systems and, if warranted,
            require new development to provide adequate drainage facilities and to mitigate increases in
            storm water flows and/or volume to avoid cumulative increases in downstream flows.
             Developers shall provide an assessment of a project’s potential impacts on the local and
             subregional storm drainage systems, so that the City can determine appropriate mitigation to
             ensure that system capacity and peak flow restrictions are not exceeded.
9.3-I-4      Restrict new development in areas subject to 100 year flooding, as shown in Figure 9-6.
9.3-I-5      Provide information to property owners about the availability of flood insurance.
             This policy can be implemented with counter handouts and stories in the City’s newsletter and
             pages on the City’s website.
                                                                9-18

9.4     EMERGENCY RESPONSE 
EMERGENCY PLANNING 
The California Emergencies Services Act (State Government Code Section 8550-8668) requires each
city to prepare and maintain an Emergency Plan for natural, manmade, or war-caused emergencies
that result in conditions of disaster or in extreme peril to life. In addition, the City has specific
procedures for hazardous materials emergency response (described below in Section 9.5).
The City of Yuba City in conjunction with the County of Sutter has developed a Multi-Jurisdiction
Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan (MJMHMP) in accordance with the California Disaster Mitigation Act
of 2000. The plan was approved by the City Council of the City of Yuba City on September 18,
2007, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved the plan on January 23,
2008. The plan provides guidance and insight into hazards that exist in Yuba City and suggests
possible mitigation projects. This plan should be consulted when addressing known hazards to
ensure the general health and safety of Yuba and Sutter County residents.
POLICE SERVICES 
Police Department
The Yuba City Police Department currently has a staff strength of 45 sworn peace officers and 26.5
civilian staff members, augmented by 19 part-time Reserve Peace Officers, 35 Volunteers, and 10
Police Cadets. The Yuba City Police Department offers a service ratio of 1.06 officers per 1,000
residents. The Police Officers of the Department comprise the following: 1 Chief of Police, 2
Division Commanders, 3 Lieutenants, 8 Police Sergeants, and 31 police officers. As shown in Figure
6-3, the Department is located at 1545 Poole Boulevard; off-site facilities are in use at the Yuba City
Mall, Yuba City Fire Station #3, and the Richland Housing Resource Center.
The Department has two divisions, Field Operations and Investigations. The Police Department
serves Yuba City in four “beats,” divided by Gray Avenue and the Colusa Highway. The first beat
covers the City’s northwest quarter; the second beat serves the northeast corner; the third beat serves
the southwest corner, and the fourth covers the City’s southeast corner. While the City has recently
annexed a large area with 7,500 people to what would be the fifth beat, this region is being policed
under an agreement with the Sutter County Sheriff’s Office and California Highway Patrol.
However, in Fiscal Year 2003/2004, 11 sworn officers will be added to the force and the Department
will assume responsibility for this 7,500 population. The service ratio would then become 1.12 to
1000 residents. The current nationally-accepted standard service ratio is 1.25 officers per 1,000
residents, and the California standard ranges from 1.4-1.7 per 1000 residents.

Response Standard
The Police Department’s achieved performance standard for emergency response times is three
minutes for all priority one calls. There is no official standard for non-emergency responses, though
20 minutes is the accepted norm.
FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY SERVICES
The Yuba City Fire Department (YCFD) provides fire
protection and suppression and life safety services for
the City. The Department responds to structural and
wildland fires, emergency medical service, and
hazardous/toxic material spills in the Planning Area.
On September 10, 2001, the Yuba City and Walton
Fire Departments officially merged, expanding the
Fire Department’s service area from a three-station
department protecting 44,000 residents spread over
nine square miles to a five station department
protecting 60,000 residents spread over about 30
square miles. The Department’s five stations are            The Yuba City Fire Department provides fire and life safety
located throughout its jurisdictional area: four in         services in the City and surrounding areas.
Yuba City proper and one in the unincorporated
community of Tierra Buena.
Response Standard
The internal response time standard has been that the Department provide service within six minutes
of the 911 call being received, 90 percent of the time. The City expects to be able to maintain this
standard. The YCFD recently completed a Standards of Response Coverage Study that resulted in
recommended performance objectives and specific response level standards for common risks
experienced in the community. These objectives and standards are incorporated into the General
Plan (see Policy 9.4-I-1).
The YCFD defines response time as follows:
        Response time is actually calculated from the time that the Public Safety Dispatcher picks up the
        telephone until the first unit arrives at the scene of the emergency. This time is known as “total
        reflex time.” Total reflex time includes three components: call processing, turnout time, and
        travel time. Call processing describes the process whereby the Dispatcher receives the call and
        gathers information from the call maker and notifies the fire department. Turnout time is
        described as the period of time when the emergency responders are notified of the emergency and
        initiate their response to the emergency. Travel time is described as the period of time when the
        emergency vehicle carrying the emergency responders is actually responding to the emergency until
        it arrives at the emergency scene. The response standards reflect total reflex time.

Fire Station Facilities
The Yuba City Fire Department currently staffs five engine companies in its five fire stations (see
Table 9-5). Stations 1, 2, 3, and 4 are located within Yuba City's City Limits; Station 7 in Tierra Buena
also provides initial response service in the Yuba City Planning Area. Stations 1 and 4 are staffed
with three full-time firefighters and Stations 2, 3, and 7 are staffed with two full time firefighters 24
hours a day.

9.5        HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Some topics regarding public safety can be dealt with only at a regional level, or fall within the
responsibility of public agencies other than Yuba City. The use and transportation of hazardous
substances is one example for which public safety depends in large part on the actions taken by the
State and Federal governments, as well as the County.
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT
The Sutter County Hazardous Waste Management Plan was adopted in 1990, as required by State
law. The plan establishes a waste management hierarchy, which focuses on waste reduction and
minimization. The Plan includes a comprehensive approach to management of hazardous wastes in
the County, including siting criteria for new waste management facilities, educational and
enforcement efforts to minimize and control the hazardous waste stream, and policies to maintain a
                                                                 27
unified data base on businesses that generate waste. The Sutter County Community Services
Department is the local agency responsible for enforcing a variety of hazardous material and waste,
requirements.
The majority of the hazardous waste generated in the county (95 percent) is from small quantity
generators (SQGs), who do not manifest shipments of hazardous waste, and from individual
households. The predominant hazardous waste stream produced by both manifested generators and
estimated for all small quantity generators in Sutter County is waste oil. As a result, Sutter County’s
generator programs, as recommended in the Sutter County Hazardous Waste Management Plan,
focus on encouraging recycling of waste oil.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MANAGEMENT IN YUBA CITY
Although Yuba City does have businesses that use hazardous materials, hazardous waste is not
generated in large amounts and a waste disposal facility is not likely to be sited in the City. However, a
concern exists due to the transportation of hazardous materials through or near the City. The
California Highway Patrol and California Department of Transportation have primary responsibility
in regulating the transportation of hazardous waste and materials. Accidents involving hazardous
materials are possible due to the transport of such materials via highways and rail.
To prepare for events that could endanger the health and safety of its citizens, Yuba City has taken
several steps to provide plans for immediate responses to disasters such as hazardous materials spills.
Currently, the Yuba City Fire Department is part of the Region III Hazardous Materials Response
Team. There are 2 Level 1 Hazardous Materials Teams in the Region. One of the Hazardous Materials
Teams is located in Oroville, and the other is located in Marysville. Yuba City currently has seven
Hazardous Materials Specialists who are a part of the Marysville team.
In the event of a hazardous materials spill within the City, the Police and Fire Departments are
simultaneously sent to the scene to respond and assess the situation. The fire department keeps two
firefighters with special hazardous materials training on each shift. If a spill occurs on the freeway, the
California Highway Patrol will call upon the City’s resources in identifying, isolating, and if necessary,
evacuating the area. In all cases, the Sutter County Environmental Health Department shall be
contacted and in some cases, will be consulted on containment and mitigation.
In Yuba City, waste oil and household hazardous wastes are collected at the Yuba-Sutter Household
Hazardous Waste Facility at 134 Burns Drive. This facility is jointly operated by Yuba and Sutter
Counties.
Through Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) grants, the City Hazardous Materials
Specialists have conducted pre-plan visits to numerous sites within the city that handle hazardous
materials. Information regarding the type of chemicals used at each site is computerized for quick
access in emergency response planning, should an accident occur at one of the locations. The City
intends to eventually pre-plan all 40 sites in the city, as well as the major roadway and rail corridors
used for hazardous materials transport.
HAZARDOUS WASTE STORAGE AND LEAKAGE SITES
The State of California’s Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) in Yuba City maintains a
list of sites that represent hazardous waste facilities subject to corrective action, lands designated as
hazardous waste properties or border zone properties, and public drinking water wells which contain
detectable levels of organic contaminants and which are subject to water analysis. The DTSC also
includes data gathered by the State Water Resources Control Board, which reports a list of all Leaking
Underground Storage Tank (UST) sites and all solid waste disposal facilities from which there is a
migration of hazardous waste. The most recent list was published in April 1998 and included 28 sites
                                                                                             29
in Yuba City with leaking USTs, most of which were gas stations. There are two cleanup and
abatement orders listed for the discharge of hazardous wastes.

GUIDING POLICY
9.5-G-1 Minimize the risk of property damage and personal injury resulting from the production,
        use, storage, disposal, or transportation of hazardous materials.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
9.5-I-1  Promote the reduction, recycling, and safe disposal of household hazardous wastes through
        public education and awareness. Expand collection programs in conjunction with new
        growth in the city.
9.5-I-2  Continue to pursue funding to conduct pre-plan visits to hazardous materials sites within
        the city, as well as major roadway and rail corridors used for hazardous materials transport.
9.5-I-3  Require the clean-up of sites contaminated with hazardous substances.
         The California Environmental Protection Agency publishes the Hazardous Waste and
         Substances Sites List, which identifies properties in the City that have the potential for
         hazardous materials contamination. Contaminated sites are threats to the quality of
         groundwater and shall be cleaned through decontamination of soils and filtration of
         groundwater. Clean-up shall be required in conjunction with new development, reconstruction,
         property transfer of ownership, and/or the continued operation after the discovery of
         contamination. Continual business operation may be permitted during clean-up or remediation
         of the contamination, as long as the clean-up proceeds in accordance with an approved clean-up
         plan.
9.5-I-4  Implement policies contained in the Sutter County Hazardous Waste Management Plan
        that encourage and assist the reduction of hazardous waste from businesses and homes.
9.5-I-5  Require businesses generating hazardous waste to pay necessary costs for local
        implementation of programs specified in the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan,
        as well as the costs associated with emergency response services for a hazardous materials
        release.
9.5-I-6  Specify routes for transporting hazardous materials, taking into account areas of projected
        new growth.
         These routes should not pass through residential areas or other sensitive areas. Specific time
         periods for transport should be established to reduce the impact and accident risk during peak
         travel periods.
