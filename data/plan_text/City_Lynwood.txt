consistency with the land use designations set
forth
            by the 1990 General Plan As an example
at        the current time many areas are designated Single                                            Family

applying the existing        General                 Plan and zoning results because
the                 General Plan land use designations and                                            or
zoning district                boundaries                typically do not
follow existing land parcel boundaries In some instances
 an       existing      parcel                    of
                                                            land is                    bisected by         either
 or one of                                these land          use district lmundades   which      makes
 it                       difficult to apply only one                             land use            for
 that         parcel    of land In these cases                              current Planning Department
 staff                members have been identifying this
 situation topotential developers and or subdividers
 have been recommending the need for Genera
 and
 Plan amendments tocorrect these situations It                                                     has
 been observed that the number of amendments tothe
 current General Plan may be greater than what
 would otherwise be necessary due to this problem

 MTA to Add More Buses to          Heavily  Used Lines to Offer More Service and Ease
 Overcrowding        Effective October 1
 MTA will add   an   additional 88  hour buses
                                    peak               on  heavily            EDITORS NOTE IC ick
                                                                              here for complete list of
 traveled bus lines    throughout   Los Angeles County    to  comply   with
                                                                              morning and afternoon
 a federal a PP eats court decision that calls for   more   bus service
                                                                              pgak hour service
                                                                              additions to MTA bus
                                                                              lines’
 The MTA Board of Directors in      early September agreed to add the
 additional buses while at the same time asking the U       S Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
 for a rehearing to further clarify how the consent decree an agreement designed to
 improve bus service is to be interpreted
 MTA over the last two years has already added 160 buses into service and the
 remaining 88 buses will bring the total of buses added to 248 the total buses ordered
 by  the court MTA bus lines to receive the additional buses         were  selected based      on   the
 volume of passengers who use the lines as well as those lines with           a  recent   history    of
 excessive crowding
 As part of the deployment of the additional 88 buses into service MTA will promote
  145 part
       time bus operators into full     time operators and will hire an additional 30
 mechanics and 18 service attendants to support the extra service
 Total costs of the additional bus service     are estimated at    4
                                                                   $11    million in FY 2002 The
 added costs will be off set by operating efficiencies overhead cost          reductions     lower
 fuel costs and spare part cost     savings
 MTA   currently  has   a record amount of bus service on the road       and will have    completed
 the process of purchasing over 2                art compressed natural gas
                                     000 new state
                                                 the
                                                 of
  CNG buses by 2004 MTA has already taken delivery of more than 1                300 new CNG
 buses and has initiated     new  types of bus service including the popular Metro Rapid
 buses that   speed   travel time
 The   deployment    of  new buses and the introduction of Metro       Rapid bus service     as well
 as other factors have contributed to the lowest rate of customer complaints received
 by MTA in   one   month
 In July 2001 customer complaints declined from a ratio of 6         37 complaints per
  000 daily boardings experienced
  100                                      in  July 1997   to a ratio  of 3
                                                                          15 complaints per
  000 daily boardings
  100                          a new  record  and  perhaps   the strongest indicator yet that
 the  Metro  System    continues  to improve
 A total of 46 bus lines will receive added service in at least       one peak   hour time    period
